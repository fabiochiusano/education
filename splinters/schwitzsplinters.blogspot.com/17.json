(Paxton et al 2012; Schwitzgebel and Jennings 2017).  It is sometimes suggested that the relatively low percentage of women faculty in philosophy explains the relatively low percentage of women who major in philosophy (which then in turn explains the relatively low percentage of women who become the next generation of philosophy faculty).\n\nI was curious whether philosophy departments with a relatively high percentage of women faculty would also have a relatively high percentage of students who are women.  Maybe departments with more women faculty are more \"woman friendly\", with a visible effect on the proportion of women who complete the Bachelor's or PhD?\n\nPaxton et al. 2012 provide some evidence of a relationship between departments' proportion of women faculty, women undergraduates, and women graduate students.  In a sample of 49 departments, they found a substantial correlation between the percent of women faculty and the percent of undergraduate philosophy majors who are women (r = .45, p = .012). However, in a similar sample of 31 departments, they did not report finding such a correlation between percent of faculty who are women and percent of PhD students who are women.\n\nThere are a few limitations in the Paxton et al. study.  First, thirty-one departments is a somewhat small number for such an analysis, yielding only limited statistical power to detect medium-sized correlations (note that with 49 departments in their undergraduate analysis, Paxton et al's p-value was greater than .01 despite a correlation of .45).  Second, the sample of departments might be unrepresentative.  And third, the proportion of women who complete the PhD might be a better measure of women-friendliness or women's success than proportion enrolled in the PhD program, since a substantial proportion of philosophy PhD students do not complete their degrees (in many departments completion rates are around 50%) and (anecdotally) non-completion rates might be higher for women than men (I welcome pointers to systematic data on this).\n\nFor these reasons, I decided to examine whether in a larger sample of PhD-granting philosophy departments in the U.S., the percent of women faculty would correlate with the percent of women completing the PhD.\n\nFor the data on students, I relied on the IPEDS database from the National Center for Educational Statistics, using an eight-year time frame from the academic year 2009-2010 to 2016-2017.  For faculty, I used Julie Van Camp's counts of women faculty and total faculty in 97 doctoral programs in the U.S. from January 2006 and January 2015, as recovered through the Wayback Machine Internet Archive.  (These 97 programs produce about 95% of the Philosophy PhDs in the U.S.  ETA: This includes tenured and tenure-track faculty only.)  For each department women faculty percentage score, I averaged the percentage of women faculty in 2006 and in 2015 to reduce noise due to temporary gains and losses.  (My own department, for example, had 2/17 [12%] women faculty in 2006 and 4/19 [24%] in 2015, and is probably better represented by 18% than by either the higher or the lower number.)\nOverall, women were 20% of faculty in 2006 (340/1669) and 25% of faculty in 2015 (442/1755), a statistically significant increase (z = 3.4, p = .001).  Although 20% to 25% may not sound like much, it is actually quite remarkable for such a short period.  The faculty growth between 2006 and 2015 in this set of universities was only 86 positions (from 1669 to 1755 total faculty), while the growth of women faculty was 102 positions.\n\nThe pattern in undergraduate Bachelor's degree completions in these same institutions is in some ways similar.  Among these 97 institutions, the percentage of women earning BAs increased from 29% (1066/3618) to 34% (957/2787).  This is statistically significant (z = 4.1, p < .001), and intermediate years show a slow steady increase (30%, then 31%, then 32%).  However, it is possible that this is just a brief fluctuation in a long-term trend, in which percentage of women among philosophy majors has held approximately steady at 30-34% since at least 1986.  Also notable: While faculty numbers increased, graduating majors decreased (fitting with national trends across all university types).\n\nThe pattern in PhD completions is approximately flat over the period (fitting with results from the NSF reported here), fluctuating between 25% and 33% women -- coincidentally, 27% both at the beginning (100/372) and at the end (113/415) of the period.  However, with numbers this low, statistical power is an issue.\n\nThe main question I was looking at was correlational: Do the universities with a higher proportion of women faculty tend to have a higher proportion of women completing their PhDs?  And the answer is...\n\nYes!\n\nHere it is as a chart:\n\n[apologies for blurry image: click to clarify and enlarge]\nThe correlation is substantial r = .42 (p < .001).  For example, although only 37 of the 97 universities had over 25% women faculty, all ten of the universities that had the highest proportion of women among their Philosophy PhD recipients did.\n\nOddly, however, for Bachelor's degrees, I can find no relationship at all, with a correlation of r = -.01 (p = .96).  This result contrasts sharply with the Paxton et al. results, and I'm not sure what to make of it.  A follow-up study might look at a broader sample of undergraduate institutions to see what sort of relationship there is between percent of women faculty and percent of women undergraduates in philosophy and whether it might vary with institution type.\n\n", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html dir=\"ltr\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:b=\"http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b\" xmlns:data=\"http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data\" xmlns:expr=\"http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr\">\n<head>\n<link href=\"https://www.blogger.com/static/v1/widgets/2890069739-widget_css_bundle.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"/>\n<meta content=\"text/html;

One's entire future career prospects depend on (or seem to depend on) one's ability to please and impress one's dissertation advisor.  This generates a lot of stress and a weird power dynamic between student and advisor.  Also, one needs to build a new life and a new social network in a new town, during a time in life when social support is often crucial.  And one probably wants one's dissertation to be the best most wonderful awesome thing one has ever written in one's life, despite never having had any experience writing anything as long and ambitious.  Ouch!<p>\n\nIn many ways, being a PhD student is a wonderful and amazing thing, but given the above, humane PhD advising is called for -- not harshness or rigidity.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a_2fHZi8LpU/XG7ivgH1BkI/AAAAAAAABeI/Q5B--oBzhngOUDlZzSU40YqXinV5Y4QyQCLcBGAs/s1600/phd022509s.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"260\" data-original-width=\"600\" height=\"139\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a_2fHZi8LpU/XG7ivgH1BkI/AAAAAAAABeI/Q5B--oBzhngOUDlZzSU40YqXinV5Y4QyQCLcBGAs/s320/phd022509s.gif\" width=\"320\"/></a></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n[<a href=\"https://conditionallyaccepted.com/2013/08/16/take-phd/\">image source</a>]<p>\n\nHere are seven principles to consider, if you are a PhD advisor, or maybe to hope for in a PhD advisor, if you are student.<p>\n<b>(1.) Don't take more than a month to return comments on written drafts.</b>  We advisors have a lot to do -- the book contract, the grant deadline, the trip to Germany.  But it's our responsibility to give our students comments in a timely fashion.  Next month will be busy too, and putting it off won't actually reduce the overall load unless you are slow enough to discourage students from showing their work very often (and I don't think that's what we should normally want).  Taking three months to return comments risks slowing down your student's progress by a whole semester.  The student might not prod you.  They might say it's fine, no hurry -- but take that with a grain of salt, given the power relations.  Find the time.<p>\n<b>(2.) Don't assume that your student wants to be a superstar researcher.</b>  If you're supervising PhD students, you probably see the academic world through the lens of research, and you probably esteem other professors in your field mostly in proportion to the strength of their research.  It's great if one of your students lands a job at a research university!  It's good, but nothing special, if they land a job at a non-research-focused teaching-intensive university.  If they end up teaching at a two-year community college, well, that's maybe a disappointment?  Of course some students do really want top research jobs and really would be disappointed to teach at a community college.  It's kind of in the air, in grad programs, that a research career is the ideal.  But not all students want that.  Most of world's professors work in teaching-intensive schools rather than powerhouse research universities -- and that's great.  I love to hear it when students tell me that they'd rather teach community college than land a job at Harvard.  If you assume that all of your students want to be superstar researchers, you contribute to a competitive and high-pressure environment in which teaching careers are devalued, students who don't appear to be on a research-career trajectory are perceived as disappointing, and students may not feel comfortable honestly sharing their non-research career goals with their professors.  All of this unfair and disheartening.  (Of course, it's terrific when a student aims for a stellar research career and achieves it.  I'm just saying don't assume that's what your students want, and don't push those expectations on them.)<p>\n<b>(3.) Don't pressure your students to work more quickly.</b>  Sure, the <i>university </i>might want to see them finish in five years.  But you should be the advocate of your students' interests against the university, rather than vice versa.  Life happens.  Depression.  Writer's block.  Parenthood.  Second thoughts and half-pursued career changes.  Financial trouble.  Illness.  A rare and exciting opportunity to see Brazil with their sister.  The situation is stressful enough for them without their advisor's giving them time pressure too.  You might think it's in their interest to work more quickly; and maybe it is.  But rather than take a harsh or paternalistic approach, pressuring them to work faster \"for their own good\", let <i>them </i>decide what pace works for them.  With perfect neutrality, help them finish quickly if that's what they want; and let them take their time if that's what they want.<p>\n<b>(4.) Remember that your student is already excellent.</b>  It is so hard to gain admissions into a good PhD program these days that only excellent students are able to do so.  They might not know how to write a dissertation yet, and they won't have as deep an understanding as you do of the research methods and the existing literature in your subfield.  But I've yet to meet a PhD student who didn't have the potential to be a terrific scholar and teacher.  There's no need for weeding them out or trying to figure out who are the strong vs. the weak ones.  Instead, help each of your amazing students more fully realize the excellence they already have.<p>\n<b>(5.) Evaluate the work, not the student.</b>  Evaluation is the constant duty of a professor.  But focus your evaluation on the student's work rather than on the student's ability or overall quality.  Excellent scholars sometimes produce mediocre work, especially when they're under pressure or trying something new.  No biggie!  (Reminder: Your student is under pressure and trying something new.)  If a student feels that everything they produce will be evaluated as a sign of their genius or (more likely) lack of genius, the atmosphere will be one of anxiety, pressure, perfectionism, defensiveness, and competitiveness.  Eventually, of course, the core parts of the student's dissertation will have to be excellent, but that's at the <i>end</i> of the PhD program.  Assuming that your student is a human being, their work along the way will have its ups and downs, and some of it will have to be discarded or will need at lot of revision, especially if they're creative, adventuresome, and open to risk.  How are they going to get helpful feedback if they feel that you are so constantly judging them that they dare not show you material unless they feel it's already near perfect?<p>\n<b>(6.) A hoop is just a hoop.  A class is just a class.  A draft is just a draft.</b>  Help them move efficiently through requirements (without pressuring them to do so (#3)).  The standard should be adequacy rather than exceptional brilliance.  If your student feels a need to prove their genius at every step, it should be no surprise if they're stressed out, taking incompletes, prepping far too long for their quals, etc.  Since they're already excellent (#4), if you've been a good advisor and if too many uncontrollable life changes haven't happened, their dissertation will be excellent at the end, when it's <i>finished</i> (#5).<p>\n<b>(7.) Be ever mindful of the asymmetry of power.</b>  The extreme asymmetry can be easy for advisors to forget, especially for those of us who regard ourselves as egalitarians and who like to be on a friendly, first-name basis with our students.  What you \"lightly\" request might be experienced as compulsion.  You might casually criticize, or tease, or razz them as you would a peer, but the effects of such casual remarks can be much more devastating, disruptive, or disorienting than you realize.  If a full professor says to another full professor working in the same field \"that's obviously wrong\" or \"that's stupid\", that might just be an occasion for friendly disagreement; not with a student whose whole career depends on your opinion.<p>\n\n---------------------------------<p>\n\nAll of these principles are defeasible, of course.  They represent my perspective on being a humane PhD advisor.  I might be wrong, and I might be much less humane than I think I am or than I hope to be.  (My grad students say they find me to be a good advisor, but given the power dynamics they might feel compelled to say that.  Few of us really know, I think, how good we are as advisors.)<p>\n\nOne disadvantage of my adherence to (7) above, I suspect, is that I'm less chummy with my students than some other advisors are.  Socializing, inviting students to my house, sharing details of our personal lives, etc., feels slightly strange to me given the power dynamic -- is the \"friendliness\" free or compelled?  I feel like I can't know, and that uncertainty keeps me always slightly guarded and formal.  I can only hope I'm not too standoffish as a result.<p>\n\nOne disadvantage of my adherence to (2) and (5) above, I suspect, is that the stronger students receive from me less of an encouraging vibe of \"you're the best, you're going to be a superstar researcher\" than they might hope or expect.  All my students are excellent and I prefer not to rank them in my mind.  Before anointing one as the next research superstar, let's see how the dissertation turns out in the end.  Nor do I especially value research excellence over teaching excellence.<p>\n\nWhen I think back on how warm and friendly and encouraging my father was with his strongest students (not PhD students in his case, but Master's), I somewhat regret my restraint in both of these respects.  There is, I suppose, no perfect solution but instead a range of tradeoffs that can reasonably be weighed differently.<p>\n\n---------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/06/against-those-year-end-faculty-meetings.html\">Against Those Year-End Faculty Meetings to Discuss the Graduate Students</a> (June 17, 2014)<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/think-of-your-dissertation-as-your.html\">Think of Your Dissertation as Your <i>Longest </i>Work, Not Your <i>Best </i>Work</a> (July 19, 2018).</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/02/seven-principles-of-humane-phd-advising.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2019-02-21T10:07:00-08:00\">10:07 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1401654848956854342\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, December 27, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6888586366352015921\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/12/some-structural-disadvantages-of.html\">Some Structural Disadvantages of Interdisciplinary Research, and What to Do About Them</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>My own academic department has treated me well over the years, accepting my interdiscipinary forays into psychology and science fiction.  But most academic researchers who do interdisciplinary work face structural disadvantages.  I speak from my experience in philosophy, but the problems are deeply rooted in the academic system.<p>\n\nI will focus on two disadvantages: The \"But It Isn't X\" Complaint (from colleagues from your home discipline) and Prejudice / Turf Defense (from colleagues from disciplines other than your home discipline).<p>\n\n*****************************************************<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HQBHBgeWsOc/XCTjPS3HiUI/AAAAAAAABTI/xbzCjGAkluk2uCgzInC5E082YedyWvKVwCLcBGAs/s1600/fractal-1063445_1920.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1090\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"218\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HQBHBgeWsOc/XCTjPS3HiUI/AAAAAAAABTI/xbzCjGAkluk2uCgzInC5E082YedyWvKVwCLcBGAs/s320/fractal-1063445_1920.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n<b>The \"But It Isn't X\" Complaint</b><p>\n\nIf you apply for a job in a department in discipline X, the hiring department will care almost exclusively about your work in X.  When you stand for promotion or most other sorts of disciplinary recognition, you will be evaluated almost exclusively for your work within the discipline.  If you ask for your work outside the discipline to be counted equally, you will be told that it isn't really X and therefore doesn't count for much toward hiring, promotion, or recognition in discipline X.<p>\n\nThe \"But It Isn't X\" Complaint is entirely understandable.  Shouldn't hiring and promotion into a philosophy department, for example, and recognition in philosophy, depend on the candidate's contributions to <i>philosophy?</i>  And even if in principle the evaluators want work outside of their discipline to count equally, they will feel unable to properly evaluate it.  In the disciplinary evaluations on which most of academia is built, within-discipline contributions count most.<p>\n\nThe almost inevitable consequence is that researchers who devote substantial time to interdisciplinary work will be severely disadvantaged in hiring, promotion, and disciplinary recognition.<p>\n<i>What to Do on Behalf of Your Interdisciplinary Colleagues</i><p>\n\nIf a department wants to recognize interdisciplinary colleagues appropriately in hiring, promotion, and other types of evaluation, they need to <b>ask not \"how much has this person contributed to our discipline?\" but rather (1.) \"how much has this person contributed to academia as a whole?\" and (2.) \"has this person contributed enough to our discipline to still count as member of this discipline?\"</b>  Suppose someone straddles two disciplines 50/50, and over some period of time they publish three excellent papers in their home discipline and three excellent papers in another discipline.  Evaluate them not according to the three home-discipline papers, with the three others as \"frosting\", but treat all six papers on a par.  Of course, if the majority of papers are in another discipline, at some point it would be reasonable to consider a change of department.  But until that time, all contributions should be valued and evaluated by the home department.<p>\n\nIf there is to be room in academia, as I think there should be, for people who bridge two disciplines, those people need to be valued for their contributions to <i>both </i>disciplines.  If people in their home discipline cannot expertly evaluate that person's interdisciplinary work -- quite understandable! -- they should consult with others from the appropriate discipline, or even better with others who are interdisciplinary between the same two disciplines.<p>\n<i>\nWhat to Do If You Are the Interdisciplinary Researcher<p></p></i>\n\nAssuming your colleagues and evaluators are not implementing the strategy above, as most will not, I advise three strategies:<p>\n\n(1.) <b>Do as much in your home discipline as your colleagues do.</b>  Publish the six papers in your home discipline <i>and</i> three outside your discipline.  This isn't easy to implement, of course!  But one of the advantages of interdisciplinary research is that your expertise outside of your home discipline can be a font of fresh ideas.  If your c.v. contains as much good work in X as your colleagues', it doesn't matter so much if they think of your other work as of secondary importance.<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Take advantage of higher-level administrators' appreciation of interdisciplinarity.</b>  In my experience, the majority of higher-level administrators (deans, etc.) value interdisciplinarity.  Their evaluations rarely matter enough to compensate for the structural disadvantages I mentioned above, but often their evaluations matter somewhat.  There are sometimes grant opportunities, teaching release opportunities, or other recognition for interdisciplinary work; keep your eyes open for these.  Also, if your disciplinary colleagues are supportive, you can remind them that there are aspects of your research profile that will be attractive to administrators because of your interdisciplinarity.  This can lead your colleagues' to be more assertive in making your case than they would otherwise be, anticipating approval from the higher-ups.<p>\n\n(3.) <b>Relabel your work as a contribution to your discipline.</b>  This is the boldest move, and it will have mixed success at best.  For example, when I first started doing work in psychology I thought of it just as work in psychology that had <i>consequences </i>for philosophy.  After all, if you <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DreamReportRepl.htm\">run</a> an <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ExpWOAttn.htm\">empirical experiment</a> that <a href=\"http://\">looks like a psychology experiment</a>, or<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ExpWOAttn.htm\"> contribute an article</a> to a <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ReplWarehouse.htm\">psychology journal</a>, isn't that doing psychology?<p> \n\nHowever, starting around 2003, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Steve Stich, Jonathan Weinberg, and others started calling their empirical research on non-philosophers' philosophical opinions \"experimental philosophy\" rather than psychology, and they successfully campaigned to publish some of it in straight-up philosophy journals.  They partly succeeded in <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/experimental-philosophy/\">changing the borders of the discipline</a> of philosophy to include work that would previously have been called psychology.  They haven't convinced everyone, of course.  Not all philosophers think of \"experimental philosophy\" as <i>really </i>philosophy.  But the situation is better than it was.  Arguably, \"behavioral economics\" is a similar story, even more successful.<p>\n\nSimilarly, I have been starting to <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/PhilosophersRecommend-150507-short.pdf\">make the case</a> that <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0719-schwitzgebel-philosophy-articles-20150717-story.html\">writing fiction</a> can also be <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/09/fiction-and-skepticism.html\">a way of doing philosophy</a> -- witness Rousseau, Sartre, Nietzsche, Plato, Murdoch, Voltaire, etc.!<p>\n\n*****************************************************<p>\n<b>Prejudice / Turf Defense<p></p></b>\n\nInterdisciplinary prejudice and turf defense are slightly different but related phenomena.<p>\n<i>Interdisciplinary prejudice </i>is the understandable default assumption that someone outside of your discipline isn't going to be nearly as good at work in your discipline as someone whose formal affiliation and training is in your discipline.  <i>Turf defense</i> is an emotional reaction to the threatening idea that someone outside of your discipline might be as good as you and your colleagues, or better, at work in your own discipline [ETA:] or that others might falsely perceive them that way.<p>\n\nUsually, interdisciplinary prejudice is justified, and perhaps not deserving of a pejorative label.  If a non-philosopher submits something to a philosophy journal, odds are good that it won't be an excellent work of philosophy.  If a philosopher tries to run a psychology experiment, odds are good that their methods and analyses won't be as solid as a psychologist's.  For similar reasons, turf defense isn't wholly unjustified: You don't want others to mistakenly think that the non-X researcher's probably-inferior work is as good as a disciplinary expert's work, so it makes sense in a way to guard against incursions.  The turf defense reaction is also, I think, partly driven by feelings that the outsider is being disrespectful: If an outsider thinks they can come in and beat us at our own game, that seems to suggest that they lack respect for our years of hard work and disciplinary training.<p>\n\nHowever, sometimes people really can do excellent work in more than one discipline.  It takes years of effort to acquire the knowledge and skills; but people do sometimes put in the requisite time and effort.  An Associate Professor of X with a strong interdisciplinary focus might have as much knowledge of and experience in Y as an Assistant Professor in Y.  (It would be almost superhuman, though, for an Associate Professor in X to have as much knowledge and experience in Y as an Associate Professor in Y, unless the situation is very unusual.)  However, even when the outsider does have the requisite knowledge and skills, it is, I fear, a sociological fact that substantial prejudice and turf defense remain.<p>\n<i>What to Do on Behalf of Interdisciplinary Colleagues</i><p>\n\n(1.) <b>Be aware of your possible interdisciplinary prejudice and turf defense and the fact that they are not always justified.</b>  Try to evaluate work in your home discipline by someone outside of your home discipline in approximately the same way you would evaluate other contributions to your discipline.<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Implement anonymous review when possible.</b>  If the work passes muster, it shouldn't matter if it's from a Stanford professor in your discipline or someone from a less prestigious university with a different disciplinary affiliation or from a construction worker in Tallahassee.<p>\n\n(3.) <b>Where anonymous review isn't possible, downplay departmental affiliations on the first page of articles and applications</b> -- for the same reasons.<p>\n<i>What to Do If You Are the Interdisciplinary Researcher<p></p></i>\n\n(1.) <b>Collaborate with someone from the other discipline.</b>  There appears to be much less prejudice and turf defense when at least one member of the research team is from the target discipline.  Furthermore, the collaborator will bring an inside-the-discipline perspective that it is very difficult to achieve from outside a discipline, even if one has substantial expertise.<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Watch for shibboleths.</b>  By shibboleths I mean superficial signs of being an insider rather than an outsider.  It helps reduce prejudice and turf defense the more you can write and speak indistinguishably from members of the target discipline.  (Collaborators can help with this.)  If you sound like an outsider, even if your content is good, that will tend to amplify negative reactions to your work.<p>\n\n(3.) <b>Cite thoroughly and carefully early in your project.</b>  Show, from the very beginning, thorough and serious engagement with the existing work in the target discipline.  This shows respect for that work, reducing the turf defense reaction, and it shows that you have substantial expertise, reducing the prejudice reaction.<p>\n\n*****************************************************<p>\n\nBarring radical changes, structural disadvantages will continue to impair people who do interdisciplinary work.  However, I do also believe that there is one major compensatory advantage, over the long run of a research career.  <b>Often, the freshest and most fruitful academic ideas come from researchers with expertise in more than one area</b>, who can use their expertise in Y to shine new interesting light on X.  Your colleagues won't always appreciate this right away.  But in the long run, you will have different things to say than those whose expertise is exclusively within a single discipline.  You will have a distinctive perspective and contribution.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/fractal-abstract-line-wave-design-1063445/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/12/some-structural-disadvantages-of.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-12-27T07:22:00-08:00\">7:22 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6888586366352015921\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, December 20, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4348801974629754723\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/12/philosophy-as-second-major-data-by-race.html\">Philosophy as a Second Major: Data by Race and Gender</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Last year, I observed that <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/philosophy-relies-on-those-double-majors.html\">Philosophy relies on double majors</a> more than most other academic disciplines do.  Drawing on <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/Data.aspx\">IPEDS data</a> from the National Center for Education Statistics, for Bachelor's degrees completed in  2016, I found that although only 0.30% of students choose Philosophy as a first major, among those who completed a second major, 1.7% choose Philosophy.  I also found that 20% of graduating Philosophy majors had Philosophy as their second major.  If we conjecture that double majors with Philosophy as one of their majors are just as likely to list Philosophy first as second (which might not be true, but can't be assessed from the IPEDS data), then 40% of Philosophy majors are double-majoring with something else.  [See <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/Data.aspx\">here</a> for methodological details and more data.]<p>\n\nThis year, I thought it would be interesting to break down the results by race and gender.  My thought was that maybe women or members of historically underrepresented racial groups might be proportionately more likely than White men to take Philosophy as a second major.  White men are disproportionately represented in Philosophy, for whatever (much disputed!) reason.  Perhaps women and members of underrepresented racial groups would be more likely to take Philosophy as a second major if they could also major in something else?<p>\n\nTo reduce hindsight bias, I encourage you to pause now and reflect on what your guess would be.<p>\n\nDrum roll please....<p>\n<i>Results by Gender</i><p>\n\nNCES uses the gender categories \"men\" and \"women\".  I examined all U.S. data from the 2009-2010 academic year through the 2016-2017 academic year.<p>\n\nCombining all majors and all years, women were about as likely as men to complete a second major: 5.4% of women did so, compared to 5.1% of men (441,066/8,214,707 vs. 318,372/6,167,753 [p &lt; .001 of course, given the huge numbers]).  (All statistical tests in this post are two-tailed two-proportion z tests.)  Viewing the data another way, women constituted 57% of all graduates and 58% of all graduates who completed two majors.<p>\n\nPhilosophy constituted 0.39% of all first majors across the time period, and 1.9% of all second majors.  (These 2009-2017 numbers are higher than the 2016 numbers above because the Philosophy major <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/has-sharp-decline-in-philosophy-majors.html\">plummeted sharply</a> during the period.)  Women were about a third as likely to complete Philosophy as a first major than men: 0.21% of women did so, compared to 0.62% of men (17,244/8,214,707 vs. 38,241/6,167,753 [p &lt; .001]).  Despite 57% of graduates being women, women were only 31% of graduates whose first major was Philosophy.<p>\n\nAs I had suspected might be the case, <b>women were a larger proportion of Philosophy graduates whose second major was Philosophy: 35%, instead of 31%.</b>  Though the effect size isn't large, it is statistically significant (4,956/14,064 vs. 17,244/55,485 [p &lt; .001]).  Put another (perhaps more discouraging) way, 0.65% of women chose Philosophy as a second major, compared to 2.9% of men.<p>\n<i><i>Results by Race</i><p></p></i>\n\nNCES uses the racial categories American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Two or More Races, Race/Ethnicity Unknown, and Nonresident Alien, with these classifications running from the 2010-2011 to the 2016-2017 academic year.<p>\n\nIn contrast with gender, race was substantially related to completing a second major, combining all majors.<p>\n\nPercentage of graduates who completed a second major, by race, all majors:<blockquote>\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native: 3.6%</blockquote></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\nAsian: 5.7%\nBlack or African American: 2.4%\nHispanic or Latino: 4.8%\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: 2.8%\nWhite: 5.7%\nTwo or More Races: 5.3%\n<p>\n\nTo confirm that this wasn't a result of students of different racial identities enrolling in different school types, I checked to see if the results held up for different Carnegie classifications of school types (e.g., Doctorate Universities: Highest Research Activity, Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts &amp; Science Focus), and the same general pattern holds.  However, this question merits further exploration.<p>\n\nTo see how this looks for Philosophy specifically, it's clearest to compare the breakdown of 1st majors in Philosophy by race with the breakdown of 2nd majors.<p>\n\nFirst majors in Philosophy, by race:<blockquote>\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native: 0.5%</blockquote></p></p></p>\nAsian: 6.1%\nBlack or African American: 5.1%\nHispanic or Latino: 10.8%\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: 0.2%\nWhite: 65.4%\nTwo or More Races: 3.1%\n<p>\n<p>\n\nSecond majors in Philosophy, by race:<blockquote>\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native: 0.3%</blockquote></p></p>\nAsian: 5.7%\nBlack or African American: 3.2%\nHispanic or Latino: 8.5%\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: 0.1%\nWhite: 69.5%\nTwo or More Races: 3.8%\n<p>\n<p>\n\nHere it is as a bar chart:<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GZtN5-2m3wI/XBvoBzyld0I/AAAAAAAABSY/4Sw_hSeATSc4roaPWOne3M7LSGxswjTpwCLcBGAs/s1600/PhilRace1stv2nd.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"608\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GZtN5-2m3wI/XBvoBzyld0I/AAAAAAAABSY/4Sw_hSeATSc4roaPWOne3M7LSGxswjTpwCLcBGAs/s320/PhilRace1stv2nd.jpg\" width=\"253\"/></a></p></p></p>\n[click to clarify and enlarge]<p>\n\nThe result is the opposite of what we see with women, and the opposite of what I had predicted: <b>With the exception of \"two or more races\", students in racial groups other than White were a <i>smaller </i>proportion of graduates with a second major in Philosophy</b>.  This was true even of Asian graduates who, combining all majors, were just as likely as White graduates to complete a second major.  (All differences in proportion between 1st and 2nd major by race were statistically significant at p &lt; .05.)<p>\n<i>Conclusion</i><p>\n\nOverall across all majors, women weren't much more likely to complete second majors than were men, but they <i>were </i>more likely to do so in Philosophy.  Conversely, students from most racial groups other than White <i>were </i> in general substantially less likely to complete second majors than were White students, and the disproportion was even greater among Philosophy majors.<p>\n\nI'm not sure what might explain these patterns or what to do with them.

(Plus Other Interesting NCES Data)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I've received <a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/grantproposals/small_grant_proposals/2018/2018demoproposal.pdf\">good news</a> on a grant, with Morgan Thompson and Eric Winsberg, for some data-crunching about Philosophy majors in the U.S.  To celebrate, here's more data!<p>\n<i>Has the Sharp Decline in Philosophy Majors Hit Bottom?<p></p></i>\n\nLast year, drawing on the publicly available <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data\">IPEDS database</a>, I reported an alarmingly <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/sharp-declines-in-philosophy-history.html\">sharp decline</a> in the number of recipients of Bachelor's degrees in Philosophy in the U.S. since 2010 -- from 9,297 in 2010, or 0.58% of all graduates, to 7,507 in 2016, or 0.39% of all graduates.   I found similar declines in History, English, and other language majors.<p>\n\nIn the most recent year's data (2016-2017), I'm encouraged to see no further decline either in the total number of Philosophy majors or in the percentage of graduates who choose the Philosophy major.  To give you a sense of how striking this is, look at 2013-2017:<p>\n\nBachelor's Degrees in Philosophy in the U.S., by year:\n<blockquote> 2013: 9,439 (0.53% of all graduates)</blockquote></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n2014: 8,837 (0.47%)\n2015: 8,198 (0.43%)\n2016: 7,507 (0.39%)\n2017: 7,579 (0.39%)\n<p>\n\n[for methodological details see <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/sharp-declines-in-philosophy-history.html\">here</a>]<p>\n\nAfter declining by about 600 majors per year from 2013 through 2016, 2017 shows a slight uptick.  The 95% confidence interval around the 2017 number is 0.38% to 0.40%, so this flattening is not merely a chance deviation from the 0.05%/year downward trend since 2013.<p>\n<i>English and History, However, Continue to Decline<p></p></i>\n\nIn contrast with Philosophy, English and History are continuing to decline (though note that English and History still have many more majors overall).<p>\n\nBachelor's Degrees in English:\n<blockquote> 2013: 56,021 (3.0% of all graduates)</blockquote></p></p></p></p>\n2014: 54,222 (2.8%)\n2015: 49,540 (2.5%)\n2016: 46,259 (2.3%)\n2017: 44,686 (2.2%)\n<p>\n\nBachelor's Degrees in History:\n<blockquote> 2013: 37,583 (2.0% of all graduates)</blockquote></p>\n2014: 34,193 (1.8%)\n2015: 31,048 (1.6%)\n2016: 28,229 (1.4%)\n2017: 26,724 (1.3%)\n<p>\n\nDespite a 9% growth in total number of graduates across all majors, in the five years from 2013 to 2017, the number of graduates declined by 20% in English and by 29% in History, and is continuing to fall fast.  (Maybe, if you squint at the data with an optimistic eye, the rate of decline is slowing.)<p>\n<i>In Contrast, the Number of PhDs Hasn't Declined Much<p></p></i>\n\nIn contrast, the number of Philosophy, English, and History PhDs awarded has declined only slightly in that same five year period: from 475 to 438 in Philosophy, 1377 to 1347 in English, and 1003 to 945 in History.  Consequently,<b> the ratio of BAs to PhDs has declined considerably between 2013 and 2017</b>.  In English the ratio fell from 41 BAs per PhD in 2013 to 33 BAs per PhD in 2017.  In History the ratio fell from 37 to 29, and in Philosophy it fell from 20 to 17.<p>\n\nHere's a chart going back to 2010:<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EFXaGhESEa4/XACZJLx-LzI/AAAAAAAABP0/5dqcwjV4gosAQWZGT4aFK5yhJeGIsKghACLcBGAs/s1600/BAtoPhDratio-181129.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"492\" data-original-width=\"481\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EFXaGhESEa4/XACZJLx-LzI/AAAAAAAABP0/5dqcwjV4gosAQWZGT4aFK5yhJeGIsKghACLcBGAs/s320/BAtoPhDratio-181129.jpg\" width=\"313\"/></a><p>\n[click to clarify and enlarge]<p>\n<i>Conclusion<p></p></i>\n\nMajors can rise and decline substantially in popularity over the years.  Continuing decline isn't inevitable.  I'm rooting for a turnaround.<p>\n\nI might be wrong, but I think and hope that the recently increasing visibility of philosophers in prominent public venues such as the<i> New York Times</i> has helped improve the educated public's perception of the relevance and interest of philosophy.

One simple explanation (favored, for example, by Jon Haidt in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777\">his discussion</a> of Eric's work) is that philosophical moral reflection has little to no influence on people's moral behavior.  However, Eric and his frequent collaborator Joshua Rust have been hesitant to draw that conclusion without more empirical evidence (see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PowerReason.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">here</a> for possible alternative explanations).<p>\n\nMeanwhile, Eric's PhD student Chris was growing interested in the power of narratives to change behavior.  So we decided to collaborate on a project to compare the influence of narrative and argument on charitable giving.<p>\n<i>Design<p></p></i>\n\nFor our argument, we chose an argument constructed by philosopher Peter Singer with the aim of convincing ordinary readers to donate to charity.  The argument was originally written for a paper in draft by Luke Buckland, Matthew Lindauer, David Rodriguez-Arias, and Carissa Veliz.  (Thanks to them and to Peter Singer for sharing this argument with us.)  We supplemented Singer's argument with some additional clarificatory text.  It's a typical Singer-style argument, emphasizing that people have a duty to prevent death and suffering due to extreme poverty by donating money that they would otherwise spend on luxuries, and that our physical distance from those who are suffering does not excuse us from the obligation to help.<p>\n\nFor our narrative, we chose a true story, about the same word-length as the argument, about a family rescued from slavery by a charitable donation, which we adapted from the website of a charitable organization.<p>\n\nParticipants were 918 MTurk workers in the United States.  We divided them into four conditions: (1.) narrative only, (2.) argument only, (3.) narrative + argument, and (4.) control (who received a similar-length text from a middle-school physics textbook).  Participants were then asked to rate, on a 7-point scale, how much they agreed or disagreed with statements about the ethics of donation and their own motivation to donate (e.g., \"It is morally good to give money to charities that help those in extreme poverty\", \"Currently I feel motivated to give money to a charity that helps people in extreme poverty\").  In Experiment 1, we then asked them a hypothetical question about how much they would give to a charity if we offered them a bonus of $10.  In Experiment 2, we replaced the hypothetical-donation language with a lottery choice.  We'll report only on Experiment 2 here, but the results of Experiment 1 were very similar.<p>\n\nHere is the exact language for the lottery choice:\n<blockquote>Upon completion of this study, 10% of participants in this study will receive an additional $10. You have the option to donate some portion of this $10 to one of six well-known charities that have been shown to effectively fight suffering due to extreme poverty. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, the portion you decide to keep will appear as a bonus credited to your Mechanical Turk worker account, and the portion you decide to donate will be given to the charity you pick from the list below. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, how much of your additional $10 would you like to donate?</blockquote><p>\n\nParticipants then ticked a number on a scale from $0 to $10 in dollar intervals, indicating how much they would donate if they won the $10. \n (A big thanks to <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, especially Jon Behar, for funding this study!)<p>\n\nFinally, we asked questions designed to measure \"narrative transportation\" (i.e., how immersive and moving they found the narrative, or argument, or physics text), adapted from <a href=\"http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/the_role_of_transportation_in_the_persuasiveness_of_public_narratives.pdf\">Green and Brock 2000</a>.<p>\n\nWe thought we'd share some preliminary results.  We emphasize that these results are only preliminary.  Later, we'll want to double-check our numbers, confirm that we got the exclusions exactly right, etc.  (We have a preregistration at <a href=\"https://osf.io/\">Open Science Foundation</a>, but we haven't made it public yet.)<p>\n<i>Results<p></p></i>\n\nMean amount donated, by condition:<p>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NK7SVwP8u9c/W_LzoL_PQ1I/AAAAAAAABOU/VvH0S_R31Ak4n7gsETTXDNNgOl6alO7OACLcBGAs/s1600/MeanDonation-181119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"288\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NK7SVwP8u9c/W_LzoL_PQ1I/AAAAAAAABOU/VvH0S_R31Ak4n7gsETTXDNNgOl6alO7OACLcBGAs/s320/MeanDonation-181119.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n\n(Apologies for blurry image.  Click to enhance.  Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.)<p>\n\nStatistically, the conditions are different (ANOVA [913,3], F=4.99, p = .002).  In planned, pre-registered one-tailed t-tests, we found that the narrative and narrative+argument conditions generated more donation than the control condition (p = .02, .001) but the argument condition did not (p = .48).  Similarly in a multiple regression analysis we found that being in one of the narrative conditions (narrative only or narrative+argument) predicted donation amount but being in one of the argumentative conditions was not statistically significantly predictive.  <b>In other words, exposure to a Singer-style philosophical argument had no statistically detectable effect on charitable giving, but exposure to a narrative about a family rescued from slavery did have a detectable effect.</b>  This was also true in Experiment 1, concerning hypothetical donation.<p>\n\nThe results were even clearer for the measure of ethical opinion and motivation to donate, which was scored on a scale from 5 to 35, based on 5 questions:\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8TXqt8z9z5s/W_L55fVT4LI/AAAAAAAABOw/vXI947okp5UC89WSqOcww4kkyusTeYrKQCLcBGAs/s1600/CharityMotivation-181119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"392\" data-original-width=\"485\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8TXqt8z9z5s/W_L55fVT4LI/AAAAAAAABOw/vXI947okp5UC89WSqOcww4kkyusTeYrKQCLcBGAs/s320/CharityMotivation-181119.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n\nIt's not a huge effect size -- about 2 points on the scale -- but it's easier to see how the results for argument and control are similar to each other and different from the results for narrative and narrative+argument, which are also similar to each other (ANOVA [913,3], F=10.8, p &lt; .001; one-tailed t vs. control condition: argument p = .71, narrative p &lt; .001, nar+arg p &lt; .001). \n Similarly to the lottery donation results, a regression analysis of reported motivation and moral opinion finds being in a narrative condition predictive and being in an argument condition non-predictive.<p>\n\nAs expected, we also found that participants reported more narrative transportation in the narrative and narrative+argument conditions than in the other conditions (ANOVA, p &lt; .001) and that narrative transport, amount given, and motivation to give were mutually correlated (transport-amount given, r = .24; transport-motivation, r = .40, motivation-amount given, r = .50; all p's &lt; .001).<p>\n<i>Conclusion<p></p></i>\n<b>We regard this as preliminary evidence that exposure to at least one type of narrative influences charitable giving, motivation, and opinion, while exposure to one common type of philosophical argument has little if any influence.</b><p>\n\nIn our teaching, we also seem to find that Singer-style arguments have little effect on moral opinion or motivation to donate.  In another series of studies (collaborative with Peter Singer and Brad Cokelet), which we hope to be able to report on soon, professors and TAs at UC Riverside taught lower-division philosophy students philosophical arguments for charitable donation and for vegetarianism.  In subsequent questionnaires, students' self-reported attitudes toward charity don't appear to have been much influenced by the arguments, but their self-reported attitudes toward vegetarianism do appear to have been influenced.<p>\n\nThis is not to deny that <i>some</i> people are influenced to donate by Singer's arguments.  Eric believes that he has been, for example.  But the effect might be weak or uncommon or not effectively produced by brief exposures.<p>\n\nIn follow-up research, we plan to see if we find similar results with different types of arguments and narratives, and we hope to zero in on what underlying factors are at work behind these effects.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/narrative-but-not-philosophical.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-11-21T08:13:00-08:00\">8:13 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2869116372983638922\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, November 16, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7378135089447239332\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/possible-backfire-effects-of-excellent.html\">Possible Backfire Effects of an Excellent Diversity Statement?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VFI2qFzCxjw/W-3JY5NLwwI/AAAAAAAABN4/XTUmbDejpK4odVGTYhoJUNtuezcZ3gEuwCLcBGAs/s1600/diverse-kids.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1502\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VFI2qFzCxjw/W-3JY5NLwwI/AAAAAAAABN4/XTUmbDejpK4odVGTYhoJUNtuezcZ3gEuwCLcBGAs/s200/diverse-kids.jpg\" width=\"188\"/></a></div><p>\n\nApplicants for faculty positions in the University of California must now include \"Diversity Statements\" alongside more traditional elements of their applications.  Other universities have instituted similar requirements.  Applicants might wonder how much detail and energy to put into a diversity statement.  The question is trickier than it might seem, and there is, I think, some risk that an excellent diversity statement will backfire.<p>\n\nOne of the most acrimonious and politicized issues in faculty hiring in the U.S. right now is the extent to which universities ought to prioritize increasing the demographic diversity of their faculty.  On one side are faculty and administrators who think that applicants' race, gender, or other demographic features ought not to be considered at all in hiring; on the other side are faculty and administrators who regard demographic diversification as a very high priority in faculty hiring; and of course there is a range of nuances and intermediate positions.  You can see the politics of this issue, as it manifests in philosophy blogs, for example <a href=\"http://dailynous.com/2018/10/26/demographic-diversity-good-philosophy/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2018/10/nominations-are-currently-open-for-apa-leadership-positions-until-october-31-1.html\">here</a>.<p>\n\nBecause of these background politics, diversity statements that are too passionate or detailed might risk alienating some people on a hiring committee.  In the current environment, such statements are not politically neutral.<p>\n\n------------------------------------------<p>\n\nAt U.C. Riverside, where I work, it's clear that pursuit of demographic diversity is a high priority in the administration.  Many faculty have the impression that if a proposed hire will contribute substantially to the \"diversity mission\" of the university, that hire is much likelier to be approved.  Every search committee must have an \"Affirmative Action Compliance Officer\" responsible for monitoring affirmative action efforts and tracking justifications for the rejection of all rejected applicants.  Also, all faculty on hiring committees must complete a thirty-minute online diversity training and attend a ninety-minute in-person workshop on \"Promoting Faculty Diversity\".<p>\n\nI attended my first diversity workshop a couple of months ago.  It struck me that most of the attendees -- even those who thought that promoting diversity was a good idea -- felt resentful that they were required to engage in two hours of diversity training before being permitted to serve on a hiring committee.  We're busy with all of our teaching and research, of course!  The training is experienced as a needless, time-consuming interruption.  We all already know, or at least think we know, pretty much what we need to know about these issues.<p>\n\nDiversity statements were a central topic of the workshop I attended.  Examples of good and bad diversity statements were offered for our consideration.  We were advised to treat the diversity statement as among the most important parts of the application.  Indeed, it was suggested that we might do a preliminary screening of applications based on the diversity statement alone, removing from consideration any candidates whose diversity statements weren't excellent, before even looking at research or teaching.  This particular suggestion was met with considerable hostility and incredulity among the faculty sitting near me in the back corner of the room, most of whom seemed to be bristling with rebellious anger, like the \"bad\" kids forced to attend some supposedly-educational high school detention hour.<p>\n\nWhat makes for a good diversity statement?  I'm inclined to think that an excellent diversity statement would show concrete, detailed, and extensive evidence of one's commitment to and ability to contribute to the university's mission of promoting student and faculty diversity.  Ideally, this would show in your research, and in your teaching, and in your committee service and other administrative roles, and in your broader life experience.   (UC Davis offers some guidelines <a href=\"https://academicaffairs.ucdavis.edu/guidelines-writing-diversity-statement\">here</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2016/06/10/how-write-effective-diversity-statement-essay\">here's some advice</a> from <i>Inside Higher Ed</i>.)<p>\n\nI returned to my office and pulled up my own Diversity Statement (which I keep handy to trot out for various purposes when necessary).  Having attended the workshop, my statement now struck me as too brief and lacking detail.  It could be much better!  I revised it, adding several different kinds of specific evidence of my commitment to enhancing the diversity of the university through my teaching and adding another ten or so specific pieces of evidence of my commitment to enhancing the diversity of both UCR and the profession as a whole through my research, committee service, and public philosophy.  (If you follow my blog, you'll know that I have done considerable work on diversity issues.)  What a wonderful Diversity Statement I had by the end, if I may say so myself, full of good, concrete evidence that I'm deeply committed to diversifying the profession!<p>\n\nAnd then I thought: How would <a href=\"http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/dan-kaufman/\">Daniel Kaufman</a> or <a href=\"https://leiterreports.typepad.com/\">Brian Leiter</a> react a diversity statement like this?  A lot of philosophers (maybe not Kaufman and Leiter in particular) might react negatively.  For tenure-track job applicants especially, philosophers like Kaufman and Leiter, who believe that demographic diversity has recently been overemphasized, might understandably be hesitant to welcome colleagues who are passionately committed to the importance of demographic diversity.  They might, on good grounds, fear that such a colleague would prioritize philosophy of race or Asian philosophy over some of the areas they might prefer to hire in, or that the colleague might be especially drawn to job candidates who are disabled, or women, or from other historically underrepresented groups, etc.  The applicant's academic politics might be, in their view, all wrong.  Such philosophers might prefer to see a bland, pro forma diversity statement that implicitly conveys the message that increasing demographic diversity is not high among the applicant's priorities.<p>\n\nNow I wouldn't suggest playing down your enthusiasm about diversity issues if you genuinely feel that enthusiasm.  But I do think it probably makes sense to be aware that there might unfortunately be hiring contexts in which it's possible to do this part of the application <i>too</i> well.<p>\n\n------------------------------------------<p>\n\nAddendum:<p>\n\nTanya Golash-Boza, <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2016/06/10/how-write-effective-diversity-statement-essay\">in her advice at Inside Higher Ed</a>, suggests that hiring committee members who feel that the \"diversity agenda\" has gone too far will tend to skip diversity statements, and so applicants needn't worry about their reactions.  Hmmm... maybe?<p>\n\n------------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\nSee also Helen De Cruz's <a href=\"https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2018/11/what-kind-of-colleague-do-you-want-.html\">recent thoughts</a> on the possible backfire effects of being portrayed as compassionate or as a dedicated teacher, in applications to research-oriented academic jobs.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=112338&amp;picture=diverse-kids\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/possible-backfire-effects-of-excellent.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-11-16T09:23:00-08:00\">9:23 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7378135089447239332\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, October 22, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6403260623576474171\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/10/in-defense-of-weekends-evenings.html\">In Defense of Weekends, Evenings, Holidays, and Sleep</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Csy7so-b4jU/W830CdJPEaI/AAAAAAAABJ4/QltpIs649zsY4-JWclUnt46-yzrizKS7wCLcBGAs/s1600/40hr-workweek.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"384\" data-original-width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Csy7so-b4jU/W830CdJPEaI/AAAAAAAABJ4/QltpIs649zsY4-JWclUnt46-yzrizKS7wCLcBGAs/s200/40hr-workweek.jpg\" width=\"156\"/></a></div><p>\n\nI haven't checked my email since Friday afternoon, and there are now 165 unread messages in my inbox.  (Only a few are likely to be spam.  I have excellent filters and use a separate email address for all commercial transactions.)  I am inspired to confess this after having read a <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Does-Graduate-School-Kill/244796\">recent article on academic overwork</a> and its propensity to kill marriages.<p>\n\nAccording to the article,\n\n<blockquote>Marital hardships are easily traced to academe\u2019s toxic work culture -- one in which your research must be everything, you are praised for working 17 hours a day in a lab, and you are reprimanded and told you\u2019re not dedicated enough for visiting your long-distance partner or (gasp!) taking a vacation.</blockquote><p>\n\nEtc.<p>\n\nSome students experience their professors as demanding these kinds of sacrifices from them.  I hope my students do not experience me as demanding this!  Nor do I demand it of myself.  I prioritize and protect my weekends, evenings, holidays, and sleep.  And yet I maintain a productive academic career.  This is possible!  Indeed, I believe that it is <i>good</i>, for two reasons:<p>\n\n(1.) <b>Other parts of life are important.</b>  Maybe if you're David Hume or a cancer researcher on the edge of a breakthrough, the world really needs every drop of labor possible from you.  But for the rest of us: Your kids, your spouse, your friends, and your neighbors need your more.  Your rebuttal to Schnerdfoot's objection to Imakara et al. (2009) can wait.  And <i>you</i> need you more.  Live a good, rich life!  Don't burn yourself out for this.<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Productivity gains under conditions of exhaustion are minimal.</b>  Some evidence suggests that there is <a href=\"https://lengstorf.com/overtime-hurts-productivity/\">little productivity gain above about forty hours a week</a>; and working sixty hours a week might even decrease total output compared to working forty.  I suspect this varies considerably by profession and type of labor, but speaking from personal experience, when I am exhausted, my philosophical work suffers.  I can't read or write as quickly, creatively, and actively.  My teaching energy declines and I'm more of a dud with my students.  And I find myself spacing out or spending too much time on distractions like Facebook or my phone.  I do my best work, focused and energetic, when I'm sleeping well and when I've been recharging and relaxing sufficiently on weekends and evenings.<p>\n\nNow there are some unfortunate situations in academic labor, where one simply cannot trim down to a reasonably-sized workweek -- for example, if you're adjuncting at multiple campuses or being tyrannized by a demanding supervisor.  But setting such regrettable cases aside, I don't think that most graduate students or tenure-track professors, in philosophy at least, need to regularly work more than 40-50 hours per week, except perhaps in exceptional crunch times, <i>if</i> they can work those 40-50 hours energetically and productively.<p>\n\n(I am open to being corrected about the generalization above, across some ranges of situations.  And in calling some situations \"regrettable\" I don't mean that they are <i>merely</i> regrettable in the sense that we should tolerate them with a sigh rather than activity fighting against the institutional practices that create those situations.)<p>\n\nFor example, I try to abide by the following policies:<p>\n\n(1.) No academic work in the evening.  (I do let myself check Facebook and read popular articles related to academia, and also to do other light reading related to my work, e.g., popular books by authors like Oliver Sacks or Steven Pinker.)<p>\n\n(2.) No academic work on weekends.  (Similar exceptions to those in the evening.  Also, sometimes I travel on weekends.)<p>\n\n(3.) One hour of exercise every morning.  (Sometimes, if I have academic thoughts while exercising, e.g., about blog posts or papers, I will note them down in my phone to pursue later.)<p>\n\n(4.) At least an eight-hour sleep opportunity.  (I have some insomnia issues I'm working on, so I don't typically succeed in sleeping a full eight hours, but even relaxing eyes-closed in bed has some value.)<p>\n\n(5.) A two-week holiday in the summer, and assorted vacation days throughout the year.  (I don't take every federal holiday, but I more than make up for that with days off that aren't federal holidays.)<p>\n\n(6.) Only four work-related out-of-town trips per year.  (I've been pushing a bit higher sometimes with exceptional cases, though, and my trips are often multi-stop.)<p>\n\n(7.) Regular Monday-Friday work hours.  (Right now, it's about 9:00-6:15, which is a 46.25-hour week.)<p>\n\nIn grad school, I was miserable until I figured out better policies for myself.  I felt like I needed to work as many hours as humanly possible, with the result that any time I wasn't working I was feeling guilty.  My days were a blurred mix of working and half-working/half-not-working-and-feeling-guilty-about-it, with lots of hazy wasted time and unproductive eyes-glazed reading.  Much better, for me, are bright lines between work and home, plus clear policies.<p>\n\nThese policies haven't interfered too much with my productivity.  I have a light teaching load (1-2-1 on the quarter system, with teaching buy-outs sometimes), enabling more research publications than most philosophers have.  With that caveat, in the last two years, I've published eight research articles (some co-authored), a co-edited anthology, two science fiction stories, and 17 minor or popular pieces.  I am currently teaching a 400-student class on Evil (with 5 TAs), plus an honors section, plus a graduate seminar; and I am chairing five PhD dissertation students and an undergraduate honors thesis, and I'm hosting a visiting post-doc.  Plus, I have my blog and a variety of (minor to moderate-sized) administrative duties.  I have a book manuscript due in November and of course several other writing projects in progress.<p>\n\nMaybe my work would be better if I spent more time on it?  I'm not sure.  But even if so, I suspect that the world will manage just fine.<p>\n\nSo if I don't quite get through my inbox today, please forgive me!  Also, there might be some typos.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/today-in-labor-history-the-40-hour-workweek/\">image source</a>]<p>\n<i>ETA Oct. 26:<p></p></i>\n\nWhile this post has generally had good reception, a number of people have expressed the view that in their academic jobs, they are forced to work over fifty hours per week either (a.) to keep their jobs, or (b.) to keep their jobs while also having time to do research work that they value, or (c.) to keep their jobs while also managing complex and demanding lives outside of work.  (The background assumption here is that there is at least <i>some</i> productivity gain for working over fifty hours, which I'm sure is true for some people in some situations.)

To this end, we have initiated a broadly consultative process to arrive at a list of potentially diversity-enhancing practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, we have:<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Collected and analyzed data on under-representation in 56 philosophy journals from 1880-2010.</li>\n<li>Conducted a survey of 50 philosophy journals to evaluate current practices and results.</li>\n<li>Held an open meeting at the Pacific Division APA with the editors of 20 leading philosophy journals to discuss possible improvements.</li>\n<li>Circulated this list widely to those with expertise on diversity issues, including the editors of 100 journals, and recruited the editors of five journals to discuss their experiences at greater length on the Blog of the APA.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nWe are seeking feedback from the larger philosophical community on these ideas here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur main recommendations are just these:<br/>\n<br/>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Set specific, achievable targets to make progress in increasing diversity in your journal.</b></li>\n<li><b>Implement promising practices to increase diversity in your journal and meet these targets.</b></li>\n<li><b>Collect data and evaluate progress at regular intervals and revise practices accordingly.</b></li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\nWhile we do not aim to defend any particular way of setting these targets here, and different journals may set more or less ambitious targets, we hope that all journals will set targets and take positive steps that will eventually yield proportional representation. This may require ensuring that members of under-represented groups can publish at least in proportion to their presence as faculty in the discipline or in proportion to their presence as researchers with a particular AOS. Targets even higher than proportional representation might be desirable to restore balance after a period of inequity or due to the special value of perspectives of members from some under-represented groups on some issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of our concrete ideas for improvement will no doubt be controversial, but editors seeking to increase diversity in the profession can implement the practices most compatible with their journal\u2019s aims and needs, and we believe the evidence supports many of the suggestions we provide for positive change.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, we believe that bringing about positive change just requires a bit of effort. We think that, if we really want to improve diversity in the profession, we can. We invite you to collaborate with us in doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Editorial Practices to Consider to Improve the Diversity of Philosophy Journals\u00a0</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>1. Diversify representatives \u2013 editors, editorial board members, referees, trustees, staff, etc. \u2013 to include more people from under-represented groups and on important but neglected topics of interest to a diverse range of philosophers, utilizing a diverse range of methods.</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Commit to inclusion with influence. However, also be cautious about creating disproportionate burdens on members of under-represented groups, especially if those burdens do not come with public recognition.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>2. Set specific, achievable targets to make progress in increasing diversity in your journal.\u00a0</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>For under-represented groups, long-term targets might include publishing and promoting their work at least in proportion to their presence in the part of the discipline that your journal covers.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>3. Implement promising practices to meet these targets and increase diversity in your journal, such as:\u00a0</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Solicit submissions of promising work by members of under-represented groups.  (<a href=\"https://philpeople.org/news#tab=everything\">PhilPeople</a> might be a useful resource.)</li>\n<li>Reserve more space for articles by members of under-represented groups to help meet specific targets.</li>\n<li>Publish more papers of interest to under-represented groups in philosophy and on important but neglected topics of interest to a diverse range of philosophers.</li>\n<li>When inviting authors always bear in mind the importance of increasing diversity in the field (potentially via special issues).</li>\n<li>Ensure fair practice in weighing the value of anonymity and non-anonymous editorial discretion, bearing in mind that evidence is mixed regarding the effectiveness of anonymous review in increasing diversity. Take special care to ensure that any non-anonymous parts of the review process do not omit or unfairly disadvantage authors from under-represented groups.</li>\n<li>Attend to your regional context as well as the overall global context (e.g. the importance of including adequate geographical and indigenous representation in your journal).\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>4. Implement diversity-supporting referee practices, such as:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage referees and authors to avoid using language that is insensitive to cultural differences or that inappropriately excludes or offends any group of people based on their ability/disability, age, ethnicity and race, gender identity, sexual orientation, class, nationality, etc.</li>\n<li>Encourage referees and authors to check that papers cite and discuss a fair representation of relevant work by members of under-represented groups.</li>\n<li>Encourage referees to consider accepting papers on topics of interest to under-represented groups in philosophy and on important but neglected topics of interest to a diverse range of philosophers.</li>\n<li>Encourage referees to not reject promising papers on grounds of writing quality, if the concerns are merely stylistic, can be repaired to an adequate level, and the philosophical content is good. This helps ensure fair consideration of work by philosophers who are not native speakers of English.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Encourage timely and developmental reviews, since members of vulnerable groups are especially disadvantaged by long delays before publication.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>5. Implement promising practices to increase accessibility in journals, such as:\u00a0</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Create structurally-tagged content.</li>\n<li>Utilize text-to-speech capability for print-impaired users in the absence of an audio book.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Include a navigable table of contents within your publications, and provide a defined reading order (including, for example, appropriate links between the main flow of the text and any sidebar or box out text) to help those reading through audio to navigate their way through the article.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n<li>Include Alt-text descriptions to explain illustrations for readers with reduced access to graphic information.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Give readers control over the font (size, style, and color), background color, and line spacing for online publications, and/or make them available in html.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Consider trying to make your journal more accessible for those in developing countries by making your journal open access in those regions.</li>\n<li>Employ W3C web accessibility standards where feasible, and check for web accessibility.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>6. Collect data on diversity relevant publishing practices, e.g. submission and publication rates for members of under-represented groups, referee and editorial board composition, etc. and track progress in increasing diversity in your journal.</b><br/>\n<b><br/></b>\n<b>7. Evaluate progress at regular intervals and revise practices accordingly.\u00a0</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Work with researchers to isolate and implement evidence-based practices that increase diversity in academic philosophy journals.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>\u00a08. Officially adopt these diversity-promoting practices and widely publicize your journal\u2019s targets and commitment to promoting diversity.\u00a0</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022 Inform all representatives and bind future representatives to uphold these standards.\u00a0</li>\n<li>\u2022 Publicly and explicitly adopt diversity-promoting practices, helping to create a culture of concern that enhances the journal\u2019s reputation for welcoming diversity, attracting more diverse submissions.</li>\n</ul>\nPromoting diversity, if done well, ought to improve the quality of work in your journal, expanding the pool of contributors and the range of submitted work relevant to your journal\u2019s mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreated by the Demographics in Philosophy Project: https://www.facebook.com/PhilosophyData/<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to enhancing diversity in philosophy journal publishing, we would like to begin emphasizing things we can do to enhance diversity in the discipline more widely. We encourage feedback on this piece as well as ideas about how to implement inclusive practices for hiring and tenuring in philosophy departments and inclusive advising for PhD students. Please also help us in encouraging journals and departments to improve their practices!<br/>\n<br/>\n[<a href=\"https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/10/04/diversity-and-philosophy-journals-practices-for-improving-diversity-in-philosophy-journal-publishing/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/10/diversity-and-philosophy-journals.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-10-04T08:39:00-07:00\">8:39 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=139565263476157127\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, August 30, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3152812314325542111\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/08/rebecca-kukla-on-diversifying-philosophy.html\">Rebecca Kukla on Diversifying Philosophy</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I'm on a mission to help diversify philosophy journals.  The journals that are <a href=\"http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/top-philosophy-journals-without-regard-to-area.html\">seen as elite</a> in philosophy (but not only them) tend to draw on a somewhat narrow range of authors, addressing a somewhat narrow range of topics, using a somewhat narrow range of tools.  It's not as bad as it could be, and not as bad (I think) as it once was, but there is a long way to go.<p>\n\nPhilosophy is the broadest of all disciplines, with at least a bird's-eye view of everything important.  <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/01/for-all-x-theres-philosophy-of-x.html\">For all X, there's a philosophy of X.</a>  I like to think that my discipline could become the broadest-<i>minded</i> too, welcoming of all methods and viewpoints and cultural backgrounds.<p>\n\nAlarmingly, elite Anglophone philosophy journals are even more demographically narrow than the famously demographically narrow philosophy departments of the large Anglophone countries.  For example, <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/WomenInPhil.htm\">only about 13% of authors in elite Anglophone journals are women</a>, and <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/01/publications-by-black-authors-in-leiter.html\">less than 1% are Black</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Anglophone.htm\">only 3% of citations are to books or articles originally written in a language other than English</a>.<p>\n\nAt the Pacific Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association last spring, Nicole Hassoun, Sherri Conklin, and I organized a session on Diversity in Philosophy Journals, in which over 20 journal editors participated, as well as seven experts on the demographics of philosophy, and a large, engaged audience.  Following up on that session, we recruited five of those journal editors to write guest posts for the Blog of the APA, concerning their experiences with trying to improve the diversity of their journals.<p>\n\nAfter <a href=\"https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/08/23/diversity-and-philosophy-journals-introduction/\">a brief introductory piece</a> last week by Nicole Hassoun, Subrena Smith, and me, the first editor's post is finally up, and it's terrific!  <a href=\"https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/08/30/diversity-and-philosophy-journals-how-to-avoid-conservative-gatekeeping/\">Rebecca Kukla describes the editorial policies she has used to substantially expand the diversity of contributors and viewpoints in the <i>Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal</i></a>.

(By \"we\" I mean typical highly educated, middle-class people in Western democracies.) <b> We might be committing morally grievous wrongs</b> -- atrocities on par with the wrong that we now see in race-based slavery or the Holocaust or bloody wars of conquest -- <b>without (most of us) recognizing how morally terrible we're being.</b><p>\n\nIn <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10214679985105858\">Facebook discussion</a>, Kian MW pointed me to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10677-015-9567-7\">a fascinating article</a> by Evan G. Williams, which makes a similar point and adds the further thought, bound to be attractive to many philosophers, that <b>the proper response to such a concern is to hire lots of philosophers</b>.<p>\n\nOkay, hiring lots of philosophers isn't the <i>only </i>remedy Williams suggests, and he doesn't phrase his recommendation in quite that way.  What he says with that we need to dedicate substantial societal resources to (1) identifying our moral wrongdoing and to (2) creating social structures to implement major changes in light of those moral discoveries.  Identifying our moral wrongdoing will require progress, Williams says, both in moral theory and in related applied fields.  (For example, progress in animal ethics requires progress both in moral theory and in relevant parts of biology.)  Williams' call for dedicating substantial resources toward making progress in moral theory <i>seems </i>like a call for society to hire many more philosophers, though I suppose there are a variety of ways that he could disavow that implication if he cared to do so.<p>\n\nThe annual U.S. military budget is about $700 billion.  Suppose that President Trump and his allies in Congress, inspired by Williams' article, decided to divert 2% of U.S military spending toward identifying our society's moral wrongdoing, with half of that 2% going to ethicists and the other half to other relevant disciplines.  Assuming that the annual cost of employing a philosopher is $150,000 (about half salary, about half benefits and indirect costs), the resulting <b>$7 billion could hire about 50,000 ethicists.</b><p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nat5KmrBiQM/W3R4WJCqE2I/AAAAAAAABAI/ZKxHsUxK9fMNn-du_e2GfinlxGV6EL3GACLcBGAs/s1600/EmptyChairsPhilosophy.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"357\" data-original-width=\"635\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nat5KmrBiQM/W3R4WJCqE2I/AAAAAAAABAI/ZKxHsUxK9fMNn-du_e2GfinlxGV6EL3GACLcBGAs/s320/EmptyChairsPhilosophy.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[With 50,000 more ethicists, <a href=\"http://observer.com/2017/07/why-the-us-doesnt-understand-chinese-thought-and-must-xenophobia-confucius-xo-jinping-higher-education/\">these empty chairs</a> could be filled!]<p>\n\nTwo percent of the military budget seems like a small expenditure to substantially reduce the risk that we unwittingly perpetrate the moral equivalent of institutionalized slavery or the Holocaust, don't you think?   A B2 bomber costs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit\">about $1-$2 billion</a>.  The U.S. government might want to consider a few bomber-for-philosopher swaps.<p>\n\nI write this partly in jest of course, but also partly seriously.  If society invested more in moral philosophy -- and it needn't be a whole lot more, compared to the size of military budgets -- and if society took the results of that investment seriously, giving its philosophers prestige, attention, and policy influence, we might be morally far better off as a people.<p>\n\nWe <i>might</i>.  But I also think about <b>the ancient Athenians, the ancient Chinese, and the early 20th-century Germans.</b>  Despite the flourishing of philosophy in these times and places, the cultures did not appear to avoid moral catastrophe: The ancient Athenians were slave-owners who engaged in military conquest and genocide (perhaps even more than their neighbors, if we're grading on a curve), the flourishing of philosophy in ancient China coincided with the moral catastrophe of the period of the Warring States, and the Germans perpetrated the Holocaust and helped initiate World War II (with some of the greatest philosophers, including Heidegger and Frege, on the nationalistic, anti-Semitic, political right).<p>\n\nNow maybe these societies would have produced even worse moral catastrophes if philosophers had not also been flourishing in them, but I see no particular reason to think so.  <b>If there's a correlation between the flourishing of philosophy and the perpetration of social evil, the relationship appears to be, if anything, <i>positive</i>.</b>  This observation fits with my general concerns about the <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-often-do-ethics-professors-call-their-mothers\">not-very-moral behavior of professional ethicists</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">philosophers' apparent skill at post-hoc rationalization</a>.<p>\n\nI'm not sure how skeptical to be.  I hesitate to suggest that a massive infusion of social capital into philosophical ethics <i>couldn't</i> have a large positive impact on the moral choices we as a society make.  It might be truly awesome and transformative, if done in the right way.

That's pretty high!  But a couple of measures suggest he might be even more important than number three.  In terms of appearance in philosophy abstracts, he might be number one.  Kant* appears 4370 times since 2010 in <a href=\"https://philindex.org/\">Philosophers Index</a> abstracts, compared to 2756 for Plato*, 3349 for Aristot*, 1096* for Hume*, 1545 for Nietzsch*, and 1110 for Marx*.  I've tried a bunch of names and found no one higher.<p>\n\nBut maybe the most striking measure of a philosopher's perceived importance is when philosophy departments advertise for specialists specifically in that person's work.  By this measure, Kant is the winner, hands-down.  Not even close!<p>\n\nHere's what I did: I searched <a href=\"https://philjobs.org/\">PhilJobs</a> -- currently the main resource for philosophy jobs in the Anglophone world -- for permanent or tenure-track positions posted from June 1, 2015 to June 18, 2018.  \"Kant*\" yields 30 ads (of 910 in the database), among which 17 contained \"Kant\" or \"Kantian\" in the line for \"Area of Specialization\".  One said \"excluding Kant\", so let's toss that one out, leaving 29 and 16.  Four were specifically asking for \"post-Kantian\" philosophy (which presumably excludes Kant, but it's testament to his influence that a historical period is referred to in this way), but most were advertising either for a Kant specialist (e.g., UNC Chapel Hill searched in AOS \"Kant's theoretical philosophy\") or Kant among other things (e.g., Notre Dame \"Kant and/or early modern\").  Where \"Kant\" was not in the AOS line, his name was either in the Area Of Competence line or somewhere in the body of the ad [note 1].<p>\n\nIn sum, the method above yields:</p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n<b>Kant: 29 total PhilJobs hits, 16 in AOS</b> (12 if you exclude \"post-Kantian\").<p>\n\nHere are some others:<p>\nPlato*: 3, 0.</p></p>\nAristot*: 2, 0.\nHume*: 1, 0.\nConfuc*: 1, 0.\nAquin*: 3, 1 (all Catholic universities).\nNietzsch*: 0, 0.\nMarx*: 5, 1. (4/5 Chinese universities).<p>\n\nAs I said, hands down.  Kant runs away with the title, Plato and Confucius shading their eyes in awe as they watch him zoom toward the horizon.<p>\n\nNote 1: If \"Kant\" was in the body of the ad, it was sometimes because the university was mentioning their department's strength in Kant rather than searching for someone in Kant, but for my purposes if a department is self-describing its strengths in that way, that's also a good signal of Kant's perceived importance, so I haven't excluded those cases.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kant_gemaelde_3.jpg\">image source</a>]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-perceived-importance-of-kant-as.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-06-20T09:16:00-07:00\">9:16 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=131584281550610522\" onclick=\"\">2\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, May 04, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3571320516603930570\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-rise-and-fall-of-philosophical.html\">The Rise and Fall of Philosophical Jargon</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>In 2010, I defined a <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/04/discussion-arcs.html\">discussion arc</a>, in philosophy, as a curve displaying the relative frequency at which a term or phrase appears among the abstracts of philosophical articles.  Since then, I've done a few analyses using discussion arcs, mostly searching for philosophers' names (<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/07/discussion-arcs-of-apa-presidents-from.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/04/heidegger-and-wittgenstein-break-away.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/05/rise-of-ethics-and-feminism.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-ghettoization-of-nietzsche.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/03/popular-persistence-of-fading.html\">here</a>).<p>\n\nToday I thought it would be fun to look at philosophical jargon -- its rise and fall, how much it varies over time, and as a measure of what is hot.  Maybe you'll find it fun too!<p>\n\nI rely on abstract searches in The Philosophers Index.  NGram is nifty, but it doesn't do well with trends specifically in academic philosophy (see <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/03/popular-persistence-of-fading.html\">here</a>).  JStor is interesting too, but it's a limited range of journals, especially for articles less than six years old.<p>\n\nFirst, I constructed a representative universe of articles (limiting the search to journal articles only): In this case, I searched for \"the\" in the abstracts, in five year intervals from 1940-present, except merging 1940-1949 for smoothness and a large enough sample.  Then I searched for target terms in abstracts in the same five-year intervals.  I constructed the curves by dividing the number of occurrences of the target term by the number of articles in the representative universe in each period.<p>\n\nSome topics and terms are perennial, rising and falling a little, but not in any dramatic way.  Others increase or decrease fairly steadily without a clear peak (allowing for some noisiness especially in the early data).  For example, here are the are the arcs for happiness, Kant*, and skepticism or scepticism (all three fairly steady), evolution* and democra* (both rising), and induction (falling):<p>\n\n(The asterisk is a truncation symbol; the y-axis is percentage of all abstracts containing the word.)<p>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-74wP6q5jLVE/WuySE_H0PuI/AAAAAAAAB-U/wys0zJZNEfIEWbcQcfxil3EbwDmfDcDyQCLcBGAs/s1600/Arc1d.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"589\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-74wP6q5jLVE/WuySE_H0PuI/AAAAAAAAB-U/wys0zJZNEfIEWbcQcfxil3EbwDmfDcDyQCLcBGAs/s400/Arc1d.jpg\" width=\"326\"/></a>\n[apologies for blurry image; click to enlarge and clarify]<p>\n\n(You thought happiness was more important to philosophers than Kant?  Wrong!)<p>\n\nOne way to measure how trendy or steady a topic is, is the ratio of percentage of discussion in its peak period, compared to its average discussion.  Exactly equal discussion over the whole period would yield a ratio of 1:1.  Fairly steady discussion with some noise would be 1 to 1.5.  Topics that rise and fall more substantially would be proportionally higher.  Call this the <b>Max/Average Ratio</b>.\n\nFor the six topics above, the Max/Average Ratios are:<p>\n<li>Kant*: 1.3</li>\n<li>happiness: 1.4</li>\n<li>skepticism or scepticism: 1.4</li>\n<li>evolution*: 1.5</li>\n<li>democra*: 2.0</li>\n<li>induction: 3.0</li><p>\n\nEvolution*, though it approximately triples over the period, has a Max/Average Ratio not too far from one.  Democra* rises from a substantially lower level of discussion than does evolution* and has a higher Max/Average Ratio.  Induction crashes down to about a sixth of its initial level of discussion (0.174% in the first four periods to 0.028% in the final two) -- hence its moderately large ratio.<p>\n\nNow let's consider some jargon terms that more clearly reflect hot topics.<p>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jQgd_mH7SjQ/WuySI37uQgI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/kBmlNyu0mxoXLRErCImiyBs8jownyTsdQCLcBGAs/s1600/Arc2b.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"620\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jQgd_mH7SjQ/WuySI37uQgI/AAAAAAAAB-Y/kBmlNyu0mxoXLRErCImiyBs8jownyTsdQCLcBGAs/s400/Arc2b.jpg\" width=\"310\"/></a><p>\n\nSince the scale is logarithmic, periods of zero incidence are not charted.  Also remember that logarithmic scales visually compress peaks relative to linear scales.  For example, though the decline of \"language of thought\" is not so visually striking, usage was in fact about seven times as much at peak as it is now.<p> \n\n\"Grue\" was introduced by Nelson Goodman to describe a puzzle about how we know the future in his \"New Riddle of Induction\" in 1955.  As you can see from the chart, discussion peaked 10-15 years later, in the late 1960s.  \"The original position\" was introduced by John Rawls in his 1971 <i>A Theory of Justice</i>, describing part of an idealized decision-making process, and discussion of it peaked in the late 1980s, about 15 years later.  \"Supervenience\" has a murkier origin, but was popularized in philosophy by R.M. Hare in 1952, to talk about how one set of properties might covary with another (for example the moral and the physical).  Discussion peaked about 40 years later in the early 1990s.  Hilary Putnam introduced \"Twin Earth\" (a planet with XYZ instead of water) in a thought experiment in 1975, and discussion peaked 15-20 years later in the early 1990s.  \"Radical interpretation\" was introduced by Donald Davidson in the early 1970s, peaking 15 years later in the late 1980s.  Finally, the \"language of thought\" was introduced by Jerry Fodor in his 1975 book of the same title, peaking 15-20 years later in the early 1990s.<p>\n<b>With the exception of supervenience </b>-- maybe partly because the concept took some time to transition from ethics to the metaphysics of mind -- <b>the pattern is remarkably consistent, with peaks about 15-20 years after a famous introduction event.</b> \n This pacing reminds me of my earlier research suggesting that <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/04/discussion-arcs.html\">individual philosophers tend to receive peak discussion around ages 55-70</a>, despite <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/05/at-what-age-do-philosophers-do-their.html\">producing their most influential work</a> on average about 20 years earlier (NB: the two data sets are only partly comparable, but I'm pretty sure the generalization is roughly true anyway).  This is the pace of philosophy.<p>\n\nFor these terms and phrases, the Max/Average Ratios are a bit higher than for the rising and falling topics sampled above:<p>\n<li>superven*: 2.7</li>\n<li>\"radical interpretation\": 3.4</li>\n<li>\"Twin Earth: 3.9</li>\n<li>\"the original position\": 4.2</li>\n<li>\"language of thought\": 4.6</li>\n<li>grue: 5.3</li><p>\n\nThe Max/Average Ratio, of course, doesn't really capture rising <i>and</i> falling; and the ratio will be inflated for more recently introduced terms, assuming virtually zero incidence before introduction.<p>\n\nFor a better measure of peakiness, we can <b>examine the ratio of the maximum discussion to the average discussion in the first two and final two time periods.</b>  To avoid infinite peakiness and overstating the peakiness of rare terms, I'll assume a floor level of discussion of .01% in any period.  Call this <b>Peakiness</b> with a capital P.  Five of the six topics in the first group have a Peakiness between 1.3 and 2.0, and evolution* has 2.9.<p>\n\nIn contrast:<p>\n<li>superven*: 3.8</li>\n<li>\"Twin Earth\": 4.7</li>\n<li>\"radical interpretation\": 6.3</li>\n<li>\"the original position\": 8.4</li>\n<li>\"language of thought\": 8.8</li>\n<li>grue: 50.6</li><p>\n\nGrue was <i>hot!</i>  Although its peak discussion was about the same as superven*, it has crashed far worse -- or at least it has, <i>so far</i>.  If we had a longer time period to play with, we could try to make the analyses more temporally stable by sampling a window of 50 years before and after peak, thus giving superven* more of a fair chance to finish its crash, as it were.<p>\n\nOkay, how about newer jargon?  Let's try a few.  I guess first I should say that jargon is wonderful and valuable, and I actually love the grue and Twin Earth thought experiments.  Also some jargon becomes a permanent part of the discipline -- such as \"dualism\" and \"secondary qualities\".  Maybe grue and Twin Earth will also prove in the long run to be permanent valuable contributions to the philosopher's toolbox, just in a lower-key way than back when they were hot topics.  I don't really mean \"jargon\" as a term of abuse.<p>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pq5tA83c7L4/WuySNm7j2II/AAAAAAAAB-c/bXEl6JdsQ8suL47-KbOJRk9bPcCJzkO8QCLcBGAs/s1600/Arc3a.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"578\" data-original-width=\"481\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pq5tA83c7L4/WuySNm7j2II/AAAAAAAAB-c/bXEl6JdsQ8suL47-KbOJRk9bPcCJzkO8QCLcBGAs/s400/Arc3a.jpg\" width=\"333\"/></a><p>\n\nIn 1974, Robert Kirk introduced \"zombies\" in the philosophical sense (entities physically indistinguishable from people but with no conscious experience), but usage didn't really take off until they got discussion in several articles in <i>Journal of Consciousness Studies</i> in 1995 and in David Chalmers' influential <i>The Conscious Mind</i> in 1996.  Contrary to popular rumor, the zombie doesn't appear to be dead quite yet.  \"Epistemic injustice\" was introduced by Miranda Fricker in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  \"Virtue epistemology\" was introduced by Ernest Sosa in the early 1990s.  Fictionalism has a longer and more complicated <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism/#BriHisOve\">history</a> in logic and philosophy of math.<p>\n\nThe \"explanatory gap\" between physical or functional explanations and subjective conscious experience was introduced by Joseph Levine in 1983, but doesn't hit the abstracts until some papers of his in the early 1990s.  \"Experimental philosophy\" in its earlier uses refers to the early modern scientific work of Newton, Boyle, and others.  It's recent usage to refer to experimental work on folk intuitions about philosophical scenarios hits the abstracts all at once with five papers in 2007.  Consistently with my twenty-year hypothesis, of these, \"explanatory gap\" is the only one that shows signs of being past its peak (despite hopes expressed by some of my Facebook friends).  Maybe fictionalis* is running longer.<p>\n\nOkay, I can't resist trying a few more discussion arcs, just to see how they play out.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wfMb45a4OGY/WuySRBa1l2I/AAAAAAAAB-g/hoLB1Bn-h30rEM_WfGnpXT4DoY6qq8kPgCLcBGAs/s1600/Arc4b.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"588\" data-original-width=\"584\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wfMb45a4OGY/WuySRBa1l2I/AAAAAAAAB-g/hoLB1Bn-h30rEM_WfGnpXT4DoY6qq8kPgCLcBGAs/s400/Arc4b.jpg\" width=\"397\"/></a><p>\n\n\"Possible worlds\" goes back at least to Leibniz, but its first appearance in the abstracts was by Saul Kripke in a 1959 article.  It peaks at 2.0% in the late 1960s, but has enduring popularity (currently 0.4%).  \"Sense data\" as the objects of perception was introduced in the early 20th century by G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell and has lots of discussion in the beginning of this dataset (1.7%), crashing down to levels appropriate to a historical relic (0.02%).  \"Qualia\" has a couple occurrences early in the abstracts and traces back to C.S. Peirce in the 19th century, then hits the abstracts again with an article by Sydney Shoemaker in 1975, peaking in the late 1990s.<p>\n\nSupererogation (morally good acts beyond what is morally required) entered modern discussion in the late 1950s and early 1960s (first hitting the abstracts with Joel Feinberg in 1961), then peaked in the late 1980s -- but it looks like it might be staging a comeback?  Wittgenstein introduced the idea of the \"language game\" in his posthumous <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> (1953), with discussion peaking in the late 1970s.  Thomas Nagel introduced \"moral luck\" in a classic 1979 article, and although it peaked in the late 2000s, it hasn't yet declined much from that peak.<p>\n\nPossible worlds has the highest Peakiness of the lot -- though nothing like grue -- at 8.4.  \"Language game\" is next at 5.1.  The rest aren't very Peaky, ranging from 2.1 to 2.9.<p>\n\nI've spent more hours this week doing this than I probably should have, given all my other commitments -- but there's something almost meditative about data-gathering, and the arcs yield a perspective I appreciate on the historical brevity of philosophical trends.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-rise-and-fall-of-philosophical.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-05-04T11:04:00-07:00\">11:04 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3571320516603930570\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy?updated-max=2018-05-04T11:04:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=13&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/women-have-been-earning-30-34-of.html\">32% of Philosophy Bachelor's degree recipients</a> in the U.S., <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/WomenInPhil.htm\">about 29% of Philosophy PhD recipients</a>, and about 20-25% of philosophy faculty. (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1527-2001.2012.01306.x\">Paxton et al 2012</a>; <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/WomenInPhil.htm\">Schwitzgebel and Jennings 2017</a>).  It is sometimes suggested that the relatively low percentage of women faculty in philosophy explains the relatively low percentage of women who major in philosophy (which then in turn explains the relatively low percentage of women who become the next generation of philosophy faculty).<p>\n\nI was curious whether philosophy departments with a relatively high percentage of women faculty would also have a relatively high percentage of students who are women.  Maybe departments with more women faculty are more \"woman friendly\", with a visible effect on the proportion of women who complete the Bachelor's or PhD?<p>\n\nPaxton et al. 2012 provide some evidence of a relationship between departments' proportion of women faculty, women undergraduates, and women graduate students.  In a sample of 49 departments, they found a substantial correlation between the percent of women faculty and the percent of undergraduate philosophy majors who are women (r = .45, p = .012). However, in a similar sample of 31 departments, they did not report finding such a correlation between percent of faculty who are women and percent of PhD students who are women.<p>\n\nThere are a few limitations in the Paxton et al. study.  First, thirty-one departments is a somewhat small number for such an analysis, yielding only limited statistical power to detect medium-sized correlations (note that with 49 departments in their undergraduate analysis, Paxton et al's p-value was greater than .01 despite a correlation of .45).  Second, the sample of departments might be unrepresentative.  And third, the proportion of women who <i>complete </i>the PhD might be a better measure of women-friendliness or women's success than proportion enrolled in the PhD program, since a substantial proportion of philosophy PhD students do not complete their degrees (in many departments completion rates are around 50%) and (anecdotally) non-completion rates might be higher for women than men (I welcome pointers to systematic data on this).<p>\n\nFor these reasons, I decided to examine whether in a larger sample of PhD-granting philosophy departments in the U.S., the percent of women faculty would correlate with the percent of women completing the PhD.<p>\n\nFor the data on students, I relied on the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data\">IPEDS database</a> from the National Center for Educational Statistics, using an eight-year time frame from the academic year 2009-2010 to 2016-2017.  For faculty, I used Julie Van Camp's counts of women faculty and total faculty in 97 doctoral programs in the U.S. from January 2006 and January 2015, as recovered through the Wayback Machine Internet Archive.  (These 97 programs produce about 95% of the Philosophy PhDs in the U.S.  ETA: This includes tenured and tenure-track faculty only.)  For each department women faculty percentage score, I averaged the percentage of women faculty in 2006 and in 2015 to reduce noise due to temporary gains and losses.  (My own department, for example, had 2/17 [12%] women faculty in 2006 and 4/19 [24%] in 2015, and is probably better represented by 18% than by either the higher or the lower number.)<p>\n<b>Overall, women were 20% of faculty in 2006 (340/1669) and 25% of faculty in 2015 (442/1755)</b>, a statistically significant increase (z = 3.4, p = .001).  Although 20% to 25% may not sound like much, it is actually quite remarkable for such a short period.  The faculty growth between 2006 and 2015 in this set of universities was only 86 positions (from 1669 to 1755 total faculty), while the growth of women faculty was 102 positions.<p>\n\nThe pattern in undergraduate Bachelor's degree completions in these same institutions is in some ways similar.  <b>Among these 97 institutions, the percentage of women earning BAs increased from 29% (1066/3618) to 34% (957/2787).</b>  This is statistically significant (z = 4.1, p &lt; .001), and intermediate years show a slow steady increase (30%, then 31%, then 32%).  However, it is possible that this is just a brief fluctuation in a long-term trend, in which <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/women-have-been-earning-30-34-of.html\">percentage of women among philosophy majors has held approximately steady at 30-34% since at least 1986</a>.  Also notable: While faculty numbers increased, graduating majors decreased (fitting with <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/sharp-declines-in-philosophy-history.html\">national trends across all university types</a>).<p>\n\nThe pattern in PhD completions is approximately flat over the period (fitting with results from the NSF <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/WomenInPhil.htm\">reported here</a>), fluctuating between 25% and 33% women -- coincidentally, 27% both at the beginning (100/372) and at the end (113/415) of the period.  However, with numbers this low, statistical power is an issue.<p>\n\nThe main question I was looking at was correlational: Do the universities with a higher proportion of women faculty tend to have a higher proportion of women completing their PhDs?  And the answer is...<p>\n\nYes!<p>\n\nHere it is as a chart:<p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zm9XARjtIuY/XHllA8mg9ZI/AAAAAAAABfQ/tbYFY00U4yMSoJfwKyR-IyQEnJivps_mACLcBGAs/s1600/WomenFacultyPhDs-190301.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"478\" data-original-width=\"711\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zm9XARjtIuY/XHllA8mg9ZI/AAAAAAAABfQ/tbYFY00U4yMSoJfwKyR-IyQEnJivps_mACLcBGAs/s400/WomenFacultyPhDs-190301.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n[apologies for blurry image: click to clarify and enlarge]<p>\n<b>The correlation is substantial r = .42 (p &lt; .001).  For example, although only 37 of the 97 universities had over 25% women faculty, all ten of the universities that had the highest proportion of women among their Philosophy PhD recipients did.</b><p>\n\nOddly, however, for Bachelor's degrees, I can find no relationship at all, with a correlation of r = -.01 (p = .96).  This result contrasts sharply with the Paxton et al. results, and I'm not sure what to make of it.  A follow-up study might look at a broader sample of undergraduate institutions to see what sort of relationship there is between percent of women faculty and percent of women undergraduates in philosophy and whether it might vary with institution type.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>"}

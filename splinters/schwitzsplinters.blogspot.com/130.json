My secret agenda is to undermine overly intellectualist views about belief and self-knowledge.\n\nAn episode of some sort occurs in your mind.  Let's say it's in inner speech: \"I should get started on that blog post\" or \"It fine for her to choose Irvine over Riverside\".  On the face of it, it's an assertion: It's not a question or a string of nonsense or a \"hmmmmm...\".  An episode of inner speech in the form of an assertion is, I will say, one type of assertoric thought.  (Assertoric thought needn't require inner speech if visual imagery or emotional reactions or imageless thoughts can do the same type of work; but let's set that issue aside for today.)  Inner speech of this sort can cross your mind without your judging or believing the content.  If I sing to myself \"She's buying a stairway to Heaven\", normally I don't at that same moment believe that anyone is actually buying a stairway to Heaven.  At other times, it seems that I do genuinely believe what I am saying to myself, with the inner speech somehow the vehicle of that belief: \"Uh oh, we're out of coffee!\"  The question is: What is present in the latter case that is absent in the former?\n\nOne possibility is a feeling of assent.  On this view, when \"out of coffee!\" comes to my mind, accompanying that inner speech is another type of experience, not in inner speech -- an experience of yes-this-is-true, or a feeling of confidence or correctness.  In contrast, when I'm singing along with Led Zeppelin, there's no such accompanying yes-this-is-true experience.\n\nAnother possibility, the one I prefer, is that the important difference is less in the phenomenology, that is, in some experiential difference between the two cases, than it is in type of cognitive traction the thought has.  Does the thought spin idly, so to speak, or does it penetrate into other aspects of your cognitive life?  I'd like to suggest that if the thought has one type of cognitive traction, it's a judgment.  And if the judgment has a certain type of further traction, you believe.  If the thought has little to no traction, it's a mere idle thought (or as I call it elsewhere, a \"wraith\" of judgment).\n\nIt seems to me phenomenologically plausible that at least sometimes we feel confidence when we speak silently to ourselves, and sometimes we feel doubt or skepticism or like we're just singing some words.  The same episode of inner speech \"She's buying a stairway\" can be experienced very differently, and this difference can have something to do with whether we really judge it to be so.  But for two reasons, I think it's a mistake to rely on these phenomenological differences in distinguishing between judgments and merely idle assertoric thoughts.\n\nFirst, even if there is sometimes a phenomenology of confidence or this-is-really-so-ness and sometimes a feeling of doubt or I'm-merely-singing, it is by no means clear that such epistemic phenomenology accompanies all of our inner speech or even most of it.  For example, in Russell Hurlburt's experience sampling studies, we don't see a lot of reports of this type of epistemic phenomenology.  Thinking back as best I can on my own stream of experience (some systematically sampled, but mostly not), it strikes me that such phenomenology would generally be subtle in most cases -- the kind of thing it would be easy for a theorist to miss or alternatively to invent given the difficulty of knowing such structural features of experience.  Such phenomenological criteria are, at best, a dubious theoretical foundation for such an important distinction.\n\nSecond, and maybe more importantly, what we should care about in making a distinction of this sort is not the existence, or not, of a feeling of confidence or some accompanying phenomenology of this-is-so.  What matters more is the role the thought plays in one's cognitive life.  That role is what the distinction between judgment and idle thinking ought to track.\n\nConsider the two examples I began with: \"I should get started on that blog post\" and \"It's fine for her to choose Irvine over Riverside\".  I say these to myself, perhaps with some feeling of that-is-so.  But then, maybe I don't start on the blog post.  I check Facebook instead, though there's no real need for me to do so.  Nor do I feel particularly bad about that, or torn.  The thought occurred, seemed in some sense right, but didn't penetrate further into my cognition or decision making.  Meanwhile, maybe, I remain miffed that she rejected Riverside for Irvine (I'm imagining here a graduate student or faculty member choosing to decline our offer of admission or hiring).  Probably I shouldn't be miffed.  It is fine!  People ought to choose what they think is best for them.  And yet... most of my cognition about the matter remains wrongly and irrationally hurt and resentful.  I'm trying to convince myself, but I haven't fully succeeded.\n\nWhat we do and should care about in distinguishing judgment from idle thought is the extent to which I have succeeded.  If, at least for that moment, my planning and thinking really is informed by my seeming-assessment that it's time to get started and that it's fine for her to choose Irvine, then that is what I have judged.  But if, as is sometimes the case, the thoughts don't really penetrate into the remainder of my cognitive life, don\u2019t guide other aspects of my reasoning and my posture toward the world, then it's probably best to regard them as mere idle thoughts, rather than genuine judgments, even if in some superficial way I feel sincere and this-is-so-ish when I say them to myself.  (On the metaphor of attitudes as postures toward the world, see my discussion here.)\n\nThat is how I would like to draw the distinction between judgment and idle thought.\n\nHow about belief?  Here I want to make a similar move, but at an expanded temporal scale.  We might sincerely judge something to be so in the sense that our related thoughts, and our general posture toward the world, are for a moment aligned toward the truth of that thing.  I really do, now that I think of it carefully, judge it to be fine for her to have made that choice.  Of course it's fine!  But the difference between a judgment and a belief is the difference between an occurrence and a steady-state thing.  A judgment happens in a moment; a belief endures, at least for a while.  The question is: Does the judgment stick? Does that momentary assessment have enough cognitive traction to change how I will feel about it next time I return to the question?  After the conscious thought vanishes, will it leave some sort of more durable trace in my cognitive structure?  Or it is here and gone?  Belief requires, I suggest, that more durable trace.\n\nOne way to think of it is this: A conscious thought is in a way a preparation for a judgment, and a judgment is in a way a preparation for a belief.  \"P\" bubbles up into your mind, for some reason.  If P finds the right kind of momentary home in your mind, if, at that moment, for the duration of its presence in the footlights of consciousness, it shifts or solidifies related aspects of your mentality, then it is a full-bodied judgment and not just an idle thought.  And if what it shifts and solidifies stays shifted and solidified after the judgment fades from consciousness, then that judgment has become a belief.\n\nBack to the secret agenda: If this is right, you cannot just read what you believe, or even what you currently judge, off of what you can introspectively discover, or what you say with a feeling of sincerity.  Genuine belief and judgment require penetration deeper into the springs of thought and action.  \n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nRelated:\n\n\"A Dispositional Approach to the Attitudes: Thinking Outside of the Belief Box\" (in Nottelmann, ed., New Essays on Belief, 2013).\n\n\"Do You Have Whole Herds of Swiftly Forgotten Microbeliefs?\" (Feb 1, 2019).

I'm trying to convince myself, but I haven't fully succeeded.<p>\n\nWhat we do and should care about in distinguishing judgment from idle thought is the extent to which I have succeeded.  If, at least for that moment, my planning and thinking really is informed by my seeming-assessment that it's time to get started and that it's fine for her to choose Irvine, then that is what I have judged.  But if, as is sometimes the case, the thoughts don't really penetrate into the remainder of my cognitive life, don\u2019t guide other aspects of my reasoning and my posture toward the world, then it's probably best to regard them as mere idle thoughts, rather than genuine judgments, even if in some superficial way I feel sincere and this-is-so-ish when I say them to myself.  (On the metaphor of attitudes as postures toward the world, see my discussion <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nThat is how I would like to draw the distinction between judgment and idle thought.<p>\n\nHow about belief?  Here I want to make a similar move, but at an expanded temporal scale.  We might sincerely judge something to be so in the sense that our related thoughts, and our general posture toward the world, are for a moment aligned toward the truth of that thing.  I really do, now that I think of it carefully, judge it to be fine for her to have made that choice.  Of course it's fine!  But the difference between a judgment and a belief is the difference between an occurrence and a steady-state thing.  A judgment happens in a moment; a belief endures, at least for a while.  The question is: Does the judgment stick? Does that momentary assessment have enough cognitive traction to change how I will feel about it next time I return to the question?  After the conscious thought vanishes, will it leave some sort of more durable trace in my cognitive structure?  Or it is here and gone?  Belief requires, I suggest, that more durable trace.<p>\n\nOne way to think of it is this: A conscious thought is in a way a preparation for a judgment, and a judgment is in a way a preparation for a belief.  \"P\" bubbles up into your mind, for some reason.  If P finds the right kind of momentary home in your mind, if, at that moment, for the duration of its presence in the footlights of consciousness, it shifts or solidifies related aspects of your mentality, then it is a full-bodied judgment and not just an idle thought.  And if what it shifts and solidifies stays shifted and solidified after the judgment fades from consciousness, then that judgment has become a belief.<p>\n\nBack to the secret agenda: If this is right, you cannot just read what you believe, or even what you currently judge, off of what you can introspectively discover, or what you say with a feeling of sincerity.  Genuine belief and judgment require penetration deeper into the springs of thought and action.<p>  \n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">A Dispositional Approach to the Attitudes: Thinking Outside of the Belief Box</a>\" (in Nottelmann, ed., New Essays on Belief, 2013).<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/02/do-you-have-whole-herds-of-swiftly.html\">Do You Have Whole Herds of Swiftly Forgotten Microbeliefs?</a>\" (Feb 1, 2019).

That seems unproblematic.  But do I believe (assuming I don't stop to explicitly think about it) that my desk chair will swivel to the left, as I push off with my right foot to reach for a book?  Driving to campus today, did I believe that the SUV approaching on the crossroad wouldn't blow through the red light?  Reaching into my box of Triscuits, do I believe that the inner plastic bag is folded over twice to the left and that I need to unfold it to the right to access the snacks inside, as I absentmindedly, but skillfully enough, do just that?<p>\n\nMany philosophers, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2023177\">following Donald Davidson</a>, hold that when you act intentionally, you must have beliefs about what you are doing -- beliefs that what you are doing will (or at least has a chance of) bringing about the event you want to bring about by doing that thing.  Intricacies bloom if you analyze the idea carefully (which is what makes it fun philosophy), but the basic thought is that when I intentionally flip the switch to turn on the light, I want to turn on the light and I believe that by flipping the switch I will do so.<p>\n\nBut those types of beliefs are about your actions and their effects -- not about the details of the world that shapes your actions.  It would be odd to think that you could intentionally act in the world without a broad range of beliefs about your environment, but it's much less clear <i>how much</i> you have to believe, that is, how fine-grained or detailed your beliefs need to be.  If I'm intentionally driving to work, I have to believe that I'm in my car.  Maybe I have to believe that this is the route to work (though absent-mindedly driving toward a bridge you know is closed is <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nous.12022\">a problem case</a> for this claim).  Probably I have to believe that the light is red, as I stop for it.  But do I have to believe that all four wheels of my car are currently touching the road?  Do I have to believe that the drivers nearby will stay in their lanes?  Do I believe that lightpost that I don't really notice, but certainly see, is right there?<p>\n\nHere are two extreme views:<p>\n<i>Restrictive View: I only believe what I explicitly reflect on.</i>  Unless the thought \"I am on the correct route to work\" actually bubbles up to consciousness, I don't really believe that.  Unless I specifically attend to the fact that I still have two arms, I don't believe that I do.<p>\n<i>Liberal View: I believe everything about the world that my skillful actions depend on.</i>  I believe that by shifting my weight such-and-so as I walk, I won't tip over.  I believe that my right forefinger now needs to come down a half inch from the Y to hit the H I am about to strike on the keyboard.  I believe that this patch of road is not yellow, and this patch, and this patch, for every patch of road that flies past my peripheral vision if it is the case (as it presumably is) that were one of those patches yellow I would steer slightly differently to give it a wider berth.<p>\n\nThe Restrictive view seems <i>too </i>restrictive -- at least on the standard Anglophone philosopher's understanding of \"belief\", according to which, belief is, to a first approximation, synonymous with a certain standard usage of \"think\" or \"thought\" -- not the active use (\"I am thinking of Triscuits\") but a more passive use (\"I thought there were Triscuits in the cupboard, honey?\").  I can truly say to a colleague \"I thought you were coming to the department meeting\", i.e., I believed that he was, even if I only assumed that he was coming and I didn't entertain the specific conscious thought \"Isaiah will be coming to the meeting\".  If knowledge of the fact that P requires believing that P, as most philosophers think (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KB.htm\">other than me</a>, but never mind that!), it seems that we can truly say \"I knew you wouldn't let me down\" even if the thought that you wouldn't let me down never explicitly came to mind -- perhaps <i>especially </i>if the thought that you wouldn't let me down never explicitly came to mind.<p>\n\nOn the other hand, the Liberal view seems too liberal.  Normally I can report my beliefs, if you ask, but I cannot report these.  (I might not even remember where the Y and the H are relative to each other, if you asked me when I didn't have a keyboard to look at.)  Normally, also, our beliefs can broadly inform our reasoning, but these cannot do so.  Although our habits and our fine-grained motor skills depend in some way on responsiveness to environmental details, whatever is guiding that responsiveness appears to be isolated to the execution of specific tasks rather that being generally available for cognition.<p>\n\nIf what I've said so far is right, the best view is somewhere in the middle, between the Restrictive and the Liberal.  But <i>where </i>in the middle?  Do we have whole herds of microbeliefs that guide our action -- and which we could report, perhaps, if asked that very split second -- but which are almost all swiftly forgotten?  Or are our beliefs more coarse-grained and durable than that -- the big-picture stuff that we are likely to remember for at least a minute or two?<p>\n\nHere's what I think: It's fine to talk either way, within broad limits, as long as you are consistent about it.<p>\n\nWhat's not fine, I'd suggest, is to commit to there being an ontologically or psychologically real sharp line, such that exactly this much availability and reportability and memory (or whatever), no more, no less, is what's necessary for belief.  What's not fine, I'd suggest, is the kind of industrial-grade realism that holds that there is a precise fact of the matter, if only we could know it, that I believe exactly P, Q, and R while I'm driving and not the ever-so-slightly-more-fine-grained T, U, and V.<p>\n\nI hope you find this assertion plausible, reflecting on the range of examples I've given.  If not, maybe I can strengthen my case by referring to other classes of phenomena where the boundaries of belief appear to be fuzzy (e.g., <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/its-not-just-one-thing-to-believe.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/do-you-have-infinitely-many-beliefs.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/In-Between.htm\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">here</a>).<p>\n\nIf I am right in denying this sharp line, that fact fits much more comfortably with <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">dispositionalism about belief</a>, which treats believing as a matter of matching, to a sufficient degree, a profile pattern of actions, thoughts, and reactions characteristic of that belief than it fits with a view on which believing requires that you possess discrete representations of P, Q, and R, which are always either discretely stored, or not stored, somewhere in the functional architecture of your mind.<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/do-you-have-infinitely-many-beliefs.html\">Do You Have Infinitely Many Beliefs about the Number of Planets?</a> (Oct 17, 2012)<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/its-not-just-one-thing-to-believe.html\">It's Not Just One Thing, to Believe There's a Gas Station on the Corner</a> (Feb 28, 2018)<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/In-Between.htm\">In-Between Believing</a> (<i>Philosophical Quarterly,</i> 2001)<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">A Phenomenal, Dispositional Account of Belief</a> (<i>Nous</i>, 2002).<p>\n<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">A Dispositional Approach to the Attitudes: Thinking Outside of the Belief Box</a>, in Nottelmann, ed., 2013.<p>\n\nAnd Daniel Dennett's classic <a href=\"https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-zenon-pylyshyn/class-info/FP2012/FP2012_readings/Dennett_RealPatterns.pdf\">Real Patterns</a> (<i>Journal of Philosophy</i>, 1991).<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pxhere.com/en/photo/167000\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/02/do-you-have-whole-herds-of-swiftly.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2019-02-01T07:56:00-08:00\">7:56 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5383731430158374364\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, July 30, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1548578932510867522\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/on-what-we-tell-pollsters.html\">On What We Tell Pollsters</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A1mlFzsiWL0/W162hdVKZhI/AAAAAAAAA_I/Q_IM4Jkj8IA7w0Ros94vgTUT1ms4n-b1gCLcBGAs/s1600/rainblown_mind_by_ace0fredspades-d6884yl.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"500\" data-original-width=\"363\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A1mlFzsiWL0/W162hdVKZhI/AAAAAAAAA_I/Q_IM4Jkj8IA7w0Ros94vgTUT1ms4n-b1gCLcBGAs/s320/rainblown_mind_by_ace0fredspades-d6884yl.gif\" width=\"232\"/></a></div><p>\n\n\nBarry Lam\u2019s podcast <a href=\"https://hiphination.org/\">Hi-Phi Nation</a> has a new episode on \u201cinformation silos\u201d and what we tell pollsters.  Partway through the episode, I am briefly interviewed about the nature of belief.<p>\n\nLam is always fun, and the episode has a few twists you might not expect.  One theme throughout the episode is a critique of the view generally accepted as implicit background in polling and in popular reports of poll results: <b>that people tell pollsters what they actually believe</b>.  Lam explores an empirical challenge to this and a more philosophical challenge.<p>\n\nEmpirical challenge: People who feel uncertain might answer by \"<a href=\"http://johnbullock.org/papers/partisanBiasInFactualBeliefs.pdf\">cheerleading</a>\" for their side, Republicans for example simply saying whatever they think will make Trump look good, Democrats saying whatever they think makes Trump look bad.  If this is going on, when the incentives are changed (for example by paying respondents for right answers, including a smaller payment for admitting that they don\u2019t know), they might instead reveal their true opinion.  Even if they are not uncertain, they might simply <a href=\"http://people.umass.edu/schaffne/Schaffner_Luks_POQ_forthcoming.pdf\">lie</a> to the pollster, saying what they plainly know to be false, to help or express support for their side.<p>\n\nA more philosophical challenge explores the question of what it is, really, to have a political, or politically loaded, belief.  On some questions, there might not be a single straightforward fact about what you believe, hidden in a \u201csecret compartment\u201d, which you choose either to reveal or not reveal to the pollster.  On climate change, or racial equality, or on what accommodations society owes to people with disabilities, you might be inclined to answer one way in one context or to one audience, and in quite a different way in another context or to another audience; you might wager thus-and-so when X is at stake, but quite differently when Y is at stake; your spontaneous reactions and your more guarded reactions might splinter in different directions; and so on.  Among all these various thoughts and reactions, there needn\u2019t be some privileged set that reflects your true belief while others are somehow misleading or inauthentic.<p>\n\nThat, at least, is <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">my view of belief</a>.  If you are sufficiently splintered, fragmented, or in-betweenish in your dispositional profile, then what you tell pollsters, even sincerely, will be only one element of a complicated picture.  If what you say is misaligned with some other aspects of your speech and behavior, you might be merely cheerleading or lying, but you needn\u2019t necessarily be.  You might be answering as sincerely as you can, with the fragment of you that is called forth at the moment.<p>\n\nFull episode <a href=\"https://hiphination.org/episodes/s2-episode-10-chamber-of-facts/\">here</a>.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/ace0fredspades/art/Rainblown-mind-376613661\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/on-what-we-tell-pollsters.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-07-30T00:11:00-07:00\">12:11 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1548578932510867522\" onclick=\"\">2\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/announcements\" rel=\"tag\">announcements</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, March 29, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6954498116281131339\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/help-me-choose-posts-for-my-next-book_29.html\">Help Me Choose Posts for My Next Book: Belief, Desire, and Self-Knowledge</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>As I've mentioned, MIT Press will be publishing a book of my selected blog posts and op-eds.  I've narrowed it down to a mere (!) 150 posts, in seven broad categories, and I'd love your input in helping me narrow it down more.\n\n<p>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LJ8HJ3C\">moral psychology</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NSY9M3D\">technology</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DPZJ638\">belief, desire, and self-knowledge</a> (live as of today)</li>\n<li>culture and humor</li>\n<li>cosmology, skepticism, and weird minds</li>\n<li>consciousness</li>\n<li>metaphilosophy and sociology of philosophy</li><p>\n\nEvery week I'll post a poll with about twenty posts or op-eds to rate, on one of those seven themes.  No need to rate all of the listed posts!  Just rate any posts or op-eds you remember.  Each poll will also contain links to the original posts and op-eds so you can refresh your memory if you want.<p>\n\nIt would be a great help if you could answer some of these polls -- if only just to click \"a favorite\" next to a few you remember fondly.

It wasn't her main point, and lots of philosophers say similar things, so I don't mean to criticize Camp specifically.  Philosophers who say this sort of thing usually treat it as an obvious background assumption -- and in so doing, they reveal that they have a fundamentally different picture than I do of how the mind works.<p>\n\nI'm not going to be able to quote Camp exactly, but <b>the idea was roughly this: If you and I both believe that there's a gas station on the corner, then we believe exactly the same thing.  That is, we believe <i>that there is a gas station on the corner</i>.</b>  Furthermore, this thing that we both believe is exactly the same thing that I convey to Nicholle when I then turn to her and say, while you nod, \"There is a gas station on the corner.\"<p>\n\nOf course, we might disagree about some related propositions.  Maybe I think it's a Shell and you think it's a Chevron.  Maybe I think that the corner is next to the freeway onramp and you think it's two blocks from the onramp.  But still, we are in perfect agreement about the particular proposition that there is a gas station on the corner.<p>\n\nSuppose that Nicholle is new to town and almost out of gas, and that's why the topic arose.  Now, plausibly, I might almost as easily have said \"There's a gas station over by the onramp\" or \"There's a Shell on the corner\" or \"There's a station -- maybe a Shell? -- just over that way [pointing]\" or \"I think you can get gas just down that road a bit\" or....  Quite a few things, some of which you would have agreed with, some you would have disagreed with (\"There's a Shell on the corner\"), and still others that would have been awkward in your mouth but with which you might not have exactly disagreed (... \"maybe a Shell\"...).<p>\n\nOn one view of the mind and of communication -- the view that seems to me implicit in Camp's remark -- there's a fact of the matter exactly which propositions about this topic I believe and which I don't (and maybe which I have some intermediate credence in).  All of the propositions that I might naturally have said (barring exaggeration, metaphor, misstep, etc.) are among the things I believe.  Quite a large number!  Somewhere on this large list is exactly the belief \"there is a gas station on the corner\"; and since that's what I ended up saying, that's the content I conveyed to Nicholle; and you, Nicholle, and I now share precisely this belief.<p>\n<b>One challenge for this picture, and maybe the first source of trouble, is determining which propositions should go on the \"yes I believe it\" list.</b>  It might have been inept of me, but not beyond the pale, to say \"Probably there's either a Shell or a 76, like, near that big blue building and the colorful sign with the flowers or is it cactus, you know, after that underpass we took on the way into campus, I think, if you were with us then?\"  Is that among the propositions I believe?  It gets even worse if we forget conversational pragmatics and focus simply on cognition or philosophy of mind.  Do I believe that there's a gas station less than 1 mile away, and less than 1.1 miles away, and less than 1.2 miles away, and... closer than Los Angeles and closer than where Saul Kripke probably lives, and farther than the parking lot, and farther than where Brianna (or was it Jordy?) accidentally left her laptop....  It looks like the list of propositions that I believe might be <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/do-you-have-infinitely-many-beliefs.html\">infinite and difficult to determine the boundaries of</a>.<p>\n<b>A second challenge is specifying the content of this proposition \"there's a gas station on the corner\" which you, Nicholle, and I supposedly all believe.</b>  Which states of affairs are such that this belief is true and which are such that it's false?  What counts as a \"gas station\"?  (What if there's a 7-11 with a single pump, or a single broken pump, or a single pump that is closed for construction, or a guy who illegally sells gas from a parked tanker truck?)  Which possible layouts of nearby streets are such that \"the corner\" determinately refers to the corner on which the gas station is located?  (What if one of us is wrong about the direction of the corner relative to us and the freeway?  What if there are two gas stations and three corners?)  If you, Nicholle, and I disagree about what would count as there being a gas station on the corner, do we not in fact have the same belief?  Or do we still have exactly the same belief but we're somehow wrong in our understanding of its satisfaction conditions?<p>\n\nA fine mess!  Now I don't really mind messes.  It's a messy world.  But our messy world demands a messy philosophy of mind and a messy philosophy of language -- and the fundamental problem with the view I'm criticizing is that it demands cleanliness: You and I believe exactly these things and exactly not these others; belief contents are precise, and shared, and delivered in sentence-sized packages.<p>\n<b>So here's the alternative picture I prefer.  You and I both have a wide range of dispositions to act, and reflect, and say things aloud to each other and silently to ourselves, concerning the presence or absence or location of that gas station or that Shell or whatever it is.</b>  For example, I'm disposed not to worry about whether it's possible to get gas nearby if the question arises; I feel like I know there's gas nearby.  Also, I'm disposed to say \"yes\" if someone asks if there's a Shell around.  If I wanted gas, I would drive a certain direction, and I'd feel surprise if it turned out badly.  I'm disposed to form certain visual imagery if asked about nearby gas stations, etc., etc.  You have a partially overlapping, partially divergent set of dispositions.  Like me, you are disposed to drive roughly that direction if you want to get gas; unlike me, you'd be surprised by the Shell sign.<p>\n\nOf course, I can't convey to Nicholle in three seconds this whole chaotic tangle which constitutes my belief state concerning that Shell station -- so <b>I choose some simplification of it to put into words, pragmatically focused on what I think is the most relevant thing</b>: \"There's a gas station on the corner\".  This isn't *exactly* what I believe.  Exactly what I believe is immensely complex, maybe infinitely so, and certainly beyond my ability to shape into a shareable linguistic package.<p>\n<b>You and I \"share\" the belief about the gas station in roughly the same way you and I might both share a personality trait.</b>  Maybe we're both extraverted.  But of course the exact shape of our extraversion differs in detail: We'd say yes to a somewhat different range of party invitations, we'd be gregarious and talkative in somewhat different ranges of situations.  To say we're both \"extraverted\" is blunt tool to get at a much more complex phenomenon beneath; but good enough for practical purposes, if we don't care about a high degree of precision.<p>\n<i>ETA 1:55 PM, Feb. 28:</i><p>\n\nElisabeth Camp and I had an email exchange about this post, which with her permission I've added to The Underblog <a href=\"https://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2018/02/here-im-posting-discussion-with.html\">here</a>.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">A Dispositional Approach to Attitudes: Thinking Outside of the Belief Box</a>\", in N.

This view is nicely articulated in (the simple versions of) the origin-myths of belief talk in the thought experiments of <a href=\"http://selfpace.uconn.edu/class/percep/SellarsEmpPhilMind.pdf\">Wilfrid Sellars</a> and <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-magic-prism-9780195313284\">Howard Wettstein</a>, according to which belief attribution mythologically evolves out of a practice of indirect quotation or imagining interior analogues of outward speech.<b> The other role is predicting and explaining (primarily) non-linguistic behavior</b> -- what a person will do, given their background desires (e.g. <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/intentional-stance\">Dennett 1987</a>; <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/psychosemantics\">Fodor 1987</a>; <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/do-apes-read-minds\">Andrews 2012</a>) .<p>\n\nWe might call the first role <i>testimonial</i>, the second <i>predictive-explanatory</i>.  In adult human beings, when all goes well, the two coincide.  You attribute to me the belief that class starts at 2 pm.  It is true both that I would say \"Class starts at 2 pm\" and that I would try to show up for class at 2 pm (assuming I want to attend class).<p>\n\nBut sometimes the two roles come apart.  For example, suppose that Ralph, a philosophy professor, sincerely endorses the statement \"women are just as intelligent as men\".  He will argue passionately and convincingly for that claim, appealing to scientific evidence, and emphasizing how it fits the egalitarian and feminist worldview he generally endorses.  And yet, in his day-to-day behavior Ralph tends not to assume that women are very intellectually capable.  It takes substantially more evidence, for example, to convince him of the intelligence of an essay or comment by a woman than a man.  When he interacts with cashiers, salespeople, mechanics, and doctors, he tends to assume less intelligence if they are women than if they are men.  And so forth.  (For more detailed discussion of these types of cases, see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ActBel.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PragBel.htm\">here</a>.)  Or consider Kennedy, who sincerely says that she believes money doesn't matter much, above a certain basic income, but whose choices and emotional reactions seem to tell a different story.  <b>When the two roles diverge, should belief attribution track the testimonial or the predictive-explanatory?</b>  Both?  Neither?<p>\n<b>Self-attributions of belief are typically testimonial.</b>  If we ask Ralph whether he believes that women and men are equally intelligent, he would presumably answer with an unqualified <i>yes</i>.  He can cite the evidence!  If he were to say that he doesn't really believe that, or that he only \"kind of\" believes it, or that he's ambivalent, or that only part of him believes it, he risks giving his conversational partner the wrong idea.  If he went into detail about his spontaneous reactions to people, he would probably be missing the point of the question.<p>\n<b>On the other hand, consider Ralph's wife.</b>  Ralph comes home from a long day, and he finds himself enthusiastically talking to his wife about the brilliant new first-year graduate students in his seminar -- Michael, Nestor, James, Kyle.  His wife asks, what about Valery and Svitlana? [names selected by <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/11/names-in-philosophical-examples.html\">this random procedure</a>]  Ah, Ralph says, they don't seem quite as promising, somehow.  His wife challenges him: Do you <i>really</i> believe that women and men are equally intelligent?  It sure doesn't seem that way, for all your fine, egalitarian talk!  Or consider what Valery and Svitlana might say, gossiping behind Ralph's back.  With some justice, they agree that he doesn't really believe that women and men are equally intelligent.  Or consider Ralph many years later.  Maybe after a long experience with brilliant women as colleagues and intellectual heroes, he has left his implicit prejudice behind.  Looking back on his earlier attitudes, his earlier evaluations and spontaneous assumptions, he can say: Back then, I didn't deep-down believe that women were just as smart as men.  Now I do believe that.  Not all belief attribution is testimonial.<p>\n<b>\nIt is a simplifying assumption in our talk of \"belief\" that these two roles of belief attribution -- the testimonial and the predictive-explanatory -- converge upon a single thing, what one <i>believes</i>.</b>  When that simplifying assumption breaks down, something has to give, and not all of our attributional practices can be preserved without modification.<p>\n\n[This post is adapted from Section 6 of my paper in draft, \"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PragBel.htm\">The Pragmatic Metaphysics of Belief</a>\"]<p>\n\n[HT: Janet Levin.]<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/MUTCD_W12-1.svg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/11/two-roles-for-belief-attribution.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-11-02T10:07:00-07:00\">10:07 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2566532885289639524\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, July 19, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5512893069195974917\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/07/why-i-evince-no-worry-about-super.html\">Why I Evince No Worry about Super-Spartans</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I'm a <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">dispositionalist about belief</a>.  <b>To believe that there is beer in the fridge is nothing more or less than to have a particular suite of dispositions.</b>  It is to be disposed, <i>ceteris paribus</i> (all else being equal, or normal, or absent countervailing forces), to behave in certain ways, to have certain conscious experiences, and to transition to related mental states.  It is to be disposed, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, to go to the fridge if one wants a beer, and to say yes if someone asks if there is beer in the fridge; to feel surprise should one open the fridge and find no beer, and to visually imagine your beer-filled fridge when you try to remember the contents of your kitchen; to be ready to infer that your Temperance League grandmother would have been disappointed in you, and to see nothing wrong with plans that will only succeed if there is beer in the fridge.  If you have enough dispositions of this sort, you believe that there is beer in the fridge.  There's nothing more to believing than that.  (Probably some sort of brain is required, but that's implementational detail.)<p>\n\nTo some people, <b>this sounds uncomfortably close to <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/#2\">logical behaviorism</a>, a view according to which all mental states can be analyzed in terms of behavioral dispositions.</b>  On such a view, to be in pain, for example, just is, logically or metaphysically, to be disposed to wince, groan, avoid the stimulus, and say things like \"I'm in pain\".  There's nothing more to pain than that.<p>\n\nIt is unclear whether any well-known philosopher was a logical behaviorist in this sense.  (<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/\">Gilbert Ryle</a>, the most cited example, was clearly not a logical behaviorist.  In fact, the concluding section of his seminal book <i>The Concept of Mind</i> is a critique of behaviorism.)<p>\n\nPart of the semi-mythical history of philosophy of mind is that in the bad old days of the 1940s and 1950s, some philosophers were logical behaviorists of this sort; and that logical behaviorism was abandoned due to several fatal objections that were advanced in the 1950s and 1960s, including one objection by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam\">Hilary Putnam</a> that turned on the idea of super-spartans.  Some people have suggested that 21st-century dispositionalism about belief is subject to the same concerns.<p>\n\nPutnam asks us to \"engage in a little science fiction\":<p>\n<blockquote>Imagine a community of 'super-spartans' or 'super-stoics' -- a community <b>in which the adults have the ability to successfully suppress <i>all </i>involuntary pain behavior.</b>  They may, on occasion, admit that they feel pain, but always in pleasant well-modulated voices -- even if they are undergoing the agonies of the damned.  The do not wince, scream, flinch, sob, grit their teeth, clench their fists, exhibit beads of sweat, or otherwise act like people in pain or people suppressing their unconditioned responses associated with pain.  However, they do feel pain, and they dislike it (just as we do) (\"Brains and Behavior\", 1965, p. 9).</blockquote><p>\n\nHere is some archival footage I have discovered:<p>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AkTU3oQNIuU\" width=\"560\"></iframe><p>\n\nA couple of pages later, Putnam expands the thought experiment:<p>\n<blockquote>[L]et us undertake the task of trying to imagine a world in which there are not even pain <i>reports</i>.  I will call this world the 'X-world'.  In the X-world we have to deal with <b>'super-super-spartans'</b>.  <b>These have been super-spartans for so long, that they have begun to suppress even <i>talk </i>of pain.</b>  Of course, each individual X-worlder may have his private way of thinking about pain....  He may <i>think </i>to himself: 'This pain is intolerable.  If it goes on one minute longer I shall scream.  Oh No!  I mustn't do that!  That would disgrace my whole family...'  But X-worlders do not even admit to having pains\" (p. 11).</blockquote><p>\n\nPutnam concludes:\n\n<blockquote>\"If this last fantasy is not, in some disguised way, self-contradictory, then logical behaviourism is simply a mistake....  <b>From the statement 'X has a pain' by itself no behavioral statement follows -- not even a behavioural statement with a 'normally' or 'probably' in it.</b> (p. 11)</blockquote><p>\n\nPutnam's basic idea is pretty simple: If you're a good enough actor, you can behave as though you lack mental state X even if you have mental state X, and therefore any analysis of mental state X that posits a necessary connection between mentality and behavior is doomed.<p>\n\nNow I don't think this objection should have particularly worried any logical behaviorists (if any existed), much less actual philosophers sometimes falsely called behaviorists such as Ryle, and still less 21st-century dispositionalists like me.  Its influence, I suspect, has more to do with how it conveniently disposes of what was, even in 1965, only a straw man.<p>\n<b>We can see the flaw in the argument by considering parallel cases of other types of properties for which a dispositional analysis is highly plausible, and noting how it seems to apply equally well to them.</b>  Consider solubility in water.  To say of an object that it is soluble in water is to say that it is apt to dissolve when immersed in water.  Being water-soluble is a dispositional property, if anything is.<p>\n\nImagine now a planet in which there is only one small patch of water.  The inhabitants of that planet -- call it PureWater -- guard that patch jealously with the aim of keeping it pure.  Toward this end, they have invented technologies so that normally soluable objects like sugar cubes will not dissolve when immersed in the water.  Some of these technologies are moderately low-tech membranes which automatically enclose objects as soon as they are immersed; others are higher-tech nano-processes, implemented by beams of radiation, that ensure that stray molecules departing from a soluble object are immediately knocked back to their original location.  <b>If Putnam's super-spartans objection is correct, then by parity of reasoning the hypothetical possibility of the planet PureWater would show that no dispositional analysis of solubility could be correct, even here on Earth.</b>  But that's the wrong conclusion.<p>\n<b>The problem with Putnam's argument is that, as any good dispositionalist will admit, dispositions only manifest <i>ceteris paribus</i> -- that is, under normal conditions, absent countervailing forces.</b>  (This has been especially clear since <a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198247044.001.0001/acprof-9780198247043\">Nancy Cartwright's influential 1983 book</a> on the centrality of <i>ceteris paribus</i> conditions to scientific generalizations, but Ryle knew it too.)  Putnam quickly mentions \"a behavioural statement with a 'normally' or 'probably' in it\", but he does not give the matter sufficient attention.  Super-super-spartans' intense desire not to reveal pain is a countervailing force, a defeater of the normality condition, like the technological efforts of the scientists of PureWater.  To use hypothetical super-super-spartans against a dispositional approach to pain is like saying that water-solubility isn't a dispositional property because there's a possible planet where soluble objects reliably fail to dissolve when immersed in water.<p>\n\nMost generalizations admit of exceptions.  Nerds wear glasses.  Dogs have four legs.  Extraverts like parties.  Dropped objects accelerate at 9.8 m/sec^2.  Predators eat prey.  Dispositional generalizations are no different.  This does not hinder their use in defining mental states, even if we imagine exceptional cases where the property is present but something dependably interferes with its manifesting in the standard way.<p>\n\nOf course, if some of the relevant dispositions are dispositions to have certain types of related conscious experiences (e.g., inner speech) and to transition to related mental states (e.g., in jumping to related conclusions), as both Ryle and I think, then the super-spartan objection is even less apt, because super-super-spartans do, by hypothesis, have <i>those</i> dispositions.  They manifest such internal dispositions when appropriate, and if they fail to manifest their pain in outward behavior that's because manifestation is prevented by an opposing force.<p>\n\n(PS: Just to be clear, I don't myself accept a dispositional account of pain, only of belief and other attitudes.)</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/07/why-i-evince-no-worry-about-super.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-07-19T13:33:00-07:00\">1:33 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5512893069195974917\" onclick=\"\">17\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, February 23, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4020671119022453617\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/02/belief-is-not-norm-of-assertion-but.html\">Belief Is Not a Norm of Assertion (but Knowledge Might Be)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Many philosophers have argued that you should only assert what you know to be the case (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2998423\">Williamson 1996</a>).  If you don't know that P is true, you shouldn't go around saying that P is true.  Furthermore, to assert what you don't know isn't just bad manners; it violates a constitutive norm, fundamental to what assertion is.  To accept this view is to accept what's sometimes called the <a href=\"http://www.iep.utm.edu/kn-norms/#H1\">Knowledge Norm of Assertion</a>.<p>\n\nMost philosophers also accept the view, standard in epistemology, that you cannot know something that you don't believe.  Knowing that P implies believing that P.  This is sometimes called the <a href=\"http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/knowbelieve.pdf\">Entailment Thesis</a>.  From the Knowledge Norm of Assertion and the Entailment Thesis, the <b>Belief Norm of Assertion</b> follows: <b>You shouldn't go around asserting what you don't believe.</b> Asserting what you don't believe violates one of the fundamental rules of the practice of assertion.<p>\n\nHowever, <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KB.htm\">I reject the Entailment Thesis</a>.  This leaves me room to <b>accept the Knowledge Norm of Assertion while rejecting the Belief Norm of Assertion.</b><p>\n\nHere's a plausible case, I think.<p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Juliet the implicit racist.</b>  Many White people in academia profess that all races are of equal intelligence. Juliet is one such person, a White philosophy professor. She has studied the matter more than most: She has critically examined the literature on racial differences in intelligence, and she \ufb01nds the case for racial equality compelling. She is prepared to argue coherently, sincerely, and vehemently for equality of intelligence and has argued the point repeatedly in the past.  When she considers the matter she feels entirely unambivalent.  And yet Juliet is systematically racist in most of her spontaneous reactions, her unguarded behavior, and her judgments about particular cases. When she gazes out on class the \ufb01rst day of each term, she can\u2019t help but think that some students look brighter than others \u2013 and to her, the Black students never look bright.  When a Black student makes an insightful comment or submits an excellent essay, she feels more surprise than she would were a White or Asian student to do so, even though her Black students make insightful comments and submit excellent essays at the same rate as the others. This bias affects her grading and the way she guides class discussion. She is similarly biased against Black non-students. When Juliet is on the hiring committee for a new of\ufb01ce manager, it won\u2019t seem to her that the Black applicants are the most intellectually capable, even if they are; or if she does become convinced of the intelligence of a Black applicant, it will have taken more evidence than if the applicant had been White (adapted from <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ActBel.htm\">Schwitzgebel 2010</a>, p. 532).</p></blockquote><p>\n\nDoes Juliet believe that all the races are equally intelligent?  On my <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PragBel.htm\">walk-the-walk view of belief</a>, Juliet is at best an in-between case -- not quite accurately describable as believing it, not quite accurately describable as failing to believe it.  (Compare: someone who is extraverted in most ways but introverted in a few ways might be not quite accurately describable as an extravert nor quite accurately describable as failing to be an extravert.) <b>Juliet <i>judges</i> the races to be equally intelligent, but that type of intellectual assent or affirmation is only one piece of what it is believe, and not the most important piece.</b>  More important is how you actually live your life, what you spontaneously assume, how you think and reason on the whole, including in your less reflective, unguarded moments.  Imagine two Black students talking about Juliet behind her back: \"For all her fine talk, she doesn't really believe that Black people are just as intelligent.\"<p>\n\nBut I do think that <b>Juliet can and should <i>assert</i> that all the races are intellectually equal.</b>  She has ample justification <i>for</i> believing it, and indeed I'd say she knows it to be the case.  If Timothy utters some racist nonsense, Juliet violates no important norm of assertion if she corrects Timothy by saying, \"No, the races are intellectually equal.  Here's the evidence....\"<p>\n\nSuppose Tim responds by saying something like, \"Hey, I know you don't really or fully believe that.  I've seen how to react to your Black students and others.\"  Juliet can rightly answer: \"<b>Those details of my particular psychology are irrelevant to the question</b>.  It is still the case that all the races are intellectually equal.\"  Juliet has failed to shape herself into someone who generally lives and thinks and reasons, on the whole, as someone who believes it, but this shouldn't compel her to silence or compel her to always add a self-undermining confessional qualification to such statements (\"P, but admittedly I don't live that way myself\").  If she wants, she can just baldly assert it without violating any norm constitutive of good assertion practice. <b> Her assertion has not <i>gone wrong</i></b> in a way that an assertion goes wrong if it is false or unjustified or intentionally misleading.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i0-fVQdoqKA/WK9PifIjAsI/AAAAAAAABxc/A7ZxBp7NcLcJ6kYeEu_ogwXoPqUebhLtwCLcB/s1600/Lackey%2527s%2BTeacher.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i0-fVQdoqKA/WK9PifIjAsI/AAAAAAAABxc/A7ZxBp7NcLcJ6kYeEu_ogwXoPqUebhLtwCLcB/s320/Lackey%2527s%2BTeacher.jpg\" width=\"237\"/></a></div><p>\n\nJennifer Lackey (2007) presents some related cases.  One is her well-known <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00664.x/abstract\">creationist teacher</a> case: <b>a fourth-grade teacher who knows the good scientific evidence for human evolution and teaches it to her students, despite accepting the truth of creationism personally as a matter of religious faith</b>.  Lackey uses this case to argue against the Knowledge Norm of Assertion, as well as (in passing) against a Belief Norm of Assertion, in favor of a Reasonable-To-Believe Norm of Assertion.<p>\n\nI like the creationist teacher case, but it's importantly different from the case of Juliet.  Juliet feels unambivalently committed to the truth of what she asserts; she feels no doubt; she confidently judges it to be so.  Lackey's creationist teacher is not naturally read as unambivalently committed to the evolutionary theory she asserts.  (Similarly for Lackey's other related examples.)<p>\n\nAlso, in presenting the case, Lackey appears to commit to the Entailment Thesis (p. 598: \"he does not believe, and hence does not know\").  Although it is minority opinion in the field, I think it's not outrageous to suggest that both Juliet and the creationist teacher <i>do</i> know the truth of what they assert (cf. the geocentrist in <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11098-012-0022-5\">Murray, Sytsma &amp; Livengood 2013</a>).  <b>If the creationist teacher knows but does not believe, then her case is not a counterexample to the Knowledge Norm of Assertion.</b><p>\n\nA related set of cases -- not quite the same, I think, and introducing further complications -- are <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/02/should-ethics-professors-be-held-to.html\">ethicists who espouse ethical views without being much motivated to try to govern their own behavior accordingly</a>.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.philpercs.com/2017/01/my-entry.html\">image from Helen De Cruz]</a></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/02/belief-is-not-norm-of-assertion-but.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-02-23T12:53:00-08:00\">12:53 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4020671119022453617\" onclick=\"\">12\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/epistemology\" rel=\"tag\">epistemology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">knowledge</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, November 09, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7680288533053294860\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/11/thought-for-day.html\">Thought for the Day</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>What you believe is not what you say you believe.

One can be disposed <i>to have</i> a certain conscious experience (e.g., disposed to experience a feeling of surprise if one were to see no beer), but dispositions and their manifestations are not metaphysically identical.  Oscar can be disposed to experience surprise if he were to see an empty fridge, even if he never actually sees an empty fridge and so never actually experiences surprise.<p>\n\nFrom these three claims <b>it follows that we cannot introspect attitudes such as belief and desire</b>.<p>\n<b>But it seems we <i>can </i>introspect them! </b> Right now, I'm craving a sip of coffee.  It seems like I am currently experiencing that desire in a directly introspectible way.  Or suppose I'm thinking aloud, in inner speech, \"X would be such a horrible president!\"  It seems like I can introspectively detect that belief, in all its passionate intensity, as it is occurs in my mind right now.<p>\n\nI don't want to deny this, exactly.  Instead, let me define relatively <i>strict </i>versus <i>permissive </i>conceptions of the targets of introspection.<p>\n\nTo warm up, consider a visual analogy: seeing an orange.  There the orange is, on the table.  You see it.  But do you really see the whole orange?  Speaking strictly, it might be better to say that you see the orange rind, or the part of the orange rind that is facing you, rather than the whole orange.  Arguably, you infer or assume that it's not just an empty rind, that it has a backside, that it has a juicy interior -- and usually that's a safe enough assumption.  It's reasonable to just say that you see the orange.  <b>In a relatively permissive sense, you see the whole orange; in a relatively strict sense you see only the facing part of the orange rind.</b><p>\n\nAnother example: From my office window I see the fire burning downtown.  Of course, I only see the smoke.  Even if I were to see the flames, in the strictest sense perhaps the visible light emitted from flames is only a contingent manifestation of the combustion process that truly constitutes a fire.  (Consider <a href=\"http://blog.chembark.com/2010/11/05/methanol-fires-are-invisible/\">invisible methanol fires</a>.)  More permissively, I see the fire when I see the smoke.  More strictly, I need to see the flames or maybe even (impossibly?) the combustion process itself.<p>\n\nNow consider psychological cases: In a relatively permissive sense, you see Sandra's anger.  In a stricter sense, you see her scowling face. <b> In a relatively permissive sense, you hear the shyness and social awkwardness in Shivani's voice.</b>  In a stricter sense you hear only her words and prosody.<p>\n\nTo be clear: I do not mean to imply that a stricter understanding of the targets of perception is more accurate or better than a more permissive understanding.  (Indeed, excessive strictness can collapse into absurdity: \"No, officer, I didn't see the stop sign.  Really, all I saw were patterns of light streaming through my vitreous humour!\")<p>\n<b>As anger can manifest in a scowl and as fire can manifest in smoke and visible flames, so also can attitudes manifest in conscious experience.</b>  The desire for coffee can manifest in a conscious experience that I would describe as an urge to take a sip; my attitude about X's candidacy can manifest in a momentary experience of inner speech.  In such cases, we can say that the attitudes present a <b><i>conscious face</i></b>.  If the conscious experience is distinctive enough to serve as an excellent sign of the real presence of the relevant dispositional structure constituting that attitude, then we can say that the attitude is (occurrently) conscious.<p>\n\nIt is important to my view that the conscious face of an attitude is not tantamount to the attitude itself, even if they normally co-occur.  If you have the conscious experience but not the underlying suite of relevant dispositions, you do not actually have the attitude.  (Let's bracket the question of whether such cases are realistically psychologically possible.)  Similarly, a scowl is not anger, smoke is not a fire, a rind is not an orange.<p>\n<b>Speaking relatively permissively, then, one can introspect an attitude by introspecting its conscious face</b>, much as I can see a whole orange by seeing the facing part of its rind and I can see a fire by seeing its smoke.  I rely upon the fact that the conscious experience wouldn't be there unless the whole dispositional structure were there.  If that reliance is justified and the attitude is really there, distinctively manifesting in that conscious experience, then I have successfully introspected it.  The exact metaphysical relationship between the strictly conceived target and the permissively conceived target is different among the various cases -- part-whole for the orange, cause-effect for the fire, and disposition-manifestation for the attitude -- but the general strategy is the same.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://ourbraggingwrites.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/just-an-orange-rind/\">image source</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/11/introspecting-attitude-by-introspecting.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-11-02T10:45:00-07:00\">10:45 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2407424397990888785\" onclick=\"\">14\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/attitudes\" rel=\"tag\">attitudes</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, October 27, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4284265335596167578\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/dispositionalism-vs-representationalism.html\">Dispositionalism vs Representationalism about Belief</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>The Monday before last, <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/\">Ned Block</a> and <a href=\"http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/philosophy/emandelbaum.htm\">Eric Mandelbaum</a> brought me into their <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/perception2016/\">philosophy grad seminar</a> at New York University to talk about belief.  Our views are pretty far apart, and I got pushback during class (and before class, and after class!) from a variety of directions.  But the issue that stuck with me most was the big-picture issue of <i>dispositionalism </i>vs <i>respresentationalism </i>about belief.<p>\n\nI'm a <b>dispositionalist</b>.  By this I mean that <b>to believe some particular proposition</b>, such as that your daughter is at school, <b>is nothing more or less than to be disposed toward certain patterns of behavior, conscious experience, and cognition, under a range of hypothetical conditions</b> -- for example, to be disposed to go to your daughter's school if you decide you want to meet her, to be disposed to feel surprise should you head home for lunch and find her waiting there, and to be disposed, if the question arises, to infer that her favorite backpack is also probably at the school (since she usually takes it with her).  All of these dispositions hold only \"ceteris paribus\" or \"all else being equal\" and one needn't have <i>all</i> of them to count as believing.  (For more details about my version of dispositionalism in particular, see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">here</a>.)  Crucial to the dispositionalist approach (but not unique to it) is the idea that <b>the implementational details don't matter -- or rather, they matter only derivatively.</b>  It doesn't matter if you've got a connectionist net in your head, or representations in the language of thought, or a billion little homonuculi whispering in thieves' cant, or an immaterial soul.  As long as you have the right clusters of behavioral, experiential, and cognitive dispositions, robustly, across a suitably broad range of hypothetical circumstances, you believe.<p>\n<b>On a representationalist view, implementation does matter.</b>  On a suitably modest view of what a \"representation\" is (I like <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/explaining-behavior\">Dretske's account</a>), the human mind uses representations.  For example, it's very plausible that neural activity in primary visual cortex is representational, if representations are states of a system that function to track or convey information about something else.  (In primary visual cortex, patterns of excitation in groups of neurons function to indicate geometrical features in various parts of the visual field.)  <b>The representationalist about belief commits to a general picture of the mind as a manipulator of representations, and then characterizes believing as a matter of having the right sort of representations</b> (e.g., one with the content \"my daughter it school\") <b>stored or activated in the right type of functional role in the mind</b> (for example, stored in memory and poised (if all goes well) to be activated in cognitive processing when you are asked, \"where is your daughter now?\").<p>\n\nI interpreted <i>some </i>of the pushback from Block, Mandelbaum, and their students as follows: \"Look, the best cognitive science employs a representational model of the mind.  So representations are real.  Even you don't deny that.  So if you want a truly scientific model of the mind instead of some vague dispositionalism that looks only at the effects or manifestations of real cognitive states, you should be a representationalist.\"<p>\n\nHow is a dispositionalist to reply to this concern?  I have three broad responses.<p>\n<b>The Implementational Response.</b>  The most concessive response (short of saying, \"oops, you're right!\") is to deny that there is any serious conflict between the two positions by allowing that the way one gets to have the dispositional profile constitutive of belief might be by manipulating representations in just the manner that the representationalist supposes.  <b>The views can be happily married!  You don't get to have the dispositional profile of a believer unless you already have right sort of representational architecture underneath</b>; and once you have the right sort of representational architecture underneath, you thereby acquire the relevant dispositional profile.  The views only diverge in marginal or hypothetical cases where representational architecture and dispositional profile come apart -- but maybe those cases don't matter too much.<p>\n\nHowever, I think that answer is too concessive, for a couple of reasons.<p>\n<b>The Messiness Response.</b>  Here's a too-simple hypothetical representationalist architecture for belief.  To believe that P (e.g., that my daughter is at school today) is to just to have a representation with the content P (\"my daughter is at school today\") stored somewhere in the mind, ready to be activated when it becomes relevant whether P is the case (e.g., I'm asked \"where is your daughter now?\").  One problem with this view is the problem of specifying the exact content.  I believe that the my daughter is at school today.  I also believe that my daughter is at JFK Elementary today.  I also believe that my daughter is at JFK Elementary now.  I also believe that Kate is at JFK Elementary now.  I also believe that Kate is in Ms. Salinas' class today.  This list could obviously be expanded considerably.  Do I literally have all of these representations stored separately?  Or is there only one representation stored, from which the others are swiftly derivable?  If so, which one?  How could we know?  This puzzle invites us to <b>reject the simplistic picture that believing P is a matter of having a stored representation with exactly the content P.</b>  But once we make this move, we open ourselves up to a certain kind of implementational <i> messiness</i> -- which is plausible anyway.  As we have seen in the two best-developed areas of cognitive science -- the cognitive science of memory and the cognitive science of vision -- the underlying architectural stories tend to be highly complex and tend not to map neatly onto our folk psychological categories.  Furthermore, viewed from an appropriately broad temporal perspective, scientific fashions come and go: We have this many memory systems, no we have this many; early visual processing is not much influenced by later processing, wait yes it is influenced, wait no it's not after all.  Dynamical systems, connectionist networks, patterns of looping activation can all be understood in terms of language-like representations, or no they can't, or maybe map-like representations or sensorimotor representations are better.  <b>Given the messiness and uncertainty of cognitive science, it is premature to commit to a thoroughly representationalist picture.</b>  Maybe someday we'll have all this figured out well enough so that we can say \"this architectural structure, this one, is what you have if you believe that your daughter is at school, we found it!\"  That would be exciting!  That day, I abandon dispositionalism.  Until then, I prefer to think of belief dispositionally rather than relying upon any particular architectural story, even as general an architectural story as representationalism.<p>\n<b>The What-We-Care-About Response.</b> <i>Why</i>, as philosophers, do we want an account of belief?  Presumably, it's because we care about predicting and explaining our behavior and our patterns of experience.  So let's suppose as much divergence as it's reasonable to suppose between patterns of experience and behavior and patterns of internal architecture.  Maybe we discover an alien species that has outward behavior and inner experiences virtually identical to our own but implemented very differently in the underlying architecture.  Or maybe we can imagine a human being whose actions and experiences, not only in her actual circumstances but also in a wide range of hypothetical circumstances, are just like that of someone who believes that P, but who lacks the usual underlying architecture.  On an architecture-driven account, it seems that we have to deny that these aliens or this person believes what they seem to believe; on a dispositional account, we get to say that they do believe what they seem to believe.  The latter seems preferable: <b>If what we care about in an account of belief is patterns of behavior and experience, then it makes sense to build an account of belief that prioritizes those patterns of behavior and experience as the primary thing, and treats purely architectural considerations as secondary.</b><p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n\nSome related posts and papers:<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">\nA Phenomenal, Dispositional Account of Belief</a> (<i>Nous </i>2002).<p>\n<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/\">Belief</a> (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2006 revised 2015).<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2008/11/mad-belief.html\">Mad Belief?</a> (blog post, Nov. 5, 2008).<p>\n<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">A Dispositional Approach to Attitudes: Thinking Outside of the Belief Box</a> (in Nottelmann, ed., <i>New Essays on Belief</i>, 2013).<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/against-intellectualism-about-belief.html\">Against Intellectualism About Belief</a> (blog post, July 31, 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PragBel.htm\">The Pragmatic Metaphysics of Belief</a> (essay in draft, October 2016).</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/dispositionalism-vs-representationalism.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-10-27T11:52:00-07:00\">11:52 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4284265335596167578\" onclick=\"\">17\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, September 28, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3869924146899106561\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/09/new-essay-in-draft-pragmatic.html\">New Essay in Draft: The Pragmatic Metaphysics of Belief</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Available <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PragBel.htm\">here</a>.<p>\n\nAs always, comments and criticisms welcome, either by email to my address or in the comments section on this post.<p>\n\nAbstract:<p>\n\nSuppose someone intellectually assents to a proposition but fails to act and react generally as though that proposition is true.  Does she believe the proposition?  <i>Intellectualist </i>approaches will say she does believe it.  They align belief with sincere, reflective judgment, downplaying the importance of habitual, spontaneous reaction and unreflective assumption.  <i>Broad-based</i> approaches, which do not privilege the intellectual and reflective over the spontaneous and habitual in matters of belief, will refrain from ascribing belief or treat it as an intermediate case.  Both views are viable, so it is open to us to choose which view to prefer on pragmatic grounds.  I argue that since \u201cbelief\u201d is a term of central importance in philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and epistemology, we should use it to label most important phenomenon in the vicinity that can plausibly answer to it.  The most important phenomenon in the vicinity is not our patterns of intellectual endorsement but rather our overall lived patterns of action and reaction.  Too intellectualist a view risks hiding the importance of lived behavior, especially when that behavior does not match our ideals and self-conception, inviting us to noxiously comfortable views of ourselves.<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PragBel.htm\">The Pragmatic Metaphysics of Belief</a> (in draft)\n<p>\n\n(I'll be giving a version of this paper as talk at USC on Friday, by the way.)<p>\n<i>Related Posts:<p></p></i>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/03/on-being-blameworthy-for-unwelcome.html\">On Being Blameworthy for Unwelcome Thoughts, Reactions, and Biases </a>(Mar 19, 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/against-intellectualism-about-belief.html\">Against Intellectualism about Belief</a> (Jul 31, 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/02/pragmatic-metaphysics.html\">Pragmatic Metaphysics</a> (Feb 11, 2016)\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/09/new-essay-in-draft-pragmatic.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-09-28T14:47:00-07:00\">2:47 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3869924146899106561\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, July 14, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6482753957765911430\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/07/wang-yangming-on-unity-of-knowing-and.html\">Wang Yangming on the Unity of Knowing and Acting</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UPr4Fa_zC7A/V4fFTdUucWI/AAAAAAAABcQ/7-XjMb7_j58ZbXI8qpMyi6DCOTck8OLbwCLcB/s1600/WangYangming.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UPr4Fa_zC7A/V4fFTdUucWI/AAAAAAAABcQ/7-XjMb7_j58ZbXI8qpMyi6DCOTck8OLbwCLcB/s200/WangYangming.jpg\" width=\"127\"/></a></div><p>\n\nI've been slowly acquainting myself with the later Chinese philosophical tradition.  <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wang-yangming/\">Wang Yangming</a> (1472-1529) is one of the striking figures -- a leading neo-Confucian scholar, as well as an important provincial administrator and military commander.  Perhaps his best-known thesis is the <i>unity of knowing and acting</i>:<p>\n<blockquote>There have never been people who know but do not act.  <b>Those who \"know\" but do not act simply do not yet know</b>....  Seeing a beautiful color is a case of knowing, while loving a beautiful color is a case of acting.  As soon as one sees that beautiful color, one naturally loves it.  It is not as if you first see it and only then, intentionally, you decide to love it....  The same is true when one says that someone knows filial piety or brotherly respect.  That person must already have acted with filial piety or brotherly respect before one can say she knows them.  One cannot say she knows filial piety or brotherly respect simply because she knows how to <i>say </i>something filial or brotherly (Ivanhoe 2009 trans., p. 140-141).</blockquote><p>\n\nContemporary readers might tend to find this claim implausible.  <b>Aren't we all familiar with weakness of will or willful wrong action in which we do something that we know we shouldn't</b> -- cheating on an exam, having the next drink, skipping out of a commitment to enjoy some time on the beach?  <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wang-yangming/#3\">Bryan Van Norden suggests</a> that the doctrine is intended as kind of pragmatically motivated overstatement to get bookworms out of their seats, and that the strongest plausible claim in the vicinity is the claim that knowing a moral truth implies at least being <i>motivated </i>to act on it, even if one doesn't ultimately act accordingly.  In contemporary Anglophone philosophy the view that moral judgments are necessarily motivating is called <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-motivation/#IntVExt\">motivational internalism</a>.<p>\n\nI find something attractive in Wang Yangming's doctrine, which I think doesn't quite map onto standard contemporary motivational internalist views.  The doctrine resonates with my <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">dispositional approach to belief</a>, according to which to believe some proposition is just to act and and react as though that proposition is true.  With some caveats, I might endorse <b>the unity of <i>believing </i>and acting</b>.<p>\n\nHere are the caveats:<p>\n\n1. <b>\"Action\" should be interpreted very broadly.</b>  Reaction is a kind of action.  Omission is a kind of action.  Thinking and feeling is a kind of action.  That's broader than standard use but I don't think outrageously broad.  The dispositions constitutive of believing that your parents deserve your care include not only dispositions to act in outwardly caring ways but also dispositions to react inwardly with concern if they are threatened and not to forget what is important to them.  If you don't generally act and react caringly, I'm inclined to say, you might <i>sincerely judge</i> that your parents deserve your care, and you might (in Wang Yangming's words) \"know how to <i>say </i>something filial\", but you don't fully possess the dispositional structure constitutive of believing that your parents deserve your care.  (If you fail in only a few respects it might still be accurate enough to say that you believe it, similarly to its being accurate enough to call someone an extravert who is mostly disposed to extraversion but who has introverted moments.)  <b>To believe something is, on my view, to live generally as though it is so.</b>  That's the sense of \"action\" in question.<p>\n\n2. <b>\"Belief\" differs from judgment and knowledge.</b>  A broad, action-based view of what is constitutive of belief only works if we also have a vocabulary for describing cases in which we sincerely verbally endorse something that we don't consistently act on.  I prefer the term \"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ActBel.htm\">judgment</a>\" for sincere endorsements.  Thus, on my view, you might<i> sincerely judge</i> that such-and-such is the case, but if you don't generally move through the world as if it were so, you don't fully, or deeply, or completely, or univocally <i>believe </i>it.  Similarly, I've argued (contra Wang Yangming), you can <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KB.htm\">know something without believing it</a> in this strong action-encompassing sense of \"belief\".<p>\n\n3. <b>We often choose <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/10/on-aiming-for-moral-mediocrity.html\">moral mediocrity</a>.</b>  We can rationally choose actions we believe are morally bad.  Morality is an important consideration for almost everyone, but we are often satisfied with far less than ideal moral behavior.  Compare valuing health: You can believe that kale is good for your health, and thoroughly live in recognition of that fact, without always choosing kale over brownies, because health is not always your paramount concern.<p>\n\nYou might see some tension between the third caveat and the surface interpretation of the doctrine.  If the child doesn't act and react in a filial way, maybe she still does fully and unambivalently believe that her parents deserve her care, but she chooses moral mediocrity on this matter?  Wouldn't that be a dissociation between believing and acting?<p>\n\nI do think such cases are possible, maybe even common, but that's not the kind of dissociation between believing and acting that I, and maybe Wang Yangming, want to deny.  Here's one way of articulating this type of case: You don't value moral goodness much but insofar as you value it you'll care for your parents if it isn't too much trouble.  That actually expresses your attitude toward filial duty; that's your belief as manifest in your actions.  This differs from the case of the bookish Confucian scholar who says \"I know and truly believe that filial duty is vastly more important than personal pleasures, but I just can't bring myself to act accordingly yet.\"  Wang Yangming wants to call bullfeathers on that sort of thing.  With more self-knowledge and honesty, this scholar might better say something like, \"Yes, intellectually and theoretically, I judge the Confucians correct in highly prioritizing filial duty; but I don't yet personally find myself believing that filial piety is so important -- not deeply, fully, and unambivalently in the way that I deeply, fully, and unambivalently believe that this is a quill in my hand and that I must eat to stay alive.\"<p>\n\nPhilosophers and others interested in the nature of attitudes can legitimately conceptualize belief in different ways.  But I think there are <b>practical advantages to accepting a broad-based notion of belief as constituted by the whole range of your choices and reactions, sharply distinguished from a more intellectual notion of judgment or sincere verbal endorsement</b> which need not be reflected in action.<p>\n\n(For more on the practical advantages of a broad, action-based view of belief, see \"<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/some-pragmatic-considerations-against.html\">Some Pragmatic Considerations Against Intellectualism about Belief</a>\"; April 7, 2016.)<p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.greatthoughtstreasury.com/author/wang-yang-ming-or-yangming-aka-wang-shouren-or-wang-shou-jen-courtesy-name-boan\">image source</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/07/wang-yangming-on-unity-of-knowing-and.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-07-14T13:12:00-07:00\">1:12 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6482753957765911430\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/chinese%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">chinese philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, April 07, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"620483018812779294\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/some-pragmatic-considerations-against.html\">Some Pragmatic Considerations Against Intellectualism about Belief</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wfDaxBcZtSc/VwaZDOsJ5cI/AAAAAAAABUM/0JTo-RJ7JUwHCiYPOncxDlcLBDHt9y01Q/s1600/trunkbranches.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wfDaxBcZtSc/VwaZDOsJ5cI/AAAAAAAABUM/0JTo-RJ7JUwHCiYPOncxDlcLBDHt9y01Q/s320/trunkbranches.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nConsider cases in which a person <i>sincerely endorses</i> some proposition (\"women are just as smart as men\", \"family is more important than work\", \"the working poor deserve as much respect as the financially well off\"), but often behaves in ways that fail to fit with that sincerely endorsed proposition (typically treats individual women as dumb, consistently prioritizes work time over family, sees nothing wrong in his or others' disrespectful behavior toward the working poor).  Call such cases \"dissonant cases\" of belief.  <b><i>Intellectualism</i> is the view that in dissonant cases the person genuinely believes the sincerely endorsed proposition, even if she fails to live accordingly.</b> <i>Broad-based views</i>, in contrast, treat belief as a matter of how you steer your way through the world generally.<p>\n\nDissonant cases of belief are, I think, \"antecedently unclear cases\" of the sort I discussed in <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/02/pragmatic-metaphysics.html\">this post</a> on pragmatic metaphysics.  The philosophical concept of belief is sufficiently vague or open-textured that <b>we can <i>choose </i>whether to embrace an account of belief that counts dissonant cases as cases of belief</b>, as intellectualism would do, or whether instead to embrace an account that counts them as cases of failure to believe or as <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/In-Between.htm\">in-between cases</a> that aren't quite classifiable either as believing or as failing to believe.<p>\n\nI offer the following pragmatic grounds for rejecting intellectualism in favor of a broad-based view.  My argument has a trunk and three branches.<p>\n\n--------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>The trunk argument</i>.<p>\n<i>Belief </i>is one of the most central and important concepts in all of philosophy.  It is central to philosophy of mind: Belief is the most commonly discussed of the \"propositional attitudes\".  It is central to philosophy of action, where it's standard to regard actions as arising from the interaction of beliefs, desires, and intentions.  It is central to epistemology, much of which concerns the conditions under which beliefs are justified or count as knowledge.  <b>A concept this important to philosophical thinking should be reserved for the most important thing in the vicinity that can plausibly answer to it.</b>  The most important thing in the vicinity is not our patterns of intellectual endorsement.  It is our overall patterns of action and reaction.  What we say matters, but what we do in general, how we live our lives through the world -- that matters even more.<p>\n\nConsider a case of implicit classism.  Daniel, for example, sincerely says that the working poor deserve equal respect, but in fact for the most part he treats them disrespectfully and doesn't find it jarring when others do so.  If we, as philosophers, choose describe Daniel as believing what he intellectually endorses, then we implicitly convey the idea that Daniel's patterns of intellectual endorsement are what matter most to philosophy: Daniel has the attitude that stands at the center of so much of epistemology, philosophy of action, and philosophy of mind.  If we instead describe Daniel as a mixed-up, in-betweenish, or even failing to believe what he intellectually endorses, we do not implicitly convey that intellectualist idea.<p>\n<i>Branch 1.</i><p>\n<b>Too intellectualist a view invites us to adopt noxiously comfortable opinions about ourselves.</b>  Suppose our implicit classist Daniel asks himself, \"Do I believe that the working poor deserve equal respect?\"  He notices that he is inclined sincerely to judge that they deserve equal respect.  Embracing intellectualism about belief, he concludes that he does believe they deserve equal respect.  He can say to himself, then, that he has the attitude that philosophers care about most \u2013 belief.  Maybe he lacks something else.  He lacks \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alief_(mental_state)\">alief</a>\" maybe, or the right habits, or something.  But based on how philosophers usually talk, you'd think that's kind of secondary.  Daniel can comfortably assume that he has the most important thing straightened out.  But of course he doesn't.<p>\n\nIntellectualist philosophers can deny that Daniel does have the most important thing straightened out.  They can say that how Daniel treats people matters more than what he intellectually endorses.  But if so, their choice of language mismatches their priorities.  If they want to say that the central issue of concern in philosophy is, or should be, how you act in general, then the most effective way to encourage others to join them in that thought is to build the importance of one's general patterns of action right into the foundational terms of the discipline.<p>\n<i>Branch 2.</i><p>\n<b>Too intellectualist a view hides our splintering dispositions.</b>  Here's another, maybe deeper, reason Daniel might find himself too comfortable: He might not even <i>think to look</i> at his overall patterns of behavior in evaluating what his attitude is toward the working poor.  In Branch 1, I assumed that Daniel knew that his spontaneous reactions were out of line, and he only devalued those spontaneous reactions, not thinking of them as central to the question of whether he believed.  But how would he come to know that his spontaneous reactions are out of line?  If he's a somewhat reflective, self-critical person, he might just happen to notice that fact about himself.  But an intellectualist view of the attitudes doesn\u2019t <i>encourage </i>him to notice that about himself.  It encourages Daniel, instead, to determine what his belief is by introspection of or reflection upon what he is disposed to sincerely say or accept.<p>\n\nIn contrast, a broad-based view of belief encourages Daniel to cast his eye more widely in thinking about what he believes.  In doing so, he might learn something important.  The broad-based approach brings our non-intellectual side forward into view while the intellectualist approach tends to hide that non-intellectual side.  Or at least it does so to the extent we are talking specifically about belief -- which is of course a large part of what philosophers do in fact actually talk about in philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and epistemology.<p>\n\nAnother way in which intellectualism hides our splintering dispositions is this: Suppose Suleyma has the same intellectual inclinations as Daniel but unlike Daniel her whole dispositional structure is egalitarian.  She really does, and quite thoroughly, have as much respect for the custodian as for the wealthy business-owner.  An intellectualist approach treats Daniel and Suleyma as the same in any domain where what matters is what one believes. They both count as believers, so now let's talk about how belief couples with desire to beget intentions, let's talk about whether their beliefs are justified, let's talk about what set of worlds makes their beliefs true -- for all these purposes, they are modeled in the same way.  The difference between them is obscured, unless additional effort is made to bring it to light.<p>\n\nYou might think Daniel's and Suleyma's differences don't matter too much.  They're worth hiding or eliding away or disregarding unless for some reason those differences become important.  If that's your view, then an intellectualist approach to belief is for you.  If on the other hand, you think their differences are crucially important in a way that ought to disallow treating them as equivalent in matters of belief, then an intellectualist view is not for you.  Of course, the differences matter for some purposes and not so much for other purposes.  The question is whether on balance it's better to put those differences in the foreground or to tuck them away as a nuance.<p>\n<i>Branch 3.<p></p></i>\n<b>Too intellectualist a view risks downgrading our responsibility. </b> It's a common idea in philosophy that we are responsible for our beliefs.  We don't choose our beliefs in any straightforward way, but if our beliefs don't align with the best evidence available to us we are epistemically blameworthy for that failure of alignment.  In contrast, our habits, spontaneous reactions, that sort of thing -- those are not in our control, at least not directly, and we are less blameworthy for them.  My true self, my \"real\" attitude, the being I most fundamentally am, the locus of my freedom and responsibility -- that's constituted by the aspects of myself that I consciously endorse upon reflection.  You can see how the intellectualist view of belief fits nicely with this.<p>\n\nI think that view is almost exactly backwards.  Our intellectual endorsements, when they don't align with our lived behavior, count for little.  They still count for something, but what matters more is how we spontaneously live our way through the world, how we actually treat the people we are with, the actual practical choices we make.  That is the \"real\" us.  And if Daniel says, however sincerely, that he is an egalitarian, but he doesn't live that way, I don't want to call him a straight-up egalitarian.  I don't want to excuse him by saying that his inegalitarian reactions are mere uncontrollable habit and not the real him.  It's easy to talk.  It's hard to change your life.  I don't want to let you off the hook for it in that way, and I don't want to let myself off the hook.  I don't want to say that I really believe and I am somehow kind of alienated from all my unlovely habits and reactions.  It's more appropriately condemnatory to say that my attitude, my belief state, is actually pretty mixed up.<p>\n\nIt's hard to live up to all the wonderful values and aspirations we intellectually endorse.  I am stunned by the breadth and diversity of our failures.  What we sincerely say we believe about ourselves and the people around us and how we actually spontaneously react to people and what we actually choose and do -- so often they are so far out of line with each other!  So I think we've got to have quite a lot of forgiveness and sympathy for our failures.  My empirical, normative, pragmatic conjecture is this: In an appropriate context of forgiveness and sympathy, the best way to frankly confront our regular failure to live up to our verbally espoused attitudes is to avoid placing intellectual endorsements too close to the center of philosophy.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/402790760397690236/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/some-pragmatic-considerations-against.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-04-07T11:12:00-07:00\">11:12 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=620483018812779294\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, September 14, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1104221453032425587\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/09/chinese-philosophy-intellectualism.html\">Chinese Philosophy &amp; Intellectualism about Belief</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Two separate announcements, not one.

Someone might sincerely say, for example, that women and men are equally intelligent, but be consistently sexist in his assessments of intelligence.  (See the literature on <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicit-bias/\">implicit bias</a>.)  Someone might sincerely say that her dear friend has gone to Heaven, while her emotional reactions don't at all fit with that.<p>\n<b>On <i>intellectualist</i> views of belief, what we really believe is the thing we sincerely endorse, despite any other seemingly contrary aspects of our psychology.</b>  On <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">the more <i>broad-based</i> view I prefer</a>, what you believe depends, instead, on how you act and react in a broad range of ways, and sincere endorsements are only one small part of the picture.<p>\n\nIntellectualism might be defended on four grounds.<p>\n\n(1.) <i>Intellectualism might be intuitive.</i>  Maybe the most natural or intuitive thing to say about the implicit sexism case is that the person really <i>believes</i> that women are just as smart; he just has trouble putting that belief into action.  The person really believes that her friend is in Heaven, but it's hard to avoid reacting emotionally as if her friend is ineradicably dead rather than just \"departed\".<p>\n\nReply: Sometimes we do seem to want to say that people believe what they intellectually endorse in cases like this, but I don't think our intuitions are univocal.  It can also seem natural or intuitive to say that the implicit sexist doesn't really or wholly or deep-down believe that the sexes are equal, and that the mourner maybe has more doubt about Heaven than she is willing to admit to herself.  So the intuitive case could go either way.<p>\n\n(2.) <i>Intellectualism might fit well with our theoretical conceptualization of belief.</i>  Maybe it's in the nature of belief to be responsive to evidence and deployable in reasoning.  And maybe only intellectually endorsed or endorsable states can play that cognitive role.  The implicit sexist's bias might be insufficiently responsive to evidence and insufficiently apt to be deployed in reasoning for it to qualify as belief, while her intellectual endorsement <i>is</i> responsive to evidence and deployable in reasoning.<p>\n\nReply: <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ucsb.edu/people/profiles/faculty/cvs/papers/Nature%20of%20Belief%20June%2007.pdf\">Zimmerman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pgrim.org/philosophersannual/pa28articles/gendleraliefbelief.pdf\">Gendler</a>, in influential essays, have nicely articulated versions of this defense of intellectualism [caveat: see Zimmerman's comment below].  I raised some objections <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ActBel.htm\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.jackmarleypayne.com/\">Jack Marley-Payne</a> has<a href=\"http://www.jackmarleypayne.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Against-Intellectualist-Theories-of-Belief.pdf\"> objected in more explicit detail</a>, so I won't elaborate in this post.  Marley-Payne's and my point is that people's implicit reactions <i>are</i> often sensitive to evidence and deployable in what looks like reasoning, while our intellectual endorsements are often resistant to evidence and rationally inert -- so at least it doesn't seem that there's a sharp difference in kind.<p>\n\n(It was Marley-Payne's essay that got me thinking about this post, I should say.  We'll be discussing it, also with <a href=\"http://www.keithfrankish.com/\">Keith Frankish</a>, in September for <a href=\"http://philosophyofbrains.com/minds-online-2015\">Minds Online 2015</a>.)<p>\n\n(3.) <i>Intellectualism about belief might cohere well with the conception of \"belief\" generally used in current Anglophone philosophy.</i>  Epistemologists commonly regard knowledge as a type of belief.  Philosophers of action commonly think of beliefs coupling with desires to form intentions.  Philosophers of language discuss the weird semantics of \"belief reports\" (such as \"Lois believes that Superman is strong\" and \"Lois believes that Clark Kent is not strong\").  Possibly, an intellectualist approach to belief fits best with existing work in these other areas of philosophy.<p>\n\nReply: I concede that something like intellectualism seems to be presupposed in much of the epistemological literature on knowledge and much of the philosophy-of-language literature on belief reports.  However, it's not clear that philosophy of action and moral psychology are intellectualistic.  Philosophy of action uses belief mainly to explain what people <i>do</i>, not what they <i>say</i>.  For example: Why did Ralph, the implicit sexist, reject Linda for the job?  Well, maybe because he wants to hire someone smart for the job and he doesn't think women are smart.  Why does the mourner feel sorry for the deceased?  Maybe because she doesn't completely accept that the deceased is in Heaven.<p>\n\nFurthermore, maybe coherence with intellectualist views of belief in epistemology and philosophy of language is a mistaken ideal and not in the best interest of the discipline as a whole.  For example, it could be that <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/12/freges-puzzle-and-in-between-cases-of.html\">a less intellectualist philosophy of mind, imported into philosophy of language, would help us better see our way through some famous puzzles about belief reports</a>.<p>\n\n(4.) <i>Intellectualism might be the best practical choice because of its effects on people's self-understanding.</i>  For example, it might be more effective, in reducing unjustified sexism, to say to an implicit sexist, \"I know you <i>believe</i> that women are just as smart, but look at all these spontaneous responses you have\" than to say \"I know you are <i>sincere</i> when you say women are just as smart, but it appears that you don't through-and-through <i>believe</i> it\".  <a href=\"http://pantheon.yale.edu/~tgendler/\">Tamar Gendler</a>, <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ucsb.edu/fac/aaron-zimmerman/\">Aaron Zimmerman</a>, and <a href=\"http://shaps.unimelb.edu.au/about/staff/dr-karen-jones\">Karen Jones</a> have all defended attribution of egalitarian beliefs partly on these grounds, in conversation with me.<p>\n\nReply: I don't doubt that Gendler, Zimmerman, and Jones are right that many people will react negatively to being told they don't entirely or fully possess all the handsome-sounding egalitarian and spiritual beliefs they think they have.  (Neither, would I say, do they entirely lack the handsome beliefs; these are <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/In-Between.htm\">\"in-between\" cases</a>.)  They'll react more positively, and be more open to rigorous self-examination perhaps, if you start on a positive note and coddle them a bit.  But I don't know if I want to coddle people in this way.  I'm not sure it's really the best thing in the long term.  There's something painfully salutary in thinking to yourself, \"Maybe deep down I don't entirely or thoroughly believe that women (or racial minorities, or...) are very smart.  Similarly, maybe my spiritual attitudes are also mixed up and multivocal.\"  This is a more profound kind of self-challenge, a fuller refusal to indulge in self-flattery.  It highlights the uncomfortable truth that our self-image is often ill-tuned to reality.<p>\n\n------------------------------------------<p>\n\nAlthough all four defenses of intellectualism have some merit, none is decisive.  This tangle of reasons leaves us in approximately a tie so far.  But we haven't yet come to...<p>\n<b>The most important reason to <i>reject</i> intellectualism about belief:</b><p>\n<blockquote><b>Given the central role of the term \"belief\" in philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, epistemology, and philosophy of language, we should reserve the term for the most <i>important</i> thing in the vicinity.</b></blockquote><p>\n\nBoth intellectualism and broad-based views have some grounding in ordinary and philosophical usage.  We are at liberty to choose between them.  Given that choice, we should prefer the account that picks out the aspect of our psychology that most deserves the central role that \"belief\" plays in philosophy and folk psychology.<p>\n\nWhat we sincerely say, what we intellectually endorse, is important.  But it is not as important as how we live our way through the world generally.  What I say about the intellectual equality of the sexes is important, but not as important as how I actually treat people.  My sincere endorsements of religious or atheistic attitudes are important, but they are only a small slice of my overall religiosity or lack of religiosity.<p>\n\nOn a broad-based view of belief, to believe that the sexes are equal, or that Heaven exists, or that snow is white, is to steer one's way through the world, in general, as though these propositions are true, not only to be disposed to say they are true.  It is this <i>overall</i> pattern of self-steering that we should care most about, and to which we should, if we can do so without violence, attach the philosophically important term \"belief\".<p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://javasoulnation.blogspot.com/2012/12/dialog-kosong.html\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/against-intellectualism-about-belief.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-07-31T09:07:00-07:00\">9:07 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5480617465755657090\" onclick=\"\">27\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief?updated-max=2015-07-31T09:07:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=16&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

My secret agenda is to undermine overly intellectualist views about belief and self-knowledge.<p>\n\nAn episode of some sort occurs in your mind.  Let's say it's in inner speech: \"I should get started on that blog post\" or \"It fine for her to choose Irvine over Riverside\".  On the face of it, it's an assertion: It's not a question or a string of nonsense or a \"hmmmmm...\".  An episode of inner speech in the form of an assertion is, I will say, one type of <i>assertoric thought</i>.  (Assertoric thought needn't require inner speech if visual imagery or emotional reactions or imageless thoughts can do the same type of work; but let's set that issue aside for today.)  Inner speech of this sort can cross your mind without your judging or believing the content.  If I sing to myself \"She's buying a stairway to Heaven\", normally I don't at that same moment believe that anyone is actually buying a stairway to Heaven.  At other times, it seems that I do genuinely believe what I am saying to myself, with the inner speech somehow the vehicle of that belief: \"Uh oh, we're out of coffee!\"  The question is: What is present in the latter case that is absent in the former?<p>\n\nOne possibility is a <i>feeling of assent</i>.  On this view, when \"out of coffee!\" comes to my mind, accompanying that inner speech is another type of experience, not in inner speech -- an experience of yes-this-is-true, or a feeling of confidence or correctness.  In contrast, when I'm singing along with Led Zeppelin, there's no such accompanying yes-this-is-true experience.<p>\n\nAnother possibility, the one I prefer, is that the important difference is less in the phenomenology, that is, in some experiential difference between the two cases, than it is in type of <i>cognitive traction </i>the thought has.  Does the thought spin idly, so to speak, or does it penetrate into other aspects of your cognitive life?  I'd like to suggest that if the thought has one type of cognitive traction, it's a judgment.  And if the judgment has a certain type of further traction, you believe.  If the thought has little to no traction, it's a mere idle thought (or as I call it <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KnowOwnBel.htm\">elsewhere</a>, a \"wraith\" of judgment).<p>\n\nIt seems to me phenomenologically plausible that at least sometimes we feel confidence when we speak silently to ourselves, and sometimes we feel doubt or skepticism or like we're just singing some words.  The same episode of inner speech \"She's buying a stairway\" can be experienced very differently, and this difference can have something to do with whether we really judge it to be so.  But for two reasons, I think it's a mistake to rely on these phenomenological differences in distinguishing between judgments and merely idle assertoric thoughts.<p>\n\nFirst, even if there is sometimes a phenomenology of confidence or this-is-really-so-ness and sometimes a feeling of doubt or I'm-merely-singing, it is by no means clear that such epistemic phenomenology accompanies all of our inner speech or even most of it.  For example, in Russell Hurlburt's <a href=\"http://hurlburt.faculty.unlv.edu//sampling.html#ipie\">experience sampling studies</a>, we don't see a lot of reports of this type of epistemic phenomenology.  Thinking back as best I can on my own stream of experience (some systematically sampled, but mostly not), it strikes me that such phenomenology would generally be subtle in most cases -- the kind of thing it would be easy for a theorist to miss or alternatively to invent given <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262525224\">the difficulty of knowing such structural features of experience</a>.  Such phenomenological criteria are, at best, a dubious theoretical foundation for such an important distinction.<p>\n\nSecond, and maybe more importantly, <i>what we should care about</i> in making a distinction of this sort is not the existence, or not, of a feeling of confidence or some accompanying phenomenology of this-is-so.  What matters more is the role the thought plays in one's cognitive life.  That role is what the distinction between judgment and idle thinking ought to track.<p>\n\nConsider the two examples I began with: \"I should get started on that blog post\" and \"It's fine for her to choose Irvine over Riverside\".  I say these to myself, perhaps with some feeling of that-is-so.  But then, maybe I don't start on the blog post.  I check Facebook instead, though there's no real need for me to do so.  Nor do I feel particularly bad about that, or torn.  The thought occurred, seemed in some sense right, but didn't penetrate further into my cognition or decision making.  Meanwhile, maybe, I remain miffed that she rejected Riverside for Irvine (I'm imagining here a graduate student or faculty member choosing to decline our offer of admission or hiring).  Probably I shouldn't be miffed.  It <i>is</i> fine!  People ought to choose what they think is best for them.  And yet... most of my cognition about the matter remains wrongly and irrationally hurt and resentful.  I'm trying to convince myself, but I haven't fully succeeded.<p>\n\nWhat we do and should care about in distinguishing judgment from idle thought is the extent to which I have succeeded.  If, at least for that moment, my planning and thinking really is informed by my seeming-assessment that it's time to get started and that it's fine for her to choose Irvine, then that is what I have judged.  But if, as is sometimes the case, the thoughts don't really penetrate into the remainder of my cognitive life, don\u2019t guide other aspects of my reasoning and my posture toward the world, then it's probably best to regard them as mere idle thoughts, rather than genuine judgments, even if in some superficial way I feel sincere and this-is-so-ish when I say them to myself.  (On the metaphor of attitudes as postures toward the world, see my discussion <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nThat is how I would like to draw the distinction between judgment and idle thought.<p>\n\nHow about belief?  Here I want to make a similar move, but at an expanded temporal scale.  We might sincerely judge something to be so in the sense that our related thoughts, and our general posture toward the world, are for a moment aligned toward the truth of that thing.  I really do, now that I think of it carefully, judge it to be fine for her to have made that choice.  Of course it's fine!  But the difference between a judgment and a belief is the difference between an occurrence and a steady-state thing.  A judgment happens in a moment; a belief endures, at least for a while.  The question is: Does the judgment stick? Does that momentary assessment have enough cognitive traction to change how I will feel about it next time I return to the question?  After the conscious thought vanishes, will it leave some sort of more durable trace in my cognitive structure?  Or it is here and gone?  Belief requires, I suggest, that more durable trace.<p>\n\nOne way to think of it is this: A conscious thought is in a way a preparation for a judgment, and a judgment is in a way a preparation for a belief.  \"P\" bubbles up into your mind, for some reason.  If P finds the right kind of momentary home in your mind, if, at that moment, for the duration of its presence in the footlights of consciousness, it shifts or solidifies related aspects of your mentality, then it is a full-bodied judgment and not just an idle thought.  And if what it shifts and solidifies stays shifted and solidified after the judgment fades from consciousness, then that judgment has become a belief.<p>\n\nBack to the secret agenda: If this is right, you cannot just read what you believe, or even what you currently judge, off of what you can introspectively discover, or what you say with a feeling of sincerity.  Genuine belief and judgment require penetration deeper into the springs of thought and action.<p>  \n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">A Dispositional Approach to the Attitudes: Thinking Outside of the Belief Box</a>\" (in Nottelmann, ed., New Essays on Belief, 2013).<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/02/do-you-have-whole-herds-of-swiftly.html\">Do You Have Whole Herds of Swiftly Forgotten Microbeliefs?</a>\" (Feb 1, 2019).

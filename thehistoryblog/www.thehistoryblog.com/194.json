I\u2019ve been a loyal viewer since it was on YouTube and while the transition to television was a little awkward \u2014 a sketch on the short-lived Funny or Die HBO show \u2014 it has found its footing on Comedy Central and is now heading into its third season. \n In the first two seasons of the Comedy Central show, each episode revolved around a city as a unifying theme. Three comedians told a story each about, say, Detroit or New York City of Nashville, and it worked because hometown yarns are always good fun, and anyway history is so dense and rich that there\u2019s no chance of so broad a range as an entire city feeling limited. Still, I missed the theme shows of the olden days, so I was delighted to see a few of them in season two (First Ladies, American Music) and they\u2019re back this season. The first episode has a theme, in fact, the history of science, one of my favorite subtopics.  \n If you haven\u2019t seen it before, I envy you, because you can watch every episode of the first two seasons on Comedy Central\u2019s website with enthralled new eyes. The episodes are just over 20 minutes long, so you can totally marathon through all 18 of them in less than seven hours. I\u2019m not saying you should call in sick, but you should probably call in sick. Priorities, man. \n Drunk History co-creators Derek Waters and Jeremy Connor, were on a panel at this year\u2019 Comic-Con. Waters talks about the inception of the show \u2014 Otis Redding was involved \u2014 and how it took off, the processes of narration and reenactment, topics they thought would work but turned out to be buzzkills, ie, the Donner Party and serial killer H.H. Holmes. Fun fact: the first season they made narrators tell two stories which means they were drunk non-stop from 3:00 in the afternoon until after the wee hours of the next morning. Oh, and the narrators have to blow in a breathalyzer regularly throughout filming to ensure they are efficiently but not dangerously wasted. Guest stars this season include Octavia Spenser, Parker Posey, Will Ferrel, Josh Hartnett and Maya Rudolph. \n If you\u2019re a fan of the show, you\u2019ll wish the panel video were longer. More showing how the sausage is made! \n ** Embed removed due to stupid autoplay. Have a nice, quiet link instead. ** \n The follow-up Q&A is, alas, very brief, but it still manages to cover a couple of key questions I\u2019ve been curious about, most significantly how are the stories chosen and by whom.  \n ** Second embed also removed due to stupid autoplay.

The trove of previously unknown works came to light in September of 2010 when Pierre Le Guennec carried a suitcase full of them to the Picasso Administration to have them authenticated. His story was that either Picasso himself or his wife Jacqueline gave the art to Pierre as a gift for having installed a security system and done some other work around the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur estate. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Painting-of-a-hand.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38182\" height=\"159\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Painting-of-a-hand-200x159.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Painting-of-a-hand-200x159.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Painting-of-a-hand-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Painting-of-a-hand-430x342.jpg 430w\" title=\"Painting of a hand by Pablo Picasso, one of the works in the Le Guennec cache\" width=\"200\"/></a>Picasso\u2019s son Claude found this account unbelievable because while the artist was generous with his prolific work, he routinely signed and dated a piece before giving it to someone. There was certainly no precedent for Picasso handing over hundreds of random, unsigned pieces at one time. Claude pressed charges against the Le Guennecs for receipt of stolen goods.</p>\n<p>Pierre and Danielle gave different accounts of how they had acquired this multi-million dollar treasure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[On the stand Pierre] recalled that one day, in a corridor, Jacqueline Picasso had handed him a closed box containing the works, saying: \u201cHere, it\u2019s for you. Take it home.\u201d He said: \u201cThank you, madame\u201d and they never discussed it again. During the inquiry, Danielle Le Guennec had separately recalled a different version: that her husband came home with a stuffed rubbish bag, and told her Picasso had given the works to him when tidying his studio.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nu-Assis-Sitting-nude-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38181\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nu-Assis-Sitting-nude--120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nu-Assis-Sitting-nude--120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nu-Assis-Sitting-nude--200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nu-Assis-Sitting-nude--430x537.jpg 430w\" title=\"Nu Assis (Sitting nude)\" width=\"120\"/></a>Both stories strained credulity, as far as the Picasso heirs were concerned, and no clear answers were forthcoming in court. They do suspect that third parties may be involved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Picasso heirs\u2019 lawyer had suggested in court that the couple might have been manipulated by an art smuggling ring. Pierre Le Guennec had claimed that, despite knowing nothing about art, he had personally used books about Picasso to draw up an inventory that was found with the cache of 180 lithographs, collages and paintings and 91 drawings. But in court, lawyers cast doubt over whether he wrote the inventory himself. It contained a note about a similarity to a Picasso work at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art. But in court, Pierre Le Guennec seemed not to have ever heard of MoMA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The couple are in the 70s now and won\u2019t be going to jail. They were given a two-year suspended sentence and the collection will be returned to Picasso\u2019s heirs. The court made no determination as to who was responsible for the theft.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Retired electrician found guilty of holding stolen Picassos\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38177\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38177#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38155\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38155\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Herbert Hoover\u2019s World War I laces\">Herbert Hoover\u2019s World War I laces</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, August 29th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Herber-Hoover-heading-European-food-relief_1918.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38163\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Herber-Hoover-heading-European-food-relief_1918-95x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Herber-Hoover-heading-European-food-relief_1918-95x150.jpg 95w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Herber-Hoover-heading-European-food-relief_1918-191x300.jpg 191w\" title=\"Herbert Hoover ca. 1918\" width=\"95\"/></a>The Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of American History has a collection of <a href=\"http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/world-war-one-laces\" target=\"_blank\">beautiful Belgian laces made during World War I</a> at the behest of future President of the United States Herbert Hoover. Hoover\u2019s name is nowadays most commonly associated with the lack of relief for the destitute of the Great Depression \u2014 the notorious tent cities of the homeless and poverty-stricken were famously called Hoovervilles \u2014 but before he was president Herbert Hoover was actively involved in relief efforts. As <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30131\" target=\"_blank\">head of the Food Administration</a> under Woodrow Wilson, Hoover was in charge of the administration\u2019s food and fuel conservation programs during the war, but before that, when war first broke out in 1914, Hoover ran the Committee for Relief in Belgium (CRB) which organized the distribution of food supplies to ten million people in occupied Belgium.</p>\n<p>Hoover wasn\u2019t in government at the time. He wasn\u2019t even in the United States. He was living in London, a wealthy mining engineer and investor who <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/deremetallica00agri#page/n3/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">translated Renaissance mining tracts</a> with his wife Lou in his spare time. That translation is considered the standard for its clarity of language and extensive scholarly footnotes and is still in print today. He was drawn into relief work after World War I broke out and tens of thousands of American citizens suddenly found themselves stranded in London. Hoover organized a committee to get them back home and was so effective that in October of 1914 the U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James asked Hoover to take on a far more onerous job: keep all of Belgium from starving to death.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Belgium-Relief-Committee-poster.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38165\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 89px) 100vw, 89px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Belgium-Relief-Committee-poster-89x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Belgium-Relief-Committee-poster-89x150.jpg 89w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Belgium-Relief-Committee-poster-178x300.jpg 178w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Belgium-Relief-Committee-poster-430x721.jpg 430w\" title=\"Committee for Relief in Belgium poster\" width=\"89\"/></a>Belgium had been invaded by Germany at the start of the war and famine immediately became a very real prospect. The small country only produced enough food to supply 20-25% of the population, but whatever food was available was requisitioned by the occupiers to supply the troops. Britain put Germany and the occupied countries under blockade making food imports nigh on impossible. </p>\n<p>That was the Gordian knot Hoover had to cut through. He was able to arrange for the relief supplies to be shipped to Belgium where the CRB monitored their distribution by the Comit\u00e9 National de Secours et d\u2019Alimentation (CNSA), the Belgian organization dedicated to famine relief. The CRB personnel weren\u2019t just passing the time of the day. They had to be involved in every step of the distribution process because as occupied Belgians, CNSA personnel were legally bound to follow German orders. The primarily British and American CRB staff was under no such obligation. Their job was to ensure the food made it to Belgian plates and they did it well. The CRB raised funds, shipped 5.7 million tons  of donated food past Germany\u2019s unrestricted U-boat warfare and then literally fed Belgium from 1914 through 1919.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper-tag-for-lace.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38164\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper-tag-for-lace-e1440927730509-139x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper-tag-for-lace-e1440927730509-139x150.jpg 139w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper-tag-for-lace-e1440927730509-200x215.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper-tag-for-lace-e1440927730509-430x463.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Paper-tag-for-lace-e1440927730509.jpg 1300w\" title=\"Paper tag for CRB lace.

He also arranged for thread to be distributed to Belgian lace makers and for the sale of their finished lace to buyers in Allied countries. Belgium had been famous for its delicate handmade laces since the 17th century, and while industrialization and mass-production had hobbled the traditional craft, Queen Elisabeth of Belgium instituted promotional and improvement programs had helped spur a revival of interest in handmade lace just before World War I. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Belgian lace committees worked closely with the \u201cCommission for Relief of Belgium\u201d as the work on behalf of the lace makers became even more important during World War One. Several famous Belgian artists were enlisted to make new designs. Among them were Isidore de Rudder, his sister Maria de Rudder, Charles Michel, and Juliette Wytsman, who designed some of the War Laces that are now part of the collection at the National Museum of American History.</p>\n<p>World War One laces often included names of people, places, inscriptions, and dates; a characteristic not usually found in other lace work. The lace often incorporates the coats-of-arms or national symbols of the Allied Nations as well as the nine Belgian provinces in recognition of the help received. It was hoped that these distinguishing elements would appeal to generous people around the world who might buy these laces in support of the Belgian people. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cupid-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38166\" height=\"89\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cupid-det-150x89.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cupid-det-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cupid-det-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cupid-det-430x256.jpg 430w\" title=\"Augusta-Virginia Banner Panel, detail of cupids at center.

Eight of them date to 995 A.D.; the other six, three of which are fragments, were minted in 1018 A.D. Sihtric\u2019s coins are very rare discoveries on the British mainland. There are also fragments of three or four silver pennies from the reign of Cnut the Great, the Danish King of England who reigned from 985 or 995 through 1035. The Cnut coins were probably produced in the mint at Chester.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-silver-coin-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38150\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-silver-coin-2-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-silver-coin-2-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-silver-coin-2-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-silver-coin-2-430x430.jpg 430w\" title=\"Silver penny from Llandwrog hoard. Image by Robin Maggs, National Museum Wales.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Archaeologists believe the hoard was lost or buried between 1020 and 1030. The Bryn Maelgwyn hoard, unearthed in 1979 near Llandudno in Conwy, north Wales, was buried around that time \u2014 after 1024 \u2014 and it too contains coins minted by Cnut and Sihtric: 203 Cnut silver pennies and just two Sihtric silver pennies. The Bryn Maelgwyn coins are thought to have been Viking booty rather than a savings account, however, unlike the Llandwrog hoard. The weight of the ingots is 115.09 grams out of a total hoard weight of 127.77 grams. That means fully 90% of the weight of the hoard is in the ingots which suggests the hoard\u2019s main role was silver storage.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-hoard-ingots.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38149\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-hoard-ingots-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-hoard-ingots-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-hoard-ingots-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Llandwrog-hoard-ingots-430x315.jpg 430w\" title=\"Silver ingots. Image by Robin Maggs, National Museum Wales.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Dr Mark Redknap, Head of Collections and Research in the Department of History and Archaeology at the National Museum Wales said the find will help historians to form a picture of the eleventh century Gwynedd economy.</p>\n<p>He said: \u201cThere are three complete finger-shaped ingots and one fragmentary finger-shaped metal ingot. Nicking on the sides of the ingots is an intervention sometimes undertaken in ancient times to test purity, and evidence that they had been used in commercial transactions before burial.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least four hoards on the Isle of Man indicate that bullion retained an active role in the Manx economy from the 1030s to 1060s, and the mixed nature of the Llandwrog hoard falls into the same category. As such it amplifies the picture we are building up of the wealth and economy operating in the kingdom of Gwynedd in the eleventh century.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum Wales</a> is hoping to secure the hoard. The Bryn Maelgwyn hoard is at the Cardiff branch of the Nation Museum, so it would be in excellent company. First the valuation committee must decide the fair market value of the hoard. The museum will then try to raise the price, ideally through a Lottery Fund grant, which will be divided between the finder and the landowner.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Small but sweet Viking hoard declared treasure\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38146\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38146#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38126\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38126\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rossetti didn\u2019t paint Botticelli lady\u2019s hair red\">Rossetti didn\u2019t paint Botticelli lady\u2019s hair red</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, August 27th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_1470-85_by_Sandro_Botticelli_VA_London_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38127\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 91px) 100vw, 91px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_1470-85_by_Sandro_Botticelli_VA_London_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-91x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_1470-85_by_Sandro_Botticelli_VA_London_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-91x150.jpg 91w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_1470-85_by_Sandro_Botticelli_VA_London_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-182x300.jpg 182w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_1470-85_by_Sandro_Botticelli_VA_London_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-430x706.jpg 430w\" title='\"Portrait of a Lady known as Smeralda Bandinelli\" by Sandro Botticelli, c.1470-5.

The Lucille Ball hue of Smeralda\u2019s hair was long thought to be an alteration done by Rossetti after he bought the painting in 1867. Experts at the V&amp;A conserving the work for next year\u2019s<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-botticelli-reimagined/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Botticelli Reimagined</em></a> exhibition have discovered that the flaming red hair is original.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2011EU1795.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38136\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2011EU1795-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2011EU1795-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2011EU1795-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2011EU1795-430x573.jpg 430w\" title='\"Portrait of a Lady known as Smeralda Bandinelli\" before restoration.

In a letter dated three days after he bought the painting, Rossetti told his secretary \u201cI have been restoring the headdress, but don\u2019t mean to tell.\u201d The hair was thought to have suffered the brunt of Rossetti\u2019s sneaky intervention, but when V&amp;A conservators removed the top layer of discolored varnish, they saw that there were fewer layers of paint than they expected to find. Analysis of the paint confirmed it was tempera and that the red pigment of the hair was applied by Botticelli\u2019s hand. The only areas Rossetti appears to have retouched were some areas of the face and the cap.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_in_conservation_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38128\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_in_conservation_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_in_conservation_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_in_conservation_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_in_conservation_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-430x642.jpg 430w\" title='Curator clean tests \"Portrait of a Lady known as Smeralda Bandinelli\" by Sandro Botticelli, c.1470-5.

He drew incised lines on architectural features like the pillars, window framing and door which add depth and precision and help ensure the perspective looks accurate. For Smeralda\u2019s garment, Botticelli first used liquid sketching to rough out the clothing before covering it in a wash of paint with high carbon content to enhance the shading. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_during_cleaning_testing_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38129\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_during_cleaning_testing_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_during_cleaning_testing_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_during_cleaning_testing_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1._Portrait_of_a_Lady_known_as_Smeralda_Bandinelli_during_cleaning_testing_c_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_London-430x642.jpg 430w\" title='\"Portrait of a Lady known as Smeralda Bandinelli\" by Sandro Botticelli, c.1470-5, during cleaning testing.

The 19th century saw a gradual revival of appreciation for the Renaissance master, and the pre-Raphaelites played an important role in the reevaluation of Botticelli\u2019s significance. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Ruskin and Edward Burne-Jones collected Botticelli paintings and drawings, which goes to show how different the market was for his work back then. Rossetti paid \u00a320 for <em>Smeralda Bandinelli</em> (plus \u00a34 to have it professionally cleaned). When he sold it to collector Constantine Alexander Ionides just 15 years later, the sale price had leapt to \u00a3315. It hasn\u2019t been sold since and isn\u2019t likely to be ever again \u2014 Ionides included it in his bequest of 82 paintings <a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O17317/portrait-of-a-lady-known-painting-botticelli-sandro/\" target=\"_blank\">to the V&amp;A in 1901</a> \u2014 but Botticelli\u2019s <em>Rockefeller Madonna</em> set a record for the artist when it <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli-the-rockefeller-5649717-details.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">sold at auction for $10,442,500</a> in 2013. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9._La_Ghirlandata_1873_by_Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_c_Guildhall_Art_Gallery_2015._Photo_Scala_Florence_Heritage_Images.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38130\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9._La_Ghirlandata_1873_by_Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_c_Guildhall_Art_Gallery_2015._Photo_Scala_Florence_Heritage_Images-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9._La_Ghirlandata_1873_by_Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_c_Guildhall_Art_Gallery_2015._Photo_Scala_Florence_Heritage_Images-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9._La_Ghirlandata_1873_by_Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_c_Guildhall_Art_Gallery_2015._Photo_Scala_Florence_Heritage_Images-200x290.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9._La_Ghirlandata_1873_by_Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_c_Guildhall_Art_Gallery_2015._Photo_Scala_Florence_Heritage_Images-430x624.jpg 430w\" title='\"La Ghirlandata\" by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 1873.

The highly detailed law law was written by the Laodicea Assembly in 114 A.D. and approved by Aulus Vicirius Martialis, proconsul of the Roman Asia province, in the provincial capital at Ephesus. It was carved on a slab and erected in the city to put fear in the heart of all water scofflaws.</p>\n<p>The Roman affinity for practical engineering ensured cities had access to public water. Aqueducts carried enormous quantities of water from nearby sources to the urbs where it was split up into lead pipes and reservoirs supplying the fountains, baths and drinking water throughout the city. Keeping people from illegally tapping into the pipes to supply their own homes was a constant struggle. If too many people helped themselves, not only would the water flow be disrupted for their neighbors, but the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21511\" target=\"_blank\">sewer system tied into the water system suffered</a> as well since it required regular flushing. Backed up sewers and low water supply make for uncomfortable and dangerously unsanitary conditions in any city.</p>\n<p>Water management was thus an essential aspect of city administration and violators of the common water good were subject to heavy penalties. In Laodicea, anyone caught polluting the water, damaging the pipes and channels, opening sealed pipes or stealing the city water for private use would have to pay fines as high as 12,500 denarii. A legionary was paid 300 denarii a year in the early second century A.D., so fines in the thousands would be complete disasters for regular people. Many of the most egregious public water thieves were quite wealthy since they had homes into which city water could be easily and discretely diverted, so it was important that the fines be large if they were to act as any kind of deterrent. </p>\n<blockquote><p>[Excavations head Professor Celal \u015eim\u015fek of Pamukkale University] said the 1,900-year-old rules to prevent water pollution had a very special place, adding, \u201cThe fine for damaging the water channel or polluting the water is 5,000 denarius, nearly 50,000 Turkish Liras. The fine is the same for those who break the seal and attempt illegal use. Also, there are penalties for senior staff that overlook the illegal use of water. They pay 12,500 denarius. Those who denounce the polluters are given one-eighth of the penalty as a reward, according to the rules.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>A translation from the Greek of one section of the inscription:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThose who divide the water for his personal use, should pay 5,000 denarius to the imperial treasury; it is forbidden to use the city water for free or grant it to private individuals; those who buy the water cannot violate the Vespasian Edict; those who damage water pipes should pay 5,000 denarius; protective roofs should be established for the water depots and water pipes in the city; the governor\u2019s office [will] appoint two citizens as curators every year to ensure the safety of the water resource; nobody who has farms close to the water channels can use this water for agriculture.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Laodicea-site.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38122\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Laodicea-site-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Laodicea-site-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Laodicea-site-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Laodicea-site-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Laodicea ruins.

Laodicea was hard hit during the two decades of war between Rome and Mithridates VI, King of Pontus, and it was only after the end of the last Mithraditic War (75-63 B.C.) that the sleepy town grew into prosperous city under Roman rule.

Image courtesy the J. Paul Getty Museum.\" width=\"112\"/></a>The bust of Pope Paul V by Gian Lorenzo Bernini that was acquired by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles earlier this year has left a trail of criminal investigations and fired civil servants in its wake. When the museum announced the rediscovery and acquisition of the long-lost sculpture <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37131\" target=\"_blank\">this June</a>, the only details released about the purchase where that it belonged to an unnamed private collector who arranged a private sale via Sotheby\u2019s London. The last time before then that it appeared on the historical record was when it was sold to a Viennese collector at an 1893 Borghese family estate sale.</p>\n<p>Last month, details started to leak about the acquisition. The Getty was reported to have paid <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/in-brief/long-lost-bernini-bust-sold-33-million-getty-museum-319870\" target=\"_blank\">a jaw-dropping $33 million</a> to buy the bust from a still-unnamed Slovakian art dealer who had bought it unattributed and then found out it was the real thing, not a copy after Bernini\u2019s original. Somehow, the work had migrated from Vienna at the end of the 19th century to modern-day Bratislava, Slovakia. where it was in the collection of Slovakian painter Ernest Zmet\u00e1k. In 2013, Zmet\u00e1k\u2019s heirs put some of this collection, including the bust of Pope Paul V, up for auction. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38113\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 58px) 100vw, 58px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA-58x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA-58x150.jpg 58w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA-116x300.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA-311x800.jpg 311w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bust-for-sale-SOGA.jpg 389w\" title=\"Image of bust from Bratislava auction catalogue. Image courtesy SOGA auction house.\" width=\"58\"/></a>The bust, then attributed solely to an \u201cunknown Italian sculptor,\u201d was put up for auction twice, once <a href=\"http://www.soga.sk/aukcie-obrazy-diela-umenie-starozitnosti/aukcie/114-zimna-aukcia-vytvarnych-diel-a-starozitnosti-umelecka-pozostalost-ernesta-zmetaka/neznamy-taliansky-sochar-busta-papeza-podla-gianlorenza-berniniho-48536\" target=\"_blank\">in December of 2013 for 47,000 euro</a>, and when it failed to sell, again almost a year later <a href=\"http://www.soga.sk/aukcie-obrazy-diela-umenie-starozitnosti/aukcie/118-jesenna-aukcia-vytvarnych-diel/neznamy-taliansky-sochar-busta-papeza-podla-gianlorenza-berniniho-51592\" target=\"_blank\">for 24,000 euro</a>. Shortly after the bust couldn\u2019t find a buyer even at the 50% off fire sale, the auction house sold the bust privately for the reserve price of 24,000 euro to one Cl\u00e9ment Guenebeaud, a French collector living in Bratislava.</p>\n<p>It was Guenebeaud who realized the bust was made by Bernini himself. He tried to sell it on his own but the large hole in its ownership history made potential buyers wary. A famous work of art that mysteriously traveled from Vienna to Slovakia over the course of the 20th century runs the risk of being Nazi loot which could mire the current owner in a messy and expensive restitution battle. Sotheby\u2019s was game, though, and through them Guenebeaud was able to sell the bust to the Getty. The Baroque masterpiece left Slovakia without incident.</p>\n<p>After the Getty announced their new treasure with a splash, the fact that a small country with limited resources that could really use a tourism boost had somehow let a 17th century bust by one of the greatest sculptors in the world slip through its fingers <a href=\"http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20059314/how-slovakia-lost-a-bernini.html\" target=\"_blank\">did not go unnoticed back in Bratislava</a>. Culture Minister Marek Ma\u010fari\u010d ordered an investigation into the bust debacle and filed a criminal complaint against an unknown offender involved in the sale on suspicion that someone involved in the appraisal and sale knew its true value but deliberately and fraudulently obscured it.</p>\n<p>As of now, there is no evidence of deliberate deception. The auction house in Bratislava is a local outfit without the depth of expertise necessary to confidently attribute a sculpture to Bernini. Ernest Zmet\u00e1k apparently had no idea the bust was original, nor did his heirs. The only person who had any idea, Guenebeaud, didn\u2019t hide the fact that he thought it was a genuine Bernini in his application for an export license. He wrote that it was probably by Bernini and estimated its value at around \u20ac7 million, but the ministry employee in charge or arranging the permits changed the description from \u201cbust by Gian Lorenzo Bernini\u201d to \u201cbust after Bernini.\u201d Apparently she decided to go with the auction house\u2019s assessment rather than Guenebeaud\u2019s, and the commission that reviews permanent export applications accepted it without ordering an expert examination to confirm or deny the disputed authorship. Minister Ma\u010fari\u010d fired her and the director of the department in charge of issuing export permits.</p>\n<p>The timeline of all these events is foggy. It\u2019s not clear who determined the bust was original. It could be Alexander Kader, head of the department of European sculpture at Sotheby\u2019s London, but usually the top experts in the field are consulted for works of this importance. Presumably the Getty wouldn\u2019t have shelled out $33 million without being satisfied the bust was by Bernini.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38112\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Getty-Trust-spokesperson-M.A-Hartwig-with-bust-of-Paul-V-at-the-Getty-Museum.jpg 1359w\" title=\"Getty Trust spokesperson M.A Hartwig with bust of Paul V on display at the Getty.

The museum <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/lawsuit-threatens-getty-bernini-bust-322239\" target=\"_blank\">does not seem concerned</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In an email to artnet News Ron Hartwig, the Getty Museum\u2019s vice-president of communications assured that the bust \u201cwill remain on view to the public at the J. Paul Getty Museum.\u201d</p>\n<p>He explained \u201cThe Bust of Pope Paul V (1621) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini was legally exported from Slovakia, legally sold in the United Kingdom and legally imported into the United States. Whatever the nature of the Slovakian government\u2019s inquiry, it has no impact whatsoever on the Getty\u2019s ownership of the bust.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Heads roll in Slovakia over sale of Bernini bust\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38111\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38111#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38099\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38099\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Aztec skull rack found in Mexico City\u2019s Templo Mayor\">Aztec skull rack found in Mexico City\u2019s Templo Mayor</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, August 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tzompantli-skulls.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-38101\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tzompantli-skulls-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tzompantli-skulls-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tzompantli-skulls-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tzompantli-skulls-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skulls mortared in a circle in Templo Mayor tzompantli.

A five-skull tzompantli was discovered underneath a sacrificial stone and a mound of skulls and jawbones at the Templo Mayor <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20326\" target=\"_blank\">in 2012</a>, but this latest discovery is on a whole other scale.

Six feet under floor level, they discovered a wall of volcanic rock coated with stucco with a flagstone floor. The rectangular platform, estimated to be more than 34 meters (111.5 feet) long and 12 meters (40 feet) wide, has at its center a circular structure made from skulls cemented together using a lime, sand and volcanic gravel mortar. Many of the skulls have a hole 25 to 30 centimeters (10-12 inches) in diameter piercing the parietal bones. They are all facing inwards at the open space inside the circle. Adult male skulls predominate, but there are skulls from adult women, youths and children as well. So far archaeologists have counted 35 skulls, but expect to see that number increase exponentially as they dig further down under the stucco and stone slabs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tzompantli-from-Codex-Tovar-1587.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-38103\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tzompantli-from-Codex-Tovar-1587-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tzompantli-from-Codex-Tovar-1587-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tzompantli-from-Codex-Tovar-1587-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tzompantli-from-Codex-Tovar-1587-430x324.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tzompantli-from-Codex-Tovar-1587.jpg 1359w\" title=\"Tzompantli from Tovar Codex, 1587\" width=\"200\"/></a>Preliminary dating places this structure in Stage VI of the construction of the Templo Mayor (between 1486 and 1502), during the reign of Aztec warrior king Ahu\u00edzotl. He was succeeded on the throne of Tenochitlan by his nephew Moctezuma II who would meet his end fighting Conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Cort\u00e9s himself described the great tzompantli of Tenochtitlan, as did early ethnographers Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan and Dominican friar Diego Dur\u00e1n. They wrote of tzompantli with low, elongated bases supporting the vertical posts with horizontal racks of skulls. There is also at least one account of skulls mortared together; this is the first time a tzompantli has been discovered matching that description.</p>\n<blockquote><p>University of Florida archaeologist Susan Gillespie, who was not involved in the project, wrote that \u201cI do not personally know of other instances of literal skulls becoming architectural material to be mortared together to make a structure.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been looking for the big one for some time, and this one does seem much bigger than the already excavated one,\u201d Gillespie wrote. \u201cThis find both confirms long-held suspicions about the sacrificial landscape of the ceremonial precinct, that there must have been a much bigger tzompantli to curate the many heads of sacrificial victims\u201d as a kind of public record or accounting of sacrifices.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The second stage of excavations will begin in November. Meanwhile, the skulls will be examined in the laboratory. They\u2019ll test the DNA if they can recover any and will test stable isotopes in the bones and teeth to determine the geographic origin of the sacrificed.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Aztec skull rack found in Mexico City\u2019s Templo Mayor\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38099\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38099#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38087\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38087\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Noah\u2019s round ark takes to the water\">Noah\u2019s round ark takes to the water</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, August 23rd, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dr.-Irving-Finkel-examines-Ark-Tablet.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The author examining the Ark Tablet in the British Museum.

Image by Dale Cherry.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Five years ago, the news broke that premier cuneiform scholar Dr. Irving Finkel, Deputy Keeper of Middle East at the British Museum, had translated a new account of the ancient Babylonian Flood Story on a clay tablet from 1,750 B.C. and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/4364\" target=\"_blank\">found directions for making a round ark</a>. There are multiple versions of the deluge myth in the ancient Near East. One features Ziusudra, King of Sumer, as the Noah figure and is found on a single tablet from the 17th century B.C. excavated in Nippur, Iraq. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells the story of Utnapishtim who was tasked by the god Enki-Ea to build a boat that would save his family, craftsmen, plants and animals from the flood the other gods were sending to destroy humanity. The earliest surviving Gilgamesh tablets date to the 18th century B.C. The Akkadian version is named after its hero, Atra-Hasis, and is found on fragments of tablets also dating back to the 18th century B.C. The Flood Story on the tablet recently translated by Dr. Finkel is the Akkadian Atra-Hasis version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tablet-in-Chaldean-Account-of-Genesis.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Drawing of Gilgamesh tablet pieced together from fragments in Smith's &quot;Chaldean Account of Genesis&quot;\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38091\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tablet-in-Chaldean-Account-of-Genesis-150x121.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tablet-in-Chaldean-Account-of-Genesis-150x121.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tablet-in-Chaldean-Account-of-Genesis-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tablet-in-Chaldean-Account-of-Genesis-430x349.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tablet-in-Chaldean-Account-of-Genesis.jpg 1529w\" title=\"Drawing of Gilgamesh tablet pieced together from fragments in Smith's &quot;Chaldean Account of Genesis&quot;\" width=\"150\"/></a>All of these versions of the Flood Story precede the Biblical version with the one God and Noah by a thousand years, a fact that caused a sensation in 1872 when British Museum Assyriologist George Smith announced he\u2019d found the first cuneiform account of the Great Flood, now known to be the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=309929&amp;partId=1\" target=\"_blank\">11th Tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh</a>. Smith published his find in the 1876 book <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/chaldeanaccounto00smit#page/n9/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Chaldean Account of Genesis</em></a>, a seminal volume in the history of Assyriology even though several of his translations, admittedly makeshift solutions to missing bits in the sources (he suggested Gilgamesh was to be read Izdubar), have since been corrected.</p>\n<p>Finkel published his translation of the Atra-Hasis tablet last year in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ark-Before-Noah-Decoding-Story/dp/0345804392/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of the Flood</em></a>, a fascinating archaeological detective story that manages that rare feat of conveying its author\u2019s contagious enthusiasm along with the scholarly information. I\u2019m sure in someone else\u2019s hands the analysis of cuneiform tablets can make for dry reading, but Dr. Finkel\u2019s ebullience shines through on every vigorously-turned page.</p>\n<p>That endlessly renewable resource of enthusiasm played a key role in the translation of the round ark tablet. Dr. Finkel first encountered the small cuneiform tablet in 1985 when it was one of several pieces Douglas Simmonds brought to the British Museum for expert assessment. Douglas\u2019 father Leonard was in the Royal Air Force after World War II and had amassed a significant collection of Near East artifacts during his travels. After Leonard\u2019s death, Douglas researched the objects. Finkel had already helped him with several cylinder seals and clay tablets before the fateful 1985 encounter.</p>\n<p>As one of very few people in the world who can sight-read cuneiform, Finkel was able to read the clean first verses of the tablet: \u201cWall, wall! Reed wall, reed wall! Atra-Hasis\u2026\u201d That passage is famous among Assyriologists as the opening lines of the Atra-Hasis Flood Story. Finkel was thrilled at such a rare find and asked to keep the tablet so he could translate the whole thing which is covered in cuneiform front and back, but Mr. Simmonds was unwilling to part with it. It wasn\u2019t until 2009 when Dr. Finkel spotted Douglas Simmonds at the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/channel/exhibitions/2008/babylon_myth_and_reality.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Babylon, Myth and Reality</em></a> exhibition that the latter finally agreed to bring the tablet in for translation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Ark-Tablet.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The Ark Tablet, ca. 1,750 B.C.

Image courtesy Douglas Simmonds.\" width=\"156\"/></a>The sixty lines of the Ark Tablet go into unprecedented detail on the design of the boat and the materials used in construction. None of the other Atra-Hasis tablets describe the vessel. This is most of what\u2019s on the front of the tablet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Wall, wall! Reed wall, reed wall!<br/>\nAtra-Hasis, pay heed to my advice,<br/>\nThat you may live for ever!<br/>\nDestroy your house, build a boat;<br/>\nSpurn property and save life!<br/>\nDraw out the boat that you will make<br/>\nOn a circular plan;<br/>\nLet her length and breadth be equal,<br/>\nLet her floor area be one field, let her sides be one <em>nindan</em> high,<br/>\nYou saw <em>kannu</em> ropes and <em>aslu</em> ropes/rushes for [a coracle before!]<br/>\nLet someone (else) twist the fronds and palm-fibre for you!<br/>\nIt will surely consume 14,430 (<em>sutu</em>)!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI set in place thirty ribs<br/>\nWhich were one <em>parsiktu</em>-vessel thick, ten <em>nindan</em> long;<br/>\nI set up 3,600 stanchions within her<br/>\nWhich were half (a <em>parsiktu</em>-vessel) thick, half a <em>nindan</em> high;<br/>\nI constructed her cabins above and below.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI apportioned one finger of bitumen for her outsides;<br/>\nI apportioned one finger of bitumen for her interior;<br/>\nI had (already) poured out one finger of bitumen onto her cabins;<br/>\nI caused the kilns to be loaded with 28,800 (<em>sutu</em>) of <em>kupru</em>-bitumen<br/>\nAnd I poured 3,600 (<em>sutu</em>) of <em>ittu</em>-bitumen within.<br/>\nThe bitumen did not come to the surface [lit. up to me];<br/>\n(so) I added five fingers of lard,<br/>\nI ordered the kilns to be loaded \u2026 in equal measure;<br/>\n(With) tamarisk wood (?) (and) stalks (?)<br/>\n\u2026(= I completed the mixture).</p></blockquote>\n<p>These quantities are enormous, enough palm-fiber rope, wooden ribs and stanchions to build a coracle 3,600 square meters in area, almost two-thirds the size of a soccer field, with walls 20 feet high. If the amount of rope described here were laid out in a single line, it would reach from London to Edinburgh. The vats of bitumen were necessary to waterproof a boat whose hull is, after all, made of rope.</p>\n<p>The back of the tablet is more damaged than the front, with significant chunks missing, but what is there continues the discussion of bitumen application and then describes Atra-Hasis and his family getting on the boat. In one moving passage, Atra-Hasis prays to the moon god Sin that the coming tragedy be averted. Sin\u2019s reply includes a line that will strike a familiar chord with anyone who has ever heard the Noah story.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cSin, from his throne, swore as to annihilation<br/>\nAnd desolation on (the) darkened [day (to come)]\u201d<br/>\n\u201cBut the wild animals from the steppe [(\u2026)]<br/>\nTwo by two the boat did [they enter]\u2026\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Armed with this unique description, Dr. Finkel contacted ancient ship specialists to see if they could construct a scale version of the ark. The project was filmed for a television program called <em>The Real Noah\u2019s Ark</em> which first aired <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-real-noahs-ark-secret-history\" target=\"_blank\">on Britain\u2019s Channel 4</a> last September. It apparently aired as <a href=\"http://natgeotv.com/za/rebuilding-noahs-ark/about\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rebuilding Noah\u2019s Ark</em></a> on the National Geographic channel, but I missed it. The British Museum\u2019s YouTube channel just posted <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sbfr-9US31k\" target=\"_blank\">a five-minute introduction</a> to the episode a few days ago, which was the first I\u2019d heard of it.

(It was Bartolini who dubbed the dance a \u201cValtzer\u201d even though it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re not waltzing. The face-to-face whirling dance we know as the waltz became popular in aristocratic circles starting in the 1770s, so you\u2019d think he would have been familiar with it.) Sisters Emma and Julia were the youngest of the eight children of Lady Charlotte Campbell, daughter of the 5th Duke of Argyll, and her distant cousin/husband John Campbell. It wasn\u2019t a great match, fortune-wise, and after his death the Lady Charlotte had significant money troubles. By the time Bartolini immortalized Emma and Julia in graceful motion, they were living with their widowed mother in Florence where a noblewoman in reduced circumstances could live more comfortably than she could in England or Scotland.</p>\n<p>Given their comparative brokeness, it\u2019s not certain who commissioned the work. According to Bartolini\u2019s studio notes, the sculpture was commissioned by the girls\u2019 brother Mr. Campbell, but the whole family had limited funds so it\u2019s unlikely their eldest brother Walter would have spent \u00a3500 on a marble life-sized portrait of his sisters. Perhaps a more likely candidate is the girls\u2019 uncle, Lady Charlotte\u2019s brother, George William Campbell, the 6th Duke of Argyll. Bartolini\u2019s notes say they shipped it to Edinburgh and at some point the sculpture wound up in the dining room of Inveraray Castle, seat of the Dukes of Argyll. There are no references to its arrival in the castle archives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lorenzo-Bartolini-sculpteur-by-Jean-Auguste-Dominique-Ingres-Mus\u00e9e-du-Louvre-Rene-Gabriel-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38075\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lorenzo-Bartolini-sculpteur-by-Jean-Auguste-Dominique-Ingres-Mus\u00e9e-du-Louvre-Rene-Gabriel--121x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lorenzo-Bartolini-sculpteur-by-Jean-Auguste-Dominique-Ingres-Mus\u00e9e-du-Louvre-Rene-Gabriel--121x150.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lorenzo-Bartolini-sculpteur-by-Jean-Auguste-Dominique-Ingres-Mus\u00e9e-du-Louvre-Rene-Gabriel--200x247.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lorenzo-Bartolini-sculpteur-by-Jean-Auguste-Dominique-Ingres-Mus\u00e9e-du-Louvre-Rene-Gabriel--430x532.jpg 430w\" title=\"Lorenzo Bartolini, sculpteur, by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1820.

He had been one of Napoleon\u2019s favorites and his fortunes suffered somewhat in the wake of his patron\u2019s final defeat and exile, but he made a decent living in the late 18teens and twenties in large part thanks to portrait commissions. A great many portrait busts of prominent men and women of the period (the Bonaparte siblings and spouses, Alexander I of Russia, the Duke of Alba, the Duchess of Sutherland and dozens more) made by Bartolini are in museums and collections all over Europe and the United States today. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Plaster-model-for-marble-group-ca-1861.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38083\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 92px) 100vw, 92px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Plaster-model-for-marble-group-ca-1861-92x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Plaster-model-for-marble-group-ca-1861-92x150.jpg 92w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Plaster-model-for-marble-group-ca-1861-185x300.jpg 185w\" title='Plaster model for \"Neoptolemus Casting Astyanax from the Walls of Troy,\" ca. 1861' width=\"92\"/></a>Canova\u2019s static, posed neoclassical aesthetic still dominated, while Bartolini preferred a softer, more naturalistic approach he\u2019d learned studying painting in Paris under Jacques-Louis David. Despite his eye for naturalism and movement so clearly evinced in <em>The Campbell Sisters</em>, the portrait of the young ladies is one of only two action sculptures made by Bartolini. The other one was <em>Neoptolemus Casting Astyanax from the Walls of Troy</em>, made in 1841 and widely considered Bartolini\u2019s chef-d\u2019oeuvre. Commissioned by Donna Rosa Poldi-Pezzoli, the <em>Astyanax</em> group would become the core of Poldi-Pezzoli Museum founded in Milan by her son Don Gian-Giacomo. Bartolini created a scene of dynamic action \u2014 Neoptolemus (aka Pyrrhus) about to throw the child Astyanx from Troy\u2019s ramparts to his death while his mother Andromache lies prostrate at his feet, one arm reaching up his leg \u2014 in marked contrast to his static portraits. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bronze-copy-cast-after-hailstorm-damage.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38082\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bronze-copy-cast-after-hailstorm-damage-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bronze-copy-cast-after-hailstorm-damage-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bronze-copy-cast-after-hailstorm-damage-200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bronze-copy-cast-after-hailstorm-damage-430x537.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bronze-copy-cast-after-hailstorm-damage.jpg 1024w\" title='Bronze copy of \"Astyanax\" cast after hailstorm damage, ca. 1902. Image courtesy the Museo Poldi Pezzoli.' width=\"120\"/></a>Sadly the sculpture and its plaster model were destroyed by aerial bombing in World War II. A bronze replica made in 1902 after the original marble, then located in the courtyard of the museum building, was damaged in a hailstorm, has survived, as have preparatory drawings now in the Uffizi and the <a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/drawings/item/140914\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Library and Museum</a>. That makes <em>The Campbell Sisters</em> the only surviving Bartolini sculpture that captures characters in movement. Because of that and because it\u2019s a much earlier work that uniquely combines the portraiture he was best known for and an action scene, the UK museums are thrilled to get to keep <em>The Campbell Sisters</em>.</p>\n<p>It is on display at the V&amp;A right now, where it will remain until November 20th. After that, it moves to the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh for the first seven year visitation period.

href=\"http://www.cc.com/shows/drunk-history\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Drunk History</em> premieres on Comedy Central</a> tonight at 10:30 EST. I\u2019ve been a loyal viewer since it was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DrunkHistory/videos\" target=\"_blank\">on YouTube</a> and while the transition to television was a little awkward \u2014 a sketch on the short-lived Funny or Die HBO show \u2014 it has found its footing on Comedy Central and is now heading into its third season.</p>\n<p>In the first two seasons of the Comedy Central show, each episode revolved around a city as a unifying theme. Three comedians told a story each about, say, Detroit or New York City of Nashville, and it worked because hometown yarns are always good fun, and anyway history is so dense and rich that there\u2019s no chance of so broad a range as an entire city feeling limited. Still, I missed the theme shows of the olden days, so I was delighted to see a few of them in season two (<a href=\"http://www.cc.com/full-episodes/pjwpol/drunk-history-first-ladies-season-2-ep-208\" target=\"_blank\">First Ladies</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/full-episodes/hdbe99/drunk-history-american-music-season-2-ep-203\" target=\"_blank\">American Music</a>) and they\u2019re back this season. The first episode has a theme, in fact, the history of science, one of my favorite subtopics. </p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t seen it before, I envy you, because you can watch every episode of the first two seasons <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/shows/drunk-history/episode-guide\" target=\"_blank\">on Comedy Central\u2019s website</a> with enthralled new eyes. The episodes are just over 20 minutes long, so you can totally marathon through all 18 of them in less than seven hours. I\u2019m not saying you should call in sick, but you should probably call in sick. Priorities, man.</p>\n<p><em>Drunk History</em> co-creators Derek Waters and Jeremy Connor, were on a panel at this year\u2019 Comic-Con. Waters talks about the inception of the show \u2014 Otis Redding was involved \u2014 and how it took off, the processes of narration and reenactment, topics they thought would work but turned out to be buzzkills, ie, the Donner Party and serial killer H.H. Holmes. Fun fact: the first season they made narrators tell two stories which means they were drunk non-stop from 3:00 in the afternoon until after the wee hours of the next morning. Oh, and the narrators have to blow in a breathalyzer regularly throughout filming to ensure they are efficiently but not dangerously wasted. Guest stars this season include Octavia Spenser, Parker Posey, Will Ferrel, Josh Hartnett and Maya Rudolph.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a fan of the show, you\u2019ll wish the panel video were longer.

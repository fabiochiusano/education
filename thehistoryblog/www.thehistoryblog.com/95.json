The Narshykin family had bought the palace in 1799 and lived there until 1917 when the fled the country and the Bolsheviks on the double. They left behind many valuable objects which were transferred State Hermitage Museum in 1920.  \n But those were just the pieces that were easy to find. Before they left Russia with their portable wealth, the family carefully wrapped their antique silver and stashed it in a hidey hole between the second and third floors of the palace. It was so effective a hiding place that it wasn\u2019t even found when the palace was extensively renovated in the 1960s. It took a three-year project of re-engineering and restoration that began in 2009 to break through a brick wall and reveal the secret room crammed with cases full of treasure. \n Apparently some of the crew tried to take a cut of the loot, hiding it away before the construction company alerted the authorities to the find, but they weren\u2019t up to the job the Narshykin\u2019s had done so thoroughly before them and the police found the pieces when they searched the building. \n The Naryshkin family was one of the most important in Tsarist Russia going back hundreds of years. It could trace its roots to the 15th century, but the family leapt to prominence when the beautiful Natalya Naryshkina (1651-1694) wed Tsar Alexis after his first wife died birthing their 13th child. Their son would become Peter the Great and she was rule as regent of Russia during his minority. Peter showered favor on his maternal family and the Naryshkin princes held high office in the government, military and court from then until the brutal end of the Russian monarchy. \n In July of 1918, Colonel Kiril Mihailovich Naryshkin, adjutant to White Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Nikolaevich Rozanov, was one of the first people to enter the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg. Rozanov and Naryshkin broke down the defensive palisade encircling the house and went in together. There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants. \n While there was some talk at the time the treasure was discovered that Narshykin descendants might make an ownership claim on the silver or of the finders getting 50% of its value, but surprising nobody the collection was declared historically significant and therefore property of the state. Since then it has been studied, inventoried and conserved and is now on public view in the Catherine Palace, the main building of the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum, which is also home to the reconstructed Amber Room. \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\"

It could trace its roots to the 15th century, but the family leapt to prominence when the beautiful Natalya Naryshkina (1651-1694) wed Tsar Alexis after his first wife died birthing their 13th child.

Peter showered favor on his maternal family and the Naryshkin princes held high office in the government, military and court from then until the brutal end of the Russian monarchy.</p>\n<p>In July of 1918, Colonel Kiril Mihailovich Naryshkin, adjutant to White Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Nikolaevich Rozanov, was one of the first people to enter the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg. Rozanov and Naryshkin broke down the defensive palisade encircling the house and went in together. There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54703\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

It was found in an undisclosed location in South Norfolk near the site where another important piece from around the same period, the Winfarthing Pendant, was unearthed in 2014.</p>\n<p>The pendant is in excellent condition. It is a small piece, .67 inches by half an inch, of a type known as a cross-in-ring pendant, a style that dates to the late 6th, mid-7th centuries. The ring part is composed of three concentric rings of gold beaded wire. In the center is a beaded wire cross. The outer rim is worn smooth, either from use or in the original crafting of the piece. A small sheet of gold is looped at the top middle. Traces of now-worn ribbed decoration remain.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ms Shoemark, from Norfolk County Council\u2019s archaeology department, said: \u201cLike the Winfarthing assemblage, this piece most likely belonged to a high-status lady.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt dates to an important turning point in Saxon history during the first flowering of Christianity [in England] and is of similar date to the jewellery assemblage from the now famous and nearby Winfarthing burial.</p>\n<p>\u201cMale graves of this period appear to be entirely lacking in elaborate jewellery.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis latest pendant makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of Saxon society, religion and the position of women during a period of immense social and cultural change.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54661\" height=\"331\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-430x331.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-430x331.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-150x116.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-200x154.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anglo-Saxon-pendant-768x592.jpg 768w\" title=\"Anglo-Saxon gold cross-in-ring pendant, late-6th to mid-7th century.

There are 78 coins in the collection, all silver denarii, in decent but not great condition. This is the second Roman coin hoard unearthed in Warwickshire since 2015. The first was larger, containing 440 silver denarii stashed in a large clay pot and buried in what is now Edge Hill, but what makes this one unique is that its coins date to 68-69 A.D., from the end of the reign of the Nero through the infamous Year of the Four Emperors. </p>\n<p>The overthrow of Nero and his consequent suicide threw the empire into chaos. Competing generals vied for the throne, and coup followed coup installing Galba, Otho and Vitellius successively as emperors for a few months apiece. The civil wars ended when Vespasian became emperor in July of 69 A.D. and founded the Flavian dynasty that would rule Rome for 27 years. </p>\n<p>Wars are expensive things and private armies don\u2019t fight just for the principle. Galba found this out from day one, as he\u2019d been acclaimed emperor by the Praetorian Guard who had been promised by their calculating leaders monetary reward for their support, something they had developed a taste for under the Julio-Claudians. But Galba had no intention of paying for the loyalty of his own guard, and with the imperial treasury in the doldrums, the coins he struck weren\u2019t going to line the pockets of soldiers. </p>\n<p>Seven months later, Galba was a stabbed and decapitated corpse and Otho, who had bought 23 Praetorians to secure Galba\u2019s fate, was emperor. He couldn\u2019t afford to buy the loyalty, even temporary, of the army of Germania Inferior, however, so three months later he was dead and Vitellius, commander of said army was emperor. He got to enjoy a whole eight months as emperor thanks to that support before he was defeated by Vespasian and the legions of the east.</p>\n<p>With this constant turmoil, competing armies, supremely self-interested parties looking to benefit from their selection of one or another candidate for the throne, the emperors made as much use as possible of their minting powers. Yet, surviving coins from this period are exceedingly rare in Britain. The 78 examples found in the clay pot are the largest single collection of coins from the Year of the Four Emperors ever discovered.</p>\n<p>The hoard has been declared official Treasure and experts from the British Museum have assessed its market value at \u00a362,000. The local museum closest to the find site, Market Hall Museum in Warwick gets first crack at acquiring the hoard. It is applying for grants, throwing fundraising events and soliciting donations now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Councillor Dave Reilly, Portfolio Holder for Environment, Heritage and Culture says:</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an amazingly important find for Warwickshire and our Roman past. Bringing the hoard back to the county and the Market Hall Museum will mean that Warwickshire\u2019s residents can enjoy them for generations to come. The international significance of some of the coins in this hoard will increase visitors not only to Warwick, but the wider county, which can only contribute to our key objective of making the Warwickshire economy vibrant.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Year of Four Emperors coin hoard found in Warwickshire\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54350\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54350#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53616\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53616\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Glorious Bronze Age bulla found in Shropshire\">Glorious Bronze Age bulla found in Shropshire</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, December 11th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53623\" height=\"118\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-front-150x118.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-front-150x118.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-front-200x157.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-front-768x602.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-front-430x337.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bulla, front view.

It is crescent-shaped with wedge-shaped sides and was created using at least two pieces of gold sheet. The top edge has collars on either side that were filled with clay or compacted soil, either deliberately or over the centuries it was buried. Between them is a tunnel which would have been used to thread a chain or necklace through to hang it as a pendant. The front and rear plates that make the body of the pendant are a single sheet of gold plate fixed at the mid-point of the top edge. A base plate closes the two sides of the plate. The fixing points are concealed so the plates and tube collar look like a single piece. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53619\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 67px) 100vw, 67px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-side-67x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-side-67x150.jpg 67w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-side-135x300.jpg 135w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-side-768x1711.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-side-359x800.jpg 359w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-side.jpg 842w\" title=\"Bulla, side view.

The composition of the bulla was tested with XRF-analysis, but the presence of solder \u2014 which in Bronze Age objects is higher in copper or silver than the rest of the piece \u2014 could not be conclusively identified. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-other-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53618\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 61px) 100vw, 61px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-other-side-61x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-other-side-61x150.jpg 61w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-other-side-121x300.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-other-side-323x800.jpg 323w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-other-side.jpg 766w\" title=\"Bulla, other side. Photo courtesy Portable Antiquities Scheme.\" width=\"61\"/></a>The most striking element of the bulla is the decoration. Every surface is engraved with geometric designs filled with cut parallel lines and concentric curves. They are so precise, so even that the maker must have used a compass or divider to mark them out and then cut them using a graver with a 45 degree cutting edge. There are no punched or repousse patterns as have been found on other bullae. The deep grooves carved all over the piece suggest the gold sheet is comparatively thick and that the decoration was done on the completed pendant rather than on the sheets before they were put together.</p>\n<p>To top it off, the lines go in alternating horizontal, vertical, semi-circular and diagonal directions, creating a dynamic graphic look as well as an <a href=\"https://t.co/KenwUaD7to\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">incredible play of light</a> that makes the gold reflect in different shades that underscore the intricate shapes. This is work of the highest quality, the greatest possible workmanship, material and design that is all but incomparable in a British context.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-top.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53621\" height=\"39\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-top-150x39.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-top-150x39.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-top-200x51.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-top-768x197.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bulla-top-430x110.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bulla, top view.

This is an unusual mixture of investment-sized denominations. It strongly suggests whoever buried this hoard was a merchant or trader of some sort. Large, highly recognizable and highly valued denominations were used to make deals on large quantities, not as walk-around cash. They were not in circulation in Cesarea. They were barely in circulation anywhere. The Byzantine coins almost never left the boundaries of the Empire period. Only a few of them have been found in Israel before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hoard-in-pot.-Clara-Amit-Israel-Antiquities-Authority.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53536\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hoard-in-pot.-Clara-Amit-Israel-Antiquities-Authority-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hoard-in-pot.-Clara-Amit-Israel-Antiquities-Authority-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hoard-in-pot.-Clara-Amit-Israel-Antiquities-Authority-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hoard-in-pot.-Clara-Amit-Israel-Antiquities-Authority-768x577.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hoard-in-pot.-Clara-Amit-Israel-Antiquities-Authority-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Hoard in pot.

The city founded by Herod the Great was important under Roman, Byzantine and Caliphate rule, a prosperous center of trade with public fountains and gardens.

Forty silver tetradrachms were found scattered over a steep slope. This is the second largest coin hoard discovered in the area and the one with the oldest coins.</p>\n<p>They date to the end of the La T\u00e8ne period and were buried in the early 1st century around the turn of the millennium when the Romans occupied the area. The collapse of the Celtic civilization and the Roman invasions created social instability that may have spurred the burial of the coins, either to protect precious savings or as a ritual deposit to buy the protection of the gods.</p>\n<p>They were originally buried in one place, wrapped in an organic material. The archaeologists identified the burial site. It broke down due to soil erosion, exposing the organic material to decay and the coins to scattering. Very few coin discoveries are made in their original context by archaeologists like this one was. Night hawks and looters run rampant, and if they get to a site at all, archaeologists are often beaten to the punch by treasure hunters. Because the coins and find site were untouched, the team was able to discover the extremely important burial location.</p>\n<p>Tetradrachms are silver coins weighing nine to 10 grams, about four times the weight (and therefore value) of the smallest denomination, the drachma. In the 1st century, tetradrachms were the most valuable coin denominations minted in what is now northern Slovakia. </p>\n<blockquote><p>It is highly probable that they are minted from silver originating from a Carpathian (Slovak) deposit. The economic power of Celts in the Slovak area was to a considerable extent based on using natural resources, especially gold, silver and iron. The Turiec region belonged among the key economic and cultural centres of Celts in Slovakia, [Deputy Director of the Archaeological Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences Karol] Pieta added.

About 1,500 of those pieces were found to come from a single artifact: an extremely rare helmet of highest quality. Like the famous helmet discovered in the 7th century ship burial at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk in 1939, the Staffordshire helmet must have belonged to an individual of high status.The Sutton Hoo helmet\u2019s owner is believed to have been King R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia; the helmet is made of iron, tinned bronze sheeting, bronze and a few prominent gilded elements like the upper lip. The Staffordshire helmet was covered in reliefs of silver gilt foil, so has even more precious metal surfacing than the Sutton Hoo helmet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36762\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Section of reconstructed helmetband \u00a9 Birmingham Museums Trust\" width=\"200\"/></a>The main structure of the helmet is lost and the hundreds of surviving relief fragments are so thin and delicate that they cannot all be puzzled back together.

A metal detector hobbyist found the first coin earlier this year, an extremely rare piece known as a face/deer coin after the stylized face design on the obverse and the deer going nose-to-nose with a snake on the reverse. Only 11 face/deer coins were known to exist before this summer. The Museum of Southwest Jutland got wind of it on August 14th and contacted the finder the next day. That\u2019s when they discovered there wasn\u2019t just one more face/deer coin, but a whole bunch more, likely deposited in the wetland as a ritual sacrifice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Obverse-face-deer-coin-e1541739535641.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Obverse of the face/deer coin with a stylized face in the center.

Over two days, they found 174 coins, 172 of them face/deer coins, the last two with Viking ships adorned with shields on the obverse and deer on the reverse. The coins were spread over an elongated oval about 165 by 50 feet in area, a distribution typical of coin deposits that have been scattered by repeated passes with plows. The way they were spread out suggests they were not buried in the bog, but rather placed on the ground in a single deposit, likely in a bag that was torn apart and destroyed over the centuries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Reverse-face-deer-e1541739577566.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53231\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Reverse-face-deer-e1541739577566-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Reverse-face-deer-e1541739577566-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Reverse-face-deer-e1541739577566-200x199.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Reverse-face-deer-e1541739577566-768x764.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Reverse-face-deer-e1541739577566-430x428.jpg 430w\" title=\"Reverse of the face/deer coin depicts a deer facing off against a snake under a sun or moon, three interlaced triangles between his legs.

The question of how much of a real monetary economy early Viking cities employed as opposed to a precious metal weight economy is a fraught one in the scholarship, and finding so many coins deposited in one place and preserved in perfect condition will give numismatic experts the unique opportunity to determine how many of these coins were minted and circulated.  Initial examinations have already revealed that many different stamps were used to strike the coins, indicating a significant output that was in no way imaginable based solely on the two handfuls of coins known before this summer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ship-deer-reverse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53234\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ship-deer-reverse-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ship-deer-reverse-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ship-deer-reverse-768x775.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ship-deer-reverse-430x434.jpg 430w\" title=\"Reverse of the ship/deer coin.

Gudfred is the first Danish king we have decently reliable evidence of in contemporary chronicles. He fought against Charlemagne and the Franks. His son Horik I (the only son whose name is recorded but not the only one to rule) carried on his father\u2019s legacy by raiding the Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne\u2019s son Louis the Pious. We know little about Gudfred and his sons\u2019 monetary policies or really much of anything about their reigns beyond their interactions with the Franks. The hoard may shed a whole new light on an obscure historical period.</p>\n<p>The coins unearthed thus far were briefly on display at the Museum of Southwest Jutland for a week until November 4th before being removed for further study. The excavation at the find site continued through October 25th. Between August and now, a total of 252 coins have been recovered. Archaeologists don\u2019t think there are many, or even any, left to find.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"9th century coin hoard found in bog\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53228\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53228#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-52698\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52698\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Mushroom picker finds Bronze Age helmets\">Mushroom picker finds Bronze Age helmets</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, September 19th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Helmets-cheek-arm-guards.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52700\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Helmets-cheek-arm-guards-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Helmets-cheek-arm-guards-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Helmets-cheek-arm-guards-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Helmets-cheek-arm-guards-768x518.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Helmets-cheek-arm-guards-430x290.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Helmets-cheek-arm-guards.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Bronze Age helmets, cheek protectors, arm guards, ca. 3200 years old.

The helmets were constructed from two sheets of bronze fashioned into curved plates slightly flattened on the top of the head. The plates are joined down the middle of the head by a central trident crest that has a hole through which a plume could be threaded. The sides are decorated with concentric circles, a shape also seen on the cheek pads. There are also holes on the bottom side through which the cheek pads were attached.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cheek-guards.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-52702\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cheek-guards-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cheek-guards-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cheek-guards-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cheek-guards-768x509.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cheek-guards-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cheek-guards.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Protective cheek pads.

The museum reported the discover to the regional authorities. Museum archaeologist D\u00e1rius Ga\u0161aj and a regional heritage official searched the find site for any information the context could provide and any other artifacts that may have still been there. The pieces had been buried together at one time in a single hole. There were no other objects found.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Arm-guards.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-52701\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Arm-guards-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Arm-guards-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Arm-guards-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Arm-guards-768x520.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Arm-guards-430x291.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Arm-guards.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Spiral arm guards. Photo by Franti\u0161ek Iv\u00e1n, TASR.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Bronze Age helmets are rare in Europe and vanishingly so in Slovakia. Only three examples in this style of manufacture are known, all of them discovered in the Eastern Alps significantly to the west of Slovakia. Archaeologists believe they may have been made in a workshop in the northern Apennines and then wound their way through the Alpine passes eventually reaching the Carpathian basin. The spiral arm guards were likely produced locally. They are of a type that has been found before in Slovakia.</p>\n<p>The armature will be studied and conserved further by experts at the Eastern Slovakia Museum where it has made its public debut as part of a display on ancient armour.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The origin of the helmets from Trhovi\u0161te remains unclear. They were probably traded objects imported for the highest society elite \u2013 military chiefs. The helmets were used and repaired. They were more a symbol of the status of the bearer, a symbol of his position and power than protective equipment.</p>\n<p>The display also includes the back part of some plate armour plate that was found long ago in \u010cierna nad Tisou and also some fragments discovered in \u0160ari\u0161sk\u00e9 Micha\u013eany.</p>\n<p>Similar helmets have been found in L\u00fa\u010dky, Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Bel\u00e1 and \u017da\u0161kov but they were made only from one sheet of bronze. They originated between the 12th and 10th century BC.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mushroom picker finds Bronze Age helmets\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52698\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/52698#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

The Narshykin family had bought the palace in 1799 and lived there until 1917 when the fled the country and the Bolsheviks on the double. They left behind many valuable objects which were transferred State Hermitage Museum in 1920. </p>\n<p>But those were just the pieces that were easy to find. Before they left Russia with their portable wealth, the family carefully wrapped their antique silver and stashed it in a hidey hole between the second and third floors of the palace. It was so effective a hiding place that it wasn\u2019t even found when the palace was extensively renovated in the 1960s. It took a three-year project of re-engineering and restoration that began in 2009 to break through a brick wall and reveal the secret room crammed with cases full of treasure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54704\" height=\"130\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-200x130.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-768x501.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-430x281.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

It could trace its roots to the 15th century, but the family leapt to prominence when the beautiful Natalya Naryshkina (1651-1694) wed Tsar Alexis after his first wife died birthing their 13th child. Their son would become Peter the Great and she was rule as regent of Russia during his minority. Peter showered favor on his maternal family and the Naryshkin princes held high office in the government, military and court from then until the brutal end of the Russian monarchy.</p>\n<p>In July of 1918, Colonel Kiril Mihailovich Naryshkin, adjutant to White Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Nikolaevich Rozanov, was one of the first people to enter the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg. Rozanov and Naryshkin broke down the defensive palisade encircling the house and went in together. There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54703\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

Since then it has been studied, inventoried and conserved and is now on public view in the Catherine Palace, the main building of the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum, which is also home to the reconstructed Amber Room.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Russian aristocratic silver goes on display\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54700\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>"}

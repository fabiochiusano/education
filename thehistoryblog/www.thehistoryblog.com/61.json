It\u2019s the first new named pipe found at the site since 2009, and in contrast to most of the earlier discoveries, the name is complete: William Faldo. \n The stockholders of the Virginia Company were expecting to make a quick profit from their investment in the Jamestown settlement, but the struggling colonists could barely keep themselves alive, never mind send back the riches in minerals and trade goods the company had envisioned. They weren\u2019t even self-sufficient, having clashed with the Powhatan tribes weeks after their arrival and being saddled with a surfeit of soft-handed gentlemen rather than farmers and laborers who could have been of practical use.  \n In January of 1608, eight months after the founding of Jamestown, the Virginia Company sent a supply mission that was woefully short of necessary provisions but long on new colonists. At least this time there were more laborers and tradesmen than gentlemen on board. Pipemaker Robert Cotton was one of them.  \n Tobacco was introduced to Europe by the Spanish in the 16th century but it was Sir Walter Raleigh who popularized it in England after Ralph Lane, first governor of Virginia, gave him a long-stemmed pipe and Virginia tobacco in 1586. By the time John Rolfe, future husband of Pocahontas, planted Virginia\u2019s first commercial tobacco crop in Jamestown in 1612, smoking was widespread in England. Rolfe\u2019s first crop was sold in London in 1614. Five years later, Jamestown was exporting 10 tons of tobacco to England a year. By 1639 it was 750 tons. \n When Robert Cotton first arrived at Jamestown, there was no tobacco cash crop. His brief was to seek out new sources of clay and pipe production methods that would give the Virginia Company consumer goods they could actually make some money selling in England. The London pipemaking industry was supplied exclusively by Dorset white clay. If Virginia clay could supply a colonial pipemaking enterprise, the Virginia Company could break the Dorset monopoly. \n While there are no surviving documents mentioning Robert Cotton other than the passenger list of the First Supply mission, archaeological evidence of his work has survived. Since 2006, archaeologists have unearthed more than 1,550 fragments of pipes made by Robert Cotton. They were found in a well, probably discards that failed during the manufacturing process. Cotton combined the tulip-shaped bowl of Virginia Indian pipes with English technology and decorative elements to create a unique design not found in any other early Virginia colonies. The Virginia clay wasn\u2019t the pristine white of Dorset\u2019s or fired at the same high heat, but Cotton\u2019s handmade work (he did not use molds to make these pipes) was appealing and saleable. \n Many were stamped with a diamond shape maker\u2019s mark and fleurs-de-lis. A few of them were inscribed with the names of influential people stamped into the clay with printer\u2019s type. Nine pipes were found with names or enough of a name to be identifiable, all of them officials of the Virginia Company or high-powered courtiers: Sir Charles Howard, lord high admiral of the English Navy, famed explorer and smoking trend-setter Sir Walter Raleigh, the Earl of Southampton, Virginia Company official and patron of Shakespeare whose name appears on two pipes, Lord De La Warr, owner of a huge quantity of Virginia Company stock and first resident governor of Virginia, Captain Samuel Argall, ship\u2019s captain and lieutenant governor of Virginia, Captain Francis Nelson, ship\u2019s captain of the Second Supply mission, Sir Walter Cope, antiquarian and Virginia Company official, Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, Virginia Company investor and King James\u2019 secretary of state. \n It\u2019s unlikely these luminaries commissioned a Virginia pipe. Archaeologists believe the name stamping was a marketing device, a gift for investors to assuage their concerns attending Jamestown\u2019s financial prospects. William Faldo, however, was not so illustrious a personage. He may have gotten his own named pipe because he was friends with the maker. His pipe was also found in a different location, a cellar rather than a well. \n Faldo was a Swiss German member of the Society of Mines Royal who persuaded the Virginia Company that he could find silver mines in the colony. He arrived along with a group of German and Polish craftsmen in October of 1608 and quickly set out to find the mines. He was believed to have found a silver mine upstream of the falls of the James River, but before thoroughly exploring it he went back to England to secure an exclusive contract to work the mine. He returned with Governor De La Warr in 1610 after the Starving Time had driven the few survivors to abandon the  Jamestown fort. De La Warr was very keen on securing that silver, so he ordered the settlers to stay put and rebuild Jamestown. The silver was never found and Faldo was killed by Appomattox Indians that same year. \n [youtube=https://youtu.be/x6iNbq8db1w&w=430] \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0

His brief was to seek out new sources of clay and pipe production methods that would give the Virginia Company consumer goods they could actually make some money selling in England. The London pipemaking industry was supplied exclusively by Dorset white clay. If Virginia clay could supply a colonial pipemaking enterprise, the Virginia Company could break the Dorset monopoly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39157\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well.jpg 1290w\" title=\"Pipe fragments found in a Jamestown well.

Since 2006, archaeologists have unearthed more than 1,550 fragments of pipes made by Robert Cotton. They were found in a well, probably discards that failed during the manufacturing process. Cotton combined the tulip-shaped bowl of Virginia Indian pipes with English technology and decorative elements to create a unique design not found in any other early Virginia colonies. The Virginia clay wasn\u2019t the pristine white of Dorset\u2019s or fired at the same high heat, but Cotton\u2019s handmade work (he did not use molds to make these pipes) was appealing and saleable.</p>\n<p>Many were stamped with a diamond shape maker\u2019s mark and fleurs-de-lis. A few of them were inscribed with the names of influential people stamped into the clay with printer\u2019s type. Nine pipes were found with names or enough of a name to be identifiable, all of them officials of the Virginia Company or high-powered courtiers: Sir Charles Howard, lord high admiral of the English Navy, famed explorer and smoking trend-setter Sir Walter Raleigh, the Earl of Southampton, Virginia Company official and patron of Shakespeare whose name appears on two pipes, Lord De La Warr, owner of a huge quantity of Virginia Company stock and first resident governor of Virginia, Captain Samuel Argall, ship\u2019s captain and lieutenant governor of Virginia, Captain Francis Nelson, ship\u2019s captain of the Second Supply mission, Sir Walter Cope, antiquarian and Virginia Company official, Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, Virginia Company investor and King James\u2019 secretary of state.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39156\" height=\"49\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment-150x49.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment-150x49.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment-200x65.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment-430x140.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment.jpg 990w\" title=\"Earl of Southampton pipe fragment.

Archaeologists believe the name stamping was a marketing device, a gift for investors to assuage their concerns attending Jamestown\u2019s financial prospects. William Faldo, however, was not so illustrious a personage. He may have gotten his own named pipe because he was friends with the maker. His pipe was also found in a different location, a cellar rather than a well.</p>\n<p>Faldo was a Swiss German member of the Society of Mines Royal who persuaded the Virginia Company that he could find silver mines in the colony. He arrived along with a group of German and Polish craftsmen in October of 1608 and quickly set out to find the mines. He was believed to have found a silver mine upstream of the falls of the James River, but before thoroughly exploring it he went back to England to secure an exclusive contract to work the mine. He returned with Governor De La Warr in 1610 after the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25056\" target=\"_blank\">Starving Time</a> had driven the few survivors to abandon the  Jamestown fort. De La Warr was very keen on securing that silver, so he ordered the settlers to stay put and rebuild Jamestown. The silver was never found and Faldo was killed by Appomattox Indians that same year.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/x6iNbq8db1w&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"New named pipe found at Jamestown\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39155\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39155#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-39134\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39134\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The King Is Dead at Versailles\">The King Is Dead at Versailles</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, October 30th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_questre_de_Louis_XIV.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39144\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_questre_de_Louis_XIV-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_questre_de_Louis_XIV-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_questre_de_Louis_XIV-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_questre_de_Louis_XIV-430x544.jpg 430w\" title=\" Equestrian portrait of Louis XIV by Ren\u00e9-Antoine Houasse, ca. 1675. \u00a9 Chateau de Versailles (dist-RMN-Grand Palais), Christophe Fouin.\" width=\"118\"/></a>The long, drawn-out, painful death of King Louis XIV of France was thoroughly documented and published in the memoirs of some of the men who witnessed it. It was so slow that the king himself took the opportunity to plan it out thoroughly, concerned about the state of his soul and the future of his realm which he had so materially damaged with endless warfare and extravagant spending. After he finally breathed his last, the elaborate funerary traditions of the monarchy kicked in, and the political ramifications of the succession \u2014 Louis outlived his legitimate sons and grandsons leaving his five-year-old great-grandson Louis, Duke of Anjou, as heir to the throne \u2014 had to be addressed. The death of any king was of great national and international import; the death of the Sun King more so that most.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_en_cire_de_Louis_XIV.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39135\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_en_cire_de_Louis_XIV-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_en_cire_de_Louis_XIV-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_en_cire_de_Louis_XIV-200x242.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Portrait_en_cire_de_Louis_XIV-430x521.jpg 430w\" title=\"Wax portrait of Louis XIV seven years before his death by Antoine Benoist, 1706. \u00a9 Chateau de Versailles(dist-RMN-GrandPalais), Christophe Fouin.\" width=\"123\"/></a>The health of Louis XIV had been in decline for the last year of his life. Rumors abounded in the hothouse environment of the royal court at Versailles that his legs were dangerously swollen. In London wagers were laid on how long he would live. Head physician Guy-Crescent Fagon, who despite having basically bled to death Louis\u2019 beloved grandson, granddaughter-in-law and great-grandson when they were struck with measles still held the full confidence of the king and his secret wife Madame de Maintenon, insisted there was nothing seriously wrong with Louis. The king\u2019s head surgeon was not so complacent, but his appeals to Fagon and Mme de Maintenon went unheeded.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fagon.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39149\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 104px) 100vw, 104px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fagon-104x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fagon-104x150.jpg 104w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fagon-430x614.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fagon.jpg 1516w\" title=\"Gui Crescent Fagon.

Fagon chalked it up to sciatica and prescribed a purgative, but when the pain increased to the point where he couldn\u2019t even walk the short distance to Mme de Maintenon\u2019s chambers, Fagon was finally persuaded to call in consulting physicians. Mareschal was able to assuage the king\u2019s pain by rubbing the leg with hot cloths, but the relief was temporary. The physicians arrived from Paris on August 14th. They felt the king\u2019s pulse and after much discussion prescribed asses\u2019 milk which they then unprescribed because in the hours they spent yammering the king\u2019s pain had abated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mareschal.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39148\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 111px) 100vw, 111px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mareschal-111x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mareschal-111x150.jpg 111w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mareschal-200x269.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mareschal-430x579.jpg 430w\" title=\"Georges Mareschal.

The surgeon now realized the king had gangrene, that only amputation could save his life. Fagon kept his head firmly embedded in the sand. More doctors\u2019 consultations, more asses\u2019 milk, a bath in spiced Burgundy wine and other useless treatments ensued until the leg\u2019s blackened and swollen condition made it impossible for Fagon to deny that this was a surgeon\u2019s issue and Mareschal took the lead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/La_mort_de_Louis_XIV_au_palais_de_Versailles-e1446232314243.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39136\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/La_mort_de_Louis_XIV_au_palais_de_Versailles-e1446232314243-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/La_mort_de_Louis_XIV_au_palais_de_Versailles-e1446232314243-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/La_mort_de_Louis_XIV_au_palais_de_Versailles-e1446232314243-200x160.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/La_mort_de_Louis_XIV_au_palais_de_Versailles-e1446232314243-430x344.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Death of Louis XIV at the Palace of Versailles by Thomas Jones Henry Barker, ca. 1835-1840.

They took one look at the leg and knew it was just a matter of time. It was too late to amputate. Louis himself realized that he wasn\u2019t bouncing back from this one. He asked Mareschal how long he had left to live and the surgeon told him he had maybe two days. The king began to put his affairs in order. He received the last rites from the Cardinal of Rohan, had the entire court pass before his bed to give their last farewells and brought the young dauphin in to give him the benefit of his final counsel.

Wells\u2019 alien invasion classic <em>The War of the Worlds</em>. The next day was Halloween and the newspapers dutifully scaremongered, splashing sensationalized headlines on their front pages about the mass hysteria the radio program had provoked in the listening audience. There were reports of suicides, people being hospitalized for shock, heart attacks and thousands of terrified callers clogging the radio station\u2019s phone lines. Almost all of those reports have proven unfounded, although it is true that more people than usual called the station, some complaining about the show being too scary, others complimenting the show for being so scary, still others wanting to know how they could help the victims of Martian violence. </p>\n<p>One of the frightened listeners sued CBS for \u201cnervous shock\u201d, but the suit was dismissed. One man wrote to CBS claiming he had spent $3.25 of his savings for a bus ticket to flee the Martians and only heard it was play 60 miles later. He was saving up to buy a new pair of shoes, so he asked CBS to send him a pair of black men\u2019s shoes, size 9-B. Welles sent him his new shoes, against the advice of CBS\u2019 lawyer.</p>\n<p>Orson Welles had already had success on radio in 1937 as the voice of <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/1985TheStoryOfTHESHADOWRadioDocumentary\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Shadow</em></a> and on the stage with his innovative <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36345\" target=\"_blank\">Mercury Theater</a> company when CBS offered him a <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/OrsonWelles-MercuryTheater-1938Recordings#\" target=\"_blank\">one-hour anthology series</a> debuting in July 1938. This was prestige listening, adaptations of the great works of literature written and performed by a professional troupe of the New York theater. The introduction emphasized this pedigree, noting it was radio\u2019s \u201cfirst presentation of a complete theatrical producing company.\u201d Welles and his Mercury Theater cast and crew put on the works of William Shakespeare (<em>Julius Caesar</em>), Alexandre Dumas (<em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>), Charles Dickens (<em>Pickwick Papers</em>) and Robert Louis Stevenson (<em>Treasure Island</em>), among many others.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mercury-Theater-War-Of-The-Worlds-broadcast-October-30-1938.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-39128\" height=\"122\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mercury-Theater-War-Of-The-Worlds-broadcast-October-30-1938-200x122.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mercury-Theater-War-Of-The-Worlds-broadcast-October-30-1938-200x122.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mercury-Theater-War-Of-The-Worlds-broadcast-October-30-1938-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mercury-Theater-War-Of-The-Worlds-broadcast-October-30-1938-430x262.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mercury Theater's &quot;The War Of The Worlds&quot; broadcast, October 30, 1938.\" width=\"200\"/></a>It is true that Welles deliberately set out to give his version of <em>The War of the Worlds</em> a realistic news story staging complete with expert commentary, witness interviews and fake reports from military honchos. It wasn\u2019t a hoax, though; just a way of giving the show a fresh, dynamic immediacy and give the audience a nice little scare for Halloween. Still, CBS was concerned that people might confuse it with real news, so they made sure there were disclaimers not just before the opening of the program, but also at the 40 and 55 minute marks.</p>\n<p>The show opened with what sounded like standard radio programming \u2014 a weather report followed by an orchestra playing music in a hotel ballroom \u2014 that was suddenly interrupted by a special new bulletin reporting explosions of hydrogen gas on Mars. Then it was back to the sleepy dance music, then another special bulletin, then back to the orchestra, then another break away to an astronomer describing what he saw on Mars. The tension grew from there as reports got more and more dramatic and the regular programming of music kept getting cut off after a few bars. </p>\n<p>The other Mercury Theater broadcasts were more traditional radio plays. Welles\u2019 twist for <em>The War of the Worlds</em> was to use radio conventions to convey the confusion and terror of the original story. He had the cast listen to WLS radio reporter Herbert Morrison\u2019s real-time description of the Hindenburg disaster, still famous today for its \u201cOh the humanity!\u201d anguish, to get that genuine feeling of a newsman\u2019s increasing horror as tragedy unfolds before him. Cast member Frank Readick played that role to perfection. </p>\n<p>The Halloween headlines condemned Orson Welles as a hoaxster and instigator of widespread panic. It was enough to scare CBS into calling a hasty press conference at which Welles expressed his deep regret, insisting he had no idea anybody would take it seriously. </p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/uuEGiruAFSw&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>He may or may not have been genuinely contrite (his expression around the 5:35 mark reminds me of Puss in Boots\u2019 big-eyed hat-in-hand look from <em>Shrek</em>), but the story vaulted him to national fame, secured a sponsor (Campbell\u2019s Soup) and <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/otr_campbellplayhouse\" target=\"_blank\">another two years</a> of the radio show. It\u2019s also the reason RKO Studios gave Orson Welles an unprecedented two-movie contract granting him complete artistic control of his pictures. Without <em>The War of the Worlds</em>, there would have been no <em>Citizen Kane</em>.</p>\n<p>The broadcast still holds up, even though reporters don\u2019t talk like that anymore. The sound effects \u2014 especially the panicked crowd noises \u2014 are great and the adaptation remains one of exceptional dexterity and verve. Listen for yourself and see what you think. Would have spent all your shoe money on a ticket out of town if you had heard this 77 years ago?</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"121\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://archive.org/embed/OrsonWellesMrBruns\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Don\u2019t panic!

Last month Poulsen was installing a fiber-optic network on the Danish island of Om\u00f8 when he struck up conversation with farmer Hans Peder Tofte. Tofte told him that as a boy he had found a silver ring on his property. Intrigued, Robert took his metal detector to the field and discovered several silver fragments and silver coins. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-fragment-wrapped-around-coins.-Tobias-Bondesson..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39109\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-fragment-wrapped-around-coins.-Tobias-Bondesson.-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-fragment-wrapped-around-coins.-Tobias-Bondesson.-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-fragment-wrapped-around-coins.-Tobias-Bondesson.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-fragment-wrapped-around-coins.-Tobias-Bondesson.-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Silver fragment folded over coins.

With funding from the Danish Agency for Culture, the museum arranged for a more thorough exploration of the field.

The field has been ploughed for hundreds of years, however, so if there was a container, it has long since been destroyed and/or rotted away. The team dug beneath the ploughed soil just in case, but all they found was clean sand. There are no indications of an individual house or settlement in the area. It appears that the treasure was simply buried in a field.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harald-Bluetooth-cross-coin-975-980.-Tobias-Bondesson.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39111\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harald-Bluetooth-cross-coin-975-980.-Tobias-Bondesson-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harald-Bluetooth-cross-coin-975-980.-Tobias-Bondesson-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harald-Bluetooth-cross-coin-975-980.-Tobias-Bondesson-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harald-Bluetooth-cross-coin-975-980.-Tobias-Bondesson-430x430.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harald-Bluetooth-cross-coin-975-980.-Tobias-Bondesson.jpg 1320w\" title=\"Harald Bluetooth cross-coin 975 - 980.

There are multiple coins from the reign of Harald Bluetooth. Minted between 975 and 980 A.D, the Harald Bluetooth cross-coins are considered the first Danish coins. They are so thin that the design on one side shows through on the other, and the silver content and weight are so low that metal detectors can\u2019t detect them. Any find of Bluetooth coins, therefore, is always archaeologically significant.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-denar-minted-in-Prague.-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39107\" height=\"68\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-denar-minted-in-Prague.-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland.-150x68.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-denar-minted-in-Prague.-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland.-150x68.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-denar-minted-in-Prague.-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland.-200x91.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Silver-denar-minted-in-Prague.-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland.-430x197.jpg 430w\" title=\"Silver denar minted in Prague.

Led by University of Cincinnati archaeologists Jack Davis and Sharon Stocker, the international team was excavating a previously unexplored field next to the Palace of Nestor. They chose to dig in a place where three stones were visible on the ground, thinking they were the remains of a Bronze Age house. They soon realized those stones were the top of a shaft tomb. After two weeks of digging, archaeologists hit gold, figuratively, that is. Literally they hit bronze, but that was just the beginning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hilt-of-Minoan-sword-with-beads-scattered.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39088\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hilt-of-Minoan-sword-with-beads-scattered-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hilt-of-Minoan-sword-with-beads-scattered-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hilt-of-Minoan-sword-with-beads-scattered-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hilt-of-Minoan-sword-with-beads-scattered-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold hilt of Minoan sword with beads.

To the left of his chest was a sword three feet long with an ivory hilt overlaid with gold. Underneath the sword was a dagger with a gold hilt in the same embroidery-like technique found on the long sword. To his right were jewels, among them a hoard of more than 1,000 beads of carnelian, amethyst, gold, agate, jasper and gold, most of them drilled through so they could be strung together. Small fragments of a cross-woven textile suggests some of the beads decorated a burial shroud. Near the beads were four solid gold rings, the most that have ever been discovered in a single burial in Greece, plus six silver cups and an assortment of bronze vessels, some with gold or silver trim.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30-inch-necklace-with-two-gold-pendants-on-each-end-decorated-with-ivy-leaves.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39081\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30-inch-necklace-with-two-gold-pendants-on-each-end-decorated-with-ivy-leaves-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30-inch-necklace-with-two-gold-pendants-on-each-end-decorated-with-ivy-leaves-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30-inch-necklace-with-two-gold-pendants-on-each-end-decorated-with-ivy-leaves-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/30-inch-necklace-with-two-gold-pendants-on-each-end-decorated-with-ivy-leaves-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Necklace after cleaning.

Pylos was thought to be a bit of a backwater compared to the grand city of 30,000, but the ultra-rich graves of Mycenae were multiple burials. The discovery of the wealthiest single burial in ever found in Greece in Pylos means historians may have to revise their understanding of the town\u2019s ancient importance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gold-signet-ring-with-bull-vaulters.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39082\" height=\"104\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gold-signet-ring-with-bull-vaulters-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gold-signet-ring-with-bull-vaulters-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gold-signet-ring-with-bull-vaulters-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gold-signet-ring-with-bull-vaulters-430x298.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold Minoan signet ring with bull and bull dancers.

The multiple burials made it difficult for archaeologists to identify which artifacts belonged to which person. One hypothesis was that the grave goods could be divided by gender \u2014 men get the weapons, women get the combs and beads \u2014 but this discovery shows that a gender division doesn\u2019t work because the man was buried with every kind of artifact under the sun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/meter-long-slashing-sword-with-an-ivory-handle-covered-with-gold.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39086\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/meter-long-slashing-sword-with-an-ivory-handle-covered-with-gold-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/meter-long-slashing-sword-with-an-ivory-handle-covered-with-gold-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/meter-long-slashing-sword-with-an-ivory-handle-covered-with-gold-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/meter-long-slashing-sword-with-an-ivory-handle-covered-with-gold-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/meter-long-slashing-sword-with-an-ivory-handle-covered-with-gold.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Meter-long slashing sword with an ivory handle covered with gold.

Nor is it the grave of his father, Neleus. This find may be even more important because the warrior pre-dates the time of Nestor and Neleus by, perhaps, 200 or 300 years. That means he was likely an important figure at a time when this part of Greece was being indelibly shaped by close contact with Crete, Europe\u2019s first advanced civilization.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thus, the tomb may have held a powerful warrior or king \u2014 or even a trader or a raider \u2014 who died at about 30 to 35 years of age but who helped to lay the foundations of the Mycenaean culture that later flourished in the region.</p>\n<p>Davis speculates, \u201cWhoever he was, he seems to have been celebrated for his trading or fighting in nearby island of Crete and for his appreciation of the more-sophisticated and delicate are of the Minoan civilization (found on Crete), with which he was buried.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fine-toothed-ivory-comb-about-six-inches-long..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39084\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fine-toothed-ivory-comb-about-six-inches-long.-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fine-toothed-ivory-comb-about-six-inches-long.-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fine-toothed-ivory-comb-about-six-inches-long.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fine-toothed-ivory-comb-about-six-inches-long.-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Decorated fine-toothed ivory comb about six inches long.

Image courtesy Steve Langdon.\" width=\"196\"/></a>In 1931, star of stage and screen John Barrymore sailed to Alaska aboard his new 120-foot yacht the <em>Infanta</em>. His purpose was to hunt Kodiak bear, but he took a different kind of trophy when he visited the village of Tuxecan on Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska: a totem pole 25 feet high. Barrymore had the pole sawn down leaving just a stump behind, then had it sawn into three sections to make it easier to carry on the deck of his yacht. Once home, the actor installed the totem pole on the grounds of his Beverly Hills estate, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-home-20150913-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bella Vista</a>. </p>\n<p>Tuxecan had been abandoned 30 years earlier when a clan leader convinced the Tlingit tribe members who lived there to move south to the town of Klawock where there was a new school and the state\u2019s first cannery. They left behind a forest of totem poles which the villagers occasionally returned to tend to, but over time began to tip over and decay, a process that the Tlingit held to be part of the natural lifecycle of <em>kooteeyaa</em> (totem poles).</p>\n<p>Tlingit totem poles were carved from single trunks of Western red cedar and raised outside people\u2019s homes. The animals from a clan\u2019s crest were carved on the poles, but each one had a different combination of figures and a different meaning. They celebrated family history, could commemorate a person or event or broadcast a wrong done to the pole\u2019s owner. Some were funerary monuments that included the ashes of the dead in bentwood boxes placed in niches in the back the pole. While the were not objects of religious veneration per se, they were and are held to be sacred.</p>\n<p>The higher the pole, the more prestigious it was. The highest poles in Tuxecan reached 30 feet or so, which means the 25-footer Barrymore stole was a very important piece in its day. Its importance has only increased with the passage of time and the loss of almost all of the more than 100 totem poles that once graced Tuxecan. Only two other original totem poles survived, moved to Klawock along with the tribe at the turn of the last century. </p>\n<p>The totem pole makes an ominous appearance in Gene Fowler\u2019s biography of John Barrymore, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Good-Night-Sweet-Prince-Barrymore/dp/0916515567/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1445893117&amp;sr=1-3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Good Night, Sweet Prince</em></a>. Barrymore was warned that removing the totem pole would bring him back luck, and Barrymore, who had an interest in diverse religious traditions, was somewhat concerned that the tribal gods \u201cmight take a notion into their whimsical noggins to wreak vengeance on the thief.\u201d If they did, they used his preexisting alcohol addiction to get to him. John Barrymore died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1942.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Vincent-Price-on-his-patio.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-39057\" height=\"245\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Vincent-Price-on-his-patio-200x245.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Vincent-Price-on-his-patio-200x245.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Vincent-Price-on-his-patio-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Vincent-Price-on-his-patio-430x527.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Vincent-Price-on-his-patio.jpg 979w\" title=\"Vincent Price, his wife Mary and the totem pole on his patio.

Altman sold it in the 1950s to actor, art historian and dedicated collector Vincent Price who had it installed next to his patio in his quarter-acre backyard in Benedict Canyon. Price loved it dearly, including photos of it in his books and showing it off to Edward R. Murrow in a 1958 episode of <em>Person to Person</em>. He described it in his memoirs as \u201csculptural and dignified and beautiful\u201d with \u201cits lovely warm browns and reds still glowing on the three great figures which compose its height. At the bottom a great bear-like creature, paws pleading; and on his head, a pale lean man who holds before him a gigantic fish which reaches from his shoulders to his toes; and on his head, hawk-nosed and savage, crouches a great bird, his tail behind him abristle with red feathers made of shingling.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Top-section-on-display-in-Kinau-Courtyard-1985.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39056\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Top-section-on-display-in-Kinau-Courtyard-1985-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Top-section-on-display-in-Kinau-Courtyard-1985-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Top-section-on-display-in-Kinau-Courtyard-1985-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Top-section-on-display-in-Kinau-Courtyard-1985-430x544.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Top-section-on-display-in-Kinau-Courtyard-1985.jpg 947w\" title=\"Top section of the totem pole on display in the Kinau Courtyard in 1985.

The museum didn\u2019t have space to exhibit the entire pole, so the top third was on display in the museum\u2019s Kinau Courtyard while the rest was kept in climate-controlled storage. The top third joined its two brothers in storage 12 years ago when it was taken down during a renovation.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, University of Alaska Anchorage anthropology professor and Tlingit expert Steve Langdon stumbled on the totem pole in the 1990s while researching the Tlingit villages of Prince of Wales Island in a Ketchikan museum. He was looking through some old photographs when he came across a snapshot of Vincent Price standing in front of the totem pole. The cactuses indicated that this picture had not been taken in Alaska. Langdon consulted with Jonathan Rowan, a carver and cultural educator from Klawock, who helped him identify the pole in photographs of Tuxecan from the late 19th century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tlingit-tribe-member-Jonathan-Rowan-speaks-about-significance-of-totem-pole.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39055\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tlingit-tribe-member-Jonathan-Rowan-speaks-about-significance-of-totem-pole-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tlingit-tribe-member-Jonathan-Rowan-speaks-about-significance-of-totem-pole-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tlingit-tribe-member-Jonathan-Rowan-speaks-about-significance-of-totem-pole-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tlingit-tribe-member-Jonathan-Rowan-speaks-about-significance-of-totem-pole-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Jonathan Rowan and the top third of the totem pole during the repatriation ceremony at the Honolulu Museum of Art.

Marco Garcia/AP\" width=\"150\"/></a>Once home, the totem pole will be studied by Rowan and other experts in an attempt to identify which clan it originally belonged to and whether it was a mortuary monument. Altman told Price that it was, that the yacht crew members who cut it down \u201cthrew Mom and Dad in the creek\u201d before sawing it in three.

At a press conference on Wednesday, October 21st, a committee of politicians and scientists announced they\u2019ll be <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11945845/Italians-identify-five-locations-where-fabled-Roman-treasure-hoard-may-be-buried.html\" target=\"_blank\">searching for the legendary treasure-filled tomb of Alaric I</a>, king of the Visigoths, under a river flowing through Cosenza, a city in the region of Calabria near the toe of Italy\u2019s boot.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a real-life Indiana Jones hunt,\u201d said Francesco Sisci, the project coordinator.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a legend of long-lost treasure, even the Nazis \u2013 Heinrich Himmler came here in 1937 to try to find the hoard for Hitler.

This scheme is the brain child of a committee formed last year by the municipality of Cosenza to develop new cultural and touristic events around the legend of Alaric. The tomb doesn\u2019t actually have to be found, therefore, in order for the search to fulfill its ultimate goal of promoting Consenza\u2019s greatest claim to fame. Which is a good thing, because the odds of finding said tomb are so miniscule they make the Richard III parking lot excavation look like a sure shot.</p>\n<p>Alaric, once a leader of a band of Gothic <em>foederati</em> (irregular troops who fought with the Roman army) under Emperor Theodosius I, has gone down in history as the first invader to sack Rome in 800 years, since the Gaul Brennus in 387 B.C. Rome wasn\u2019t actually the capital anymore when Alaric took it in 410 A.D., however. It hadn\u2019t been since 286 when Diocletian made Mediolanum (modern-day Milan) the capital of the Western Empire. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Solidus-of-Honorius-Ravenna-mint-struck-AD-402-406.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39045\" height=\"69\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Solidus-of-Honorius-Ravenna-mint-struck-AD-402-406-150x69.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Solidus-of-Honorius-Ravenna-mint-struck-AD-402-406-150x69.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Solidus-of-Honorius-Ravenna-mint-struck-AD-402-406-200x92.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Solidus-of-Honorius-Ravenna-mint-struck-AD-402-406-430x198.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Solidus-of-Honorius-Ravenna-mint-struck-AD-402-406.jpg 1576w\" title=\"Gold solidus of Honorius, struck at  Ravenna mint, 402-406 A.D.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Alaric besieged Mediolanum during his first invasion of Italy in 401, spurring the young and feckless Western Roman emperor Honorius to move the capital to Ravenna in 402 because it was surrounded by marshes, well-fortified and had direct access to the Adriatic, ideal should a hasty escape become necessary. His personal safety was his only interest. The new capital was horribly situated to protect Italy from barbarian invaders. It was only through the efforts of Flavius Stilicho, Honorius\u2019 top general and former regent during the emperor\u2019s minority, that Alaric\u2019s army was kept at bay on multiple occasions from 401 until 408 when Honorius had Stilicho arrested and executed, ostensibly for conspiring to overthrow him.</p>\n<p>In the first decade of the 5th century, Alaric besieged Rome three times, but he wasn\u2019t just in it for the pillage and loot. He wanted the emperor to appoint him commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army and grant him huge tracts of land in Pannonia. Putting pressure on Rome, which while no longer the capital was still seat of the Senate and the symbolic center of the empire, was a means to those ends. The first siege after Stilicho\u2019s death in late 408, ended with a massive payoff. According to <a href=\"http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus05_book5.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Zosimus\u2019 <em>New History</em></a>, the Senate gave Alaric 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver, 4,000 silk robes, 3,000 fleeces dyed scarlet in exchange for him lifting the siege.</p>\n<p>One year later Alaric\u2019s forces besieged Rome again after the failure of negotiations with Honorius. This time only the proclamation of a new emperor would do to get Alaric to lift the siege, and so Priscus Attalus was installed as puppet. While Attalus and Alaric had some military successes in Italy, enough to scare Honorius into preparing a flight to Constantinople, they soon hit the wall and Alaric dumped his puppet less than a year after installing him. He tried negotiating with Honorius again, but gave up for good after a sneak attack from Honorius\u2019 Goth ally Sarus when Alaric was waiting to meet the emperor at the appointed time.</p>\n<p>On August 24th, 410 A.D., the Visigoths reached the Salarian Gate of Rome. This time there was no siege. Alaric\u2019s army spent three days sacking Rome, but it was quite respectful, as sacks go. They didn\u2019t set it on fire \u2014 only a few public buildings were burned down for strategic reasons \u2014 and they spared the churches of Saint Peter and Paul. They didn\u2019t indiscriminately kill people either, although they enslaved thousands. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Burial-of-Alaric-in-the-Bed-of-the-Busentinus-H.-Leutmann.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39044\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 148px) 100vw, 148px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Burial-of-Alaric-in-the-Bed-of-the-Busentinus-H.-Leutmann-148x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Burial-of-Alaric-in-the-Bed-of-the-Busentinus-H.-Leutmann-148x150.jpg 148w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Burial-of-Alaric-in-the-Bed-of-the-Busentinus-H.-Leutmann-200x202.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Burial-of-Alaric-in-the-Bed-of-the-Busentinus-H.-Leutmann-430x435.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Burial-of-Alaric-in-the-Bed-of-the-Busentinus-H.-Leutmann.jpg 1282w\" title=\"Burial of Alaric in the Bed of the Busentinus, by H. Leutmann, 1890\" width=\"148\"/></a>Laden with the treasures of 800 years of Roman history, the Visigoths turned south where Alaric hoped to cross over into Sicily and from there to Africa, the granary of the empire. His fleet destroyed by storms, he never did make it to Sicily. A few months after the sack, Alaric suddenly became ill and died in Consentia. Jordanes describes the aftermath in his 6th century history of the Gothic people <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/gothichistoryofj00jorduoft#page/94/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Getica</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>His people mourned for him with the utmost affection. Then turning from its course the river Busentus near the city of Consentia \u2014 for this stream flows with its wholesome waters from the foot of a mountain near that city \u2014 they led a band of captives into the midst of its bed to dig out a place for his grave. In the depths of this pit they buried Alaric, together with many treasures, and then turned the waters back into their channel. And that none might ever know the place, they put to death all the diggers. </p></blockquote>\n<p>So. That is what the Cosenza search is up against: a tomb rumored to have been dug underneath a river in a location known only to slaves killed before they could share that knowledge. Past attempts to find the fabled treasure have all involved digging along the riverbank, a blind, clumsy approach that this new effort will eschew in favor of the latest technology. </p>\n<blockquote><p>By matching contemporary accounts by Roman historians with the local geography, the researchers have found five places where they think the treasure may lie. They include a 1.5 mile stretch of river that runs through Cosenza but also caves near the nearby village of Mendicino. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The latest technology will be used to search for rectangle-shaped \u201canomalies\u201d underground in the hunt for the fabled tomb of Alaric, said Amerigo Giuseppe Rota, the geologist leading the project.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe think Alaric was buried at least five to six metres underground. But in the last 1,500 years the river bed has risen by about 1.5 metres, so his tomb could be up to eight metres below ground now,\u201d he said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sure, why not? It could be. It could also not exist at all. The whole diverted river story could be a legend written 140 years after the events it purports to describe. The idea that there are 25 tons of gold under the Busento River is fanciful at best. The Visigoths would not have buried all of their Roman loot with Alaric. Even if the sources are correct that he was buried with his horse and treasure according to pagan custom (Alaric was an Arian Christian, but he held to some of his people\u2019s traditional religious practices as well), they would have been grave goods, not tons and tons of gold.</p>\n<p>Anyway the caper isn\u2019t expected to cost much. The early geophysical surveys were funded by private donors and while there\u2019s talk of the government in Rome chipping in, public funding isn\u2019t likely to materialize anytime soon.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Raiders of Alaric\u2019s lost tomb\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39042\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39042#comments\">16 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38973\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38973\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Carlo Crivelli: the best Renaissance painter you\u2019ve never heard of\">Carlo Crivelli: the best Renaissance painter you\u2019ve never heard of</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, October 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MFA_SC185659_2048px.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39018\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 93px) 100vw, 93px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MFA_SC185659_2048px-93x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MFA_SC185659_2048px-93x150.jpg 93w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MFA_SC185659_2048px-187x300.jpg 187w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MFA_SC185659_2048px-430x688.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MFA_SC185659_2048px.jpg 1179w\" title=\"Carlo Crivelli, The Dead Christ with the Virgin, St. John, and St. Mary Magdalene, 1485, on panel, 88.3 x 53 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Anonymous Gift and Julia Bradford Huntington James Fund, 02.4, Photograph \u00a9 2015 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\" width=\"93\"/></a>The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston has opened the first monographic exhibition in the United States of the works of Carlo Crivelli, a Venetian artist of the 15th century whose genius has been unjustly neglected, overshadowed by his more famous (and more Florentine) contemporaries. </p>\n<p>Born in Venice to a family of painters in around 1430-35, Carlo Crivelli\u2019s first appears in the historical record in 1457, and he was already an independent master by then and therefore at least 25 years old. The record in question documents the scandal that drove Carlo out of Venice. On March 7th, 1457, the prosecutor asked the Council of Forty, the Republic of Venice\u2019s version of the Supreme Court, to pass sentence on Carlo Crivelli for adultery. Apparently he was having an affair with Tarsia, wife of a sailor named Francesco Cortese. He had spirited her away from Francesco\u2019s brother\u2019s house and for months had \u201ccarnal knowledge of her in contempt of God and holy matrimony.\u201d Carlo was sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of 200 lire. That was actually a relatively light sentence for the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NGA_London_NG739_ART374727_2048px.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39020\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NGA_London_NG739_ART374727_2048px-106x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NGA_London_NG739_ART374727_2048px-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NGA_London_NG739_ART374727_2048px-200x282.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NGA_London_NG739_ART374727_2048px-430x606.jpg 430w\" title=\"Carlo Crivelli, The Annunciation with Saint Emidius, 1486, on canvas, 207 x 146.7 cm, National Gallery of Art, London, Presented by Lord Taunton, 1864, Photo: \u00a9 National Gallery, London / Art Resource, NY\" width=\"106\"/></a>After he served his time, Carlo went to Padua where he worked in Francesco Squarcione\u2019s studio. Squarcione was the first artist to market himself as a teacher of the new Renaissance style, imparting lessons in linear perspective and assiduously collecting antiquities to give his students classical models to copy. Andrea Mantegna had apprenticed under Squarcione in the 1440s, and the master\u2019s obsession with Roman antiquity was thoroughly inculcated into the pupil. Mantegna and Crivelli share an intense attention to architectural detail, the use of forced perspective and a bold, black outline that gives forms a chiseled sharpness. Crivelli may even have studied under Mantegna briefly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Saint-George-Slaying-the-Dragon-Carlo-Crivelli.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38987\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 78px) 100vw, 78px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Saint-George-Slaying-the-Dragon-Carlo-Crivelli-78x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Saint-George-Slaying-the-Dragon-Carlo-Crivelli-78x150.jpg 78w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Saint-George-Slaying-the-Dragon-Carlo-Crivelli-156x300.jpg 156w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Saint-George-Slaying-the-Dragon-Carlo-Crivelli-416x800.jpg 416w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Saint-George-Slaying-the-Dragon-Carlo-Crivelli.jpg 1249w\" title=\"Saint George Slaying the Dragon by Carlo Crivelli, after restoration.

By 1468, he was in Le Marche, a region of central Italy on the Adriatic coast, where he would remain until his death in around 1494.  Most of his surviving works and all of the ones he explicitly dated were painted during his years in Le Marche. He received prestigious commissions for religious works, primarily altarpieces, the largest and most elaborate of which were the monumental high altarpieces for the cathedrals of Ascoli Piceno and Camerino.  The pieces on display at the Gardner were on the main not composed as individual works but rather as sections of altarpieces that at some point were sawn apart and sold separately to collections and museums in Europe and the United States.

To that he added a detailed realism, painstakingly rendering every textile, brick and hair to a degree unmatched by any one of his Italian peers. To create the illusion of depth, dimension and texture, he took trompe l\u2019oeil to new heights by creating gemstones, the ornamental features of armor, brocades and silks, even tears, in gesso, and then covering them with paint and gold leaf. He added more decorative details to gilded areas with a punch or stylus, given them palpable texture. He combined still life with the garlands of ancient sarcophaguses and created a swag of ripe, luscious, oversized fruits or placed individual pieces \u2014 his signature cucumber crops up practically everywhere \u2014 in panel after panel.

Florence-centric Vasari didn\u2019t include him in his seminal biography of the artists and he was consistently overlooked until the 19th century when the Pre-Raphaelites rediscovered him. Revival or no, mainstream critics still pooh-poohed Crivelli as a throwback of sorts, too enamoured of the old-fashioned medieval style to be worth emulating. This is from an 1863 article about the \u201cLondon Art Scene\u201d <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5to6AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA73\" target=\"_blank\">in <em>Blackwood\u2019s Edinburgh Magazine</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Its manner is severe, hard, quaint, and even fantastic. It is remarkable for elaboration of detail. And as a further characteristic of the school, or rather of the individual master, should be observed the introduction of gold not only in the background, but extending even to the gilding of the dress and the illumination of the hair. Making allowance for the period when painted, this is truly a glorious work ; but to revive this obsolete style, as attempted in Germany and England, except, perhaps, for strict architectural decoration, were certainly a monstrous mistake, of which we imagine our artists are by this time thoroughly convinced.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harvard_309433_2048px.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39014\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harvard_309433_2048px-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harvard_309433_2048px-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harvard_309433_2048px-430x571.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Harvard_309433_2048px.jpg 1542w\" title=\"Carlo Crivelli, Saint Peter, about 1470, Brown ink, brown wash and white gouache on cream antique laid paper, 205 x 155 mm, Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Bequest of Charles A.

Four of the six panels from the Porto San Giorgio altarpiece, one of which is the Gardner\u2019s <em>Saint George</em>, have been reunited in the show.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Verona_873_2048px.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39030\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Verona_873_2048px-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Verona_873_2048px-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Verona_873_2048px-200x290.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Verona_873_2048px-430x623.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Verona_873_2048px.jpg 1412w\" title=\"Carlo Crivelli, Virgin and Child with Infants Bearing Symbols of the Passion, about 1460, on panel, 71 x 48 cm, Museo di Castelvecchio, Verona, Archivio fotografico, Photo: Matteo Vajenti, Venice\" width=\"103\"/></a><em>Ornament and Illusion: Carlo Crivelli of Venice</em> runs through January 26th, 2016.

G\u00f8ran Olsen was hiking an ancient trail in Haukeli, south central Norway, when he sat down to take a break and caught a glimpse of the sword under a pile of rocks. The single-edged blade is 77 centimeters (30 inches) long and made of wrought iron. It is of a type that was common around 750-800 A.D.</p>\n<p>The trail where the sword was found crossed a mountain plateau between western and eastern Norway. Most of the year the pass is covered in snow and ice, and the climate during summer months when the snows have melted allowing the trail to be easily hiked is low in humidity. This combination helped maintain the condition of the sword, leaving it a bit rusty and dulled, but otherwise remarkably well-preserved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe sword was found in very good condition. It is very special to get into a sword that is merely lacking its grip,\u201d said Hordaland County, Norway, archeologist Jostein Aksdal. \u201cWhen the snow has gone in spring, we will check the place where the sword was found. If we find several objects, or a tomb, perhaps we can find the story behind the sword. This was a common sword in western Norway, but it was a costly weapon, and the owner must have used it to show power.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Finding an associated gravesite would be a very lucky break, but odds are long. Other artifacts have been found along the trail before. It\u2019s possible that the sword may have been inadvertently lost by a traveler or someone who was caught in bad weather and died of frostbite. There could easily be no grave to be found.</p>\n<p>The blade has been sent to the University Museum of Bergen, Norway, for conservation and eventual display. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe are really happy that this person found the sword and gave it to us,\u201d said County Conservator Per Morten Ekerhovd. \u201cIt will shed light on our early history. It\u2019s a very (important) example of the Viking age.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/viking-sword.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-38990\" height=\"322\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/viking-sword-430x322.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/viking-sword-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/viking-sword-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/viking-sword-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/viking-sword.jpg 1368w\" title=\"Viking sword ca. 750-800 A.D.

The picture was taken the morning of April 15th, 1912, by M. Linoenewald, Chief Steward of the German liner <em>Prinz Adalbert</em> a few miles south of where the <em>Titanic</em> had gone down taking 1,517 souls with her just hours earlier. The news of the disaster hadn\u2019t reached the liner yet, but the Chief Steward noticed red paint on the iceberg and took the photo out of interest.</p>\n<p>You can\u2019t see the paint in the picture. It is described in a brief statement signed by the Chief Steward and three other crewmen:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOn the day after the sinking of the Titanic, the steamer Prinz Adalbert passes the iceberg shown in this photograph. The Titanic disaster was not yet known by us. On one side red paint was plainly visible, which has the appearance of having been made by the scraping of a vessel on the iceberg.

Photo courtesy Henry Aldridge &amp; Son/PA Wire.\" width=\"200\"/></a>This isn\u2019t the only picture of an iceberg suspect taken in the aftermath of the <em>Titanic</em>\u2018s demise. Captain William De Carteret of the <em>Minia</em> captured another possible candidate while searching for bodies. The <em>Minia</em> was a cable ship owned by Western Union which normally laid submarine cable for telegraph and was the second of four ships chartered by White Star as recovery vessels after the disaster. It reached the North Atlantic wreck site on April 26th, four days after the first recovery ship, the <em>Mackay-Bennett</em>, and searched through May 3rd.</p>\n<p>Captain De Carteret took the photograph of the iceberg with a red gash along the base. According to him and the ship\u2019s logs, that was the only iceberg encountered near the site of the collision. The Reverend Henry Ward Cunningham, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://thechronicleherald.ca/titanic/archive/82763-the-cable-ship-minia-arrived-early-this-morning-with-fifteen-bodies-from-scene\" target=\"_blank\">told the press</a> he had seen two icebergs and that the officers told him they\u2019d seen more in the distance. The <em>Minia</em> searched a wide area, however, so the Captain likely snapped a photograph of the only iceberg he\u2019d seen that was where the ship actually went down rather than the many miles over which the bodies floated, drawn towards the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Carteret-iceberg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38961\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Carteret-iceberg-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Carteret-iceberg-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Carteret-iceberg-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Carteret-iceberg-430x290.jpg 430w\" title=\"Iceberg photographed by Captain De Carteret at the wreck site in late April, 1912. Image courtesy U.S. Coast Guard archive.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The crew of the <em>Minia</em> <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-bodies-minia/\" target=\"_blank\">recovered 17 bodies</a> from the wreck site, among them Charles Melville Hays, President of the Grand Trunk Railway, but most of the deceased had no identification. The bodies were found miles apart, the last two recovered 45 miles away from each other. All were wearing life belts and according to the ship\u2019s doctor, only one of them had water in the lungs indicating drowning. Fourteen died from exposure, two apparently from trauma during the wreck. The bodies of two unidentified firemen were buried at sea in a solemn ceremony. The other 15 were brought to Halifax.</p>\n<p>The photograph taken by the Chief Steward of the <em>Prinz Adalbert</em> doesn\u2019t match the survivors\u2019 description of the iceberg as well as De Carteret\u2019s does, but the descriptions are vague and contradictory. It\u2019s of historical significance either way because it was taken so soon after the disaster and because it played a role in the legal fallout. Hamburg American Lines officials gave the photograph to the company lawyer, Charles Burlingham, partner at Burlingham, Montgomery &amp; Beecher, when they heard that the firm was representing the White Star Line. Burlingham, Montgomery &amp; Beecher represented White Star at the US Senate hearing and in the many lawsuits brought by survivors in America. </p>\n<p>They did their job well since a 1914 US Supreme Court decision, written by Oliver Wendell Holmes, determined that the US Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 applied to the British company and that therefore their total liability was the value of whatever remained of the ship and its cargo, ie, 14 lifeboats valued at $4,520, plus $93,252 in ticket sales and freight charges. Because of the monster shitstorm of bad publicity, White Star ended up settling with the many, many US claimants \u2014 survivors suing for loss of property and trauma; family members for the loss of their loved ones \u2014 for a grand total of $664,000.</p>\n<p>Burlingham, Montgomery &amp; Beecher kept the iceberg picture on the boardroom wall for almost 90 years, from 1913 until the firm went out of business in 2002. The four remaining lawyers who were partners of the firm when it closed are the joint owners of the photograph offering it for sale. It is <a href=\"http://www.henry-aldridge.co.uk/catalogues/2015/ss241015/lot0209.html\" target=\"_blank\">estimated to sell</a> for \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000 ($15,000 \u2013 $23,000).</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Photo of iceberg that may have sunk the Titanic for sale\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38959\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38959#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2015/10/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

It\u2019s the first new named pipe found at the site since 2009, and in contrast to most of the earlier discoveries, the name is complete: William Faldo.</p>\n<p>The stockholders of the Virginia Company were expecting to make a quick profit from their investment in the Jamestown settlement, but the struggling colonists could barely keep themselves alive, never mind send back the riches in minerals and trade goods the company had envisioned. They weren\u2019t even self-sufficient, having clashed with the Powhatan tribes weeks after their arrival and being saddled with a surfeit of soft-handed gentlemen rather than farmers and laborers who could have been of practical use. </p>\n<p>In January of 1608, eight months after the founding of Jamestown, the Virginia Company <a href=\"http://historicjamestowne.org/history/history-of-jamestown/the-first-supply/\" target=\"_blank\">sent a supply mission</a> that was woefully short of necessary provisions but long on new colonists. At least this time there were more laborers and tradesmen than gentlemen on board. Pipemaker Robert Cotton was one of them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Robert-Cotton-pipes.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39158\" height=\"44\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Robert-Cotton-pipes-150x44.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Robert-Cotton-pipes-150x44.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Robert-Cotton-pipes-200x59.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Robert-Cotton-pipes-430x128.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Robert-Cotton-pipes.jpg 1240w\" title=\"Robert Cotton pipes.

By the time John Rolfe, future husband of Pocahontas, planted Virginia\u2019s first commercial tobacco crop in Jamestown in 1612, smoking was widespread in England. Rolfe\u2019s first crop was sold in London in 1614. Five years later, Jamestown was exporting 10 tons of tobacco to England a year. By 1639 it was 750 tons.</p>\n<p>When Robert Cotton first arrived at Jamestown, there was no tobacco cash crop. His brief was to seek out new sources of clay and pipe production methods that would give the Virginia Company consumer goods they could actually make some money selling in England. The London pipemaking industry was supplied exclusively by Dorset white clay. If Virginia clay could supply a colonial pipemaking enterprise, the Virginia Company could break the Dorset monopoly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39157\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Pipe-fragments-found-in-the-well.jpg 1290w\" title=\"Pipe fragments found in a Jamestown well.  Image courtesy Jamestown Rediscovery.\" width=\"150\"/></a>While there are no surviving documents mentioning Robert Cotton other than the passenger list of the First Supply mission, archaeological evidence of his work has survived. Since 2006, archaeologists have unearthed more than 1,550 fragments of pipes made by Robert Cotton. They were found in a well, probably discards that failed during the manufacturing process. Cotton combined the tulip-shaped bowl of Virginia Indian pipes with English technology and decorative elements to create a unique design not found in any other early Virginia colonies. The Virginia clay wasn\u2019t the pristine white of Dorset\u2019s or fired at the same high heat, but Cotton\u2019s handmade work (he did not use molds to make these pipes) was appealing and saleable.</p>\n<p>Many were stamped with a diamond shape maker\u2019s mark and fleurs-de-lis. A few of them were inscribed with the names of influential people stamped into the clay with printer\u2019s type. Nine pipes were found with names or enough of a name to be identifiable, all of them officials of the Virginia Company or high-powered courtiers: Sir Charles Howard, lord high admiral of the English Navy, famed explorer and smoking trend-setter Sir Walter Raleigh, the Earl of Southampton, Virginia Company official and patron of Shakespeare whose name appears on two pipes, Lord De La Warr, owner of a huge quantity of Virginia Company stock and first resident governor of Virginia, Captain Samuel Argall, ship\u2019s captain and lieutenant governor of Virginia, Captain Francis Nelson, ship\u2019s captain of the Second Supply mission, Sir Walter Cope, antiquarian and Virginia Company official, Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, Virginia Company investor and King James\u2019 secretary of state.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39156\" height=\"49\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment-150x49.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment-150x49.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment-200x65.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment-430x140.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Earl-of-Southampton-pipe-fragment.jpg 990w\" title=\"Earl of Southampton pipe fragment.

Archaeologists believe the name stamping was a marketing device, a gift for investors to assuage their concerns attending Jamestown\u2019s financial prospects. William Faldo, however, was not so illustrious a personage. He may have gotten his own named pipe because he was friends with the maker. His pipe was also found in a different location, a cellar rather than a well.</p>\n<p>Faldo was a Swiss German member of the Society of Mines Royal who persuaded the Virginia Company that he could find silver mines in the colony. He arrived along with a group of German and Polish craftsmen in October of 1608 and quickly set out to find the mines. He was believed to have found a silver mine upstream of the falls of the James River, but before thoroughly exploring it he went back to England to secure an exclusive contract to work the mine. He returned with Governor De La Warr in 1610 after the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25056\" target=\"_blank\">Starving Time</a> had driven the few survivors to abandon the  Jamestown fort. De La Warr was very keen on securing that silver, so he ordered the settlers to stay put and rebuild Jamestown. The silver was never found and Faldo was killed by Appomattox Indians that same year.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/x6iNbq8db1w&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"New named pipe found at Jamestown\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39155\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>"}

We had another milestone which, while the number was a tad on the random side, turned out to be my favorite milestone celebration ever. Why? Because we rang in six million pageviews with Steve Austin, astronaut, a man barely alive but somehow still able to rock the double-knit polyester leisure suit. I was surprised and delighted to find so many comments from people who love the Six Million Dollar Man as much as I do. Engine block Steve Austin action figure 4EVA! \n The most read story of the year going by pageviews was the one about the Dutch soccer hooligans vandalizing the newly restored Barcaccia fountain at the base of Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps. Short on its heels was one of my favorite, if not the favorite, post of the year: the cuneiform tablet that added 20 more lines to the Epic of Gilgamesh. The awesomeness of the Viking blacksmith\u2019s grave drew the third largest numbers of views, and the momentous discovery of an archaic home from the 6th century B.C. underneath the Quirinale Hill in Rome came in fourth. \n Number five on the list is also my favorite photograph of the year. It\u2019s the CT scan of the cross-legged meditating Buddha statue that has a mummified person inside of it. I learned about the brutal process of self-mummification thanks to that post, which was horrifying and fascinating at the same time if not in equal measure, even though the CT scan showed the internal organs had been removed so the person inside the statue hadn\u2019t actually gotten that way by starving, dehydrating and poisoning himself over the course of six years. \n That post also corrected an error that was widespread in the general media coverage of the Buddha mummy, namely that its presence inside the statue was revealed by the CT scan. The statue was part of a traveling museum exhibition about mummies, so obviously the fact that there was a mummy inside the state was already known. That\u2019s why they scanned it in the first place. Still, once a mistake like that gets into a headline or a lede, it\u2019s almost impossible to carve it out. The days of a front page correction fixing the problem are over. \n That goes double for a big mistake in History.com\u2019s Today in History feature. I informed History.com that they had confused 18th century surveyor Andrew Ellicott with his great-grandson and dendrochronology pioneer Andrew Ellicott Douglass in their entry on the first recorded observation of a meteor shower in North America. I got an email back saying they were looking into it, but their erroneous article still stands. Perhaps they\u2019ll have fixed it by the time November 12th comes around next year. \n Another widespread story that needed some correcting is runner-up for favorite picture: the sale of the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest cat painting.\u201d Carl Kahler\u2019s monumental 1893 painting of wealthy San Francisco socialite and philanthropist Kate Birdsall Johnson\u2019s 43 cats sold for $826,000 made news all over the cat-loving Internet. Mrs. Johnson came off of her posthumous virality a little the worse for wear since apocryphal stories of her being a crazy cat lady with hundreds of cats roaming the house got repeated over and over again. In fact she was a thoughtful, devout, generous person who left valuable property and monies in her will to found a hospital for indigent women and children. That hospital still exists, albeit in a new location (the old one was felled in the 1906 earthquake) and under a new name. \n It was a particular good year for film discoveries, I think. I don\u2019t just mean lost films that were found hiding out in vaults, but personal discoveries, films that were known but that I discovered in 2015. The most important actual discovery of the year was the film of the 1915 Eastland disaster found in Dutch newsreels. The ship which killed 844 people when it capsized while still moored just feet from the bank of the Chicago River was captured in important photographs by groundbreaking photojournalist Jun Fujita, but this is the first film of the disaster known to have survived. \n As far as personal finds go, I still laugh like an idiot at Douglas Fairbanks as the brave, clueless, high as a kite detective Coke Ennyday. That was a random surprise find. Finding The Daughter of Dawn on Netflix, on the other hand, was the happy outcome of years of checking in on the story. I\u2019ve been anxious to see the rediscovered treasure since I first wrote about it in 2012, and much to my amazement, it did not disappoint even after years of buildup. It\u2019s a great picture in many ways, capturing an era that was bygone even as it was being filmed. \n My favorite videos of the year were all about the technology and procedure of historical preservation and exploration. First there was the all-too-brief view of how Historic Royal Palaces conservators go about washing the fragile 17th century tapestries under their care. With all the custom technology \u2014 the giant horizontal car wash made specifically for tapestries \u2014 the best part was how tenderly the conservators sponge away the dirt and blot away the moisture. The composite video made from synchroton X-ray imaging of a corroded 17th century metal box blew my mind purely from a tech standpoint. The detail and resolution of the images opens up a world of new possibilities for non-invasive exploration of artifacts that are otherwise too fragile to be touched. \n Speaking of history and technology, the discovery that an eye salve from Bald\u2019s Leechbook, a 10th century Anglo-Saxon book of remedies for illness, kills MRSA superbug bacteria with ruthless efficiency could have enormous implications in our soon-to-be post-antibiotic world. There were some heartbreaking responses to that story from people who have lived for years with persistent infections and are desperate to find a solution. Here\u2019s hoping the research gets all the support it needs going forward so they don\u2019t have to crowdfund for a measly \u00a31,000 to hire a summer intern. \n Is it weird if I transition from bacterial infection to poop? Oh well, at least there\u2019s some sort of segue in there, even if it is a pathogenic one. Let\u2019s face, it\u2019s not a good History Blog year without some good poop stories, like the 25 tons of pigeon poop cleaned out of the 14th c. tower in Rye, a medieval city on the English Channel coast. Also we saw the greatest of all updates to the story of the barrels of poop found in Odense, Denmark. Researchers sifting through compacted 14th century excrement one teaspoon at a time, a designated expert poop-sniffer, museum Smell-O-Vision: that post and its comment thread made me inordinately happy. As did the hidden pooper found in the 17th century Dutch painting by Royal Collection curators. \n The hidden pooper may be my favorite restoration find, but my favorite artifact find of the year is probably the Roman owl fibula found on Danish island of Bornholm. Its bright enameled colors, rarity and sheer cuteness completely won me over. If Lorenzo ever graduates from making Mj\u00f6lnir amulets out of his mom\u2019s tea spoons into a full-fledged artifact reproduction business, I vote he make us a whole bunch of Bornholm owls.  \n Close seconds are the blackboards from 1917 discovered with beautiful chalk artwork and class exercises preserved in pristine condition in an Oklahoma City school and the 132-year-old Winchester \u201973 found leaning against tree in Great Basin National Park in the Snake mountains of eastern Nevada. Several comments on the latter story appreciated that I\u2019d said conservators were keeping the rifle in its highly weathered condition \u201cbecause it\u2019s cool.\u201d What\u2019s funny is that I actually thought about it a lot when I was writing. I was going to break down all the reasons they\u2019d decided not to restore it, but then I realized that it all boiled down to the same thing: because it\u2019s cool. There are a million Winchester \u201973s. This one stands out because some poor devil left it leaning against a tree for 130 years and now it looks kickass. \n As far as precious metal finds go, the treasure of the year has to be the Bronze Age gold spirals found on Zealand, Denmark. They were found under a pile of gold coins and the spirals are so awesome they completely eclipsed the gold coin hoard. The comment thread on the spirals is particularly great too. Lots of interesting contributions from people who use or produce similar objects in embroidery and machining metal. The inscribed sword from the 13th or 14th century inspired a wealth of fascinating comments as well. Everyone likes a mystery, or at least we few, we nerdy few, we band of history-obsessed brothers do. \n I also loved the comments on the story about the 7th century Christian skeletons found in front of the Temple of Concordia at Paestum because you were so enthusiastic about the fabulous hidden prostitute conspiracy story. One of the joys of writing this blog is when something that tickles me tickles y\u2019all too. I love it even more when it\u2019s a tangent that you pick up on rather than the main thread of the story. I\u2019m not sure why. Validation that my meanderings were worthwhile, I suppose. \n Sometimes the meandering becomes an entire post of its own, as in the case of Childeric\u2019s treasure, a story I came across while researching something else I can\u2019t remember anymore and that became something of an obsession for days. The story about Emily Post\u2019s madcap road trip from coast to coast came about in much the same way. \n It\u2019s been a heartbreaking year for history lovers. The destruction of so much of our shared cultural heritage in the Middle East by terrorism and war is almost unbearable. The brutal murder of Khaled el-Asaad, a great man who dedicated his life to the historic patrimony of Syria and the gave his life for it too, was an agonizing loss to his family, colleagues and all the rest of us who where so beholden to him without even realizing it until he was gone. \n In the end, it\u2019s history itself that soothes me even in such dark times. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Europe was facing the rubble of its own history, torn apart by total war. The sculptures and reliefs of Tell Halaf in Berlin were bombed to smithereens when the museum took a direct hit from an incendiary bomb in 1943. Seventy years later, they were put back together. \n Three years ago, author Hilary Mantel, author of the exceptional Tudor historical fiction Wolf Hall, gave a speech about the public\u2019s relationship to royal families at a London Review of Books event. It made the news because some media outlets plucked quotes about the Duchess of Cambridge and made them out to be cruel criticisms of the former Kate Middleton rather than the astute and apposite observation about how people, spurred on by an obsessive press, fetishize her and box her in. It\u2019s a great speech, but the part that struck me most profoundly was about the discovery of the remains of Richard III. \n Why are we all so pleased about digging up a king? Perhaps because the present is paying some of the debt it owes to the past, and science has come to the aid of history. The king stripped by the victors has been reclothed in his true identity. This is the essential process of history, neatly illustrated: loss, retrieval. \n I\u2019ve thought of that last line so many times this year, as horrific destruction followed horrific destruction. What was lost can be found again, even if its original form is gone forever. That is what history does. That is what we do every time we read history. We find what was lost. \n Thank you all so very much for reading and commenting and sending me the kindest compliments and hottest story tips. May your 2016 be glorious. \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\"

We had another milestone which, while the number was a tad on the random side, turned out to be my favorite milestone celebration ever. Why? Because we rang in six million pageviews with <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34428\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Austin, astronaut, a man barely alive</a> but somehow still able to rock the double-knit polyester leisure suit. I was surprised and delighted to find so many comments from people who love the Six Million Dollar Man as much as I do.

The Sulaymaniyah Museum, Iraq. Photo \u00a9 Osama S.M. Amin.\" width=\"99\"/></a>The most read story of the year going by pageviews was the one about the Dutch <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34935\" target=\"_blank\">soccer hooligans vandalizing</a> the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32493\" target=\"_blank\">newly restored Barcaccia fountain</a> at the base of Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps. Short on its heels was one of my favorite, if not <em>the</em> favorite, post of the year: the cuneiform tablet that added <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38631\" target=\"_blank\">20 more lines to the Epic of Gilgamesh</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36178\" target=\"_blank\">awesomeness of the Viking blacksmith\u2019s grave</a> drew the third largest numbers of views, and the momentous discovery of an <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38394\" target=\"_blank\">archaic home from the 6th century B.C.</a> underneath the Quirinale Hill in Rome came in fourth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34988\" height=\"109\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan-150x109.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan-200x145.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan-430x312.jpg 430w\" title=\"Buddha statue and scan revealing mummy within. Images courtesy the Drents Museum.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Number five on the list is also my favorite photograph of the year. It\u2019s the CT scan of the cross-legged meditating Buddha statue that has a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34978\" target=\"_blank\">mummified person inside of it</a>. I learned about the brutal process of self-mummification thanks to that post, which was horrifying and fascinating at the same time if not in equal measure, even though the CT scan showed the internal organs had been removed so the person inside the statue hadn\u2019t actually gotten that way by starving, dehydrating and poisoning himself over the course of six years.</p>\n<p>That post also corrected an error that was widespread in the general media coverage of the Buddha mummy, namely that its presence inside the statue was revealed by the CT scan. The statue was part of a traveling museum exhibition about mummies, so obviously the fact that there was a mummy inside the state was already known. That\u2019s why they scanned it in the first place. Still, once a mistake like that gets into a headline or a lede, it\u2019s almost impossible to carve it out. The days of a front page correction fixing the problem are over.</p>\n<p>That goes double for a big mistake in History.com\u2019s Today in History feature. I informed History.com that they had confused 18th century <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39323\" target=\"_blank\">surveyor Andrew Ellicott</a> with his great-grandson and dendrochronology pioneer Andrew Ellicott Douglass in their entry on the first recorded observation of a meteor shower in North America. I got an email back saying they were looking into it, but their erroneous article still stands. Perhaps they\u2019ll have fixed it by the time November 12th comes around next year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39247\" height=\"104\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891-430x298.jpg 430w\" title=\"&quot;My Wife's Lovers&quot; by Carl Kahler, 1891-1893. Image courtesy Sotheby's.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Another widespread story that needed some correcting is runner-up for favorite picture: the sale of the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39239\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s greatest cat painting</a>.\u201d Carl Kahler\u2019s monumental 1893 painting of wealthy San Francisco socialite and philanthropist Kate Birdsall Johnson\u2019s 43 cats sold for $826,000 made news all over the cat-loving Internet. Mrs. Johnson came off of her posthumous virality a little the worse for wear since apocryphal stories of her being a crazy cat lady with hundreds of cats roaming the house got repeated over and over again. In fact she was a thoughtful, devout, generous person who left valuable property and monies in her will to found a hospital for indigent women and children. That hospital still exists, albeit in a new location (the old one was felled in the 1906 earthquake) and under a new name.</p>\n<p>It was a particular good year for film discoveries, I think. I don\u2019t just mean lost films that were found hiding out in vaults, but personal discoveries, films that were known but that I discovered in 2015. The most important actual discovery of the year was the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34829\" target=\"_blank\">film of the 1915 <em>Eastland</em> disaster</a> found in Dutch newsreels. The ship which killed 844 people when it capsized while still moored just feet from the bank of the Chicago River was captured in important photographs by groundbreaking photojournalist Jun Fujita, but this is the first film of the disaster known to have survived.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38018\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art-430x620.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art.jpg 1200w\" title=\"The Daughter of Dawn poster and cover art. Image courtesy Milestone Films.\" width=\"103\"/></a>As far as personal finds go, I still laugh like an idiot at Douglas Fairbanks as the brave, clueless, high as a kite <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36356\" target=\"_blank\">detective Coke Ennyday</a>. That was a random surprise find. Finding <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38010\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Daughter of Dawn</em> on Netflix</a>, on the other hand, was the happy outcome of years of checking in on the story. I\u2019ve been anxious to see the rediscovered treasure since I <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18218\" target=\"_blank\">first wrote about it in 2012</a>, and much to my amazement, it did not disappoint even after years of buildup. It\u2019s a great picture in many ways, capturing an era that was bygone even as it was being filmed.</p>\n<p>My favorite videos of the year were all about the technology and procedure of historical preservation and exploration. First there was the all-too-brief view of how Historic Royal Palaces conservators go about <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37989\" target=\"_blank\">washing the fragile 17th century tapestries</a> under their care. With all the custom technology \u2014 the giant horizontal car wash made specifically for tapestries \u2014 the best part was how tenderly the conservators sponge away the dirt and blot away the moisture. The composite video made from <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39264\" target=\"_blank\">synchroton X-ray imaging of a corroded 17th century metal box</a> blew my mind purely from a tech standpoint. The detail and resolution of the images opens up a world of new possibilities for non-invasive exploration of artifacts that are otherwise too fragile to be touched.</p>\n<p>Speaking of history and technology, the discovery that an eye salve from <em>Bald\u2019s Leechbook</em>, a 10th century Anglo-Saxon book of remedies for illness, kills MRSA superbug bacteria with ruthless efficiency could have enormous implications in our soon-to-be post-antibiotic world. There were some heartbreaking responses to that story from people who have lived for years with persistent infections and are desperate to find a solution. Here\u2019s hoping the research gets all the support it needs going forward so they don\u2019t have to crowdfund for a measly \u00a31,000 to hire a summer intern.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39180\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after-200x147.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after-430x317.jpg 430w\" title='\"A Village Fair with a Church Behind\" by Isack van Ostade, 1643, after cleaning.

Oh well, at least there\u2019s some sort of segue in there, even if it is a pathogenic one. Let\u2019s face, it\u2019s not a good History Blog year without some good poop stories, like the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35135\" target=\"_blank\">25 tons of pigeon poop</a> cleaned out of the 14th c. tower in Rye, a medieval city on the English Channel coast. Also we saw <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36317\" target=\"_blank\">the greatest of all updates</a> to the story of the barrels of poop found in Odense, Denmark. Researchers sifting through compacted 14th century excrement one teaspoon at a time, a designated expert poop-sniffer, museum Smell-O-Vision: that post and its comment thread made me inordinately happy. As did the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39178\" target=\"_blank\">hidden pooper found in the 17th century Dutch painting</a> by Royal Collection curators.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36139\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-150x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-430x387.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum.jpg 1324w\" title=\"Roman owl disk fibula, 1st-3rd c.

Several comments on the latter story appreciated that I\u2019d said conservators were keeping the rifle in its highly weathered condition \u201cbecause it\u2019s cool.\u201d What\u2019s funny is that I actually thought about it a lot when I was writing. I was going to break down all the reasons they\u2019d decided not to restore it, but then I realized that it all boiled down to the same thing: because it\u2019s cool. There are a million Winchester \u201973s. This one stands out because some poor devil left it leaning against a tree for 130 years and now it looks kickass.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37421\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Intact gold spirals from Boeslunde are up to three centimeters long.

It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Europe was facing the rubble of its own history, torn apart by total war. The sculptures and reliefs of Tell Halaf in Berlin were bombed to smithereens when the museum took a direct hit from an incendiary bomb in 1943. Seventy years later, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/7021\" target=\"_blank\">they were put back together</a>.</p>\n<p>Three years ago, author Hilary Mantel, author of the exceptional Tudor historical fiction <em>Wolf Hall</em>, <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n04/hilary-mantel/royal-bodies\" target=\"_blank\">gave a speech</a> about the public\u2019s relationship to royal families at a London Review of Books event. It made the news because some media outlets plucked quotes about the Duchess of Cambridge and made them out to be cruel criticisms of the former Kate Middleton rather than the astute and apposite observation about how people, spurred on by an obsessive press, fetishize her and box her in. It\u2019s a great speech, but the part that struck me most profoundly was about the discovery of the remains of Richard III.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Why are we all so pleased about digging up a king? Perhaps because the present is paying some of the debt it owes to the past, and science has come to the aid of history. The king stripped by the victors has been reclothed in his true identity. This is the essential process of history, neatly illustrated: loss, retrieval.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve thought of that last line so many times this year, as horrific destruction followed horrific destruction. What was lost can be found again, even if its original form is gone forever. That is what history does. That is what we do every time we read history. We find what was lost.</p>\n<p>Thank you all so very much for reading and commenting and sending me the kindest compliments and hottest story tips.

A crew from the Fairfax County Utilities Design and Construction Division (UDCD) was digging for a new road shoulder and sidewalk on Ox Road when workers found a layer of old macadam (a small stone aggregate road surface invented by John MacAdam in the 1820s). Beneath it was a line of cedar logs laid next to each other, a design known as a corduroy road because of its resemblance to the striated fabric. Ken Atkins, senior inspector for the UDCD and avid history buff, made sure the macadam stones were removed very carefully so as not to disturb the wood underneath.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Civil-War-cedar-log-highway.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-40122\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Civil-War-cedar-log-highway-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Civil-War-cedar-log-highway-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Civil-War-cedar-log-highway-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Civil-War-cedar-log-highway-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ken Atkins measures Civil War-era cedar log highway. Image courtesy Fairfax County Park Authority.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Atkins stopped excavation and alerted UDCD engineer Mohamed Kadasi who called the Fairfax County Park Authority\u2019s Cultural Resource Management and Protection Branch (CRMPB). They sent archaeologists to assess the site who confirmed that Mr. Atkins\u2019 instincts were spot-on. His cautious, thoughtful approach saved a very rare surviving historic Civil War road surface. Logs were a common road surface at the time, especially during the war when the constant tramping of Union and Confederate soldiers turned dirt roads into sucking mud pits.</p>\n<p>The CRMPB documented the site, taking photographs and planning a more thorough future recording of the historic road. When they were done for the day, Atkins covered the excavated trench with a steel plate to protect the cedar logs and keep members of the public from falling into the pit.</p>\n<p>Then came the bureaucracy. While the county is using the land for public works, it actually belongs to the state of Virginia and is being worked under the aegis of an easement held by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). Therefore before a formal excavation of the cedar road could be done, the CRMPB needed a permit from the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. Usually that sort of thing can drag on for weeks, but everyone pulled together. Within 48 hours, the CRMPB had drawn up a work plan and submitted the permit application, the VDOT had agreed to the plan and signed the permit.</p>\n<p>Armed with the permit, the CRMPB team used a total station, one of those surveyor\u2019s tools that looks like a big yellow plastic camera on a tripod, to record the cedar log road in 3D. They also got a favor from the Fairfax County Geographic Information System (GIS) department which has been using high definition LiDAR data to create a detailed topographic map of the county. The CRMPB asked them to process the data from the area around the road find and it returned evidence of a Civil War circular fort that once protected the roadway.</p>\n<p>CRMPB archaeologists recorded every log and its exact location, numbered them and then attached two tags with the assigned number to each end of the log. Then they cut through them. I know it sounds horrible and it is, but the UDCD had a drainage pipe to install, and the decision was made that it was better for historical accuracy and preservation to cut the logs but leave them in situ rather than pull them out. Once the pipe was in place, the trench was backfilled up to the cedar log road. The cut ends of the logs were put back in their original places and then the trench was backfilled again, this time up to the modern ground level.</p>\n<p>While the road is now reburied and will likely remain so in perpetuity, thanks to the documentation and GIS data, the CRMPB hopes to digitally reconstruct the area as it was during the Civil War. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Jim Lewis, a member of the executive committee of the Bull Run Civil War Round Table, said a corduroy road from the Occoquan River to the Fairfax courthouse was a major pathway in the war.</p>\n<p>The logs that the county workers found are almost certainly part of the first section of that road, from the courthouse to Fairfax Station, which was built in 1862, Lewis said. \u201cAlmost certainly\u201d because Lewis pointed out that a specific dating process hasn\u2019t been used to verify that the wood is from the Civil War and not from a later incarnation of Ox Road.</p>\n<p>If the corduroy road does date to the Civil War, the historian said, it would have been traveled by Union Gen. Joseph Hooker, Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart and other famous generals.</p>\n<p>The road would have been a link to get supplies from the railroad at Fairfax Station to the Fairfax courthouse, a significant Union supply depot, he said.</p>\n<p>Most other corduroy roads have long rotted away, Lewis said, which makes the Fairfax discovery substantial.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo find a corduroy road intact is spectacular,\u201d he said.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Civil War-era cedar log \u201ccorduroy road\u201d found in Virgina\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40121\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40121#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-40110\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40110\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Iron Age settlement unearthed in Norway\">Iron Age settlement unearthed in Norway</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, December 29th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Marks-in-soil-are-part-of-a-larger-find-that-show-there-were-three-buildings-here-arranged-in-the-shape-of-a-U.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40115\" height=\"73\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Marks-in-soil-are-part-of-a-larger-find-that-show-there-were-three-buildings-here-arranged-in-the-shape-of-a-U.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum.-150x73.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Marks-in-soil-are-part-of-a-larger-find-that-show-there-were-three-buildings-here-arranged-in-the-shape-of-a-U.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum.-150x73.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Marks-in-soil-are-part-of-a-larger-find-that-show-there-were-three-buildings-here-arranged-in-the-shape-of-a-U.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum.-200x98.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Marks-in-soil-are-part-of-a-larger-find-that-show-there-were-three-buildings-here-arranged-in-the-shape-of-a-U.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum.-430x211.jpg 430w\" title=\"These marks in the soil are part of a larger find that show there were three buildings here arranged in the shape of a U.

The site is adjacent to Norway\u2019s Main Air Station which is expanding to make room for 52 new F-35 fighter jets the government recently purchased. By Norwegian law, the property must be surveyed by archaeologists before construction begins, and because this site is so extensive (91,000 meters squared or more than 22 acres), the survey is a major project with more than 20 staff working for 40 weeks at a cost of 41 million Norwegian Krone ($4,700,000), not counting the additional costs for room and board and large excavators. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Excavators-at-work.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40111\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Excavators-at-work.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Excavators-at-work.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Excavators-at-work.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Excavators-at-work.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum.-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Excavators-at-work.-Photo-by-\u00c5ge-Hojem-NTNU-University-Museum..jpg 1469w\" title=\"Excavators at work.

The land has been farmed for centuries, going at least as far back 1,500 years ago when it was right on the bay. Now it\u2019s a mile inland. Its former position on the coast made it an important location for Iron Age Norwegians.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis was a very strategic place,\u201d says Ingrid Ystgaard, project manager at the Department of Archaeology and Cultural History at NTNU University Museum. \u201cIt was a sheltered area along the Norwegian coastal route from southern Norway to the northern coasts.

Archaeologists were delighted to find middens \u2014 ancient garbage pits \u2014 on the site, because they rarely survive so long in the acidic soil of Norway. Thanks to its coastal history, the site\u2019s soil is composed of alkaline ground-up seashells which has allowed delicate organic remains like animal and fish bones to survive to this day.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cNothing like this has been examined anywhere in Norway before,\u201d Ystgaard said.</p>\n<p>There are enough bones to figure out what kinds of animals they came from, and how the actual animal varieties relate to today\u2019s wild and domesticated animals, she said.

The original manuscript was discovered by a rare books dealer at an estate sale in Rochester, New York, a few years ago and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28329\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by Yale University\u2019s Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library</a> in 2009. Yale English professor Caleb Smith, Beinecke curators and genealogical researcher Christine McKay were able to identify the author as Austin Reed, a free African American from Rochester who had spent much of life in penal institutions.</p>\n<p>Reed was six years old when his father died. In the wake of the loss, he began to get into trouble, ditching school and going out at all hours. His exasperated mother decided that it was better for him to live in the country, far from the temptations and evils of the city, where, she hoped, he might be turned from his self-destructive path. She indentured him to the Ladd family to work on their farm in Avon, New York. Alas, like a latter-day Oedipus, Reed\u2019s mother only doomed him to the fate she had so fervently wished to avert. When the farmer tied the boy up \u201clike a slave\u201d and beat him badly, Reed and two other child servants set fire to his home in revenge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/House-of-Refuge.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40102\" height=\"105\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/House-of-Refuge-150x105.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/House-of-Refuge-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/House-of-Refuge-200x140.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/House-of-Refuge-430x301.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/House-of-Refuge.jpg 1200w\" title=\"House of Refuge, Bowery, New York City, 1832.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Reed was convicted of arson in September of 1833 and was sentenced to serve 10 years at the New York House of Refuge, the first juvenile reformatory in the United States. He was 10 years old. The facility opened in 1825 in a former US arsenal in the Bowery. The freshman class consisted of six boys and three girls. A decade later when Reed was there it would house 1,600 children. It was dedicated to teaching its charges skills and professions with the laudable aim of rehabilitation, but the disciple was brutal and the workload extreme.</p>\n<p>From the beginning Austin Reed was rebellious and fought against prison authorities. His juvie records are replete with comments from the wardens describing him as \u201ca deep knowing impudent brazen faced boy\u201d and \u201ca most notorious liar.\u201d He made multiple attempts to escape, at least one of which was successful if only for a short time. Still, the troubled boy found some support there, especially from superintendents Samuel Wood, an abolitionist who saw to it that Reed learned how to read and write. His successor Mr. Terry took a different approach, inflicting harsh punishments and whipping Reed within an inch of life. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Auburn-prison.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-28347\" height=\"137\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Auburn-prison-150x137.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Auburn-prison-150x137.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Auburn-prison-200x183.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Auburn-prison-430x394.jpg 430w\" title=\"Auburn prison front view (top), back view with lockstepping inmates (bottom)\" width=\"150\"/></a>He left the House of Refuge in 1839, only to quickly fall foul of the law again.

Auburn also had a stated aim of rehabilitation, but its methods were draconian: perpetual solitary confinement, violent whippings with cat-o-nine-tails, a form of waterboarding called the \u201cshower bath,\u201d being made to carry the \u201cyoke,\u201d a 40-pound bar of iron chained to the back of the prisoner\u2019s neck and both hands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Original-title.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40103\" height=\"145\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Original-title-150x145.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Original-title-150x145.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Original-title-200x193.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Original-title-430x416.jpg 430w\" title=\"Original title\" width=\"150\"/></a>Reed was in his mid-30s when he completed the book in 1858.

(His year of birth is uncertain, either 1755 or 1757). Young Alexander was left with nothing but a couple of dozen books, so he went to work as a clerk for an American shipping company. The future Secretary of the Treasure, founder of the Bank of New York and engineer of a new country\u2019s monetary system was so good at the business that he was left in charge of the firm for five months in 1771 while still a teenager.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Alexander-Hamilton-powder-horn.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40082\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Alexander-Hamilton-powder-horn-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Alexander-Hamilton-powder-horn-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Alexander-Hamilton-powder-horn-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Alexander-Hamilton-powder-horn-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Unicorn and cinquefoil detail.

He wrote an account of a hurricane <a href=\"http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-01-02-0042\" target=\"_blank\">published in the <em>Royal Danish American Gazette</em></a> that so impressed community leaders they raised money to send him to the North American colonies to advance his education. Hamilton arrived in New Jersey in 1772 and, after a year of college preparatory studies, enrolled at King\u2019s College (modern-day Columbia University) in New York City in the fall of 1773. </p>\n<p>He quickly became involved in the hot political topic of the era and earned a reputation as a lucid and effective advocate for the patriot cause. When armed conflict broke out between the British Army and colonials at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, Hamilton volunteered for the New York militia. This is the fulfillment of a long-hold wish expressed in a letter to his friend Edward Stevens when Hamilton was just 14 years old and clerking for food:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To confess my weakness, Ned, my ambition is so prevalent that I disdain the groveling conditions of a clerk to which my fortune condemns me. I would willingly risk my life, though not my character, to exalt my station. My folly makes me ashamed, yet Neddy, we know that such schemes can triumph when the schemer is resolute. Oh, how I wish there was a war!</p></blockquote>\n<p>That deep drive to rise up in the world, to make something of himself, to fight in a war which affords men of talent and bravery the chance at field promotions, medals and fame explains the alacrity with which he joined the Revolutionary cause. It also explains some of the engraving on the powder horn. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Crest-of-Hamiltons-of-Grange.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40090\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Crest-of-Hamiltons-of-Grange-126x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Crest-of-Hamiltons-of-Grange-126x150.jpg 126w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Crest-of-Hamiltons-of-Grange-200x237.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Crest-of-Hamiltons-of-Grange.jpg 378w\" title=\"Coat of arms of the Hamiltons of Grange.\" width=\"126\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hamilton-personal-bookplate.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40089\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hamilton-personal-bookplate-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hamilton-personal-bookplate-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hamilton-personal-bookplate-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hamilton-personal-bookplate-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hamilton-personal-bookplate.jpg 540w\" title=\"Alexander Hamilton's personal bookplate.

The Hamilton of Grange arms use cinquefoil ermine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Estate-engraving.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40093\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Estate-engraving-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Estate-engraving-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Estate-engraving-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Estate-engraving-430x645.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Estate-engraving.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Engraving of landed estate.

In its heyday it was part of one of the largest homes in Pompeii which was divided in two around 20 years before the apocalypse. Eighteen women and children fled to what they hoped was safety in the House of the Cryptoporticus during the 79 A.D. eruption of Vesuvius. Unfortunately there was no such thing as safety in Pompeii that day and they all fell victim to the volcano\u2019s wrath. It was also severely damaged during Allied bombing in 1943, particularly the peristyle (quadrangular garden).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fresco-outside-Domus-of-Criptoporticus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40061\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fresco-outside-Domus-of-Criptoporticus-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fresco-outside-Domus-of-Criptoporticus-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fresco-outside-Domus-of-Criptoporticus-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fresco-outside-Domus-of-Criptoporticus-430x292.jpg 430w\" title=\"Frescoed lararium outside the Domus of the Cryptoporticus.

This was likely the delicate cycle of antiquity since the tougher, dirtier, badly stained fabrics were stomped on by laundry employees in larger tubs out back. There are three large square tubs in the main laundry facility and five oval tubs. Clothes were soaked in a mixture of water and unrine. Urine with its precious ammonia was a key element in ancient cleaning. It was collected from animals and humans, harvested from public bathrooms. </p>\n<p>After the fabrics soaked for a while, they were trampled by the laundry workers. Then the cloth was treated with fuller\u2019s earth \u2014 a type of clay that served as a fabric softener \u2014 and rinsed very, very thoroughly. Garments were laid out to dry on the roof or outside the entrance before getting ironed in the fullonica\u2019s man-sized press.</p>\n<p>Visitors to the restored fullonica will see a demonstration of how fabrics were treated in ancient Roman laundry facilities.

Inspired by Clement Moore\u2019s description of the \u201cjolly old elf\u201d in his 1823 poem <em>A Visit from St. Nicholas</em>, aka <em>The Night Before Christmas</em>, Nast first depicted Santa in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/harpersweeklyv7bonn#page/n4/mode/1up\" target=\"_blank\">January 3, 1863, issue of <em>Harper\u2019s Weekly</em></a>. On the cover was a scene captioned \u201cSanta Claus in Camp\u201d in which Saint Nick brings toys and good cheer to Union soldiers. It seems that Santa, much like Nast himself who was a staunch Republican and abolitionist, had picked a side in the Civil War, and he wasn\u2019t at all subtle about it.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-in-Camp-Thomas-Nast-Jan-3-1863-Harpers-Weekly.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-40047\" height=\"641\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-in-Camp-Thomas-Nast-Jan-3-1863-Harpers-Weekly-430x641.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-in-Camp-Thomas-Nast-Jan-3-1863-Harpers-Weekly-430x641.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-in-Camp-Thomas-Nast-Jan-3-1863-Harpers-Weekly-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-in-Camp-Thomas-Nast-Jan-3-1863-Harpers-Weekly-200x298.jpg 200w\" title=\"&quot;Santa Claus in Camp&quot; by Thomas Nast, January 3, 1863, issue of Harper's Weekly.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Santa\u2019s blue (of course) coat has white stars on it and his pants have red and white stripes, similar to garb donned by other patriotic icons drawn by Nast like Columbia and Uncle Sam. He has delivered parcels to the soldiers. One finds a sock inside, doubtless a welcome gift in the bleak midwinter after the devastating loss at Fredericksburg which saw more than 12,000 of his comrades killed, wounded or taken captive. A drummer boy in the foreground stares with wide-eyed surprise at the jack-in-the-box that leapt out of his present. </p>\n<p>But it\u2019s the toy Santa is holding that is most remarkable. Here\u2019s <em>Harper\u2019s</em> explanation of it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Santa Claus is entertaining the soldiers by showing them Jeff Davis\u2019 future. He is tying a cord pretty tightly round his neck, and Jeff seems to be kicking very much at such a fate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Inside the same issue was a more sentimental approach to enlisting Santa in the Union cause. Nast\u2019s two-page cartoon entitled \u201cChristmas Eve\u201d frames two Christmas scenes: a mother looking out the window praying while her two children sleep, and a lonely soldier by a campfire, presumably her husband, looking at a picture of his wife and children. Below them are vignettes of war and fresh graves. Above them Santa Claus brings consolation in the form of presents to the family home and to the front. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Christmas-Eve-1862-Thomas-Nast.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-40046\" height=\"311\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Christmas-Eve-1862-Thomas-Nast-430x311.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Christmas-Eve-1862-Thomas-Nast-430x311.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Christmas-Eve-1862-Thomas-Nast-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Christmas-Eve-1862-Thomas-Nast-200x144.jpg 200w\" title=\"&quot;Christmas Eve, 1862&quot; by Thomas Nast, January 3, 1863, issue of Harper's Weekly.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/harpersweeklyv9bonn#page/824/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">Christmas of 1865</a>, Santa\u2019s wartime support of the Union had softened from stringing up effigy Jefferson Davis with his own hands to presiding over a Christmas pageant starring Ulysses S.

Lee, John Bell Hood and Richard Ewell are at Grant\u2019s feet, but it\u2019s just metaphoric playacting and anyway Santa\u2019s involvement is restricted to a wink and an avuncular smile, possibly a touch on the gloating side.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-Merry-Christmas-to-All-Dec-30-1865.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-40054\" height=\"310\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-Merry-Christmas-to-All-Dec-30-1865-430x310.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-Merry-Christmas-to-All-Dec-30-1865-430x310.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-Merry-Christmas-to-All-Dec-30-1865-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-Merry-Christmas-to-All-Dec-30-1865-200x144.jpg 200w\" title=\"&quot;A Merry Christmas to All&quot; by Thomas Nast, December 30, 1865, issue of Harper's Weekly.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-and-His-Works.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-40052\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-and-His-Works-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-and-His-Works-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-and-His-Works-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Santa-Claus-and-His-Works-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"&quot;Santa Claus and His Works&quot; by Thomas Nast, December 29, 1866, issue of Harper's Weekly\" width=\"200\"/></a>After the war, Nast continued to draw Santa Claus for seasonal issues of the magazine.

Twelve small gold artifacts have been found in the Thames mud by eight different people over the past few years. When treasure hunters and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/10062\" target=\"_blank\">licensed Thames mudlarks</a> find artifacts of note in the tidal muck of the river, they bring it to archaeologist <a href=\"https://finds.org.uk/contacts/staff/profile/id/62\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Sumnall</a>, the Portable Antiquities Scheme\u2019s Finds Liaison Officer for London. Sumnall realized that the gold artifacts are very similar and since they were all found in one area of the Thames foreshore, she believes these tiny gold objects were originally been attached to a single piece of clothing which has long since rotted away. A hat is a likely candidate, since a strong gust of wind could have dislodged it from its wealthy owner\u2019s head and driven it into the river whereas a jacket, say, tends to stay put.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Such metal objects, including aglets \u2013 metal tips for laces \u2013 beads and studs, originally had a practical purpose as garment fasteners but by the early 16th century were being worn in gold as high-status ornaments, making costly fabrics such as velvet and furs even more ostentatious. Contemporary portraits, including one in the National Portrait Gallery of <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitLarge/mw07263/Mary-Neville-Lady-Dacre-Gregory-Fiennes-10th-Baron-Dacre\" target=\"_blank\">the Dacres</a>, Mary Neville and Gregory Fiennes, show their sleeves festooned with pairs of such ornaments.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several of the pieces have the same gold loops and gold rope design. A few are inlaid with enamel or colored glass. Because they\u2019re so small, the amount of gold is minimal \u2014 less than could fill an egg cup, apparently \u2014 but any gold at all has to be reported to the local Finds Liaison Officer who documents the discovery before passing it on to British Museum experts who assess it for the coroner\u2019s inquest. At the inquest the coroner decides whether the object qualifies as treasure under Britain\u2019s Treasure Act \u2014 anything more than 300 years old containing more than 10% gold or silver \u2014 and thus belongs to the crown.</p>\n<p>Sumnall works at the <a href=\"http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/london-wall/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of London Docklands</a>. Once these artifacts have been declared treasure (a foregone conclusion because of the gold), the museum wants to acquire the group for its collection.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mary-Nevill-and-her-son-Gregory-Fiennes-by-Hans-Eworth-1559.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-40040\" height=\"315\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mary-Nevill-and-her-son-Gregory-Fiennes-by-Hans-Eworth-1559-430x315.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mary-Nevill-and-her-son-Gregory-Fiennes-by-Hans-Eworth-1559-430x315.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mary-Nevill-and-her-son-Gregory-Fiennes-by-Hans-Eworth-1559-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mary-Nevill-and-her-son-Gregory-Fiennes-by-Hans-Eworth-1559-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mary-Nevill-and-her-son-Gregory-Fiennes-by-Hans-Eworth-1559.jpg 1178w\" title=\"Mary Nevill and her son Gregory Fiennes by Hans Eworth, 1559.

Image courtesy Butterscotch Auction Gallery.' width=\"200\"/></a>It was found hanging on a wall of a Greenwich woman by Brendan Ryan, an appraiser for Butterscotch Auction Gallery. A music major, composer and Beethoven fan, Ryan immediately recognized Beethoven\u2019s handwriting. To confirm its authenticity and identify the composition, Ryan enlisted his former music history professor and mentor Dr. Carmelo Comberiati of Manhattanville College who had studied Beethoven manuscripts as a Fulbright scholar in Vienna. Comberiati identified the music as the first movement chorus, \u201cRuhend von seinen Thaten,\u201d of Opus 117 or <em>K\u00f6nig Stephan</em>, incidental music commissioned by Emperor Francis I of Austria for a stage production on the occasion of the opening of the new Pest Theater in Hungary. (King Stephen I was the founder of Hungary; hence the subject matter).</p>\n<p>Beethoven received the commission in the summer of 1811 while he was taking the waters in the Bohemian spa town of Teplitz. He had fallen ill in the spring, plagued with migraines and a high fever, and went to Teplitz on his doctor\u2019s advice. He was there for six weeks. It took him just two of those weeks to compose the music for <em>K\u00f6nig Stephan</em>. </p>\n<p>Beethoven\u2019s composition process is beautifully illustrated in the chaotic activity on the page. He first wrote down all his ideas and then streamlined them into the finished work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>An expert on historical musical manuscripts at the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Jeffrey Kallberg, said it was an important and exciting discovery.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeethoven manuscripts turn up on the auction market with some regularity, but usually they\u2019re known manuscripts. What makes this particularly interesting is this hadn\u2019t garnered any notice \u2014 it\u2019s been in this private collection,\u201d said Kallberg, who viewed the piece on-line from his office in Philadelphia. \u201cIt\u2019s a new manuscript, or a page from a manuscript, so that\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d</p>\n<p>It also captures quintessential Beethoven.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was famous for his sketching, and he sketched copiously. And it\u2019s the archetypical looking Beethoven sketch \u2014 he had God-awful handwriting, he was working fast, it has the look of a messy genius.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pages from this sketchbook come in a variety of sizes and types because Beethoven made the sketchbook himself by sewing together whatever paper he had lying around with a needle and twine. They are identifiable as part of the same book because they all have the same three stitch holes on the side which is how scholars are able to connect the individual leaves that were sold off and scattered after his death. Four other complete pages from the sketchbook are now in the collection of Beethoven-Haus in Bonn (<a href=\"http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=15311&amp;template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&amp;_eid=1509&amp;_ug=1810-1811&amp;_dokid=wm180&amp;_mid=Sketches%20by%20%20Beethoven&amp;suchparameter=&amp;_seite=1\" target=\"_blank\">one</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=15311&amp;template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&amp;_eid=1509&amp;_ug=1810-1811&amp;_dokid=wm181&amp;_mid=Sketches%20by%20%20Beethoven&amp;suchparameter=&amp;_seite=1\" target=\"_blank\">two</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=15311&amp;template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&amp;_eid=1509&amp;_ug=1810-1811&amp;_dokid=wm182&amp;_mid=Sketches%20by%20%20Beethoven&amp;suchparameter=&amp;_seite=1\" target=\"_blank\">three</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=15311&amp;template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&amp;_eid=1509&amp;_ug=1810-1811&amp;_dokid=wm199&amp;_mid=Sketches%20by%20%20Beethoven&amp;suchparameter=&amp;_seite=1\" target=\"_blank\">four</a>). Other known pages survive only as fragments that were cut up by dealers and sold to tourists and fans. </p>\n<p>This particular page made its way across the Atlantic Ocean in 1886 when William K\u00fcnzel of Leipzig, Germany, sold it to Fred M. Steele, a prominent Chicago lawyer and autograph collector. The Steele autograph collection was auctioned off after the death his widow Ella in 1918, but it seems the sketchleaf was sold before that, in around 1915, to the seller\u2019s ancestors in Greenwich. It\u2019s been in the family for a hundred years. The new owner is a leading German antiques dealer, so it looks like the sketchleaf will be heading home.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Beethoven composition found in Connecticut home\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40032\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40032#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-40020\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40020\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Otzi has the world\u2019s oldest known tattoos\">Otzi has the world\u2019s oldest known tattoos</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, December 22nd, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Locations-of-Otzis-tattoos.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40023\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 143px) 100vw, 143px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Locations-of-Otzis-tattoos-143x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Locations-of-Otzis-tattoos-143x150.jpg 143w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Locations-of-Otzis-tattoos-200x209.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Locations-of-Otzis-tattoos-430x449.jpg 430w\" title=\"Locations of Otzi's 61 tattoos.

The mummy with the mustache tattoo was discovered in the bluffs of El Morro overlooking the city of Arica, Chile, in 1983. It\u2019s a male who was around 35\u201340 years old when he died.

The new erroneous date was then transposed to 5,780 BP, which in turn was mistakenly read as 5,780 B.C. in a later study. And thus a simple reading error was compounded over 20 years of scholarship to add 4,000 years to the Chinchorro mummy\u2019s age. </p>\n<p>Now that this error <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X15301772\" target=\"_blank\">has been spotted and corrected</a>, Otzi\u2019s tattoos are confirmed to be the oldest known. As an aside, the <a href=\"http://siberiantimes.com/culture/others/features/siberian-princess-reveals-her-2500-year-old-tattoos/\" target=\"_blank\">Princess of Ukok</a> who is famed for her intricate, highly artistic tattoos of fantastical animals and dates to 400\u2013200 B.C., is 13th (or so, there are three other Pazyryk culture tattooed mummies from the same date range) on the list of oldest known tattoos.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Newly-discovered-tattoo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40022\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Newly-discovered-tattoo-150x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Newly-discovered-tattoo-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Newly-discovered-tattoo-200x158.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Newly-discovered-tattoo-430x341.jpg 430w\" title=\"Comparison of ribcage tattoo (T-15) seen with the naked eye versus the results of the processing obtained by multispectral imaging. \" width=\"150\"/></a>Otzi\u2019s tats are nothing like the Princess of Ukok\u2019s. They are simple in design \u2014 groupings of parallel lines and crosses \u2014 and were not decorative. There are 61 lines and crosses tattooed on his body, the last of them discovered recently almost 25 years after the Iceman\u2019s body was found. The tattoo was hidden in the darkened skin of his ribcage and was only identified thanks to <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207415000023\" target=\"_blank\">a new study</a> that used multispectral photographic imaging techniques to scan his entire body in a range of light from IR to UV. </p>\n<p>Most of the tattoos are in areas that radiological studies confirm must have been painful due to degeneration and chronic illness, which indicates they had a therapeutic purpose rather than a symbolic one. The ribcage tattoo isn\u2019t on a worn joint, his legs or his spine like the others, but Otzi suffered from several afflictions that could cause chest pain \u2014 gallbladder stones, whipworms, atherosclerosis \u2014 so it too could have been intended to alleviate pain. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Otzi-wrist-tattoo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40026\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Otzi-wrist-tattoo-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Otzi-wrist-tattoo-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Otzi-wrist-tattoo-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Otzi-wrist-tattoo-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Otzi-wrist-tattoo.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Otzi wrist tattoo.  Image courtesy the South Tyrol Museum of Archeology.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The tattoos were made by cutting fine lines into the epidermis and then rubbing charcoal dust into the cuts. Since almost all of the tattoos are on acupuncture points, researchers believe the cutting may have been an early form of acupuncture which first appears on the historical and archaeological record in China around 100 B.C. but documenting what was already an established practice by then.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although \u00d6tzi is the oldest tattooed human, the paper\u2019s authors conclude this will likely change: \u00d6tzi\u2019s tattoos are indicative of social and/or therapeutic practices that predate him, and future archaeological finds and new techniques should someday lead to even older evidence of tattooed mummies.</p>\n<p>\u201cApart from the historical implications of our paper, we shouldn\u2019t forget the cultural roles tattoos have played over millennia,\u201d [study co-author Lars] Krutak says. \u201cCosmetic tattoos \u2014 like those of the Chinchorro mummy \u2014 and therapeutic tattoos \u2014 like those of the Iceman \u2014 have been around for a very long time. This demonstrates to me that the desire to adorn and heal the body with tattoo is a very ancient part of our human past and culture.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Otzi has the world\u2019s oldest known tattoos\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40020\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40020#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2015/12/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

upon us and so is what has become an annual tradition here, the Year in History Blog History. We had another milestone which, while the number was a tad on the random side, turned out to be my favorite milestone celebration ever. Why? Because we rang in six million pageviews with <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34428\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Austin, astronaut, a man barely alive</a> but somehow still able to rock the double-knit polyester leisure suit. I was surprised and delighted to find so many comments from people who love the Six Million Dollar Man as much as I do.

The Sulaymaniyah Museum, Iraq. Photo \u00a9 Osama S.M. Amin.\" width=\"99\"/></a>The most read story of the year going by pageviews was the one about the Dutch <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34935\" target=\"_blank\">soccer hooligans vandalizing</a> the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32493\" target=\"_blank\">newly restored Barcaccia fountain</a> at the base of Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps. Short on its heels was one of my favorite, if not <em>the</em> favorite, post of the year: the cuneiform tablet that added <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38631\" target=\"_blank\">20 more lines to the Epic of Gilgamesh</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36178\" target=\"_blank\">awesomeness of the Viking blacksmith\u2019s grave</a> drew the third largest numbers of views, and the momentous discovery of an <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38394\" target=\"_blank\">archaic home from the 6th century B.C.</a> underneath the Quirinale Hill in Rome came in fourth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34988\" height=\"109\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan-150x109.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan-200x145.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buddha-and-scan-430x312.jpg 430w\" title=\"Buddha statue and scan revealing mummy within. Images courtesy the Drents Museum.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Number five on the list is also my favorite photograph of the year. It\u2019s the CT scan of the cross-legged meditating Buddha statue that has a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34978\" target=\"_blank\">mummified person inside of it</a>. I learned about the brutal process of self-mummification thanks to that post, which was horrifying and fascinating at the same time if not in equal measure, even though the CT scan showed the internal organs had been removed so the person inside the statue hadn\u2019t actually gotten that way by starving, dehydrating and poisoning himself over the course of six years.</p>\n<p>That post also corrected an error that was widespread in the general media coverage of the Buddha mummy, namely that its presence inside the statue was revealed by the CT scan. The statue was part of a traveling museum exhibition about mummies, so obviously the fact that there was a mummy inside the state was already known. That\u2019s why they scanned it in the first place. Still, once a mistake like that gets into a headline or a lede, it\u2019s almost impossible to carve it out. The days of a front page correction fixing the problem are over.</p>\n<p>That goes double for a big mistake in History.com\u2019s Today in History feature. I informed History.com that they had confused 18th century <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39323\" target=\"_blank\">surveyor Andrew Ellicott</a> with his great-grandson and dendrochronology pioneer Andrew Ellicott Douglass in their entry on the first recorded observation of a meteor shower in North America. I got an email back saying they were looking into it, but their erroneous article still stands. Perhaps they\u2019ll have fixed it by the time November 12th comes around next year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39247\" height=\"104\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/My-Wifes-Lovers-by-Carl-Kahler-1891-430x298.jpg 430w\" title=\"&quot;My Wife's Lovers&quot; by Carl Kahler, 1891-1893. Image courtesy Sotheby's.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Another widespread story that needed some correcting is runner-up for favorite picture: the sale of the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39239\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s greatest cat painting</a>.\u201d Carl Kahler\u2019s monumental 1893 painting of wealthy San Francisco socialite and philanthropist Kate Birdsall Johnson\u2019s 43 cats sold for $826,000 made news all over the cat-loving Internet. Mrs. Johnson came off of her posthumous virality a little the worse for wear since apocryphal stories of her being a crazy cat lady with hundreds of cats roaming the house got repeated over and over again. In fact she was a thoughtful, devout, generous person who left valuable property and monies in her will to found a hospital for indigent women and children. That hospital still exists, albeit in a new location (the old one was felled in the 1906 earthquake) and under a new name.</p>\n<p>It was a particular good year for film discoveries, I think. I don\u2019t just mean lost films that were found hiding out in vaults, but personal discoveries, films that were known but that I discovered in 2015. The most important actual discovery of the year was the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34829\" target=\"_blank\">film of the 1915 <em>Eastland</em> disaster</a> found in Dutch newsreels. The ship which killed 844 people when it capsized while still moored just feet from the bank of the Chicago River was captured in important photographs by groundbreaking photojournalist Jun Fujita, but this is the first film of the disaster known to have survived.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38018\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art-430x620.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Daughter-of-Dawn-poster-cover-art.jpg 1200w\" title=\"The Daughter of Dawn poster and cover art. Image courtesy Milestone Films.\" width=\"103\"/></a>As far as personal finds go, I still laugh like an idiot at Douglas Fairbanks as the brave, clueless, high as a kite <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36356\" target=\"_blank\">detective Coke Ennyday</a>. That was a random surprise find. Finding <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38010\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Daughter of Dawn</em> on Netflix</a>, on the other hand, was the happy outcome of years of checking in on the story. I\u2019ve been anxious to see the rediscovered treasure since I <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18218\" target=\"_blank\">first wrote about it in 2012</a>, and much to my amazement, it did not disappoint even after years of buildup. It\u2019s a great picture in many ways, capturing an era that was bygone even as it was being filmed.</p>\n<p>My favorite videos of the year were all about the technology and procedure of historical preservation and exploration. First there was the all-too-brief view of how Historic Royal Palaces conservators go about <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37989\" target=\"_blank\">washing the fragile 17th century tapestries</a> under their care. With all the custom technology \u2014 the giant horizontal car wash made specifically for tapestries \u2014 the best part was how tenderly the conservators sponge away the dirt and blot away the moisture. The composite video made from <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39264\" target=\"_blank\">synchroton X-ray imaging of a corroded 17th century metal box</a> blew my mind purely from a tech standpoint. The detail and resolution of the images opens up a world of new possibilities for non-invasive exploration of artifacts that are otherwise too fragile to be touched.</p>\n<p>Speaking of history and technology, the discovery that an eye salve from <em>Bald\u2019s Leechbook</em>, a 10th century Anglo-Saxon book of remedies for illness, kills MRSA superbug bacteria with ruthless efficiency could have enormous implications in our soon-to-be post-antibiotic world. There were some heartbreaking responses to that story from people who have lived for years with persistent infections and are desperate to find a solution. Here\u2019s hoping the research gets all the support it needs going forward so they don\u2019t have to crowdfund for a measly \u00a31,000 to hire a summer intern.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39180\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after-200x147.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Van-Ostade-A-Village-Fair-after-430x317.jpg 430w\" title='\"A Village Fair with a Church Behind\" by Isack van Ostade, 1643, after cleaning.

Oh well, at least there\u2019s some sort of segue in there, even if it is a pathogenic one. Let\u2019s face, it\u2019s not a good History Blog year without some good poop stories, like the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35135\" target=\"_blank\">25 tons of pigeon poop</a> cleaned out of the 14th c. tower in Rye, a medieval city on the English Channel coast. Also we saw <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36317\" target=\"_blank\">the greatest of all updates</a> to the story of the barrels of poop found in Odense, Denmark. Researchers sifting through compacted 14th century excrement one teaspoon at a time, a designated expert poop-sniffer, museum Smell-O-Vision: that post and its comment thread made me inordinately happy. As did the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39178\" target=\"_blank\">hidden pooper found in the 17th century Dutch painting</a> by Royal Collection curators.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36139\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-150x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum-430x387.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roman-owl-disc-fibula-Bornholm-National-Museum.jpg 1324w\" title=\"Roman owl disk fibula, 1st-3rd c.

Its bright enameled colors, rarity and sheer cuteness completely won me over.

Several comments on the latter story appreciated that I\u2019d said conservators were keeping the rifle in its highly weathered condition \u201cbecause it\u2019s cool.\u201d What\u2019s funny is that I actually thought about it a lot when I was writing. I was going to break down all the reasons they\u2019d decided not to restore it, but then I realized that it all boiled down to the same thing: because it\u2019s cool. There are a million Winchester \u201973s. This one stands out because some poor devil left it leaning against a tree for 130 years and now it looks kickass.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37421\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/02-Boeslunde-guldspiralerFoto-Museum-Vestsj\u00e6lland-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Intact gold spirals from Boeslunde are up to three centimeters long.

They were found under a pile of gold coins and the spirals are so awesome they completely eclipsed the gold coin hoard. The comment thread on the spirals is particularly great too. Lots of interesting contributions from people who use or produce similar objects in embroidery and machining metal. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37844\" target=\"_blank\">The inscribed sword</a> from the 13th or 14th century inspired a wealth of fascinating comments as well. Everyone likes a mystery, or at least we few, we nerdy few, we band of history-obsessed brothers do.</p>\n<p>I also loved the comments on the story about the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38414\" target=\"_blank\">7th century Christian skeletons</a> found in front of the Temple of Concordia at Paestum because you were so enthusiastic about the fabulous hidden prostitute conspiracy story. One of the joys of writing this blog is when something that tickles me tickles y\u2019all too. I love it even more when it\u2019s a tangent that you pick up on rather than the main thread of the story. I\u2019m not sure why. Validation that my meanderings were worthwhile, I suppose.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Copy-of-Childeric-ring-at-Ashmolean-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37355\" height=\"114\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Copy-of-Childeric-ring-at-Ashmolean-Museum-150x114.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Copy-of-Childeric-ring-at-Ashmolean-Museum-150x114.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Copy-of-Childeric-ring-at-Ashmolean-Museum-200x152.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Copy-of-Childeric-ring-at-Ashmolean-Museum-430x326.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Copy-of-Childeric-ring-at-Ashmolean-Museum.jpg 438w\" title=\"Copy of the ring of the King Childeric I at the Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Sometimes the meandering becomes an entire post of its own, as in the case of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37323\" target=\"_blank\">Childeric\u2019s treasure</a>, a story I came across while researching something else I can\u2019t remember anymore and that became something of an obsession for days. The story about <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38331\" target=\"_blank\">Emily Post\u2019s madcap road trip</a> from coast to coast came about in much the same way.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a heartbreaking year for history lovers. The destruction of so much of our shared cultural heritage in the Middle East by terrorism and war is almost unbearable. The brutal murder of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38037\" target=\"_blank\">Khaled el-Asaad</a>, a great man who dedicated his life to the historic patrimony of Syria and the gave his life for it too, was an agonizing loss to his family, colleagues and all the rest of us who where so beholden to him without even realizing it until he was gone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Max-von-Oppenheim-with-Venus-at-Tell-Halaf-Museum1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40131\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Max-von-Oppenheim-with-Venus-at-Tell-Halaf-Museum1-101x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Max-von-Oppenheim-with-Venus-at-Tell-Halaf-Museum1-101x150.jpg 101w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Max-von-Oppenheim-with-Venus-at-Tell-Halaf-Museum1-430x634.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Max-von-Oppenheim-with-Venus-at-Tell-Halaf-Museum1.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Max von Oppenheim, excavator of Tell Halaf, with Enthroned Goddess at the Tell Halaf Museum in Berlin, 1930s.\" width=\"101\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Enthroned-Goddess-after1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40130\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 91px) 100vw, 91px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Enthroned-Goddess-after1-91x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Enthroned-Goddess-after1-91x150.jpg 91w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Enthroned-Goddess-after1-183x300.jpg 183w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Enthroned-Goddess-after1-430x702.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Enthroned-Goddess-after1.jpg 627w\" title=\"Enthroned Goddess restored from thousands of fragments.

It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Europe was facing the rubble of its own history, torn apart by total war. The sculptures and reliefs of Tell Halaf in Berlin were bombed to smithereens when the museum took a direct hit from an incendiary bomb in 1943. Seventy years later, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/7021\" target=\"_blank\">they were put back together</a>.</p>\n<p>Three years ago, author Hilary Mantel, author of the exceptional Tudor historical fiction <em>Wolf Hall</em>, <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n04/hilary-mantel/royal-bodies\" target=\"_blank\">gave a speech</a> about the public\u2019s relationship to royal families at a London Review of Books event. It made the news because some media outlets plucked quotes about the Duchess of Cambridge and made them out to be cruel criticisms of the former Kate Middleton rather than the astute and apposite observation about how people, spurred on by an obsessive press, fetishize her and box her in. It\u2019s a great speech, but the part that struck me most profoundly was about the discovery of the remains of Richard III.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Why are we all so pleased about digging up a king? Perhaps because the present is paying some of the debt it owes to the past, and science has come to the aid of history. The king stripped by the victors has been reclothed in his true identity. This is the essential process of history, neatly illustrated: loss, retrieval.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve thought of that last line so many times this year, as horrific destruction followed horrific destruction. What was lost can be found again, even if its original form is gone forever. That is what history does. That is what we do every time we read history. We find what was lost.</p>\n<p>Thank you all so very much for reading and commenting and sending me the kindest compliments and hottest story tips.

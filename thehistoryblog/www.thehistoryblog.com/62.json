Museum volunteers went to Southend to inspect it in person. They found it in its original case on the floor of a shed, confirmed it was a Lorenz teleprinter and paid the seller the \u201cBuy it now\u201d price of \u00a39.50 ($14). It is going on display with a Lorenz SZ42 code machine loaned by the Norwegian Armed Forces Museum to tell the full story of how the British broke the Lorenz code.  \n The Lorenz SZ42 cipher machine was used to transmit the top-secret messages of the German High Command to Army Commands in German-occupied countries. The operator would type the message in plain text on the keyboard of a teleprinter connected to the Lorenz cipher machine which would then convert the message into code. It was in widespread use from 1942 until the end of the war, and with 12 wheels each with a different number of cams, the code it generated was deemed unbreakable.  \n Andy Clark, chairman of the trustees at The National Museum of Computing, said the Lorenz was stationed in secure locations as \u201cit was far bigger than the famous portable Enigma machine\u201d.\n\u201cEverybody knows about Enigma, but the Lorenz machine was used for strategic communications,\u201d said Clark.\n\u201cIt is so much more complicated than the Enigma machine and, after the war, machines of the same style remained in use.\u201d \n Little did the Nazis know the British deciphered the code six months after the first experimental Lorenz SZ40 started sending data in June of 1941. A remarkable feat of reverse engineering by cryptographer Bill Tutte cracked the code in January 1942. Tutte and his team at Bletchley Park figured out the design and function of the machine without ever having seen one. Operator error in a message transmitted from Athens to Vienna on August 30th, 1941, gave the cryptographers a unique opportunity Bletchley to figure out the plain text and the keystream.  \n Bletchley analysts saw their first Lorenz cipher machine in 1945. By then they had intercepted and read enormously important tactical messages for four years. That\u2019s how the Allies were able to confirm that the Germans had swallowed their bluff that the D-Day landings were happening at Calais. The breaking of Lorenz also played a major role in the construction of Colossus, the first programmable computer. Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers devised Colossus to calculate the positions of the 12 wheels of the Lorenz code machine in hours rather than weeks. \n The Lorenz SZ42 encryption machine is extremely rare. Only 200 were built during the war and just four known examples survive. Lorenz teleprinters, on the other hand, were standard production, with a large number of commercial models manufactured. The military-issue teleprinter is much more rare than the commercial models. Bletchley staff first thought it was a standard commercial teleprinter. They only realized it was the rarer military issue, complete with its wartime serial number, swastika accents and a special key for the insignia of the Waffen-SS, when they brought it back to the museum for cleaning and conservation. \n The code machine is missing its motor. The museum hopes there\u2019s a Lorenz motor out there in someone else\u2019s shed that would allow them to restore the whole apparatus to working order. If you see something in your attic that looks like a motor in smooth black capsule-like casing with shafts on both sides manufactured by the Lorenz Company at Tempelhof in Berlin, please contact the National Museum of Computing. \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\"

Operator error in a message transmitted from Athens to Vienna on August 30th, 1941, gave the cryptographers a unique opportunity Bletchley to figure out the plain text and the keystream. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42434\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas.-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas..jpg 1500w\" title=\"Colossus Wrens, Betty O'Connell and Irene Dixon with Lorenz SZ42 at the National Museum of Computing.

By then they had intercepted and read enormously important tactical messages for four years. That\u2019s how the Allies were able to confirm that the Germans had swallowed their bluff that the D-Day landings were happening at Calais. The breaking of Lorenz also played a major role in the construction of Colossus, the first programmable computer. Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers devised Colossus to calculate the positions of the 12 wheels of the Lorenz code machine in hours rather than weeks.</p>\n<p>The Lorenz SZ42 encryption machine is extremely rare. Only 200 were built during the war and just four known examples survive. Lorenz teleprinters, on the other hand, were standard production, with a large number of commercial models manufactured. The military-issue teleprinter is much more rare than the commercial models. Bletchley staff first thought it was a standard commercial teleprinter. They only realized it was the rarer military issue, complete with its wartime serial number, swastika accents and a special key for the insignia of the Waffen-SS, when they brought it back to the museum for cleaning and conservation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42438\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Lorenz motor.

Rangers found a large number of pits dug by treasure hunters looking to steal Civil War artifacts. They likely used metal detectors to discover small, easily removed and carried objects like uniform buttons, buckles and bullets. </p>\n<p>These excavation pits were discovered by park staff last week. That area has now been sealed off as an active crime scene while the rest of the park remains open to visitors who, unlike the looters, have respect for thousands of Union and Confederate troops who were killed and wounded in the Siege of Petersburg. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Since the park is nestled in an urban setting, Rogers said, \u201cSomeone may have seen something we need to know. The public can help by calling in any tips or other information. The toll-free number is <span class=\"gc-cs-link\" id=\"gc-number-0\" title=\"Call with Google Voice\">888-653-0009</span> and callers can leave a message.\u201d</p>\n<p>The looting at Petersburg National Battlefield is a federal crime covered by the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Violators, upon conviction, can be fined up to $20,000.00 or imprisoned for two years, or both.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately it will be difficult to recover any looted artifacts. The kinds of things likely to have been found would be next to impossible to trace specifically to the Petersburg battlefield as opposed to the Civil War period in general.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Breastworks-of-the-Confederate-Fort-Mahone-aka-Fort-Damnation-outside-Petersburg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42428\" height=\"136\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Breastworks-of-the-Confederate-Fort-Mahone-aka-Fort-Damnation-outside-Petersburg-150x136.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Breastworks-of-the-Confederate-Fort-Mahone-aka-Fort-Damnation-outside-Petersburg-150x136.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Breastworks-of-the-Confederate-Fort-Mahone-aka-Fort-Damnation-outside-Petersburg-200x181.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Breastworks-of-the-Confederate-Fort-Mahone-aka-Fort-Damnation-outside-Petersburg-430x389.jpg 430w\" title=\"Breastworks of the Confederate Fort Mahone aka Fort Damnation outside Petersburg, 1865.

The longest siege in US history began in June of 1864 after General Ulysses S. Grant put a stop to six weeks of failed frontal assaults on Confederate General Robert E. Lee\u2019s army defending Richmond and withdrew to Petersburg. Then the second largest city in Virginia, Petersburg was a railroad hub and an essential supply line to Richmond. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dead-Confederates-in-the-trenches-of-Fort-Mahone-April-3-1865.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42429\" height=\"138\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dead-Confederates-in-the-trenches-of-Fort-Mahone-April-3-1865-150x138.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dead-Confederates-in-the-trenches-of-Fort-Mahone-April-3-1865-150x138.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dead-Confederates-in-the-trenches-of-Fort-Mahone-April-3-1865-200x184.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dead-Confederates-in-the-trenches-of-Fort-Mahone-April-3-1865-430x395.jpg 430w\" title=\"Dead Confederates in the trenches of Fort Mahone, April 3, 1865.

The subsequent siege lasted nine and a half months and saw a dozen major engagements between the Union and Confederate armies. With soldiers digging ever-growing networks of trenches, long periods of inaction peppered with battles that achieved few tactical goals at a great cost of human life, Petersburg presaged the approach that would characterize the First World War.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-battle-of-Petersburg-Va.-April-2nd-1865.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42422\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-battle-of-Petersburg-Va.-April-2nd-1865-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-battle-of-Petersburg-Va.-April-2nd-1865-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-battle-of-Petersburg-Va.-April-2nd-1865-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-battle-of-Petersburg-Va.-April-2nd-1865-430x318.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-battle-of-Petersburg-Va.-April-2nd-1865.jpg 1492w\" title=\"The Battle of Petersburg, April 2nd, 1865.

The Union victory forced General Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The city of Richmond surrendered on April 3rd. Lee\u2019s Army of Northern Virginia, mortally wounded by exhaustion, disease, hunger and desertion, fought on for another week until it was defeated at the Battle of Appomattox Court House and Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant on April 9th, 1865. That triggered the surrender of the rest of the surviving Confederate forces and the end of the American Civil War.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Looters dig up Petersburg National Battlefield\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42420\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42420#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-42404\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42404\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Ancient gold wreath kept in a box under the bed\">Ancient gold wreath kept in a box under the bed</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, May 29th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-in-cardboard-box.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42408\" height=\"115\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-in-cardboard-box-150x115.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-in-cardboard-box-150x115.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-in-cardboard-box-200x153.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-in-cardboard-box-430x330.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ancient gold wreath in cardboard box.

It\u2019s a hoop of pure gold with gold myrtle leaves and flowers attached that obscure the hoop and give it the look of a natural myrtle wreath when seen from the front. The workmanship is very fine, with delicate veining on the leaves and details like the anthers and filaments of the flowers.</p>\n<p>The style suggests it dates to around the 2nd or 3rd century B.C., but its exact age can\u2019t be determined.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42407\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ancient-gold-wreath-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Hellenistic gold wreath.

Dirt suggests recent excavation, not something that was bought legitimately 60, 70 or even 80 years ago. Gold wreaths are expensive, small and portable which makes  them highly desirable to looters. In 2006 <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/print/2006/dec/11/local/me-getty11\" target=\"_blank\">the Getty had to return one</a> they had bought in 1993 from a \u201cSwiss private collection,\u201d ie, a gang of Greek smugglers, to Greece. In 2012 <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17282\" target=\"_blank\">traffickers were caught red-handed</a> trying the sell a looted gold wreath in Greece. On the other hand, there are plenty of nooks and crannies in the hammered sheet gold for dirt to nestle in for the long haul. If it was never professionally cleaned, it\u2019s possible that some of the soil from its burial place stuck over decades.</p>\n<p>It almost certainly was deliberately buried as a funerary offering. Wreaths of braided flowers, grasses, leaves and branches were used in ancient Greece and Rome as symbols of victory, honor and sovereignty crowning the heads of Olympic athletes, generals on the battlefield, even literary giants like Ovid and Virgil. Wreaths also symbolized the ascension to immortality or apotheosis, often seen in funerary monuments held over the head of a deified emperor, for example. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Wreath-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42406\" height=\"77\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Wreath-det-150x77.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Wreath-det-150x77.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Wreath-det-200x102.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Wreath-det-430x220.jpg 430w\" title=\"Somerset wreath detail.

The myrtle was associated with the goddess Aphrodite, symbolizing love and immortality. Myrtle wreaths were worn at weddings, by victorious athletes and by initiates into the Eleusinian mysteries.

Some barrels from the same brew could go bad.

Mycologist Dr. Emil Christian Hansen, who in addition to being a veritable paragon of human determination is pretty much directly responsible for every healthy sip of lager you\u2019ve ever had. Hansen was born in Ribe, Denmark, in 1842, the son of a hardworking laundress and an alcoholic Foreign Legion vet who lived on the streets a homeless drifter. To help support the family, from an early age Hansen took on all kinds of jobs, from acting to house painting. When he got a steady job as a tutor, he was finally able to support his formal schooling. He graduated high school at the age of 29 and matriculated at the University of Copenhagen where he studied zoology with a particular interest in fungi.</p>\n<p>(Random historical connection interlude: when he was a student at the University of Copenhagen, Hansen was the assistant of Professor of Zoology Japetus Steenstrup. Steenstrup, also head of the university-affiliated Royal Natural History Museum, in 1850 loaned Charles Darwin some modern and fossil barnacle specimens from his personal collection to aid Darwin in his research for <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. Four years later Darwin expressed his gratitude by gifting Steenstrup with 77 barnacle fossils, 55 of which were <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31986\" target=\"_blank\">discovered in storage and put on display</a> at the Natural History Museum in 2014. In 1876, Hasen would co-author the first Danish language translation of Darwin\u2019s <em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em>.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Carlsberg-Laboratory-Carlsberg-Group.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42396\" height=\"107\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Carlsberg-Laboratory-Carlsberg-Group-150x107.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Carlsberg-Laboratory-Carlsberg-Group-150x107.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Carlsberg-Laboratory-Carlsberg-Group-200x143.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Carlsberg-Laboratory-Carlsberg-Group-430x308.jpg 430w\" title=\"Carlsberg Laboratory, early 1900s.

Just two years later, Hansen was head of the laboratory. In 1883, he made a momentous breakthrough while studying yeast. He realized bad beer wasn\u2019t caused solely by bacterial contamination, as Louis Pasteur had proposed, but also by contamination from wild yeast strains. He isolated a single cell of favorable yeast and grew it into a pure yeast culture he called \u201cUnterhefe Nr. I\u201d (bottom-fermenting yeast no. 1) which when used as the sole yeast source in the fermentation process ensured that the microorganisms which caused beer sickness would not develop in the lager.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/J-C-Jacobsen-and-Carlsberg-employees-1885-Carlsberg-Group.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42395\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/J-C-Jacobsen-and-Carlsberg-employees-1885-Carlsberg-Group-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/J-C-Jacobsen-and-Carlsberg-employees-1885-Carlsberg-Group-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/J-C-Jacobsen-and-Carlsberg-employees-1885-Carlsberg-Group-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/J-C-Jacobsen-and-Carlsberg-employees-1885-Carlsberg-Group-430x305.jpg 430w\" title=\"J.C, Jacobsen and Carlsberg employees, 1885.

Jacobsen was a philanthropic, progressive-minded man who was deeply committed not just to enlisting science to produce excellent beer, but to supporting scientific endeavors for the betterment of mankind in general. Jacobsen could have easily patented the \u201cclean yeast\u201d isolated in his laboratory, but instead he spread the purified yeast culture far and wide, reaching out to competitors and offering them living yeast specimens free of charge. Thus Carlsberg ended lager\u2019s beer sickness problem and lager began its reign as the most popular beer in the world, today comprising 90% of all beer sold. Most of the lager produced today uses the same strain isolated by Hansen and distributed by Jacobsen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1883-Carlsberg-lager-bottle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42400\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1883-Carlsberg-lager-bottle-59x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1883-Carlsberg-lager-bottle-59x150.jpg 59w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1883-Carlsberg-lager-bottle-118x300.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1883-Carlsberg-lager-bottle-315x800.jpg 315w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1883-Carlsberg-lager-bottle.jpg 827w\" title=\"Carlsberg lager, 1883 bottle.

Researchers at the lab uncorked one and sipped the contents. It was still good, apparently, although it no longer tasted like lager so much as a sherry or port. Carlsberg Laboratory scientists then took samples from the bottle in an attempt to isolate the original live brewing yeast that revolutionized lager production worldwide. Nobody thought they\u2019d be successful, but against all predictions, after a year of research they succeeded, thanks to the thick layer of precipitate at the bottom of the bottle which was characteristic of late 19th century lager. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rebrew-process.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42386\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rebrew-process-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rebrew-process-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rebrew-process-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rebrew-process-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Rebrew in process.

I, Carlsberg\u2019s brewers set to the challenging task of recreating the first consistent quality lager. While the brewery has exceptional archives and even a museum, there is no exact recipe for the 1883 lager. All they had to go on in the records was the ratio of water, malt and hops, because the brewers back then didn\u2019t write down the detailed recipe. At the time the brewery really only made one type of beer, and brewers worked on multiple batches a day. They knew the recipe backwards and forwards, so they didn\u2019t bother to document it in writing. </p>\n<p>The ratio was a solid starting point, though, and they did know a great deal about the sources of ingredients and the equipment used. They acquired floor-malted barley malt (floor malting was the system used in 1883). They secured well water drawn through the chalk layer that underlays Copenhagen, just as the water from the 68-foot feep well that supplied the Carlsberg brewery in 1883 was. They used \u201cGammel Dansk\u201d barley, one of the first domestic barleys J.C. Jacobsen considered of high enough quality to use instead of importing Scottish and British varieties. Like the 1883 brew, the rebrew was not filtered or pasteurized, nor was gelatin added to clear the brew of hazy sediment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Handblown-glass-bottle-2.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42388\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Handblown-glass-bottle-2-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Handblown-glass-bottle-2-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Handblown-glass-bottle-2-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Handblown-glass-bottle-2-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Handblown glass bottle for the rebrew.

Holmegaard has been making Carlsberg bottles since the 1850s. Nielsen consulted with Carlsberg museum staff and glass collectors to determine what kind of bottle would have been used in 1883. He found that machine moulded glass bottles were only produced starting in the 1890s, so he used a wooden mould and to mouth-blow the green glass bottles just as his vocational ancestors had done.</p>\n<p>On May 18th, the press, craft beer producers, connoisseurs and critics were invited <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/54916-carlsberg-recreates-historic-beer.html\" target=\"_blank\">the first tasting of the rebrew</a>, named the Father of Quality Lager.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/168482158\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved,\u201d Bjarke Bundgaard, a beer history expert for Carlsberg, told Live Science after the cask was tapped. \u201cWe were very afraid of unwanted microorganisms visiting in the barrel.

Inside the cave just 336 meters (1102 feet) from the entrance, they found two circular structures made of whole and broken stalagmites. Archaeologists carefully documented the site, but were unable to date it. Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating on a burnt animal bone found nearby returned a date of older than 47,600 years ago, which pushes the outer limit of C-14 dating\u2019s 50,000-year range. The date dangled the intriguing possibility that the stalagmite circles had been built by Neanderthals, the only people in Europe from 400,000 to 40,000 years ago when anatomically modern humans moved in and rapidly took over.</p>\n<p>Archaeological exploration of the site ended abruptly when the lead archaeologist F. Rouzaud died prematurely in 1999, and the difficult access to the cave kept other archaeologists from picking up where he left off. In 2013, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences palaeoclimatologist Sophie Verheyden, a speleologist who has a vacation home in the area, put together a team of experts to examine the annular stalagmites structures. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3D-reconstruction-of-the-structures-in-the-Bruniquel-Cave.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-42367\" height=\"77\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3D-reconstruction-of-the-structures-in-the-Bruniquel-Cave-200x77.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3D-reconstruction-of-the-structures-in-the-Bruniquel-Cave-200x77.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3D-reconstruction-of-the-structures-in-the-Bruniquel-Cave-150x58.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3D-reconstruction-of-the-structures-in-the-Bruniquel-Cave-430x166.jpg 430w\" title=\"3D reconstruction of the stalagmite structures in the Bruniquel Cave.

The stalagmite structures are therefore among the oldest firmly dated human constructions, and Neanderthals were the only humans in Europe at that time.</p>\n<p>The earliest surviving evidence of constructions by anatomically modern humans  \u2014 collapsed circular structures made from mammoth bones or dear antlers \u2014 date to around 20,000 years ago. Indications of earlier Neanderthal building are limited to a few postholes and remnants of dry stone walls, but they cannot be conclusively attributed to Neanderthals or conclusively dated. The great archaeological gifts of the Bruniquel Cave, therefore, are the complexity and survival of the stalagmite circles and the repeatable, reliable direct dating.</p>\n<p>This momentous find redefines our understanding of Neanderthal culture and abilities.

First, it reveals the appropriation of a deep karst space (including lighting) by a pre-modern human species. Second, it concerns elaborate constructions that have never been reported before, made with hundreds of partially calibrated, broken stalagmites (speleofacts) that appear to have been deliberately moved and placed in their current locations, along with the presence of several intentionally heated zones. Our results therefore suggest that the Neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought for this hominid species.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s a compilation of photographs and 3D animated flyover of the site in the video <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/neanderthals-built-cave-structures-and-no-one-knows-why-1.19975#/\" target=\"_blank\">on this page</a>.

Image courtesy Historic Royal Palaces.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Speaking of Queen Elizabeth I, Historic Royal Palaces (HRP) curators think an altar cloth from St Faith\u2019s Church in Bacton, Herefordshire, may be the <a href=\"http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/regional/14495935.Altar_cloth_kept_in_rural_Herefordshire_church_confirmed_as_Tudor_cloth_linked_to_Queen_Elizabeth_I/\" target=\"_blank\">only known surviving piece of one of the monarch\u2019s famously elaborate gowns</a>. There is no conclusive proof that the cross-shaped piece of fabric once belonged to the queen herself, but there\u2019s very solid circumstantial evidence. </p>\n<p>The altar cloth has belonged to the small rural church for centuries. The richly embroidered cloth, long rumored to have a connection to the Virgin Queen, stopped being used as altar cloth and was placed in a glass display case in 1909. The church received it from Blanche Perry, daughter of a Welsh nobleman who was born in Bacton and became one of the queen\u2019s most loyal and longest serving ladies. Brought to court by her aunt Lady Troy who Henry VIII appointed Lady Mistress to his children Prince Edward and Princess Elizabeth, Blanche was Elizabeth\u2019s attendant for 57 years, ultimately rising to the exalted rank of Chief Gentlewoman of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s most honourable Privy Chamber and Keeper of Her Majesty\u2019s jewels, a role she held from 1565 until her death in 1590.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blanche-Parry-kneels-before-Gloriana.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42358\" height=\"88\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blanche-Parry-kneels-before-Gloriana-150x88.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blanche-Parry-kneels-before-Gloriana-150x88.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blanche-Parry-kneels-before-Gloriana-200x118.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Blanche-Parry-kneels-before-Gloriana-430x254.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blanche Parry kneels before Queen Elizabeth I as Gloriana, funerary monument, St Faith's Church, Bacton.

Image courtesy Historic Royal Palaces.\" width=\"99\"/></a>Experts from the Historic Royal Palaces asked to examine the textile last year. They identified it as an Elizabethan skirt panel from the late 16th century, and not just any skirt panel, but one of royal quality. It is cream silk woven through with silver thread with embroidery in colored silks, gold thread and silver thread. It was embroidered with florals \u2014 columbines, daffodils, roses, honeysuckle, oak leaves, acorns, mistletoe \u2014 and animals \u2014 birds, dragonflies, butterflies, caterpillars, frogs, fish, dogs, stags, squirrels. There are also miniature boats being rowed by tiny humans. This was professional embroidery of the highest standard.</p>\n<p>The sumptuary laws explicitly reserved such rich garments for members of the immediate royal family. A single gown could cost the equivalent of labourer\u2019s yearly income. Curators believe it was a gift from the Queen to Blanche Parry, a rare, valued gift that was a token of the Queen\u2019s high esteem, love and friendship. Queen Elizabeth didn\u2019t give away her dresses very often, and no garments from her royal wardrobe have survived, only accessories. This section is the only piece of fabric known that is likely to have come from a gown of Elizabeth\u2019s. It survived because it was treated with reverence, very quickly converted into an altar piece and treated with utmost care for the next four centuries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/altar-cloth-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42330\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/altar-cloth-det-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/altar-cloth-det-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/altar-cloth-det-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/altar-cloth-det-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Animal embroidery detail.

Conservators will now analyze it and recommend a course of action that will preserve it in the long term. After it is conserved in the laboratories of Hampton Court, HRP hopes it will go on public display. St Faith\u2019s is still the undisputed owner, however, so they\u2019ll have to determine where it will be exhibited in the long-term. One possibility is that a replica will be made for the church, while the original is kept in the security and ideal conservation conditions of the Historic Royal Palaces.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/BD1Fy1WGqLk&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Altar cloth may be sole surviving Elizabeth I gown\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42357\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42357#comments\">8 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-42329\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42329\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Help save the Drake Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I\">Help save the Drake Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, May 25th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Drake-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-42332\" height=\"178\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Drake-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I-200x178.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Drake-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I-200x178.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Drake-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Drake-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I-430x384.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Drake-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Drake version of Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I, soon to be sold. Image courtesy the Art Fund.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Art Fund and Royal Museums Greenwich have launched <a href=\"https://www.savearmada.org/\" target=\"_blank\">a campaign to buy the iconic Armada Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I</a> before it\u2019s put up for public auction. The Art Fund has contributed \u00a31 million ($1,461,000) and Royal Museums Greenwich \u00a3400,000 ($584,000), its entire annual acquisitions budget, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. They need to raise another \u00a38.6 million ($12,564,000) to secure the portrait for its asking price of \u00a310 million or else it will be sold to the highest bidder. </p>\n<p>The oil-on-panel portrait was painted in around 1590 to commemorate the scrappy English navy\u2019s defeat of the mighty Spanish Armada in 1588 and has become an iconic representation of Queen Elizabeth. It has appeared in textbooks and inspired countless film and television portrayals of the Virgin Queen. Some scholars consider it the definitive representation of the English Renaissance.</p>\n<p>Queen Elizabeth stands with her elegant right hand covering North America \u2014 Spain of course claimed much of South America \u2014 on a globe. Next to her shoulder is a crown representing her rule of a new global empire, and her dress, hair and jewelry are festooned with pearls, symbols of virginity and the sea. The fabric of her gown is embroidered with suns, symbols of power and enlightenment. Behind her are two scenes from the defeat of the Spanish Armada: on the left English ships in the foreground sail towards the larger Spanish fleet, on the ship Spanish ships are buffeted onto the rocky coast of Ireland or Scotland by what was termed the \u201cProtestant Wind,\u201d the breath of God Himself weighing in on the side of England and Protestantism. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/National-Portrait-Gallery-Armada-Portrait.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42351\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/National-Portrait-Gallery-Armada-Portrait-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/National-Portrait-Gallery-Armada-Portrait-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/National-Portrait-Gallery-Armada-Portrait-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/National-Portrait-Gallery-Armada-Portrait-430x544.jpg 430w\" title=\"National Portrait Gallery version of the Armada Portrait. Image courtesy the National Portrait Gallery.\" width=\"118\"/></a>The portrait was unusual in its time for the horizontal orientation, and was immediately popular enough to inspire multiple versions. This is one of three versions of the portrait to survive. One of them is <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw02077/Queen-Elizabeth-I?LinkID=mp01452&amp;search=sas&amp;sText=elizabeth+i&amp;OConly=true&amp;role=sit&amp;rNo=8\" target=\"_blank\">in the National Portrait Gallery</a>. It was trimmed on both sides to make it a vertical portrait and the English and Spanish ships in the background, the very parts of the paintings that give it its meaning, were overpainted in black. Conservators discovered the overpainting and removed it in the 1970s. The other version is at <a href=\"http://www.woburnabbey.co.uk/abbey/art-and-the-collection/the-armada-portrait/\" target=\"_blank\">Woburn Abbey</a> and is thankfully still intact.</p>\n<p>The artist is unknown. Previously the National Portrait Gallery and Woburn Abbey versions were attributed to the Queen\u2019s Serjeant Painter George Gower, but the NPG now believes all three portraits were painted by different hands and have changed the attribution of their version to an unknown artist of the British school.</p>\n<p>The only version of the portrait still in private hands was once owned by, and likely was commissioned by, Sir Francis Drake which it makes it the most important of the three because of its close association with one of the heroes of the events depicted. It has been in his family ever since. It currently resides at Shardeloes in Buckinghamshire, the estate of the Tyrwhitt-Drake family. They\u2019re ready to sell, and if the campaign is successful, the portrait will belong to a public institution for the first time in 425 years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Royal Museums Greenwich would be the perfect home for this iconic painting, with its fine 16th- and 17th-century collections, maritime setting and world-renowned conservation expertise. If our campaign is successful, the portrait will hang at the newly renovated Queen\u2019s House, on the site of the original Greenwich Palace, where Elizabeth I was born. Plans are underway for a national programme to secure the widest possible audience. The painting is in a fragile condition and bringing it into public ownership now will secure its long-term future, conservation and display.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Woburn-Abbey-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42350\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Woburn-Abbey-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Woburn-Abbey-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Woburn-Abbey-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I-200x160.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Woburn-Abbey-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I-430x344.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Woburn-Abbey-version-of-Armada-Portrait-of-Elizabeth-I.jpg 1248w\" title=\"Woburn Abbey version of Armada Portrait of Elizabeth I.

Its background scenes of the victory over the Armada were also overpainted at one point, and the whole work is yellowed with missing flecks of paint.

Both pieces bear the mark of a head of a knight with the number three on his right side, a symbol in common use in Poland between 1921 an 1931 for 583 gold, which means the gold content is 583 parts per thousand, or just a hair under 14 karats. While the ring is missing its central gemstone and some of the smaller ones, several of them remain snug in their settings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/X-ray-of-mug.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42337\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/X-ray-of-mug-150x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/X-ray-of-mug-150x131.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/X-ray-of-mug-200x174.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/X-ray-of-mug-430x375.jpg 430w\" title=\"X-ray of mug.

Curators noticed that what had once seemed like the bottom of the mug was in fact pulling up, revealing a secret compartment. It kept its cache secure for more than 70 years before the metal gradually degraded, lifting the false bottom and separating it from the mug.

The edges are rough, which is at least in part due to corrosion, but I think the mug\u2019s owners cut out a circle from a discarded tin of some kind and then somehow fitted it into the mug so adeptly that it fooled the Nazis, the crews of people they had tearing apart people\u2019s belongings looking for valuables and from 1947 to 2016, the staff of the Auschwitz Museum.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jewelry-from-mug-wrapped.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42336\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jewelry-from-mug-wrapped-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jewelry-from-mug-wrapped-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jewelry-from-mug-wrapped-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jewelry-from-mug-wrapped-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Jewelry from mug wrapped, chain necklace still wrapped in canvas.

The first remains on the site were found during renovations to the college\u2019s Victorian building from 2010 to 2012. The discovery was kept under wraps until 2015, when Cambridge announced that archaeologists had unearthed the <a href=\"http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/400-human-skeletons-discovered-hidden-cemetery/story-26262107-detail/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">intact skeletal remains of 400 individuals</a>, plus the disarticulated remains of close to 1,000 more people. The bodies were interred in the cemetery of the medieval Hospital of St John the Evangelist, the college\u2019s namesake. It was in use between the 13th and 15th centuries and is one of the largest medieval hospital burial grounds ever discovered in Britain. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cambridge-Archaeological-Unit-excavates-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42298\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cambridge-Archaeological-Unit-excavates-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cambridge-Archaeological-Unit-excavates-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cambridge-Archaeological-Unit-excavates-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cambridge-Archaeological-Unit-excavates-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cambridge Archaeological Unit excavates cemetery of hospital of St John the Evangelist.

The hospital was founded by the community in 1195 to care for the indigent. It was a small structure in its infancy, but grew into a large institution that cared not just for the poor, but also for other residents and Cambridge University scholars. While the hospital did have support from the Church, the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jet-crucifix-buried-with-adult-male-15th-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42288\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 85px) 100vw, 85px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jet-crucifix-buried-with-adult-male-15th-c-128x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jet-crucifix-buried-with-adult-male-15th-c-128x150.jpg 128w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jet-crucifix-buried-with-adult-male-15th-c-200x233.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jet-crucifix-buried-with-adult-male-15th-c-430x501.jpg 430w\" title=\"Jet crucifix buried with adult male, 15th c.

There is very little evidence of clothing or grave goods. A few artifacts have been found but it\u2019s not clear from their positions that they were interred with the bodies. The vast majority of burials were done without coffins, many without even a shroud, likely because of the majority of patients at the hospital were poor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Area-1-North-excavation-medieval-skeletons-and-well.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42286\" height=\"80\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Area-1-North-excavation-medieval-skeletons-and-well-150x80.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Area-1-North-excavation-medieval-skeletons-and-well-150x80.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Area-1-North-excavation-medieval-skeletons-and-well-200x106.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Area-1-North-excavation-medieval-skeletons-and-well-430x229.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Area-1-North-excavation-medieval-skeletons-and-well.jpg 1075w\" title=\"Area 1 North excavation finds medieval skeletons and water well.

Archaeologists discovered six \u201ccemetery generations\u201d on the site, meaning six complete turnovers of the space. Older remains would be taken to the charnel house or the bones removed to make room for new bodies to be buried in the newly vacated areas. Despite the turnover, archaeologists also found gravel paths, a well and seeds from a number of flowering plants in the cemetery. This indicates the graves were tended to by the community, and the cemetery was less of a boneyard and more of a park-like space where people could pay their respects and grieve their dead. That\u2019s not something you find often in cemeteries of hospitals for the poor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13th-century-gravel-path-between-graves.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42297\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13th-century-gravel-path-between-graves-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13th-century-gravel-path-between-graves-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13th-century-gravel-path-between-graves-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13th-century-gravel-path-between-graves-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13th-century-gravel-path-between-graves.jpg 1555w\" title=\"13th century gravel path between graves.

Out of the identifiable remains, half of them were women, most of them between 25 and 45 years old. Given the high rates of death in childbirth of both mothers and babies at the time, you\u2019d expect to see more of the former and at least some of the latter. Historic research explained this imbalance. In 1250 the hospital promulgated an ordinance that prohibited the care of pregnant women. Its focus was to be \u201cpoor scholars and other wretched persons,\u201d as long as said wretched were not carrying future wretches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skeleton-in-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-cemetery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42291\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skeleton-in-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-cemetery-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skeleton-in-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-cemetery-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skeleton-in-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-cemetery-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skeleton-in-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-cemetery-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Skeleton-in-Hospital-of-St-John-the-Evangelist-cemetery.jpg 1555w\" title=\"Intact skeleton in St John the Evangelist hospital cemetery.

There were no osteological indications of plague on any of the bones and no mass graves of the types most commonly used to dispose quickly of the infectious dead. The dead of St John will nonetheless be of aid to scholars researching the effect of the Black Death on Cambridge.

Museum volunteers went to Southend to inspect it in person. They found it in its original case on the floor of a shed, confirmed it was a Lorenz teleprinter and paid the seller the \u201cBuy it now\u201d price of \u00a39.50 ($14). <a href=\"http://www.tnmoc.org/news/news-releases/encrypt-decrypt-full-lorenz-story\" target=\"_blank\">It is going on display</a> with a Lorenz SZ42 code machine loaned by the Norwegian Armed Forces Museum to tell the full story of how the British broke the Lorenz code. </p>\n<p>The Lorenz SZ42 cipher machine was used to transmit the top-secret messages of the German High Command to Army Commands in German-occupied countries. The operator would type the message in plain text on the keyboard of a teleprinter connected to the Lorenz cipher machine which would then convert the message into code. It was in widespread use from 1942 until the end of the war, and with 12 wheels each with a different number of cams, the code it generated was deemed unbreakable. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Andy Clark, chairman of the trustees at The National Museum of Computing, said the Lorenz was stationed in secure locations as \u201cit was far bigger than the famous portable Enigma machine\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody knows about Enigma, but the Lorenz machine was used for strategic communications,\u201d said Clark.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is so much more complicated than the Enigma machine and, after the war, machines of the same style remained in use.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Codebreakers-use-modified-British-Typex-cipher-machines-in-Hut-6-at-Bletchley-Park.-Bletchley-Park-Trust..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42435\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Codebreakers-use-modified-British-Typex-cipher-machines-in-Hut-6-at-Bletchley-Park.-Bletchley-Park-Trust.-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Codebreakers-use-modified-British-Typex-cipher-machines-in-Hut-6-at-Bletchley-Park.-Bletchley-Park-Trust.-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Codebreakers-use-modified-British-Typex-cipher-machines-in-Hut-6-at-Bletchley-Park.-Bletchley-Park-Trust.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Codebreakers-use-modified-British-Typex-cipher-machines-in-Hut-6-at-Bletchley-Park.-Bletchley-Park-Trust.-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"British codebreakers using modified British Typex cipher machines in Hut 6 at Bletchley Park to decypher Lorenz code in 1942.

A remarkable feat of reverse engineering by cryptographer Bill Tutte cracked the code in January 1942. Tutte and his team at Bletchley Park figured out the design and function of the machine without ever having seen one. Operator error in a message transmitted from Athens to Vienna on August 30th, 1941, gave the cryptographers a unique opportunity Bletchley to figure out the plain text and the keystream. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42434\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas.-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colossus-Wrens-Betty-OConnell-and-Irene-Dixon-with-Lorenz-SZ42.-Photo-courtesy-Charles-Coultas..jpg 1500w\" title=\"Colossus Wrens, Betty O'Connell and Irene Dixon with Lorenz SZ42 at the National Museum of Computing.

By then they had intercepted and read enormously important tactical messages for four years. That\u2019s how the Allies were able to confirm that the Germans had swallowed their bluff that the D-Day landings were happening at Calais. The breaking of Lorenz also played a major role in the construction of Colossus, the first programmable computer. Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers devised Colossus to calculate the positions of the 12 wheels of the Lorenz code machine in hours rather than weeks.</p>\n<p>The Lorenz SZ42 encryption machine is extremely rare. Only 200 were built during the war and just four known examples survive. Lorenz teleprinters, on the other hand, were standard production, with a large number of commercial models manufactured. The military-issue teleprinter is much more rare than the commercial models. Bletchley staff first thought it was a standard commercial teleprinter. They only realized it was the rarer military issue, complete with its wartime serial number, swastika accents and a special key for the insignia of the Waffen-SS, when they brought it back to the museum for cleaning and conservation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42438\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lorenz-motor.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Lorenz motor.

That\u2019s not unusual because the Baltic is a) really cold, and b) so saline that shipworm (and other assorted wood-eating critters), which can devour a wooden wreck in a matter of months, find it distinctly inhospitable. There are at least 100 intact ships on the Baltic Sea bed around Stockholm. \n What is unusual about the two that have just been discovered is their age. One is a medieval cog believed to date to the 14th or early 15th century. The other is from the 16th century. Most of the ships that sank in Stockholm\u2019s waters date to the 17th and 18th centuries when Sweden\u2019s naval fleet was in its fullest fulgor. \n Swedish National Maritime Museums (SNMM) divers found the wrecks just before Christmas while photographing and surveying the seabed for a new museum dedicated to the maritime archaeology of the Baltic Sea. \n The wreckage from the Middle Ages is mostly submerged in mud and its details indicate that it is a cog, most likely from the 14th or 15th century. The ship is 23\u201325 meters in length and seven meters wide. It is likely to have had a mast with a square rig. More shipbuilding details indicate it being from the Middle Ages, such as protruding deck beams with unusually high knees and a simple anchor wheel. When cog ships were introduced on the seas they were a brand new, large and powerful type of ship that came to dominate large parts of the trade around the Baltic Sea for centuries.\nThe other shipwreck is estimated to be from the 16th century and still stands with the mast straight up and fully equipped. Some of the discoveries onboard include 20 barrels of osmond iron, kitchen utensils and tools. The extent of the iron found is unprecedented in previous maritime findings. Osmond iron has largely built Sweden, but also supported countries around the Baltic Sea. Gustav Vasa wanted to ban the iron, and this happened later in 1604 when osmond iron was replaced with wrought iron. \n The SNMM is working on a ground-breaking new approach to shipwreck archaeology and display: leaving them where they are. Instead of investing in the risky, time-consuming and prohibitively expensive recovery of shipwrecks as was done with the incomparable Vasa, known wrecks and ones still to be discovered will stay on the Baltic Sea floor where they will be explored by marine archaeologists. The new maritime archaeological museum, to be built next to the Vasa\u2018s museum home in Stockholm, will display artifacts and fragments of wrecks recovered in the dives rather than the ships themselves. Visitors will still get a chance to see them, not in person after decades of conservation and restoration (always precarious), but as if they had been part of the diving team. The wonders of computer graphics and virtual reality technology make it possible to experience marine archaeological remains in their original context, in virtual situ, if you will.  \n The Treasures of the Baltic Sea museum is scheduled to open in 2020. \n   \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html

The ship is 23\u201325 meters in length and seven meters wide. It is likely to have had a mast with a square rig. More shipbuilding details indicate it being from the Middle Ages, such as protruding deck beams with unusually high knees and a simple anchor wheel.

Gustav Vasa wanted to ban the iron, and this happened later in 1604 when osmond iron was replaced with wrought iron.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The SNMM is working on a ground-breaking new approach to shipwreck archaeology and display: leaving them where they are. Instead of investing in the risky, time-consuming and prohibitively expensive recovery of shipwrecks as was done with the incomparable <em>Vasa</em>, known wrecks and ones still to be discovered will stay on the Baltic Sea floor where they will be explored by marine archaeologists. The new maritime archaeological museum, to be built next to the <em>Vasa</em>\u2018s museum home in Stockholm, will display artifacts and fragments of wrecks recovered in the dives rather than the ships themselves. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50431\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-768x543.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-430x304.jpg 430w\" title=\"Model of an exhibition giving visitors a chance to dive the Baltic Sea wrecks virtually.

There is no immediate evidence of them being related to each other or affiliated in any other way, but there is likely a ritual significance to their deaths because their remains were carefully arranged, the arms of one placed under the spine of the other in a sort of windmill pattern that is particularly pronounced in the center. They\u2019re not in the same positions, however. Some are on their sides, others on their back or with their knees pulled up to their chest or their lower limbs hyperextended towards the hips. Their intricate placement is how the team knew they were buried together in a single event.</p>\n<p>The area was first settled around 1200-1000 BC as a small farming community. It was one of the first settlements south of modern-day Mexico City. The civic center that developed is known as Cuicuilco and the archaeological site contains the remains of a conical pyramid on oval base, built around 800\u2013600 B.C., likely modeled after one of several active volcanoes in the Valley of Mexico. The attempt to appease the local Pele was successful for centuries. Until it wasn\u2019t. Cuicuilco was obliterated in the eruption of the Xitle volcano around 100-200 A.D. Subsequent eruptions buried the city and the valley in lava. </p>\n<p>The village of Tlalpan was settled just east of Cuicuilco between the Zacatenco phases (700-400 B.C.) and Ticoman (400-200 B.C.) of the Middle and Late Formative period. It had come to some prominence, apparently, until the eruption depopulation the valley. There may have been a brief Post-Classic period resettlement (archaeologists are still debating this point) but by then the area was dominated by the nearby urban center of Teotihuacan which didn\u2019t exist yet as a single community when Xitle destroyed Cuicuilco.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Basalt-walls-of-homejpg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50411\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Basalt-walls-of-homejpg-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Basalt-walls-of-homejpg-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Basalt-walls-of-homejpg-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Basalt-walls-of-homejpg-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Basalt-walls-of-homejpg-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Basalt-walls-of-homejpg.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Basalt walls of a Pre-Classic home.

It was discovered just before Christmas by a team from the Norwegian Institute of Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) who were excavating the Anders Madsens gate area of T\u00f8nsberg. </p>\n<p>The cylindrical piece is 30 mm high (1.2 inches) and 26 mm in diameter (1 inch). There\u2019s a wedge jutting out from the top front and it as well as the rest of the body are decorated all over with circles with dots inside. It was carved out of antler and archaeologists believe the maker inserted a piece of lead in the middle of the cylinder to ensure it would hold firm on the chessboard.</p>\n<p>Its unusual design suggests it was at least inspired by Arabic art, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was manufactured by Islamic artists or in an Islamic country.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe design of the piece has an abstract shape, and is designed according to Islamic tradition, where no human figures are to be depicted,\u201d says project manager for the excavation in NIKU Lars Haugesten. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cNo previous archaeological finds from T\u00f8nsberg have such details, which emphasizes that this chess piece is a unique object,\u201d says Haugesten.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Researchers determined that the this piece is a knight. The piece was called an \u201casb,\u201d meaning horse in Persian in the early form of chess that spread throughout Europe after the Islamic conquest that ended the Sasanian Persian Empire in the 7th century. The game under its Arabic name, <em>shatranj</em>, was brought to Europe via Islamic Spain in the 10th century and from there spread to the far reaches of the continent over the next couple of centuries.</p>\n<p>The oldest known chess piece in Scandinavia was found in Lund, Sweden, and dates to the 12th century. It too is of Arabic design and is not dissimilar to the one recently unearthed at T\u00f8nsberg. Similar pieces have been found in Bergen, Norway, as well, where more than a thousand game pieces have been discovered in multiple excavations. The Arabic-influenced abstract knight design is very rare. There are only six examples of them among the Bergen pieces, and they have different dimensions and decorative motifs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Excavation-area-in-Anders-Madsens-gate-T\u00f8nsberg-T\u00f8nsberg.-Photo-by-Thomas-Wrigglesworth-NIKU..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50401\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Excavation-area-in-Anders-Madsens-gate-T\u00f8nsberg-T\u00f8nsberg.-Photo-by-Thomas-Wrigglesworth-NIKU.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Excavation-area-in-Anders-Madsens-gate-T\u00f8nsberg-T\u00f8nsberg.-Photo-by-Thomas-Wrigglesworth-NIKU.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Excavation-area-in-Anders-Madsens-gate-T\u00f8nsberg-T\u00f8nsberg.-Photo-by-Thomas-Wrigglesworth-NIKU.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Excavation-area-in-Anders-Madsens-gate-T\u00f8nsberg-T\u00f8nsberg.-Photo-by-Thomas-Wrigglesworth-NIKU.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Excavation-area-in-Anders-Madsens-gate-T\u00f8nsberg-T\u00f8nsberg.-Photo-by-Thomas-Wrigglesworth-NIKU.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Excavation area in Anders Madsens gate, T\u00f8nsberg T\u00f8nsberg.

Artifacts found include a panoply of daily use objects like combs, pottery and antlers. The excavation has been the subject of much interest because T\u00f8nsberg is the oldest city in Norway, its founding traditionally dated to 871 A.D. based on the account of 13th century chronicler Snorri Sturluson, and the dig site is located in a key position near Slottsfjell Castle, the royal estate and  St. Laurence Church, now no longer standing.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Rare Arabic-inspired chess piece found in Norway\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50399\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50399#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-50374\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50374\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to World War I propaganda at the Bruce Museum\">World War I propaganda at the Bruce Museum</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, January 28th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>After the digitization of the World War I memorabilia, we went to the room next door where the Bruce Museum had its small but impeccable collection of World War I propaganda posters on display.

They were arranged in thematically-related groups, which illustrated how many angles artists used to approach the same subjects.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most compelling grouping from my perspective were the violent, disturbing ones that demonized the enemy as blood-thirsty barbarians. Some are a shock to the system, and would have doubtless been even more so in 1917-1918.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remember-Belgium.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-50382\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remember-Belgium-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remember-Belgium-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remember-Belgium-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remember-Belgium-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remember-Belgium-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Remember Belgium.\" width=\"113\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remeber-Belgium-info.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50383\" height=\"144\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remeber-Belgium-info-200x144.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remeber-Belgium-info-200x144.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remeber-Belgium-info-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remeber-Belgium-info-768x552.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Remeber-Belgium-info-430x309.jpg 430w\" title=\"Remember Belgium info\" width=\"200\"/></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blot-it-out.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-50380\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 105px) 100vw, 105px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blot-it-out-105x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blot-it-out-105x150.jpg 105w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blot-it-out-200x285.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blot-it-out-768x1095.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blot-it-out-430x613.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blot it out\" width=\"105\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blot-it-out-info.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50381\" height=\"102\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blot-it-out-info-200x102.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blot-it-out-info-200x102.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blot-it-out-info-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blot-it-out-info-768x391.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blot-it-out-info-430x219.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blot it out info\" width=\"200\"/></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-50378\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-200x262.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-768x1005.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-430x562.jpg 430w\" title=\"Keep These Off the USA\" width=\"115\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-info-e1517208107208.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50379\" height=\"109\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-info-e1517208107208-200x109.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-info-e1517208107208-200x109.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-info-e1517208107208-150x82.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-info-e1517208107208-768x418.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Keep-These-Off-the-USA-info-e1517208107208-430x234.jpg 430w\" title=\"Keep These Off the USA info\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Another group of posters was dedicated to the mobilization of women as Red Cross volunteers, nurses and in the ubiquitous sale of bonds, stamps and other products devised to help finance the war.

There were some artifacts and two multimedia stations playing propaganda films on a loop. The first was an extraordinary piece of artwork by cartoonist and animation pioneer Winsor McCay. His most famous animated movie, <em>Gertie the Dinosaur</em>, released in 1914, was the first moving picture to have a dinosaur in it and while it wasn\u2019t the first animated feature ever made, it stands out for its artistry and theme and has been studied and copied extensively. </p>\n<p>In 1918, McCay created a masterpiece of animated innovation by way of propaganda: <em>The Sinking of the Lusitania</em>, as 12-minute animated recreation of the torpedoing of the RMS <em>Lusitania</em>. The tragedy was not filmed or photographed, so McCay relied on detailed descriptions from the Hearst Corporation\u2019s Berlin correspondent August F. Beach to create his short film. It took him just shy of two years to finish the incredibly huge amount of drawing required to make this serious, dramatic subject come alive for 12 minutes. It was the longest animated feature ever made up until that point. The picture was not a box office hit, but it did fulfill its political purpose of making the sinking of the Lusitania a rallying cry for Americans, 123 of whose countrymen died on that ship.</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ugk348jStc?rel=0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The second film is lighter fare, starring a characteristically sweet, insouciant Mary Pickford learning how to rein in her profligacy so she can \u201cdo her bit\u201d and buy a Liberty Bond.

We sat for a few minutes waiting for a specialist to become available, enjoying a variety of quality cookies and coffee. The wait was minimal. I don\u2019t think I got 3 sips down before our digitization pro was ready for us.</p>\n<p>A veteran himself, he was very interested in the medals from France and the Red Cross that the formidable ladies had been awarded in 1919. He asked my relative everything she knew about them and she filled in all the information she could while we looked up the online census data for details like date of birth and death. He was particularly fascinated with the certificate that accompanied one of the awarded medals. It was in Cyrillic letters, but a variant, not the standard ones you see today. </p>\n<p>The certificate was cracked and torn and in very delicate condition, taped to white poster paper in a most precarious way.

Moving the 3,200-year-old statue 1,200 feet from the warehouse to the shiny new museum was a logistical challenge because of its massive weight and its towering 30 feet of height. The solid granite monument required the construction of a custom rig to make the move possible while minimizing risk of damage. It was locked into a metal cage on two trailer beds and then slowly, slowly driven to its final destination accompanied by a phalanx of army engineers and contractors. The total cost for the move was an estimated $770,000.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Rameses-on-the-move.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ramses on the move in custom rig.

In the era of radio and film\u2019s infancy, posters were an essential medium; there were more than 20 million posters printed from about 2,500 designs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3_-Are-You.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-50325\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3_-Are-You-101x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3_-Are-You-101x150.jpg 101w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3_-Are-You-200x298.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3_-Are-You-768x1146.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3_-Are-You-430x641.jpg 430w\" title=\"Are You 100% American? 1917 Sackett &amp; Wilhelms Lithographing &amp; Printing Company.

The medals are somewhat obscure and one of the diplomas that came with them has survived. After all these years blogging about digitization projects and crowdsourced data and archive collections, finally I get to see it happen live, and to help a family member find out all she can about these fascinating pieces to boot.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6_Christy_Fight-or-Buy.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50328\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6_Christy_Fight-or-Buy-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6_Christy_Fight-or-Buy-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6_Christy_Fight-or-Buy-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6_Christy_Fight-or-Buy-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6_Christy_Fight-or-Buy-430x574.jpg 430w\" title=\"Howard Chandler Christy (American, 1873-1952) Fight or Buy Bonds, 1917 Lithograph, 40 1/2 x 30 in.

Fraser, Chief of Clan Fraser, was known as a wily wheeler-dealer, hence his nickname \u201cThe Old Fox.\u201d He tried to play both sides throughout the conflicts of the 18th century and while he was nominally on the Jacobite side during the 1745 uprising, he told the English he wasn\u2019t just to keep his options open (i.e., cover his ass in case it all went to hell in a handbasket, as it did). His clan was on the front lines at the Battle of Culloden on April 16th, 1746, bearing the brunt of the Hanoverian assault. Lord Lovat himself was not among them. He was 80 years old, morbidly obese and afflicted with, among other ailments, gout and arthritis, so he wasn\u2019t exactly fighting fit, but he was also playing the odds. He told the English that his son Simon had fought with the Jacobites against his wishes. </p>\n<p>He was still trying to hide behind that dodge after the Battle of Culloden ended in disaster for the pro-Stuart Highlanders. It didn\u2019t work then either. The Old Fox was captured a few months later and taken to the Tower of London. In March of 1747, he was put on trial for treason. The outcome was unsurprising: he was convicted and sentenced to decapitation. On April 9th, 1747, he was led to the gallows, laughed when he saw nine people killed when one of the wooden bleachers collapsed, quoted Horace\u2019s Odes and took leave of his head.</p>\n<p>The story takes a bit of a turn after that. Although the chief had asked that his body be returned to his family cemetery and the authorities had agreed, they thought better of it after the beheading. Figuring his remains and tomb would become a focal point for Jacobite Scots to plot rebellion, they buried the body of Simon Fraser under the Tower chapel floor. There was a gap, though, a full nine days between his execution and his burial to allow for viewing of the body. According to Clan Fraser lore, his body was purloined during those nine days and smuggled back to Scotland where it was secretly buried at Wardlaw Mausoleum, the Fraser family cemetery in Kirkhill, near Inverness. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Lead-coffins-in-Fraser-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50318\" height=\"134\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Lead-coffins-in-Fraser-tomb-200x134.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Lead-coffins-in-Fraser-tomb-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Lead-coffins-in-Fraser-tomb-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Lead-coffins-in-Fraser-tomb-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Lead-coffins-in-Fraser-tomb-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Lead-coffins-in-Fraser-tomb.jpg 1573w\" title=\"Lead coffins in Fraser tomb. Photo courtesy The Royal Society of Edinburgh.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The contradictory stories came to the forefront again in the 19th century when the coffins under the Tower chapel were disinterred and one of them had Lord Lovat\u2019s name on it. More recently, however, there was a stirring on the other side of the Force when <a href=\"https://www.rse.org.uk/debate-resting-place-old-fox/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a headless body was discovered in an expensive double lead casket at the cemetery</a>. Could the tales be true? Were these The Old Fox\u2019s remains, snatched out from under England\u2019s very nose?</p>\n<p>Science\u2019s representative in this matter was forensic anthropologist Professor Dame Sue Black who was engaged to study the remains thoroughly, from osteological analysis to DNA testing, to answer conclusively whether this headless body was THE headless body of the 11th Lord Lovat. The answer is no. The remains are of a young woman in her late 20s or early 30s at the time of her death.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Professor Black, Director of the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification at the University of Dundee, said: \u201cWe can say with absolute certainty that these are not the remains of The Old Fox.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe remains were in poor condition, very wet, in common with remains that have been a long time in a wooden or lead coffin, so in line with what we expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe area of the body most indicative of whether remains are male or female is the shape of the pelvis, and two areas of the pelvis in particular. In both areas, these remains are very feminine. There is no way that these were the remains of an 80-year-old six-foot man who suffered from gout and arthritis.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe estimate these are the remains of a young woman, probably aged 25\u201335. We understand that there are some possibilities that she might be a member of the Fraser family, and further DNA testing is being carried out.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>Professor Black added: \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know what happened to the head, but it may be that it has been taken as a trophy many years ago. The DNA testing should confirm whether the remains are those of a member of the Fraser family, in which case the casket may well have simply been put to use. But if the remains are not a member of the family, then we are faced with more of a poser as to how she came to be buried in the casket.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mystery lady, not Fraser chief, buried in clan\u2019s tomb\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50291\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50291#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-50312\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50312\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Vesuvius\u2019 lesser known victims in 3D\">Vesuvius\u2019 lesser known victims in 3D</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, January 23rd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Vesuvius took thousands of lives when it erupted on August 24th, 79 A.D., burying entire cities in layers of pumice, ash and mud. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum are the most famous of its victims, thanks to the extraordinary state of preservation in which they were found and the profound emotional impact of the plaster casts made from body cavities developed in the 19th century by pioneer archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli. Now the smaller, lesser known site of Oplontis is getting some high-tech attention.</p>\n<p>Oplontis isn\u2019t a city. It\u2019s a multi-use villa complex composed of Villa A, a large luxury estate believed to have belonged to Poppaea, Nero\u2019s second wife, and Oplontis B, an industrial structure that housed an active wine import-export concern. Villa A was, thankfully, not inhabited at the time of the eruption. The wine business, on the other hand, was hopping. Archaeologists have unearthed the skeletal remains of more than 50 people from a single room of Oplontis B. Thus far, they are the only human remains found at the site.</p>\n<p>The Faces of Oplontis research project has taken a new approach to some of the unanalyzed skeletons from Oplontis B. Starting last summer, a team of archaeologists finished excavating the skeletons in Room 10 that hadn\u2019t been fully unearthed yet and examined the remains in situ using photogrammetry (a technology that deploys high resolution photography to calculate measurements and proportions). Complete skulls were 3D scanned. All of the remains were osteologically analyzed and will be subject to mitochondrial DNA testing, stable isotope, trace element, parasitological and pathogen DNA analysis. The comprehensive study will shed light on working class Romans, their diets, health, geographical origins and, one hopes, cause of death.</p>\n<p>Photogrammetry was also used before the excavation to record Room 10, making it a possible to create 3D model that shows were the people died (all the skeletons except for two which have been cast and moved to the front are still in their original locations at the time of death). The model gives researchers the ability to navigate the site without disturbing the remains, figuring out the stratigraphic data, which ones of them died first, by what means and how their bodies may have shifted. It\u2019s of particular importance in Oplontis because it\u2019s not clear what kind of volcanic fallout the site experience. Pompeii got the pumice rain. Herculaneum got the superheated mud. What took out Oplontis, which is very close to Pompeii, remains in question. The new research may help answer this once and for all.</p>\n<p>Faces of Oplontis has created <a href=\"https://facesofoplontis.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a dedicated website</a> and have made <a href=\"https://facesofoplontis.com/3dscans/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">their 3D models</a> available to the Internet-going public. They are annotated to highlight and explain the main points of interest. I recommend clicking on the notes, especially for the skulls, because they contain a lot of information we civilians would not recognize from just looking.</p>\n<p>Here is Room 10, the skeletons in situ before excavation:</p>\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" allowvr=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"323\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/e173b98af5af4f6fb8d5544f46ef63c6/embed?camera=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px;

In the winter of 2016/2017, a site on the corner of Highcross Street and Vaughan Way was slated for development, so the ULAS team was engaged by to survey it before construction of new apartment blocks began to perform any necessary salvage of archaeological remains. When they found the remains of a Roman house with a big fragment of a late 3rd or early 4th century A.D. mosaic surviving, they realized they\u2019d have to remove it to save it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/007-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-50301\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/007-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/007-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/007-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/007-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/007-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of mosaic floor.

At two by three meters (6.6 x 9.8 feet) in size, it is impressively large even though it\u2019s just a fragment of the original floor which would have been three times larger and covered the entire square room. The tesserae are small cubes of stone and brick arranged in a square of grey tiles surrounded by border of red. With the central square are red accents, among them a floral motif, leaves and a Swastika meander border.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s handsome, but it\u2019s not a glamorous floor like one of Leicester\u2019s best known Roman remains, the Blackfriars Mosaic which is one the largest and most elaborate mosaic floors ever discovered in Britain.

This made the job of lifting the mosaic a difficult one for the ULAS archaeologists. Archaeological conservator Theo Sturge, who was part of the team who lifted the Blackfriars Mosaic in the 1970s, contributed his extensive expertise to the challenging logistics of lifting a large, barely held-together mosaic in snowy, rainy, cold winter weather.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-50305\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_4-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_4-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_4-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_4-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_4-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"The team of conservators and archaeologists apply Hessian to the surface of the mosaic. Photo courtesy the University of Leicester Archaeological Services.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Thousands of tesserae had to be lifted in such a way to ensure none of them would be displaced and the pattern disrupted. To make this happen, especially in the atrocious weather conditions, ULAS had to glue Hessian fabric to the surface of the mosaic. Whatever remained of the mortar grout between the tesserae and the mortar base onto which the tiles had been set were cut away and thin boards placed underneath sections of the mosaic. The boards were then lifted and the mosaic was moved, section by section, to Theo Sturges\u2019 laboratory for conservation.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50303\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_5-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_5-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_5-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_5-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/highcross-mosaic_5-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"ULAS team carefully prepare to lift the mosaic. Photo courtesy the University of Leicester Archaeological Services.\" width=\"150\"/></a>[ULAS Project Officer] Mathew Morris added: \u201cThe finished mosaic looks fantastic, Theo has done an amazing job putting it back together. In some ways it\u2019s quite unusual to go to this level of effort and cost to conserve a mosaic of this quality, but actually because of its poorer quality you can see the craftsmanship behind it. You can see the direction the Roman workers were laying the stones in, you can see at one point one of the lines started to bend off and so they\u2019ve had to turn one line into three to create a straight edge again. It\u2019s these little human touches and errors that you can see in it that are important because they give you those glimpses into how it was made, who made it and their attitude to work, that gives you that real insight into the people of Roman Leicester.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/011-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-50302\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/011-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/011-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/011-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/011-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/011-Lifting-and-Conserving-a-Roman-Mosaic-Carl-Vivian-University-of-Leicester-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of tesserae.

The ship is 23\u201325 meters in length and seven meters wide. It is likely to have had a mast with a square rig. More shipbuilding details indicate it being from the Middle Ages, such as protruding deck beams with unusually high knees and a simple anchor wheel. When cog ships were introduced on the seas they were a brand new, large and powerful type of ship that came to dominate large parts of the trade around the Baltic Sea for centuries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/J\u00e4rnlastvrak_Tunnor-med-osmundj\u00e4rn-och-tj\u00e4ra_Foto_Jim-Hansson_SMM.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50425\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/J\u00e4rnlastvrak_Tunnor-med-osmundj\u00e4rn-och-tj\u00e4ra_Foto_Jim-Hansson_SMM-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/J\u00e4rnlastvrak_Tunnor-med-osmundj\u00e4rn-och-tj\u00e4ra_Foto_Jim-Hansson_SMM-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/J\u00e4rnlastvrak_Tunnor-med-osmundj\u00e4rn-och-tj\u00e4ra_Foto_Jim-Hansson_SMM-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/J\u00e4rnlastvrak_Tunnor-med-osmundj\u00e4rn-och-tj\u00e4ra_Foto_Jim-Hansson_SMM-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/J\u00e4rnlastvrak_Tunnor-med-osmundj\u00e4rn-och-tj\u00e4ra_Foto_Jim-Hansson_SMM-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Barrels containing osmond iron and tar.

Gustav Vasa wanted to ban the iron, and this happened later in 1604 when osmond iron was replaced with wrought iron.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The SNMM is working on a ground-breaking new approach to shipwreck archaeology and display: leaving them where they are. Instead of investing in the risky, time-consuming and prohibitively expensive recovery of shipwrecks as was done with the incomparable <em>Vasa</em>, known wrecks and ones still to be discovered will stay on the Baltic Sea floor where they will be explored by marine archaeologists. The new maritime archaeological museum, to be built next to the <em>Vasa</em>\u2018s museum home in Stockholm, will display artifacts and fragments of wrecks recovered in the dives rather than the ships themselves. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50431\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-768x543.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/\u00d6stersj\u00f6ns_skatter_utst\u00e4llning_havsbotten-430x304.jpg 430w\" title=\"Model of an exhibition giving visitors a chance to dive the Baltic Sea wrecks virtually.

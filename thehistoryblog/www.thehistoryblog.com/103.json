The tool, two prickly pear cactus spines inserted into the soft middle of a lemonade sumac stem and bound with yucca leaf strips, was excavated in 1972 from a midden at the Turkey Pen site in the Greater Bears Ears Landscape of southeastern Utah. One of the points of the spines was broken off, which is probably why it was discarded into the midden pile. Coprolites and corn cobbs in the midden layer that included the artifact were radiocarbon dated to a range of 79-130 A.D. during the Basketmaker II period (ca. 500\u202fB.C. \u2013 500\u202fA.D.). \n There are historical accounts of tattooing practices in Native American peoples of the southwest after the arrival of Europeans, but colonial authorities generally considered it a barbarous cultural expression and suppressed it actively. It was poorly documented and traditional tattooing was frequently prohibited. It largely died out in North America after European contact. \n Evidence of indigenous tattooing before that is very slim. No tattoos have been found on pre-contact mummified human remains and there are no ancient written accounts of the practice. Rare surviving tattoo tools and depictions in ancient iconography are all scholars have had to go on when studying body modification and adornment in southwestern Native American cultures before they were disrupted by European colonization, and it\u2019s unclear whether the artworks depict tattoos, body paint or scarification. \n The device was discovered by WSU anthropology PhD candidate Andrew Gillreath-Brown during an inventory of the Turkey Pen material. Cactus spine tattoo tools have been found before at Native American sites in Arizona and New Mexico, but the oldest of them date to between 1100-1280 A.D. This device looked like ones found elsewhere in the southwest only it was used a thousand years before them. \n The tool consists of a 3 \u00bd inch wooden skunkbush sumac handle bound at the end with split yucca leaves and holding two parallel cactus spines, stained black at their tips.\n\u201cThe residue staining from tattoo pigments on the tip was what immediately piqued my interest as being possibly a tattoo tool,\u201d Gillreath-Brown said.\nEncouraged by Aaron Deter-Wolf, a friend and co-author of the study who has done studies on ancient tattooing and edited several books on the subject, Gillreath-Brown analyzed the tips with a scanning electron microscope, X-ray florescence and energy dispersive ray spectroscopy. For good measure, he did several test tattoos using a replica on pig skin.\nHe saw the crystalline structure of pigment and determined it likely contained carbon, a common element in body painting and tattooing.\nThe find, said Gillreath-Brown, \u201chas a great significance for understanding how people managed relationships and how status may have been marked on people in the past during a time when population densities were increasing in the Southwest.\u201d \n The study has been published in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports and can be read in its entirety for free online. \n

For good measure, he did several test tattoos using a replica on pig skin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54447\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ink staining the tips of the cactus spines.

The rough hewn oak plank was preserved for centuries in the waterlogged environment of the Fleet River, one of the tributaries of the Thames that were \u201clost\u201d to the development of the London sewage system in the Victorian era. It was unearthed in excavations near Ludgate Hill in the 1980s but the discovery wasn\u2019t announced before because the money ran out before the thousands of artifacts from what was then the largest archaeological dig in London history could be published. (Besides, even experts didn\u2019t appreciate scatological archaeology three decades ago as much as we do now.)</p>\n<p>The communal toilet seat was once perched over a cesspit that emptied into the Fleet. It served the needs of people who lived and worked in on what was then a small island. Archaeologists even know its name, amazingly enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54419\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ax-marks-det-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Axe marks visible near the openings.

We don\u2019t have many of these in existence at all.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The toilet seat will be part of an exhibition <a href=\"https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london-docklands/whats-on/exhibitions/secret-rivers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated to London\u2019s lost rivers</a>: Effra, Fleet, Neckinger, Lea, Wandle, Tyburn, Walbrook and Westbourne. Remains preserved in the loving embrace of the city\u2019s rivers will go on display alongside the seat exemplifying how said rivers were used by Londoners as open sewers before they were diverted into culverts to be used as closed ones today. Bronze Age weapons deposited in the Thames as ritual offerings, a dog collar, animal skulls, discarded porcelain will represent the archaeology of the rivers while photographs, paintings, poems and film represent its history. <em>Secret Rivers</em> runs from May 24th through October 27th. Admittance is free, and just in case seeing the toilet seat isn\u2019t worth the ticket price, a plastic replica will be available for visitors to perch upon. That\u2019s a group selfie opportunity not to be missed.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54421\" height=\"285\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-430x285.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/James-Lawson-Stewart-watercolor-768x509.jpg 768w\" title=\"Watercolor of Jacob's Island, slum on the River Neckinger, by James Lawson Stewart, 1887.

The bones are being placed in paper boxes one at a time and removed to a conservation laboratory where each bone will be surface cleaned, soaked in a weak lime solution and dried. They won\u2019t be scoured or even cleaned as thoroughly as restorers cleaned the hanging elements like the chandelier and the Schwarzenberg coat of arms</p>\n<p>The biggest concern is that over time the pyramids have suffered damage at the base. The deformation of the lower layers poses a danger to the entire structure and the deconstruction will hopefully help identify the root cause of the problem. It could largely be a matter of weight, the towers being too massive for the bones on the bottom to bear. Endemic mold and moisture also play a part. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54406\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Look-through-the-window.jpg 1600w\" title=\"View of mound during dismantling through window in the dust barrier.

What material will be used is undetermined at this juncture. Bones from a neighboring church with a small ossuary could be borrowed, or copies could be made out of mineral materials.</p>\n<p>In order to rebuild the pyramids so they look exactly the same as they used to, experts will have to replace and shore up damaged parts in ways that do not alter the original design. The firm Nase Historie has been engaged to scan the bone towers using photogrammetry, thousands of high-resolution images mapped and stitched together to create an extremely accurate 3D model. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54401\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dust-barrier.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Filming through windows in the dust barrier.

Nobody really knows what\u2019s in these pyramids, the real number of bones, whether there is any debris or osseous material shoring up the intact bones. Being able to count precisely how many bones were used to create these towers is another unique opportunity afforded by the restoration project.</p>\n<p>As restorers work on the towers, visitors continue to be allowed access to the chapel. A dust-proof barrier separates the pyramids and chapel, but there are windows in it to give people a chance to see the reconstruction.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Restorative deboning at iconic Czech bone chapel\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54399\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54399#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54391\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54391\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rare Brazilian feathered cloak restored, exhibited\">Rare Brazilian feathered cloak restored, exhibited</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, February 24th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/recto-dopo-APRILE-2018.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54394\" height=\"234\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/recto-dopo-APRILE-2018-200x234.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/recto-dopo-APRILE-2018-200x234.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/recto-dopo-APRILE-2018-128x150.jpg 128w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/recto-dopo-APRILE-2018-768x900.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/recto-dopo-APRILE-2018-430x504.jpg 430w\" title=\"Restored feathered mantle.

Triangular in shape and complete with a small hood that originally was decorated with yellow macaw feathers (now almost entirely lost), it was made by tying feathers to a net woven of cotton. Most of the feathers are bright orange-red plumes from the scarlet ibis. Yellow and blue accents were created with macaw feathers. The materials, cotton and feathers, are so delicate very few feathers cloaks have survived until our time. This is the only one known to have a distinctive geometric pattern on the back, believed to be a stylized line representation of a bird.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manfredo-Settala-7757666.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54395\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manfredo-Settala-7757666-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manfredo-Settala-7757666-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manfredo-Settala-7757666-200x277.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manfredo-Settala-7757666-768x1065.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manfredo-Settala-7757666-430x597.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Manfredo-Settala-7757666.jpg 1211w\" title=\"Portrait of Manfredo Settala, attributed to Daniele Crispi. Austrian National Library.\" width=\"108\"/></a>The Ambrosiana has held the mantle in its collection for almost its entire life. It was donated by Milanese cleric and collector Manfredo Settala (1600-1680). He was one of the greatest collectors in 17th century Europe, going far beyond the cabinet of curiosities popular among the aristocracy of the period into a full-on museum replete with art, ancient pottery, China, sculpture, exotic animals, fossils, shells, clocks, optical devices, corals, gemstones, minerals, jewelry, foodstuffs (nuts, beans, spices, cacao) skeletons, mummies and just about anything else you can imagine. His collection was so vast that the Bibliteca Ambrosiana was unable to accommodate Settala\u2019s offer to donate it in its entirety because they didn\u2019t have the space. </p>\n<p>In a 1666 catalogue of the Settala Gallery, there was a whole chapter dedicated to \u201cPilgrim Curiosities of Indian Bird Feathers Ingeniously Woven.\u201d The artifacts in this category include several Christian icons made of colored feathers in \u201cPeru\u201d (which may be more of a catch-all term for Spanish America rather than a specific origin), a belt and crown, a sash of Chilean ostrich feathers, another of \u201cIndian crow\u201d feathers \u201cthe color of fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mantle is described as an \u201cIndian priestly vestment of sanguine color, a fiery weaving of many feathers naturally colored. A very remarkable work and worthy of being admired.\u201d Settala had received it as a gift from Prince Federico Landi, scion of a noble family in northern Italy whose princely title had been granted by the Holy Roman Emperor. Landi was a political figure of some importance \u2014 he had ties to Philip III of Spain, Duke of Milan \u2014 and he and Settala shared an interest in collecting natural (and manufactured) wonders. His connection to the King of Spain likely provided him access to exceptional artifacts from Spain\u2019s colonies. The feathered belt and crown in the Settala Gallery were donated by Prince Landi after Manfredo\u2019s death in his memory. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not labelled so I don\u2019t know for sure, but I believe the mantle, its hood still richly feathered, is hanging on the front right wall in this drawing of the Settala Gallery from the 1666 catalogue:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galleria-Settala-1666.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54393\" height=\"196\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galleria-Settala-1666-430x196.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galleria-Settala-1666-430x196.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galleria-Settala-1666-150x68.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galleria-Settala-1666-200x91.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Galleria-Settala-1666-768x350.jpg 768w\" title='Galleria Settala 1666, drawing in \"Museo, o\u0300 Galeria, adunata dal sapere e dallo studio del sig. canonico Manfredo Settala nobile milanese,\" by Paolo Terzago.' width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Settala\u2019s own records identify the \u201cceremonial mantle\u201d as having been created by the Tupinamb\u00e1 people of Brazil. They record that it was a gift from Prince Landi and note that the the Tupinamb\u00e1 wore these garments during a ceremony depicted in a drawing by Belgian engraver Theodor de Bry in the late 16th century. (De Bry\u2019s works were based on the writings of other people; he never traveled across the Atlantic himself, and there are numerous errors, inconsistencies and scenes more dramatic than factual in his oeuvre.)</p>\n<p>Early European accounts of encounters with the Tupinamb\u00e1 published in the second half of the 16th century describe multiple uses of feathers in adornment: boiled chicken feathers used in tattooing, Toucan feathers worn as ear pendants and ostrich feathers strung on cotton thread worn as hip belts.</p>\n<p>These accounts often remarked on the Tupinamb\u00e1 people\u2019s reluctance (read: refusal) to wear clothing no matter how hard the colonizers and converters tried.  The few indigenous garments the population did enjoy were worn for ceremonial purposes and had nothing like the full coverage  the priests were so anxious to instill. Headdresses, cloaks and sashes adorned with the brightly colored feathers of different native birds were highly prized and handled with utmost care to preserve them from wear and tear. </p>\n<p>Researchers hypothesize that mantles like this one may have been used by priests during the most important ceremony to the Tupinamb\u00e1  community: a cannibalistic ritual in which the flesh of sacrificed prisoners of wars was consumed to give warriors access to a paradiasical \u201cWorld without Evil\u201d after death.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Rare Brazilian feathered cloak restored, exhibited\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54391\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54391#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54385\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54385\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The last witch to burn in central Norway\">The last witch to burn in central Norway</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, February 23rd, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>During the European witch panics of the 16th and 17th century, more than 800 people were accused of witchcraft in Norway.

Reproduced with permission of NTNU Library.\" width=\"194\"/></a>Her name was Kirsten Iversdatter. She was a S\u00e1mi woman (the people historically known as Lapplanders) who drifted from town to town in the Gauldalen valley of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, begging for food and threatening people with curses when she was refused. She was commonly known as Finn-Kirsten, a reference to her S\u00e1mi origin. Her ethnicity played a large part in the fear she struck in the hearts of the locals, for the S\u00e1mi were reputed to have connections to the demonic world so powerful that not even the power of Christ could compel.</p>\n<blockquote><p>They could summon the spirits of their ancestors and gods of nature with their magical drums (the so-called \u2018rune-drum\u2019), enabling them to both see the future and divine news from distant places. Their percussive magic could find lost items and influence fortunes in life and business. Historical sources tell us that Norwegian farmers would pay the Sami for such magical services, but that one should be wary of their company. If one incurred the wrath of a Sami, so the Norwegians believed, the Sami could release a <em>gand</em>, an evil spirit and/or a physical object, which had the power to strike a man dead, even to split mountains.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So when Kirsten muttered imprecations or quickly appeared and disappeared in doorways, people got scared. Next thing you know, cows\u2019 milk dried up, crops failed, family members got sick, horses died and Kirsten was blamed for it. </p>\n<p>On February 18th, 1674, Kirsten was arrested  in the village of St\u00f8ren on suspicion of witchcraft. She was charged with harming people and animals in Gauldalen valley. She denied engaging in witchcraft, casting spells or causing any harm. In the absence of a confession, they came up with other charges that were more easily proven. The chaplain and villagers testified that she never went to church, which was a crime in those days. She also had two daughters, one 20, one two years old, neither of which were born in legitimate wedlock. Fornication was a crime too. So Finn-Kirsten was convicted of skipping church and having extra-marital sex and was condemned to die by beheading.</p>\n<p>Her ordeal was far from over. St\u00f8ren\u2019s bailiff Jens Randulf had a reputation for being adept as getting witches to talk. His methods, one can imagine, were as brutal as they were effective. Even after denying the charges in her first trial and even though she was already condemned to death, Jens was so good at torturing her that she confessed to everything and more. She had \u201cgiven herself to the Devil\u201d who appeared to her as a dog. She traveled the mountains around St\u00f8ren with Satan and his other human disciples, local ones this time.</p>\n<p>Now that they had their confession, Kirsten\u2019s previous infractions took a back seat and the witch trial started.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iversdatter_3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54388\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iversdatter_3-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iversdatter_3-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iversdatter_3-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iversdatter_3-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iversdatter_3-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Kongsg\u00e5rden in Trondheim city, today known as the Archbishop\u2019s Palace. Photograph: Nils Kristian Eikeland, NTNU Library.\" width=\"200\"/></a>After this new confession, the case was transferred to Trondheim Court of Appeal. Finn-Kirsten was detained in \u2018Kongsg\u00e5rden\u2019 (the King\u2019s royal palace) in Trondheim city \u2013 today known as the Archbishop\u2019s Palace \u2013 under the custody of the county governor Joachim Vind. After torture and interrogation by Vind and the public officers of St\u00f8ren, she named more than thirty people as accomplices, ranging from both wealthy and poor in Trondheim to prominent farmers in the valley of Gauldalen. Amongst other things, Finn-Kirsten \u2018confessed\u2019 that the son of Inger Rognessen had visited Hell three times; she claimed that another woman called Inger (who lived by the city bridge) had levitated through air with her, and that she knew both white magic and sorcery. Finn-Kirsten also claimed that Inger was eager to become an apprentice of the Devil, but that she refused her the same \u2018honour\u2019 as she had only served Satan for two years. Guri, a carpenter\u2019s wife, was alleged to have been ridden into the mountains to meet the devil twice, but Finn-Kirsten could not say if Guri was the rider or if someone rode her! This was the end for Finn-Kirsten. Her punishment was increased from beheading to death by burning, as the statutes against witchcraft allowed[.]</p></blockquote>\n<p>On October 12, 1674, a great fire was set alight by the city gates of Trondheim. Kirsten was tied to a ladder and tipped into the fire. A large crowd watched her burn to death. As she had confessed to witchcraft, her estate was forfeit. The court records describe this estate as \u201ca few ragged clothes,\u201d a sad testament to a life of poverty ended in brutal fashion.</p>\n<p>Of the people she named under torture as co-witches, three of them were put on trial, including one Gjertrud Berdal who like so many \u201cwitches\u201d was an herbalist who made home remedies for people (and their animals). Her most notable tool of witchcraft was apparently the ability to magically milk the cream of people\u2019s cows so when they milked their cows all they got was skim. Neither Gjertrud nor the other two were convicted.</p>\n<p>Even though it lasted years and marked the conclusion of the witch frenzy in central Norway, the trial of Kirsten Iversdatter and its aftermath was soon forgotten.

The 25 balls filled with gunpowder had slumbered quietly in the stores of  Virginia\u2019s Department of Historic Resources (DHR) for 30 years, or so it seemed. </p>\n<p>The grenades came from the wreck of <em>The Betsy</em>, a British collier built in Whitehaven in 1772 that transported coal during the Revolutionary War. In September of 1781, General Charles Cornwallis ordered it scuttled along with dozens of other British ships along the shore of the York River during the Siege of Yorktown in the attempt to prevent the French fleet controlling Chesapeake Bay from attacking British forces on land. The attempt failed and Corwallis, hemmed in on land by the Continental Army and reinforcements by sea blocked by the French navy, surrendered on October 19th, 1781. It was the last major battle of the American Revolution.</p>\n<p>The French were granted title to all the British ships after the surrender, including the wrecks. They spent the winter of 1781-2 salvaging what they could. Two centuries later, a team of DHR archaeologists investigated the wrecks to see if there were any artifacts left to recover. A cofferdam was built around the <em>Betsy</em>, the water filtered out and a suprising number of objects spotted. Half of the ship\u2019s contents remained in situ. About 5,000 objects were recovered, inventoried and stored in the DHR collection.</p>\n<p>Budget cuts interrupted the arduous process of fully documenting the finds and conservation of maritime archaeological materials wasn\u2019t as sophisticated in 1982 as it is now. The grenades, corroded and caked with concretions, weren\u2019t recognized as grenades. They were about the size of balls for small cannon, so they were temporarily classified as \u201cshot,\u201d bagged, placed in cardboard boxes and shelved until they could be X-rayed. The budget axe dropped before the X-rays could show that they weren\u2019t solid lead balls.</p>\n<p>Last fall, DHR\u2019s conservation lab got a grant from the National Park Service to study and conserve the <em>Betsy</em>\u2018s many artifacts. Their focus was on the organic materials \u2014 leather, rope, wood \u2014 which quickly deteriorate once removed from a waterlogged environment and preservation techniques are vastly improved now. The box with the \u201cshot\u201d wasn\u2019t high priority because metal doesn\u2019t decay, so it was set aside for later examination.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/First-grenade-core.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54383\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/First-grenade-core-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/First-grenade-core-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/First-grenade-core-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/First-grenade-core-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/First-grenade-core-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"The first grenade core found in the Betsy stores.

[\u2026]</p>\n<p>Ridgway figured it could be [live], especially after three decades of drying time. She carried that first strange ball to a microscope. Those were definitely crystals inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not happy,\u201d she told [head conservator Chelsea] Blake, before turning to her computer to search for information about weapons of The Betsy\u2019s era. It dawned on her that this ball could be the core of a grenade, what was left after the iron shell had long dissolved.</p>\n<p>Ridgway crossed the lab to another instrument that identifies chemical elements. Sulfur. And potassium. The ingredients of gunpowder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am really not happy,\u201d Ridgway said. \u201cWe\u2019re done here.

A white plume of smoke wafted up, the tell-tale sign of burning black powder. After two centuries underwater and 240 years since it was deployed, that grenade was still dangerous.</p>\n<p>The bomb squad was called twice more within days as more of the grenades were found. Conservators realized they had to go through all the <em>Betsy</em> stores to deal with their explosive artifacts all at once. It was a huge production.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of December was spent crafting plans and preparing the lab. Guided by the bomb squad and following munitions factory rules, they removed anything that could produce a static spark \u2014 plastic, scraping chairs, squeaky carts. Tables were covered with cotton fabric. Extra humidifiers were brought in. Flammable chemicals were carried away.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, Dec. 29, they came in just after dawn \u2014 Ridgway, Blake, collections assistant Andrew Foster and archaeologist Mike Clem.</p>\n<p>All other employees had been told to stay away. Neighbors across the street had been notified with a letter. Experts from an alphabet soup of agencies \u2014 FBI, ATF, bomb techs from the city, county and state police \u2014 met the four at the lab, parking in a side lot to avoid causing a scene. The fire department and medics stood by.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to endanger anyone else, but we didn\u2019t want to panic them either,\u201d Ridgway said. \u201cWe did whatever law enforcement advised us to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bomb squads provided helmets, vests and thick aprons for the staffers, who had come to work dressed only in cotton clothing and rubber-soled shoes. Each staffer was assigned a personal bomb tech handler.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had 18 people in here,\u201d Ridgway said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have asked for better help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eight hours later, they\u2019d combed through every single box. And found 20 more grenades. One was still wearing its iron jacket. </p></blockquote>\n<p>They were all detonated safely.</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdNXUJ1ofPA\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Grenades from last battle of Revolutionary War detonated\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54360\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54360#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53899\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53899\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Huge Japanese urn \u201clost\u201d for 100 years and found in fish restaurant sells big\">Huge Japanese urn \u201clost\u201d for 100 years and found in fish restaurant sells big</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, February 21st, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53902\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 89px) 100vw, 89px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Front-89x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Front-89x150.jpg 89w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Front-179x300.jpg 179w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Front-768x1288.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Front-430x721.jpg 430w\" title=\"Front of monumental cloisonn\u00e9 enamel vase depicting dragon, Japan, ca. 1893.

Placed in a group under a canopy in the East Court of the Palace of Fine Arts under a canopy were three exceptional pieces, the work of Japan\u2019s greatest masters: two monumental vases and an incense burner. The combined effort of metalworkers, potters, wood carvers and painters, they were designed especially for the Exposition and took four years to make and decorate. Before they were shipped to Chicago, they were viewed and approved by the Emperor and Empress of Japan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53901\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 82px) 100vw, 82px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Back-82x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Back-82x150.jpg 82w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Back-163x300.jpg 163w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Back-768x1411.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cloisonne-Vase-Back-430x790.jpg 430w\" title=\"Back of monumental cloisonn\u00e9 enamel vase depicting flight of plover, Japan, ca. 1893. Photo courtesy Clars Auction Gallery.\" width=\"82\"/></a>The designs on the vases and incense burner were conceived by Shin Shiwoda, Special Counsellor for Arts of the Japanese Commission to the Exposition. The ostensible motif is the seasons of the years: chickens symbolize spring, dragon summer, eagles autumn and winter. A full moon and flight of plover on the back of the dragon vase symbolize summer and fall. The birds under a snow laden branch on the back of the eagle vase represent winter. A cherry tree in blossom on the censer represents spring. The dragon, chickens and eagles also symbolize the three virtues of, respectively, wisdom, honesty and strength.</p>\n<p>The vases and censer were placed on pedestals of carved keyaki, a hardwood native to Japan. These were not created from freshly hewn lumber, but from pieces salvaged from a temple that had been destroyed in an earthquake. The wood was more than 200 years old when it was carved with 70 different types of flowers in 1890-3.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/55_e010.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53905\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/55_e010-101x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/55_e010-101x150.jpg 101w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/55_e010-200x296.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/55_e010-768x1136.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/55_e010-430x636.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/55_e010.jpg 1562w\" title=\"Front of eagle vase, Japan, ca. 1893.

The dragon on one vase represent China. The two eagles on the other vase represent Russia. The chickens are stand-ins for the Korean islands. A rising sun represents Japan. </p>\n<p>Japan\u2019s concerned over China\u2019s military and political influence over Korea was escalating in this period and would break out into the First Sino-Japanese War less than a year after the Columbian Exposition.  Russia was a looming presence as well, having established the first diplomatic relations in 1884 and quickly gaining a political foothold in support of the Korean ruling dynasty against Japanese interests. That tension would come to a head in the Russo-Japanese War a decade later.</p>\n<p>On the tops of the three pieces were designs symbolizing the friendship between the United States and Japan: the red and white stripes and stars of the US flag strewn with the chrysanthemums of Imperial Japan. A bronze eagle on top of the censer represents the United States. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/South-Entrance-Palace-of-Fine-Arts.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53906\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/South-Entrance-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/South-Entrance-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/South-Entrance-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/South-Entrance-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-768x567.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/South-Entrance-Palace-of-Fine-Arts-430x318.jpg 430w\" title=\"South Entrance Palace of Fine Arts.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The political implications of the imagery caused some difficulty at the World\u2019s Fair.

The location of its pair was unknown from immediately after the World\u2019s Fair until it was recognized sitting bold as brass in the center of the main dining room of Spenger\u2019s Fresh Fish Grotto in Berkeley, California. The venerable restaurant is one San Francisco\u2019s Bay oldest and most revered culinary icons. The gigantic urn in the middle of it somehow managed to go unidentified by experts, including the Vice President of Decorative Arts and Furnishings of the auction house that sold it, until the restaurant closed. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The story of the missing vase begins to unfold in 1892 when Michael H. de Young of San Francisco, a businessman and journalist who founded the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper and the de Young Museum, was appointed as a national commissioner to the 1893 Columbian Exposition by President Benjamin Harrison. Through this position, de Young saw the opportunity to stimulate California\u2019s economy by proposing an 1894 California Midwinter Fair, which was held the following winter in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, CA.</p>\n<p>Following the Chicago World\u2019s Fair, de Young brought one of the Japanese cloisonn\u00e9 vases to San Francisco for exhibition at the Midwinter Fair. It was at this point, following the fair, that Frank Spenger, avid collector and owner of Spenger\u2019s Restaurant in Berkeley, bought this one vase from Michael de Young and placed it inside the main dining room where it has remained until October 2018.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Apparently he first tried to put it in the family\u2019s penthouse apartment. <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-chicago-1893-worlds-fair-japanese-vase-auction-20190104-story.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to Frank Spenger\u2019s great-granddaughter Alicia</a>, Mrs. Spenger thought the eight-foot vase on its wood pedestal four feet wide was a little much for the living room, so she asked him to move it down to the restaurant with the rest of his ever-expanding collection of art, artifacts and maritime memorabilia. Even the <a href=\"https://clars.com/news/the-spenger-diamond/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spenger Diamond</a>, all 34.28 carats of it, wound up on display in the restaurant.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Huge Japanese urn \u201clost\u201d for 100 years and found in fish restaurant sells big\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53899\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53899#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54364\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54364\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rare portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots, on display\">Rare portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots, on display</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, February 20th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-Queen-of-Scots-in-white-mourning.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54366\" height=\"266\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-Queen-of-Scots-in-white-mourning-200x266.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-Queen-of-Scots-in-white-mourning-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-Queen-of-Scots-in-white-mourning-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-Queen-of-Scots-in-white-mourning-768x1022.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-Queen-of-Scots-in-white-mourning-430x572.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots in white mourning (deuil blanc), studio of studio of Fran\u00e7ois Clouet, c. 1560-61.

The oil-on-oak panel painting depicts Mary \u201cen deuil blanc\u201d (in white mourning), wearing gossamer white veils instead of the heavy blacks of full mourning she wore in a later portrait. </p>\n<p>It is believed to have been the work of the studio of Fran\u00e7ois Clouet, a miniaturist and portraitist to the French royal family, made in late 1560/early 1561 when Mary was mourning the successive deaths of her father-in-law King Henry II of France (d. July 1559), her mother Mary of Guise (June 1560) and her husband Francis II (December 1560) of France. White had been a popular mourning color in France for centuries by the time Mary donned it. She had unusually bucked that association and worn white for her 1558 wedding to the then-Dauphin of France, only to find herself having to wear white again in its traditional symbolism after his death just two and a half years later. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54371\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-200x277.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-768x1062.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-430x595.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc.jpg 1417w\" title=\"Mary, Queen of Scots, en dueil blanc, copy after Fran\u00e7ois Clouet, c. 1560-1580.

Her caretaker/keeper/jailer George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, allowed her to sit for Nicholas Hilliard, the premiere miniature portraitist of the Tudor court.

It was thought to be a modified 17th century copy of the more famous Clouet. Dendrochronological analysis of the oak panels found that the wood dated to 1547. Coupled with stylistic examination, the age of the wood confirms that the portrait dated to the mid-16th century and was done in Mary\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Rare portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots, on display\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54364\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54364#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54356\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54356\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Unique deviant burial found in Sicily\">Unique deviant burial found in Sicily</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, February 19th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/64788-medieval-sicily-stabbing.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The remains of an adult male</a> were discovered in 2013 in Piazza Armerina, a medieval village in central Sicily that was built over the ruins of a Roman latifundia, one of the immense agricultural estates that Sicily was largely divided into by the 2nd century. The body was isolated, not part of a cemetery or burial ground. As a matter of fact, the remains weren\u2019t even in or near a settlement as they date to the between the first and second half of the 11th century, a time when the area was still unpopulated. The village\u2019s first appearance on the historical record dates to 1122.</p>\n<p>The skeleton was buried face down in a shallow grave in a southwest to northeast orientation. The right arm was extended along the side of the body. The left arm was extended over the back; the ulna was found resting on the left pelvis. The feet were so close together that it\u2019s highly likely they were tied. There were no funerary objects found in the pit. </p>\n<p>The isolation, orientation and position of the body mark it as a deviant or atypical burial that it not in concert with Christian, Jewish or Muslim funerary practices. The skeleton is almost complete and in excellent condition, allowing researchers to study this unique burial in detail using a combination of osteoarchaeological analysis, forensic anthropology techniques and technology to study the remains. </p>\n<p>They identified six stab wounds on the sternum with the shape of the blade tip impressed on the bone. The weapon appears to have been a single-edged knife or dagger, a close-combat blade that nonetheless managed to pierce the thorax and penetrate the posterior sternum from entry points on the victim\u2019s back. A large bone fragment on the right side of the sternum was dislodged when the blade was twisted with significant force.</p>\n<p>To get an accurate picture of the dynamics of this fatal stabbing, researchers used 3D modeling technology. They created a virtual model of the chest, the entry points and angles of penetration. They were steep, indicating the assailant was standing behind the kneeling victim. As the blade went through the thorax into the breastbone, it probably punctured his lung and heart, killing him quickly.</p>\n<p>The injury pattern is unique. There is nothing like it known in the archaeological record. It is not the result of hand-to-hand combat. There is no evidence of contact anywhere else on the victim\u2019s chest, which almost certainly would have been present during the chaos of a fight. </p>\n<blockquote><p>There was no evidence of other injuries on the man\u2019s vertebrae or ribs that would suggest that the man was involved in some kind of \u201cuncontrolled\u201d fight, said lead author Roberto Miccich\u00e8, an archaeologist at the University of Palermo in Italy.</p>\n<p>The goal of the man\u2019s killer, it seems, was to attack the victim in a \u201cvery effective and rapid way,\u201d Miccich\u00e8 said; in addition, the assailant likely knew human anatomy \u201cvery well.\u201d In fact, the cuts were so clean and smooth, that the man may have been immobilized, perhaps with binding, Miccich\u00e8 said. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The clear, deep stab wounds, the lack of defensive, uncontrolled action, the evidence of binding, particularly in the closeness of the feet, and the relative positions of aggressor and victim indicate this was an execution.</p>\n<p>It is also the first thoroughly documented, archaeologically excavated deviant burial found in Sicily. A number of atypical burials have been recorded by archaeologists on the Italian mainland, but only one appears in the scientific literature for Sicily and it was not well-documented. Atypical burials are believed to have been employed for religious or magical reasons \u2014 like to prevent the dead from rising to harm the living \u2014 or as a form of post-mortem ostracism, a reflection of the deceased\u2019s marginal position in the social order.</p>\n<p>Researchers believe this death occurred in the aftermath of the Norman conquest of Sicily in 1061. It was a period of turmoil, of social and political realignment as the island transitioned from Islamic to Norman rule.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54358\" height=\"286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-430x286.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sicily-burial-768x512.jpg 768w\" title=\"East-facing photo of the prone burial.

title=\"Oldest tattoo tool in North America. Photo by Andrew Gillreath\u2011Brown.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center><br/>\nAn artifact stored in the Washington State University (WSU) Museum of Anthropology for 40\u202fyears has been identified as the <a href=\"https://news.wsu.edu/2019/02/28/oldest-tattoo-tool-western-north-america-discovered/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">oldest tattooing device in North America</a>. The tool, two prickly pear cactus spines inserted into the soft middle of a lemonade sumac stem and bound with yucca leaf strips, was excavated in 1972 from a midden at the Turkey Pen site in the Greater Bears Ears Landscape of southeastern Utah. One of the points of the spines was broken off, which is probably why it was discarded into the midden pile. Coprolites and corn cobbs in the midden layer that included the artifact were radiocarbon dated to a range of 79-130 A.D. during the Basketmaker II period (ca. 500\u202fB.C. \u2013 500\u202fA.D.).</p>\n<p>There are historical accounts of tattooing practices in Native American peoples of the southwest after the arrival of Europeans, but colonial authorities generally considered it a barbarous cultural expression and suppressed it actively. It was poorly documented and traditional tattooing was frequently prohibited. It largely died out in North America after European contact.</p>\n<p>Evidence of indigenous tattooing before that is very slim. No tattoos have been found on pre-contact mummified human remains and there are no ancient written accounts of the practice. Rare surviving tattoo tools and depictions in ancient iconography are all scholars have had to go on when studying body modification and adornment in southwestern Native American cultures before they were disrupted by European colonization, and it\u2019s unclear whether the artworks depict tattoos, body paint or scarification.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tattoo-needle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54445\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tattoo-needle-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tattoo-needle-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tattoo-needle-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tattoo-needle-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tattoo-needle-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cactus spines bound with split yucca leaves. Photo by Andrew Gillreath\u2011Brown.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The device was discovered by WSU anthropology PhD candidate Andrew Gillreath-Brown during an inventory of the Turkey Pen material. Cactus spine tattoo tools have been found before at Native American sites in Arizona and New Mexico, but the oldest of them date to between 1100-1280 A.D. This device looked like ones found elsewhere in the southwest only it was used a thousand years before them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The tool consists of a 3 \u00bd inch wooden skunkbush sumac handle bound at the end with split yucca leaves and holding two parallel cactus spines, stained black at their tips.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe residue staining from tattoo pigments on the tip was what immediately piqued my interest as being possibly a tattoo tool,\u201d Gillreath-Brown said.</p>\n<p>Encouraged by Aaron Deter-Wolf, a friend and co-author of the study who has done studies on ancient tattooing and edited several books on the subject, Gillreath-Brown analyzed the tips with a scanning electron microscope, X-ray florescence and energy dispersive ray spectroscopy. For good measure, he did several test tattoos using a replica on pig skin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54447\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Inky-points-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ink staining the tips of the cactus spines.

Discovering Literature: Medieval submits for your approval/devouring 50 digitized manuscripts and early printed books dating from the 8th to 16th centuries. These rare volumes are some of the most influential works in the history of English literature.  \n There\u2019s The Wycliffite Bible, the first complete translation of the Bible into English, Revelations of Divine Love by Julian of Norwich, the first work written by a woman in English, the first autobiography in English (The Book of Margery Kempe) and the only surviving Old English manuscript of Beowulf which somehow avoided the fate of so many priceless works of literature in the Robert Cotton collection that burned to ashes in a devastating October 23rd, 1731, conflagration at the aptly named Ashburnham House. William Caxton\u2019s illustrated early print edition of The Canterbury Tales may not have the color and beauty of the hand-illuminated The Book of the Queen by Christine de Pizan (the first woman author to actually make a living on the income from her writing), but it was a groundbreaking advance for the dissemination of literature and literacy.  \n Digital technology puts all of these rare or unique masterpieces, some of which aren\u2019t even available to scholars, at our fingertips. The sole surviving manuscript of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, for example, one of the greatest works of Middle English poetry, is so fragile after having barely escaped the same fire that almost incinerated Beowulf, that our grubby hands wouldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near it. Now we can enjoy its glories while smearing inches of caked Cheeto dust on our mice without a care in the world. \n If your ability to read manuscripts and early print of Old and Middle English is a bit rusty, allow the more than 20 articles written by academics, poets, authors in their own right, to help you understand what you\u2019re seeing and the impact it had on its time and ours. Or rifle through the associated collection items. There are some fantastic maps. The Beatus World Map with its remarkably modern abstract graphic is a particular favorite of mine. \n When you\u2019re done getting your Gawain and Beowulf on, you can lose more hours, days, weeks of your life perusing the Romantics and Victorians section. It features more than 1,200 items from the BL\u2019s collection from first edition published books to diaries, advertisements, penny dreadfuls, illustrations, manuscripts, pamphlets, letters and so much more. On top of the period items, you can enjoy more than 150 articles written by scholars about the works in the collection and 25 documentary films. For the educators among us, there are 30 teachers\u2019 notes good to go. It\u2019s like college, seriously. \n Discovering Literature is an unparalleled resource, a way of making an enormous collection like the British Library\u2019s, a feast beyond any normal individual\u2019s ability to ingest, never mind digest, accessible to everyone. It\u2019s not dumbed down or meager. It\u2019s just curated carefully to convey a wealth of information in concentrated form. Already so successful in its aims, this project is still just revving up. More content is added all the time.  \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\"

It was a ring with what appeared to be a human figure on it. Curious to know more about it, Ben-Shitrit posted a picture on Facebook where it caught the eye of Dr. Dror Ben-Yosef, director of the Israel Nature and Park\u2019s Authority Lower Galilee Education Center and his neighbor on the nearby Kibbutz Hazorea. Dr. Ben-Yosef recognized its advanced age and uniqueness and recommended he report the find to the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).</p>\n<p>The ring was examined by IAA Byzantine archaeology expert Dr. Yana Tchekhanovets whose preliminary identification indicates <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-israeli-gardener-finds-700-year-old-ring-with-image-of-st-nicholas-1.5849056\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it is a representation of Saint Nicholas</a>. The iconography of a haloed bald man wearing a mantle and holding a bishop\u2019s staff points to him. It is a signet ring in excellent condition that makes a deep imprint that clearly shows the attributes of the Christian saint. Dr. Tchekhanovets dated the ring to between the 12th and 15th centuries. Crusader Jerusalem was conquered by the Islamic forces of Saladin in 1187, and the last Christian territory, Acre, fell in 1291. That broad date means the ring could have been crossing the Holy Land when it was under Christian or Muslim control.</p>\n<p>You can get a look at the ring\u2019s imprint in this IAA video at the 38 second mark:</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVDc5dyauIU?rel=0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Obviously the figure depicted on the ring bares no relation to the Jolly Old Elf so associated with the contemporary tradition of Christmas gift-giving. The Saint Nicholas in the Eastern Orthodox tradition was more akin to the Western Saint Christopher, patron saint of all travelers, including merchants, sailors and pilgrims. Wearing a ring or medallion with his image \u2014 his attributes are the bishop\u2019s crook and vestments \u2014 was meant to confer his protection on the wearer. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Santa-ring.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50732\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Santa-ring-140x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Santa-ring-140x150.jpg 140w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Santa-ring-200x214.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Santa-ring-430x460.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Santa-ring.jpg 675w\" title=\"Medieval signet ring depicting Saint Nicholas.

There\u2019s no way of knowing for certain because the ring was not buried and found in situ during a rigorous archaeological excavation, but rather found nestled in weeds on the surface, so it probably wasn\u2019t discovered where it fell hundreds of years ago.</p>\n<p>According to hagiographical lore, Saint Nicholas was himself a pilgrim to the Holy Land. Born to a wealthy Greek family in Lycia (modern-day Turkey), Nicholas was raised by an uncle who was an abbot and became a monk at a very young age. One of the earliest miracles he is said to have performed \u2014 predicting a storm at sea, praying it away, raising a sailor who had died in a fall from rigging \u2014 was when he was a young man on his first pilgrimage to walk in the footsteps of Jesus. He returned to the Holy Land when he was in 40s, joining a group of ascetic monks and living in a mountain cave outside Bethlehem for several years. When he emerged, he again made a pilgrimage to all the main sites of the gospel accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/st-nicholas-ring.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50731\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/st-nicholas-ring-179x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/st-nicholas-ring-179x300.jpg 179w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/st-nicholas-ring-90x150.jpg 90w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/st-nicholas-ring-768x1287.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/st-nicholas-ring-430x720.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/st-nicholas-ring.jpg 832w\" title=\"Medieval signet ring depicting Saint Nicholas.

They are easily overlooked, trafficked or kept by finders.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nir Distelfeld, Israel Antiquities Authority anti-theft inspector, who received the ring from Ben-Shitrit to place it in the National Treasures Collection, had high praise for the gardener: \u201cWe thank Ben-Shitrit for handing over this special artifact to the Israel Antiquities Authority, and we encourage others to do the same, When they do, they enrich and deepen archaeological understanding of the past that belongs to all of us. The Israel Antiquities Authority will be awarding Ben-Shitrit a good citizenship certificate in thanks for his action.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Gardener  in Galilee finds medieval St. Nicholas ring\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50728\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50728#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-50719\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50719\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Medieval city found under high school gym in Finland\">Medieval city found under high school gym in Finland</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, February 25th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Remains-of-medieval-houses-under-gym.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50724\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Remains-of-medieval-houses-under-gym-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Remains-of-medieval-houses-under-gym-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Remains-of-medieval-houses-under-gym-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Remains-of-medieval-houses-under-gym-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Remains-of-medieval-houses-under-gym-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Remains of 14th century houses under gym.

When the gym\u2019s floor was removed during renovations. Workers found the remains of two houses, vaults, staircases and a paved road from the 14th century.</p>\n<p>It is not an unexpected find. The oldest city in Finland, Turku was founded in the 13th century, and while the medieval center of the city around the cathedral had to be rebuilt after it was levelled by fire in 1827, excavations in the 1990s unearthed the foundations of 13th and 14th-century stone and brick houses, and numerous artifacts. At that time Turku was the site of the bishopric and Turku Cathedral, consecrated in 1300, which is just down the street from the school. <a href=\"http://www.aboavetusarsnova.fi/fi\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aboa Vetus</a> next door to the school has integrated the medieval remains under its floors into only archaeological museum in Finland.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Paved-street-beneath-gym-floor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50721\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Paved-street-beneath-gym-floor-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Paved-street-beneath-gym-floor-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Paved-street-beneath-gym-floor-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Paved-street-beneath-gym-floor-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Paved-street-beneath-gym-floor-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Paved street beneath gym.

Traces of these were noticed by the archeologist Juhani Rinne when the gym was built at the beginning of the 1900s, but now the picture has come into focus,\u201d says the leader of the dig team, Kari Uotila. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>Hundreds of cubic metres of fill have been hauled out of the dig site, revealing the walled ruins and vaulted cellars. Now down a metre and a half into the soil, the team has reach floor level in parts of dig.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Medieval-foundations-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50722\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Medieval-foundations-det-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Medieval-foundations-det-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Medieval-foundations-det-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Medieval-foundations-det-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Medieval-foundations-det-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Medieval vaults and staircases under the gym.

Right now, we\u2019ve uncovered about a dozen different vault structures, as well as staircases and hallways belonging to two buildings.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Excavations will continue for another month. The archaeological team is hoping to reach the floor level of the houses. The really thorny problem is what to do after that. The whole point of tearing up the gym floor was to build a new one with fresh supports. Those support pilings as currently planned cannot be constructed without largely destroying the ruins. Uotila is hoping the remains will be left in place and that the shoring supports issue will be sorted out so that the remains can still become integrated into the building as a display. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/View-of-gym-dig.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50723\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/View-of-gym-dig-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/View-of-gym-dig-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/View-of-gym-dig-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/View-of-gym-dig-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/View-of-gym-dig-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Medieval Turku under the bbal net.

Local architect Benito Casagrande thinks they should go another way altogether.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Casagrande says that there are construction alternatives that can be used to straighten the school structure and build a floor that would not require pilings.

Burial grounds have been found in the area before. Late last year, archaeologists embarked on an excavation with the aim of discovering the rest of the necropoli at Minya, and soon struck paydirt. They unearthed tombs of priests of Thoth, inventor of writing, god of wisdom and the patron deity of the 15th nome (province) of Upper Egypt, known as Khmno, and of its capital city Ashmounin. They also found burials of the priests\u2019 family members.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Canopic-jar.-Andalu-Agency..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Canopic jar.

In the Cueva Ardales, where excavations are currently being conducted by a German-Spanish team, the presence of Neanderthals has also been proven from analysing occupation layers. \u201cThis is certainly just the beginning of a new chapter in the study of ice age rock art\u201d, says Gerd-Christian Weniger of the Foundation Neanderthal Museum Mettmann, one of the leaders of the Ardales excavations. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to our new data Neanderthals and modern humans shared symbolic thinking and must have been cognitively indistinguishable\u201d, concludes Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o, team member from the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies in Barcelona and involved in both studies. \u201cOn our search for the origins of language and advanced human cognition we must therefore look much farther back in time, more than half a million years ago, to the common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>When the fossilized remains of Neanderthals were first discovered in the 19th century, one of the proposed names for the hominid species was <em>Homo stupidus</em>. They were held to be apelike and unintelligent, incapable of abstract or symbolic thought. The confirmation that they were not only capable of symbolism but also pretty freaking phenomenal artists puts to rest those old prejudices once and for all. Neanderthals were just as cognitively capable as modern humans.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Fig_17_Aviones_view_from_breakwater.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-50674\" height=\"314\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Fig_17_Aviones_view_from_breakwater-430x314.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Fig_17_Aviones_view_from_breakwater-430x314.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Fig_17_Aviones_view_from_breakwater-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Fig_17_Aviones_view_from_breakwater-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Fig_17_Aviones_view_from_breakwater-768x561.jpg 768w\" title=\"Cueva de los Aviones, seen from the breakwater of Cartagena harbour.

Photo by  Adrian Jusupovi\u0107.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The small, purplish spindle whorl was unearthed by archaeologists in Czermno, Poland, in 1952. What the people who found it didn\u2019t realize is that the <a href=\"http://scienceinpoland.pap.pl/en/news/news%2C28263%2Conly-medieval-whorl-inscription-found-poland-comes-czermno.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">biconical slate piece was inscribed</a>, making it a unique find in the Polish archaeological record. It was Iwona Florkiewicz from the Institute of Archeology of the University of Rzesz\u00f3w who discovered how precious this little piece really during an inventory project of materials discovered at Czermno over the course of decades. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Palaeographic research (on the form of writing) carried out by Dr. Adrian Jusupovi\u0107, historian from the Institute of History PAS in Warsaw, shows that the inscription was made in the second half of the 12th century or in the 13th century.</p>\n<p>The spindle whorl bears an inscription composed of 6 letters in Cyrillic, which can be transcribed as Hoten\\\u2019. It is a masculine name that means a lover, volunteer or master. It is also possible that the inscription was a toponym. In that case it should be associated with the name of a town or village. But researchers find this second possibility is less likely.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is the only spindle whorl with a text inscription from this period ever discovered in Poland. It\u2019s likely not of Polish origin, in fact. The slate itself is a non-native material. It is Volhynian slate, recognizable from its characteristic shades of pink to purple, found in the Ukraine. From the 11th century through the mid-13th, craftsmen in the nearby town of Owrucz produced inexpensive spindle whorls from the slate that were sold throughout the Kievan Rus and in what is now Poland. This trade came to an abrupt end in the 1240s when the invading Mongols destroyed the spindle whorl workshops. </p>\n<p>While it\u2019s possible the spindle was an import that was then inscribed in Poland, the lettering and indeed the inscription itself suggest it came to Poland with the inscription already done. Not only is it written in Cyrillic, but a number of inscribed spindle whorls have been found in the former territory of the Kievan Rus (Ukraine, Russia and Belarus), whereas this the first found in Poland.</p>\n<p>As Czermno was a border town, it was yanked and forth between Poland and the Kievan Rus for centuries. The Kievans took it in the 10th century. Boles\u0142aw the Brave of Poland\u2019s Piast dynasty took it back in 1018. After his death in 1025, Czermno\u2019s fortunes shifted again and Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Rus, reconquered the town and region in 1031. There it stayed until the 14th century when Casimir III the Great reclaimed it for Poland. So at the time this spindle whorl was made, Czermno was firmly in the ambit of the Kievan Rus. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe are not sure whether the spindle whorl was used for its original purpose \u2013 spinning \u2013 or had a secondary function as an amulet. The latter possibility should not be ruled out\u201d \u2013 Florkiewicz believes. She adds that according to the researchers, similar inscriptions could be signs of ownership. There are known spindle whorls that bear the names of women and men. \u201cIt is also possible that in this case it is the name of the object\u2019s maker\u201d \u2013 she concludes.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Inscription found on medieval spindle whorl in Poland\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50654\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50654#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-50632\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50632\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Only known Roman boxing gloves found at Vindolanda\">Only known Roman boxing gloves found at Vindolanda</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, February 21st, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Roman-Boxing-Gloves-on-Hands-c-TheVindoladna-Trust.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50649\" height=\"89\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Roman-Boxing-Gloves-on-Hands-c-TheVindoladna-Trust-200x89.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Roman-Boxing-Gloves-on-Hands-c-TheVindoladna-Trust-200x89.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Roman-Boxing-Gloves-on-Hands-c-TheVindoladna-Trust-150x66.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Roman-Boxing-Gloves-on-Hands-c-TheVindoladna-Trust-768x340.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Roman-Boxing-Gloves-on-Hands-c-TheVindoladna-Trust-430x190.jpg 430w\" title=\"Roman boxing gloves found at Vindolanda cavalry barracks, ca. 120 A.D. Photo (c) TheVindoladna Trust.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Roman fort of Vindolanda just south of Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Northumberland continues to reap the blessings of its anaerobic, waterlogged soil. Last summer\u2019s dig season was replete with important finds including a cache of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47992\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">25 writing tablets</a>, but the greatest find was a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48761\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pre-Hadrianic cavalry barracks from around 105 A.D.</a> in which were found all kinds of utility items from daily life \u2014 ink writing tablets, styluses, combs, pottery, wooden spoons, bowls, leather shoes, small wooden swords that were likely children\u2019s toys \u2014 as well as an extraordinary group of cavalry weapons, armor and harness fittings. Two swords, one complete with wooden pommel, its edge still sharp inside an intact wooden scabbard, were particularly exciting finds.</p>\n<p>Among the treasures discovered in the remains of the cavalry barracks were two leather pieces unlike anything else found at the fort. Thousands of leather shoes have been unearthed at Vindolanda. These definitely weren\u2019t shoes. They are <a href=\"http://www.vindolanda.com/_blog/press-releases/post/rare-ancient-roman-boxing-gloves-uncovered-at-vindolanda/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">elliptical bands which archaeologists and Roman experts have identified as boxing gloves</a>. Dating to around 120 A.D., they are the only known surviving boxing gloves from the Roman era.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Unlike the modern boxing glove these ancient examples have the appearance of a protective guard, designed to fit snugly over the knuckles protecting them from impact. The larger of the two gloves is cut from a single piece of leather and was folded into a pouch configuration, the extending leather at each side were slotted into one another forming a complete oval shape creating an inner hole into which a hand could still easily be inserted. The glove was packed with natural material acting as a shock absorber. This larger glove has extreme wear on the contact edge and it had also undergone repair with a tear covered by a circular patch. The slightly smaller glove was uncovered in near perfect condition with the same construction but filled with a tight coil of hard twisted leather.</p>\n<p>The two gloves can still fit comfortably on a modern hand. They have been skilfully made, with the smaller glove retaining the impression of the wearer\u2019s knuckles. It is likely that the gloves functioned as sparring or practice <em>caestu</em> each has a stiffened contact edge being a softer representation of the of the more lethal metal inserts used in \u2018professional\u2019 ancient boxing bouts. It is thought that the larger glove may have been unfit for purpose due to prolonged use and may have survived alongside the \u2018newer\u2019 model resulting from a personal attachment given to it by the owner.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Boxing was a popular sport in Classical antiquity. It was used to hone and improve combat skills in the Roman army, as well as for general fitness. In addition to regular sparring, boxing matches and tournaments between soldiers were arranged as spectator sports attended by civilians.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Boxing-Glove-display-c-The-Vindolanda-Trust.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-50647\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Boxing-Glove-display-c-The-Vindolanda-Trust-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Boxing-Glove-display-c-The-Vindolanda-Trust-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Boxing-Glove-display-c-The-Vindolanda-Trust-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Boxing-Glove-display-c-The-Vindolanda-Trust-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Boxing-Glove-display-c-The-Vindolanda-Trust-430x573.jpg 430w\" title='Boxing gloves displayed against image of \"Boxer at Rest\" bronze.

The mannequin hands are placed in front of the boxer\u2019s so they look almost like extensions of his own.

The inscription, now puzzled back together, describes Aspelta as \u201cKing of Upper and Lower Egypt,\u201d \u201cBeloved of Re\u2019-Harakhty\u201d (a Kushite version of the Egyptian sun god \u201cRe\u201d) and as having been \u201cgiven all life, stability and dominion forever.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Egyptian-hieroglyphic-inscription.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50642\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 71px) 100vw, 71px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Egyptian-hieroglyphic-inscription-71x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Egyptian-hieroglyphic-inscription-71x150.jpg 71w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Egyptian-hieroglyphic-inscription-142x300.jpg 142w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Egyptian-hieroglyphic-inscription-379x800.jpg 379w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Egyptian-hieroglyphic-inscription.jpg 663w\" title=\"Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription identifying the statue as Aspelta.

Some of his distant predecessors were, but by the time Aspelta took the throne, the Kushite monarchs no longer ruled Egypt. The last Kushite king of Egypt was Tanwetamani who ruled ca. 664\u2013653 B.C. and lost control of the ancient land to the north more than 50 years before Aspelta\u2019s reign. The title is vestigial, a carryover of former glory rather than any stubborn claim to the throne of Egypt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Temple-of-Amun.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-50640\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Temple-of-Amun-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Temple-of-Amun-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Temple-of-Amun-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Temple-of-Amun-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Temple-of-Amun-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Temple of Amun looking towards the main gate.

Archivist Daniel Michelson found a red leather-bound volume of the <em>Gaines Universal Register or American and British Kalendar for the year 1793</em> nestled in the stacks on the third floor of the library and gave it to librarian John Myers to catalogue. The almanac is inscribed \u201cPhilip Schuyler\u2019s a present from his friend Mr. Philip Ten Eycke New York April 20, 1793.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washington-hair-and-note.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50626\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washington-hair-and-note-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washington-hair-and-note-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washington-hair-and-note-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washington-hair-and-note-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washington-hair-and-note-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washington-hair-and-note.jpg 1400w\" title=\"Washington hair and provenance note by James A. Hamilton.

Myers carefully turned each pages of the book and found annotations from Philip Jeremiah Schuyler including instructions on how to \u201cpreserve beef for summer\u2019s use.\u201d Then, inside an envelope stuffed into the accordion folder affixed to the book\u2019s cover, Myers discovered strands of grey hair bound in a single white thread. The envelope was labelled \u201cWashington\u2019s hair, L.S.S. &amp; (scratched out) GBS from James A. Hamilton given him by his mother, Aug. 10, 1871.\u201d</p>\n<p>Philip Jeremiah Schuyler was the son of General Philip John Schuyler who fought in the Revolutionary War and was elected to the Continental Congress, the New York State Senate and the Senate of the United States. He is considered one of the founders of Union College. General Schuyler was a personal friend of George Washington\u2019s and served under him in the Revolutionary War. His daughter, Philip Jeremiah\u2019s sister, Eliza was married to Alexander Hamilton. The James A. Hamilton who wrote the note on the envelope identifying the hair as George Washington\u2019s was their third son.</p>\n<p>Alexander and Eliza were close friends of George and Martha Washington. It\u2019s likely that Martha gave them the lock of hair after George\u2019s death in 1799 as a memento, a common practice at the time, all the more so for prominent citizens mourned by many friends and indeed the whole country.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washingtons-hair.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50628\" height=\"134\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washingtons-hair.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-200x134.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washingtons-hair.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washingtons-hair.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washingtons-hair.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Washingtons-hair.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Strands of hair belonging to George Washington found at Union College. Photo courtesy Union College.\" width=\"200\"/></a>\u201cIn an era when people frequently exchanged hair as a keepsake, it\u2019s quite probable that Martha had given Eliza some of George\u2019s hair, which in turn was given to their son, James, who later distributed it, strand by strand, as a precious memento to close friends and family members,\u201d said Susan Holloway Scott, an independent scholar and author of the recent historical novel \u201cI Eliza Hamilton.\u201d</p>\n<p>Officials with the Schuyler Mansion, a state historic site in Albany, believe that James Hamilton gave the lock of Washington\u2019s hair to his granddaughters, Louisa Lee Schuyler and Georgina Schuyler, whose initials are on the envelope discovered at Union. The mansion displays another few strands of Washington\u2019s hair in a locket kept under glass.</p>\n<p>A lack of documentation on clear custody of the material found in Union\u2019s archives or DNA testing makes it difficult to verify that the strands of hair are Washington\u2019s. The handwriting believed to be James Hamilton\u2019s on the envelope is similar to Hamilton\u2019s handwriting that accompanies strands of Washington\u2019s hair held by the Massachusetts Historical Society.</p></blockquote>\n<p>DNA testing is not possible as the hairs have been exposed to too many hands and potential contaminants to allow for accurate results. They\u2019re also cut, not pulled from the root as Martha was not a monster. Union College has no record of the book entering its collection, so there\u2019s no clear line of ownership history that could help solidify the claim. However, the Schuylers had such a strong connection to the college and the hair itself is very similar to other strands that are confirmed to have been George Washington\u2019s.</p>\n<p>India Spartz, head of Union College library\u2019s Special Collections and Archives, is currently conserving the hair bundle, the almanac and an 1804 letter to 1804 Philip Jeremiah Schuyler that was also found inside the accordion folder. The group will be exhibited at an undetermined point in the future.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Letter-hair-and-evelope-found-in-Gaines-Register.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-50627\" height=\"287\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Letter-hair-and-evelope-found-in-Gaines-Register.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-430x287.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Letter-hair-and-evelope-found-in-Gaines-Register.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Letter-hair-and-evelope-found-in-Gaines-Register.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Letter-hair-and-evelope-found-in-Gaines-Register.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Letter-hair-and-evelope-found-in-Gaines-Register.-Photo-courtesy-Union-College.-768x513.jpg 768w\" title=\"Hair, envelope and 1804 letter found in almanac.

Photo by Reinhard Haider, courtesy the Museen der Stadt Linz.' width=\"430\"/></a></center><br/>\nA mystery almost 70 years in the making was solved when a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/arts/design/gustav-klimt-drawing-found-austria.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lost drawing by Gustav Klimt was returned to the Lentos Museum</a> in Linz, Austria, after the death of a former secretary who turns out to have stolen it decades ago. The sensual drawing of two women, <em>Zwei Liegende</em> (\u201cTwo Reclining Figures\u201d), was one of four loaned to the museum (then the Neue Galerie der Stadt Linz) by Linz-born artist Olga J\u00e4ger in 1951. The other three were pieces by Egon Schiele. In 1964 it was loaned to the Albertina Museum in Vienna and returned without incident. That is the last mention of the four loaned works on the historical record.</p>\n<p>Olga J\u00e4ger died in 1965 and it seemed the disappearance of the drawing might fly under the radar forever, but in 1990 Olga\u2019s niece-in-law, wife of nephew Kurt J\u00e4ger, sent the museum a letter asking that the loaned works be returned. Museum staff looked for the art in their own stores and in other city and regional collections, but came up empty. The niece\u2019s sons pressed the case in 2006 and again a thorough search was fruitless. </p>\n<p>In 2011, the J\u00e4ger descendants sued the City of Linz and were awarded damages in the amount of \u20ac100,000  ($124,000) for the loss of one of the Schiele works (\u201cPaar\u201d). Damages got even more damaging in 2017, when the Linz Regional Court ordered the city to pay the J\u00e4gers \u20ac8.21 million (about $10 million) for the other three. The Klimt drawing was the least costly of them, assessed at \u20ac100,000.</p>\n<p>This January, the Klimt was returned to the museum out of the blue. It was delivered by a lawyer who explained his client, said former secretary, has died in December and left explicit instructions in her will to recover the work from her closet and give it back to the city.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But how did the Klimt drawing end up in a closet? According to [Julius Stieber, the director of culture and education for the City of Linz], the secretary\u2019s will said that in 1964, she noticed some irregularities with the documentation of the Schiele pictures after a loan to the Albertina Museum in Vienna, and notified the Neue Galerie\u2019s then-director, Walter Kasten.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kasten told her to keep the irregularities quiet and gave her the Klimt drawing as \u201chush art,\u201d Mr. Steiber said, further describing the will\u2019s account of the events. \u201cFor years the Klimt hung in her apartment, but when the J\u00e4ger case became public, she hid it in her wardrobe,\u201d Mr. Stieber said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a thriller,\u201d Klaus Luger, the mayor of Linz, said in a news conference on Tuesday.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The secretary has not been named for legal reasons. The three Schiele pieces are still missing and there is no evidence she was involved in their loss. Was Kasten handing out art like candy to cover his tracks? The police investigation is ongoing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drawing-on-display.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50615\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drawing-on-display-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drawing-on-display-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drawing-on-display-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drawing-on-display-768x1154.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drawing-on-display-430x646.jpg 430w\" title=\"Drawing on display at LENTOS Art Museum Linz.

It could be pivotal in determining whether the heirs waited too long to pursue their case. The statute of limitations may have run out.</p>\n<p>The drawing is now on display in the <a href=\"http://www.lentos.at/html/de/4745.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>1918 \u2013 Klimt \u2013 Moser \u2013 Schiele</em></a> exhibition at the Lentos Museum. It runs through May 21st, 2018.

Or rifle through the associated collection items. There are some fantastic maps. The <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/beatus-world-map\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beatus World Map</a> with its remarkably modern abstract graphic is a particular favorite of mine.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re done getting your Gawain and Beowulf on, you can lose more hours, days, weeks of your life perusing the <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Romantics and Victorians</em></a> section. It features more than 1,200 items from the BL\u2019s collection from first edition published books to diaries, advertisements, penny dreadfuls, illustrations, manuscripts, pamphlets, letters and so much more. On top of the period items, you can enjoy more than 150 articles written by scholars about the works in the collection and 25 documentary films. For the educators among us, there are 30 teachers\u2019 notes good to go. It\u2019s like college, seriously.</p>\n<p>Discovering Literature is an unparalleled resource, a way of making an enormous collection like the British Library\u2019s, a feast beyond any normal individual\u2019s ability to ingest, never mind digest, accessible to everyone. It\u2019s not dumbed down or meager. It\u2019s just curated carefully to convey a wealth of information in concentrated form. Already so successful in its aims, this project is still just revving up. More content is added all the time. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Discovering the British Library\u2019s medieval literature\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50738\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>"}

It was to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory where the first time ever, a mummy was scanned by a particle accelerator. The mummy was donated years ago to the Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary at Northwestern University by the Hibbard family, wealthy patrons who had funded archaeological digs in Egypt in the early 20th century and received the mummy as a gift (goes the story). They gave this mummy, the remains of a little girl just five years old at the time of her death in the late 1st century A.D., with a portrait of her over her face as if she were peering through the bandages wrapped around her body. It\u2019s that portrait that captured researcher\u2019s interest. \n The encaustic-on-wood panel paintings preserved in pristine color and detail by the dry desert heat of Egypt are so personal, evocative and haunting that they\u2019ve been a hot-ticket item for wide sale and distribution in the shady antiquities trade since the first ones were found in the 17th century. Today the mummy portraits number about 900, most of them unearthed from the Faiyum necropolis southwest of Cairo, as was the little girl whose remains were discovered in Hawara at the entrance to the Faiyum oasis. The Faiyum portraits are the largest assemblage of ancient panel paintings still in existence today. \n Only 100 of them are still intact and attached to the mummies they depict so expertly. The Hibbard mummy is part of an elite cadre, therefore. And yet, nobody in the archaeological department or on the staff of Northwestern\u2019s Block Museum of Art had any idea she existed. She just hung out at the Seminary for a century, uncommented upon, until museum curator Essi R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 saw her in person. With the curatorial team already in the process of collecting mummy portraits for an upcoming exhibition Paint the Eyes Softer: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt (ie, Faiyum), R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 took advantage of the unbelievably rare opportunity to add the girl\u2019s mummy to the portraits going on display. \n The child\u2019s body is wrapped tightly in thick layers of linen wrappings, the outer layer of which cross each other in a painstaking geometric arrangement that secure and frame her painted visage. Painted with pigment and sealed with beeswax, the girl is shown with her hair is tied at the nape of her neck and wearing a red tunic with gold jewelry. Because of her secure bindings, there was no way for researchers to study her insides without causing damage, but now that they had a real matched pair, the bones still safely wrapped in their original bandages and the intact portrait above them, researchers wanted to examine both the human and her representation with the best technology at their disposal.  \n In August they took the mummy to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where she was given a CT scan. This provided the team with a 3D map of the mummy\u2019s inside and confirmed she was about five years old when she died. On Monday they considerably upped the ante and took her to the Argonne National Laboratory in Evanston to see what the immense light power of X-ray scattering (the technology that revealed the contents of that medallion box from the French crypt so clearly I heard my own jaw drop when I first saw the video) could tell us about her.  \n \u201cIntact portrait mummies are exceedingly rare, and to have one here on campus was revelatory for the class and exhibition,\u201d said Marc Walton, a research professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern\u2019s McCormick School of Engineering. [\u2026]\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our undergraduate students \u2014 and for me \u2014 to work at understanding the whole object that is this girl mummy,\u201d Walton said. \u201cToday\u2019s powerful analytical tools allow us to nondestructively do the archaeology scientists couldn\u2019t do 100 years ago.\u201d\nThe synchrotron experiment at Argonne is a modern-day version of 19th-century England\u2019s \u201cmummy unwrapping\u201d parties, Walton said. The Northwestern team collaborated with scientists at Argonne and used the extremely brilliant high-energy synchrotron X-rays produced by Argonne\u2019s Advanced Photon Source to probe the materials and objects inside the mummy, while leaving the mummy and her wrappings intact.\n\u201cFrom a medical research perspective, I am interested in what we can learn about her bone tissue,\u201d Stock said. \u201cWe also are investigating a scarab-shaped object, her teeth and what look like wires near the mummy\u2019s head and feet.\u201d[\u2026]\nAt the Advanced Photon Source, Stock and his team shined the pencil-shaped X-ray beam (about twice the diameter of a human hair) on areas of high-density in the mummy that were identified by the CT scan. They now will use the X-ray diffraction patterns as \u201cfingerprints\u201d to identify each crystalline material. For example, is the black rounded object seen on the CT scan a gold object or a rock?\nThe findings from the synchrotron experiment, CT scan and other scientific analyses and studies of history conducted by the students will help researchers and historians better understand the context in which the Garrett mummy was excavated in 1911 as well as Roman-period mummification practices. Also, conservators will use the information to best preserve the mummy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically able to go back to an excavation that happened more than 100 years ago and reconstruct it with our contemporary analysis techniques,\u201d Walton said. \u201cAll the information we find will help us enrich the entire historic context of this young girl mummy and the Roman period in Egypt.\u201d \n Paint the Eyes Softer: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt opens at the Block Museum of Art on January 13th and runs through April 22nd, 2018. \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML

Today the mummy portraits number about 900, most of them unearthed from the Faiyum necropolis southwest of Cairo, as was the little girl whose remains were discovered in Hawara at the entrance to the Faiyum oasis. The Faiyum portraits are the largest assemblage of ancient panel paintings still in existence today.</p>\n<p>Only 100 of them are still intact and attached to the mummies they depict so expertly. The Hibbard mummy is part of an elite cadre, therefore. And yet, nobody in the archaeological department or on the staff of Northwestern\u2019s Block Museum of Art had any idea she existed. She just hung out at the Seminary for a century, uncommented upon, until museum curator Essi R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 saw her in person. With the curatorial team already in the process of collecting mummy portraits for an upcoming exhibition <em>Paint the Eyes Softer: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt</em> (ie, Faiyum), R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 took advantage of the unbelievably rare opportunity to add the girl\u2019s mummy to the portraits going on display.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-49748\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait mummy of a girl, late 1st century A.D.

Painted with pigment and sealed with beeswax, the girl is shown with her hair is tied at the nape of her neck and wearing a red tunic with gold jewelry. Because of her secure bindings, there was no way for researchers to study her insides without causing damage, but now that they had a real matched pair, the bones still safely wrapped in their original bandages and the intact portrait above them, researchers wanted to examine both the human and her representation with the best technology at their disposal. </p>\n<p>In August they took the mummy to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where she was given a CT scan. This provided the team with a 3D map of the mummy\u2019s inside and confirmed she was about five years old when she died. On Monday they considerably upped the ante and took her to the Argonne National Laboratory in Evanston to see what the immense light power of X-ray scattering (the technology that revealed the contents of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39264\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that medallion box from the French crypt</a> so clearly I heard my own jaw drop when I first saw the video) could tell us about her. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIntact portrait mummies are exceedingly rare, and to have one here on campus was revelatory for the class and exhibition,\u201d said Marc Walton, a research professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern\u2019s McCormick School of Engineering.

Photo courtesy the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Center.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Archaeologists have unearthed another piece of colossal scenary from Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s 1923 epic silent movie <em>The Ten Commandments</em> from the sands of the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes near Pismo Beach, California. At least one filmmaker, enthusiasts, nature conservancy advocates and archaeologists have been looking for the fabled set since 1982. DeMille claimed to have deliberately destroyed it after filming wrapped to keep it from being used by copy-cats to get their movies to look as good as his without having to spend the Croesonian budgets studios allowed him. He said he had it dynamited to smithereens and bulldozed the remains into a trench. </p>\n<p>A few bits and pieces were indeed <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/5201\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found by filmmaker Peter Brosnan</a> in 1983, who had to do assiduous research to even find the general area where this landmark film was shot. While there was a small flurry of interest from the Hollywood community when the first discoveries were made, the next shiny thing came along to distract potential moneyed supporters and Brosnan spent the next 30 years looking for more of the set and trying to raise funds to finish a documentary about the search that he\u2019d been filming since 1982. </p>\n<p>In 1998, Brosnan\u2019s organization teamed up with a nature preserve advocacy now known as the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Center and together they were able to recover more pieces of the set. DeMille had not in fact dynamited it, it seemed. There would have been evidence of that in the fragments, damage, scatter pattern, etc. He just broke the whole thing down and buried it and then the harsh elements did the rest, turning all that plaster and balsa wood to dust. Leave it to him to spin a yarn featuring a big dramatic action sequence complete with pyrotechnics when describing striking a set.</p>\n<p>The pursuit of the fabled lost land of Fake Movie Egypt picked up steam in the second decade of the 21st century. An archaeological dig discovered the head of one of the 21 plaster sphinxes (originally each one was 12 feet tall and weighed five tons even though they were hollow) that DeMille used to line the dramatic corridor leading to the main gates of \u201cThe City of the Pharaoh,\u201d a vista he borrowed from the Avenue of Sphinxes that connects the temples of Karnak and Luxor. The archaeologists were not able to transport the head so they reburied it hoping the sands would preserve it, but the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes are not Luxor. They\u2019re at the beach, after all, and there\u2019s a saltwater marine layer that blocked the adhesion of the expoxy archaeologists had coated the plaster in for its protection. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32838\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">When they returned in 2014</a>, the head had fallen to pieces. They were able to find another of the The City of the Pharaoh sphinx heads nearby that year, and that one was successfully recovered and conserved for display at the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Center.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Plaster-sphinx-head.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-49728\" height=\"145\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Plaster-sphinx-head-200x145.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Plaster-sphinx-head-200x145.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Plaster-sphinx-head-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Plaster-sphinx-head-768x555.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Plaster-sphinx-head-430x311.jpg 430w\" title=\"Brightly painted 300-pound plaster sphinx head.

(Funding in an unending migraine, hence the irregular digs.) The excavation was very brief, from October 23rd through November 4th, but the team made a big find even in that brief window: <a href=\"http://lompocrecord.com/news/local/pound-plaster-sphinx-head-archaeologists-unearth-new-movie-history-artifact/article_8edaa983-0a15-5079-a1c6-18889bf6f650.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a 300-pound piece of the head of another one of the plaster sphinxes</a>, the largest and best preserved yet.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe piece is unlike anything found on previous digs,\u201d said Doug Jenzen, executive director of the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Center.</p>\n<p>What makes the recent find significant is its size and how well-preserved researchers found it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe majority of it is preserved by sand with the original paint still intact,\u201d Jenzen said. \u201cThis is significant and shows that we\u2019re still learning unexpected facets to film historical movie production, such as the fact that objects in black-and-white films were actually painted extremely intense colors.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The sphinx head, which is about 5 feet by 8 feet, is currently being stored so it can dry out for a few months before art restorers can get to work preserving the artifact.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u201ds 94 years old and has been buried near the beach for that long; it is wet. If you think of the drywall in your house buried for 94 years at the beach, that is the consistency of the material we are working with,\u201d Jenzen said.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Sphinx-head-removed-from-dunes.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Sphinx head removed from the sand to the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Center for conservation.

Sterling Clark, an heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune, was highly discriminating in the pieces he chose to buy. He was entirely self-taught and relied solely on his own excellent taste, the input of a few trusted dealers and of the opinions of his wife Francine, a French-born actress who he described as his \u201ctouchstone in judging pictures.\u201d The result was a collection of such depth that it eclipsed in quality the collections amassed by his wealthier contemporaries.</p>\n<p>He kept it all on the down low, collecting for decades in the background, never publishing, promoting or displaying his artworks until th opening of the Clark Art Institute in 1955. Out of nowhere, it seemed, and set in a small college town in the remote Berkshire Mountains, one of the greatest private collections ever pieced together exploded on the scene. The Impressionists, the main focus of Sterling and Francine Clark\u2019s acquisitions after 1920, made the most lasting impression overall, but the Clark also has a phenomenal collection of paintings from the 14th century through the 19th, decorative arts, Remington bronzes, porcelain and British and American silver.</p>\n<p>Its location next to Williams College was not a coincidence. From the beginning, the Clarks evisioned the museum not just as a venue for the display of their flawless collection, but as a hub of art historical research and education. The museum sponsors the college\u2019s world-class art history graduate program have developed a truly symbiotic relationship that has produced curators and directors who have worked in the greatest museums in the country and internationally.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Dubois_Drahonet.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Alexandre Jean Dubois-Drahonet (French, 1791-1834), Portrait of Achille Deban de Laborde, 1817, Oil on canvas, 59 x 39.6 in.

The permanent collection has grown significantly since 1955 as the Clark Art Institute very selectively acquires pieces to flesh out certain areas, time periods and subject matters. <a href=\"http://www.clarkart.edu/About/Press-Room/Press-Releases/2017/Drahonet-Acquisition\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">One of its latest acquisitions is the <em>Portrait of Achille Deban de Laborde</em></a> (1817) by Alexandre-Jean Dubois-Drahonet, a French portraitist who may not have the highest name recognition today, but who was preeminent in his field and specialized in studies of military uniforms, several of which are now in the collection of Windsor Castle. Purchased at auction this past April for $295,500, far above its pre-sale estimate, it is a full-length oil on canvas painting of a boy dressed in full Napoleonic military uniform. </p>\n<p>The striking garb and composition of the portrait is a tribute to Achille\u2019s father, Baron Jean-Baptiste Deban de Laborde, a First Empire Hussar who was died in combat at the Battle of Wagram in 1809. His son was just one year old at the time. Seven years later, he sat for a portrait wearing a child-sized version of his father\u2019s uniform with its characteristic silver frogging and wee tasselled hessian boots. The youth leans on a ceremonial sword his father was given as an award for bravery as squadron leader at the Battle of Marengo in 1800. His sabre and its scabbard are on the floor on the lower right. Pinned to the velvet drapery in the upper left of the painting is the late baron\u2019s 1804 L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur medal, among others. On the couch behind Achille are Jean-Baptiste\u2019s plumed shako cap and sabretache (a pouch worn on cavalrymen\u2019s belt). The cap bears the number 8, Jean-Baptiste\u2019s hussar regiment.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Comte-Henri-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Mercure-de-Turenne-d\u2019Aynac.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49720\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 117px) 100vw, 117px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Comte-Henri-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Mercure-de-Turenne-d\u2019Aynac-117x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Comte-Henri-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Mercure-de-Turenne-d\u2019Aynac-117x150.jpg 117w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Comte-Henri-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Mercure-de-Turenne-d\u2019Aynac-200x255.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Comte-Henri-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Mercure-de-Turenne-d\u2019Aynac-768x981.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Comte-Henri-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Mercure-de-Turenne-d\u2019Aynac-430x549.jpg 430w\" title=\"Jacques-Louis David (French, 1748\u20131825), Comte Henri-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Mercure de Turenne-d\u2019Aynac, 1816.

His work was notable for its clean lines and a command of light similar to that of his contemporary Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.

They found it in exceptional condition, its canvas, stretchers and frame all original. It just required a thorough cleaning, the removal of a discolored varnish layer (not applied by the artist) and a few fill-ins here and there of small spots where the paint had flaked off over the years. After 65 hours of conservation work over the course of weeks, the beautiful portrait was ready for primetime.

The University of Bristol team discovered the objects in the garden of the Vicarage adjacent to the church and were able to date by them precisely to the winter of 873-4, thanks to the application of cutting edge technology to retest bones from a mass grave found a few feet from the new dig site in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists had long suspected that there might be a Viking camp there because it\u2019s in <em>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em>: The Great Army \u201cmoved from Lindsey to Repton and there took winter quarters\u201d in 873. They relieved the King of Mercia, Burghred, of his heavy crown and took his kingdom. They let him keep his head, at least; he was simply expelled from Mercia. A location on the River Trent seemed likely. River access is probably one the main reasons they moved to Repton and set up a camp for the winter in the first place; the presence of a large and wealthy monastery on the banks of the Trent that contained the tombs and mortal remains of several Mercian kings was another good incentive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Arrowhead.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49685\" height=\"69\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Arrowhead-150x69.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Arrowhead-150x69.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Arrowhead-200x92.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Arrowhead-768x355.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Arrowhead-430x199.jpg 430w\" title=\"Viking arrowhead unearthed at Repton vicarage dig. Photo by Cat Jarman.\" width=\"150\"/></a>In 1975, archaeologists excavating near the church on the banks of the Trent for the Viking camp site referred to in <em>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> thought they\u2019d found what they had been seeking. They unearthed the remains of a medieval D-shaped enclosure built after the monastery. Dig co-leaders Professor Martin Biddle and Birthe Kj\u00f8lbye-Biddle thought the enclosure and artifacts indicated this was indeed the Repton Viking Camp. The only problem was finding hard evidence of it. For a Viking camp, it was uncharacteristically tiny at about 1.5 hectares in surface area. Other Great Army camps are far larger, like the one at Torksey which is 26 hectares in area.</p>\n<p>Additional archaeological explorations of the site in the 1980s made another major discovery: a mound containing a mass charnel grave with the remains of more than 300 people. Researchers believed them to be Vikings killed in battle, but radiocarbon testing dated the remains in the 7th or 8th centuries, so at least a century too early to be part of the Great Army.</p>\n<p>In pursuit of fresh information regarding the size of the camp, University of Bristol doctoral candidate Cat Jarman and Professor Mark Horton of the University\u2019s Department of Anthropology and Archaeology picked a location on the west side of the enclosure and just outside of the boundary to see if there were other structures or other evidence of Viking occupation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Geophysics, including ground penetrating radar, revealed structures including paths and possible temporary buildings.</p>\n<p>Excavations showed these to be gravel platforms that may have held ephemeral timber structures or tents with deposits including fragments of Saxon millstones and a cross fragment from the monastery.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/axe-fragment.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49684\" height=\"143\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/axe-fragment-150x143.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/axe-fragment-150x143.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/axe-fragment-200x191.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/axe-fragment-768x733.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/axe-fragment-430x411.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fragment of a Viking battle axe found at Repton dig. Photo by Cat Jarman.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Associated were broken pieces of weaponry, including fragments of a battle-axes and arrows, and evidence for metal working. Also found were substantial numbers of nails, two of which had roves, the particular feature of Viking ship nails, as well as several lead gaming pieces. These are of a type that has been found in large numbers at the camp in Torksey and appear to be specifically connected to the early Viking armies.  </p>\n<p>Cat Jarman \u2026 said: \u201cOur dig shows there was a lot more to the Viking Camp at Repton than what we may have thought in the past. It covered a much larger area than was once presumed \u2013 at least the area of the earlier monastery \u2013 and we are now starting to understand the wide range of activities that toonok place in these camps.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>As significant as they are, artifacts and structural remains alone could not provide archaeologist with the date evidence they needed. It was the bones from the charnel mound, found a few yards north of the most recent excavation, that stepped up to the plate. It\u2019s not the 1980s anymore, and radiocarbon dating technology is more advanced and precise today than it was then. It also requires far smaller samples. We also have stable isotope analysis now which allows researchers to determine from levels of certain isotopes in the teeth where a person was born and raised, what kind of food he or she ate and more.</p>\n<p>Jarman\u2019s latest and greatest radiocarbon dating and isotope analysis results found that not only are the bones 9th century, but they died in the winter of 873-4, just when <em>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> the Vikings set up camp in Repton. They also found a direct connection between the remains of the workshop and the charnel mound.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The remains were placed in a deliberately damaged Saxon building along with Viking weapons and artefacts.</p>\n<p>The building also contained evidence of use as a workshop by the Vikings before it was converted into a charnel house.</p>\n<p>The Bristol team located a path linking their workshop area and the charnel house, further strengthening the link between the two. </p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Repton Viking camp is larger, older than realized\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49681\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49681#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-49687\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49687\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to LoC acquires, digitizes rare Mesoamerican map\">LoC acquires, digitizes rare Mesoamerican map</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, November 25th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mapa-de-Ecatepec-Huitziltepec.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-49688\" height=\"247\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mapa-de-Ecatepec-Huitziltepec-200x247.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mapa-de-Ecatepec-Huitziltepec-200x247.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mapa-de-Ecatepec-Huitziltepec-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mapa-de-Ecatepec-Huitziltepec-768x947.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mapa-de-Ecatepec-Huitziltepec-430x530.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Codex Quetzalecatzin, aka Mapa de Ecatepec-Huitziltepec, 1593. Photo courtesy the Library of Congress. \" width=\"200\"/></a>The Library of Congress has <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-155/?loclr=ealn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquired an extremely rare manuscript map</a> created by the Nahuatl people of Mexico in 1593. The Codex Quetzalecatzin, also known as the Mapa de Ecatepec-Huitziltepec, is one of very few manuscripts by indigenous Mesoamericans survive unburned, largely because it wasn\u2019t part of the immense literary patrimony of pre-Hispanic cultures that was considered \u201cdemonic\u201d because of its hieroglyphics, but rather the product of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48698\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Relaciones Geogr\u00e1ficas</a>, an extensive mapping project of colonial Spanish America ordered by King Philip II the late 16th century. Surveys sent to colonial authorities in every territory had to be filled in with a range of demographic, geographic, topographic and cartographic information, complete with an accurate and to-scale map of the area. The maps and much of the information on them were made by indigenous people based on local knowledge. </p>\n<p>The codex maps southern Puebla from Ecatepec, today a suburb of Mexico City to the church of Santa Cruz Huitziltepec and across the provincial border into northern Oaxaca. It\u2019s drawn in iron gall ink and painted in watercolors on paper. It is rich with hieroglyphics, colorful and compelling drawings and text labelling people and locations in Spanish and in romanized Nahuatl. While we don\u2019t know the name of the artist/s and writers who made the Codex Quetzalecatzin, it does include unique geneaological information about an important local family \u2014 several generations of the Nahuatl \u201cde Leon\u201d family from 1480 through 1593 \u2014 and the interweaving of indigenous and Spanish cultures in the century after Christopher Columbus.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]he Librarian stated: \u201cThe acquisition of the map, because of its relevance to the early history of the European contact with the indigenous people of America, makes an important addition to the early American treasures at the Library of Congress, including the Oztoticpac Lands Map and the Huexotzinco Codex. It\u2019s a rare document of world history and American history in general.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>As with many Nahua, indigenous group, manuscript maps of the period, the Codex Quetzalecatzin depicts the local community at an important point in its history and the iconography that makes up the map reflects some Spanish influence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe codex shows graphically the kinds of cultural interactions taking place at an important moment in American history,\u201d said John Hessler, curator of the Jay I. Kislak Collection for the archaeology of the early Americas of the Library of Congress. \u201cIn a sense, we see the birth of what would be the start of what we would come to know as the Americas.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hessler added: \u201cThe codex relates to the extent of land ownership and properties of the family line known as \u201cde Leon,\u201d most of the members of which are portrayed on the manuscript. With Aztec stylized graphics, the map illustrates the family\u2019s genealogy and its descent from Quetzalecatzin, who in 1480 was the major political leader of the region. It also shows churches, some Spanish place names and images suggesting a community adapting to Spanish law and rule.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the codex, certain features that point to indigenous authorship include pre-Hispanic stylistics, such as symbols for rivers, roads and pathways, and hieroglyphic writing. The marginal notations with alphabetic writing utilizing the Latin alphabet and the names of some of the indigenous elites, such as \u201cdon Alonso\u201d and \u201cdon Matheo,\u201d are clues to its colonial era composition. This is evidence that some indigenous people enjoyed the Spanish title \u201cdon\u201d and had been baptized with Christian names.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The LoC has digitized the map and uploaded it to its website, which in case you haven\u2019t seen it yet is one of the greatest photographic archives on the Internet and has been for years, long before other institutions got on the bandwagon of making high-resolution images available online to the general public. It\u2019s so great, in fact, that I couldn\u2019t even upload the full image to this article because it\u2019s so gloriously gigantic my server can\u2019t handle it.

I have family history on my mind today, thanks in large part to my father taking a moment before we gorged on a wide selection of fine viands to note that the house had been in our family for 106 years and Thanksgiving had been celebrated in it that whole time. His mother grew up there and even when she got married and had kids of her own, they always went to her parents\u2019 house for TG. My father remembers fondly going every year as a child and youth when his grandmother hosted Thanksgiving dinner. Now that my parents live there, they have carried on the century-old tradition with great verve. Thanksgiving is my mother\u2019s favorite holiday and they make a real production out of it every year. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Fast-Young-Woman.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49669\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Fast-Young-Woman-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Fast-Young-Woman-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Fast-Young-Woman-200x291.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Fast-Young-Woman-768x1116.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Fast-Young-Woman-430x625.jpg 430w\" title=\"&quot;The Fast Young Woman,&quot; illustration in The Beauties of Bloomerism by Deborah Dreadnought (pseudonym).

She was tough as nails but smiled constantly, always had a twinkle in her eye and a funny story for her great-grandkids. She also had a cast iron hand-pump that was the sole source of water inside the house. I was fascinated by it because it seemed like something in a play or on <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, totally outside my experience and oh man the water was so, so cold. And rusty. She washed in it every day, bless her bulletproof hide. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoking-not-allowed-here.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49668\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoking-not-allowed-here-133x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoking-not-allowed-here-133x150.jpg 133w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoking-not-allowed-here-200x225.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoking-not-allowed-here-768x865.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoking-not-allowed-here-430x484.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoking-not-allowed-here.jpg 1364w\" title='\"Smoking not allowed here.\" Stereoscopic photo of man pointing out the No Smoking sign to a woman in trousers smoking a cigarette.

The chariots date to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.) and one of them in particular is an exceptional example of a luxurious vehicle with all the bells and whistles of the era. It\u2019s huge, 2.56 meters (about 8\u20195\u2033) long and 1.66 meters (about 5\u20195\u2033) wide, and was elegantly appointed with bronze and bone decorations. The chariot has set a new record as the largest ancient horse-drawn vehicle discovered in Xinzheng City, which is saying something because more than 3,000 tombs have been unearthed in the area, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12651\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">including chariot and horse burials</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Scientists believe the tomb may have belonged to a noble family of the Zheng state (806\u2013375 BC), which was a vassal kingdom that governed this part of central China during the Zhou dynasty (1100\u2013221 BC). [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The leader of the dig, Ma Juncai, told Xinhua that no written records have so far been uncovered at the site, making it unclear who the burial pit belonged to, but archaeologists think it likely to have been the funeral site for a Zheng lord.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The site was first excavated in 2001. Two pits were revealed by the dig back then, but work was interrupted for 16 years until archaeologists were finally able to return to the location and pick up where they left off in February 2017. Over the nine months they\u2019ve been excavating, archaeologists have unearthed the skeletal remains of more than 90 horses in addition to the four chariots. Pit 3 is the largest of the three tombs, and boy did they need the space. Dig leader and Henan Province Institute of Cultural Relics and Archeology archaeologist Ma Juncai estimates there are at least 100 horses buried here, but there could well be more. She believes there are more chariots yet to be unearthed as well.</p>\n<p>A number of bronze artifacts have also been discovered in Pit 3. Archaeologists hope a thorough study of the bronze pieces will shed new light on the technological prowess and manufacturing methods of the period. They also hope the bronze artifacts might reveal more information about who was buried in the tomb, their social status and fill in some blanks about Zheng-era funerary practices.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Archaeologist-excavates-No.-3-Horse-and-Chariot-pit.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-49658\" height=\"287\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Archaeologist-excavates-No.-3-Horse-and-Chariot-pit-430x287.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Archaeologist-excavates-No.-3-Horse-and-Chariot-pit-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Archaeologist-excavates-No.-3-Horse-and-Chariot-pit-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Archaeologist-excavates-No.-3-Horse-and-Chariot-pit-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Archaeologist-excavates-No.-3-Horse-and-Chariot-pit-768x513.jpg 768w\" title=\"Ma Juncai excavates dismanted chariot in Pit 3.

Photo courtesy Sotheby's.\" width=\"200\"/></a>In a long, eventful life filled with accomplishments, John Quincy Adams often gets the credit for the one thing he didn\u2019t do: being the first President of the United States to be photographed. That record goes to William Henry Harrison, poor sod, who had his picture taken around the time of his inauguration in 1841. Thirty-one days later, he was dead of a fever. (Legend has it he delivered his interminably long inaugural address without a coat thereby \u201ccatching cold\u201d which developed into pneumonia and killed him. Now we know that the weather cannot infect you with disease \u2014 pathogenic microorganisms do that job \u2014 but it makes a good story so it has lingered as the dominant account of how the shortest presidential term of office came to such an abrupt end.) Adams was the second resident of the White House to photographed, albeit many years after his first and only term as President. It was in 1842 and only reprints and copies of that image and the Harrison portrait are known to survive today. The originals are lost.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why there was so much excitement <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48448\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earlier this year</a> when the news broke that an original daguerreotype of Adams taken by photographer Philip Haas at his studio in Washington, D.C. in 1843 emerged from the obscurity of attic clutter to the bright lights of Sotheby\u2019s. It was the earliest known surviving original photographic portrait of a US president. Bidding was not surprisingly fierce and there was much rejoicing in the history nerddom when the National Portrait Gallery announced a few days after the auction that they <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49054\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">had placed the victorious bid</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/John-Quincy-Adams-daguerreotype-1846.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49070\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/John-Quincy-Adams-daguerreotype-1846-121x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/John-Quincy-Adams-daguerreotype-1846-121x150.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/John-Quincy-Adams-daguerreotype-1846-200x249.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/John-Quincy-Adams-daguerreotype-1846-768x955.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/John-Quincy-Adams-daguerreotype-1846-430x535.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/John-Quincy-Adams-daguerreotype-1846.jpg 965w\" title=\"Daguerreotype, portrait of President John Quincy Adams, 1846. Photographer unknown. National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Archives, History Division.\" width=\"121\"/></a>You wouldn\u2019t know from how rare these original plates are, but as it turns out John Quincy Adams was a bit of a camera whore (said in reverent awe, Mr. President\u2019s ghost, not disrespect). Louis Daguerre presented his new technology to the public in 1839, so when Adams sat for his first portrait in 1842, the process was still in its infancy. In March of 1843, he had another portrait taken, his first by Philip Haas. Then he went back Haas\u2019 shop a week later to have the portrait redone because none of the ones from the first session came out right. His diary entries on those dates reveal his fascination with the \u201ccamera obscura\u201d device and how it worked.</p>\n<p>Getting his picture taken by top society photographers became a regular thing for John Quincy. In September of 1842, six months <em>before</em> he first visited Philip Haas, he sat for photographer John Plumbe at his Boston gallery, then again at Plumbe\u2019s studio in D.C. three more times all in 1846. The second of these four sessions took place on February 14th, 1846. The former President <a href=\"http://www.masshist.org/jqadiaries/php/popup?id=jqad45_427\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted in his diary</a> that he went to \u201cPlumbe\u2019s Daguerreotype office\u201d where they took two shots of him: \u201ca full face and a profile, both quite successful.\u201d</p>\n<p>The reference in Adams\u2019 diary was the only evidence of the existence of the \u201cquite successful\u201d profile picture by John Plumbe. If it was published, printed, reproduced or in another way disseminated we don\u2019t know about it. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Quincy-Adams-1846.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49642\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Quincy-Adams-1846-128x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Quincy-Adams-1846-128x150.jpg 128w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Quincy-Adams-1846-200x235.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Quincy-Adams-1846-768x903.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/John-Quincy-Adams-1846-430x505.jpg 430w\" title=\"John Quincy Adams photographic portrait by John Plumbe, 1846.

It was to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory where the first time ever, <a href=\"https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2017/november/mummy-portrait-research-roman-egyptian/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a mummy was scanned by a particle accelerator</a>. The mummy was donated years ago to the Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary at Northwestern University by the Hibbard family, wealthy patrons who had funded archaeological digs in Egypt in the early 20th century and received the mummy as a gift (goes the story). They gave this mummy, the remains of a little girl just five years old at the time of her death in the late 1st century A.D., with a portrait of her over her face as if she were peering through the bandages wrapped around her body. It\u2019s that portrait that captured researcher\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p>The encaustic-on-wood panel paintings preserved in pristine color and detail by the dry desert heat of Egypt are so personal, evocative and haunting that they\u2019ve been a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44320\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hot-ticket item</a> for wide sale and distribution in the shady antiquities trade since the first ones were found in the 17th century. Today the mummy portraits number about 900, most of them unearthed from the Faiyum necropolis southwest of Cairo, as was the little girl whose remains were discovered in Hawara at the entrance to the Faiyum oasis. The Faiyum portraits are the largest assemblage of ancient panel paintings still in existence today.</p>\n<p>Only 100 of them are still intact and attached to the mummies they depict so expertly. The Hibbard mummy is part of an elite cadre, therefore. And yet, nobody in the archaeological department or on the staff of Northwestern\u2019s Block Museum of Art had any idea she existed. She just hung out at the Seminary for a century, uncommented upon, until museum curator Essi R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 saw her in person. With the curatorial team already in the process of collecting mummy portraits for an upcoming exhibition <em>Paint the Eyes Softer: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt</em> (ie, Faiyum), R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 took advantage of the unbelievably rare opportunity to add the girl\u2019s mummy to the portraits going on display.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-49748\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Portrait-mummy-of-a-girl-late-1st-century-A.D.-Garrett-Evangelical-Theological-Seminary-Evanston-Illinois.-Photo-courtesy-Northwestern-University.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait mummy of a girl, late 1st century A.D.

Painted with pigment and sealed with beeswax, the girl is shown with her hair is tied at the nape of her neck and wearing a red tunic with gold jewelry. Because of her secure bindings, there was no way for researchers to study her insides without causing damage, but now that they had a real matched pair, the bones still safely wrapped in their original bandages and the intact portrait above them, researchers wanted to examine both the human and her representation with the best technology at their disposal. </p>\n<p>In August they took the mummy to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where she was given a CT scan. This provided the team with a 3D map of the mummy\u2019s inside and confirmed she was about five years old when she died. On Monday they considerably upped the ante and took her to the Argonne National Laboratory in Evanston to see what the immense light power of X-ray scattering (the technology that revealed the contents of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39264\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that medallion box from the French crypt</a> so clearly I heard my own jaw drop when I first saw the video) could tell us about her. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIntact portrait mummies are exceedingly rare, and to have one here on campus was revelatory for the class and exhibition,\u201d said Marc Walton, a research professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern\u2019s McCormick School of Engineering. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our undergraduate students \u2014 and for me \u2014 to work at understanding the whole object that is this girl mummy,\u201d Walton said. \u201cToday\u2019s powerful analytical tools allow us to nondestructively do the archaeology scientists couldn\u2019t do 100 years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>The synchrotron experiment at Argonne is a modern-day version of 19th-century England\u2019s \u201cmummy unwrapping\u201d parties, Walton said. The Northwestern team collaborated with scientists at Argonne and used the extremely brilliant high-energy synchrotron X-rays produced by Argonne\u2019s Advanced Photon Source to probe the materials and objects inside the mummy, while leaving the mummy and her wrappings intact.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom a medical research perspective, I am interested in what we can learn about her bone tissue,\u201d Stock said. \u201cWe also are investigating a scarab-shaped object, her teeth and what look like wires near the mummy\u2019s head and feet.\u201d[\u2026]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Stuart-Stock-of-Northwestern-University-and-Rachel-Sabino-of-The-Art-Institute-of-Chicago-discuss-the-experiment.-Photo-by-Jim-Prisching..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-49746\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Stuart-Stock-of-Northwestern-University-and-Rachel-Sabino-of-The-Art-Institute-of-Chicago-discuss-the-experiment.-Photo-by-Jim-Prisching.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Stuart-Stock-of-Northwestern-University-and-Rachel-Sabino-of-The-Art-Institute-of-Chicago-discuss-the-experiment.-Photo-by-Jim-Prisching.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Stuart-Stock-of-Northwestern-University-and-Rachel-Sabino-of-The-Art-Institute-of-Chicago-discuss-the-experiment.-Photo-by-Jim-Prisching.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Stuart-Stock-of-Northwestern-University-and-Rachel-Sabino-of-The-Art-Institute-of-Chicago-discuss-the-experiment.-Photo-by-Jim-Prisching.-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Stuart-Stock-of-Northwestern-University-and-Rachel-Sabino-of-The-Art-Institute-of-Chicago-discuss-the-experiment.-Photo-by-Jim-Prisching.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Stuart Stock of Northwestern University and Rachel Sabino of The Art Institute of Chicago discuss the experiment. Photo by Jim Prisching.\" width=\"200\"/></a>At the Advanced Photon Source, Stock and his team shined the pencil-shaped X-ray beam (about twice the diameter of a human hair) on areas of high-density in the mummy that were identified by the CT scan. They now will use the X-ray diffraction patterns as \u201cfingerprints\u201d to identify each crystalline material. For example, is the black rounded object seen on the CT scan a gold object or a rock?</p>\n<p>The findings from the synchrotron experiment, CT scan and other scientific analyses and studies of history conducted by the students will help researchers and historians better understand the context in which the Garrett mummy was excavated in 1911 as well as Roman-period mummification practices. Also, conservators will use the information to best preserve the mummy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re basically able to go back to an excavation that happened more than 100 years ago and reconstruct it with our contemporary analysis techniques,\u201d Walton said. \u201cAll the information we find will help us enrich the entire historic context of this young girl mummy and the Roman period in Egypt.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Paint the Eyes Softer: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt</em> opens at the Block Museum of Art on January 13th and runs through April 22nd, 2018.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"A portrait mummy and a particle accelerator walk into a bar\u2026\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49744\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>"}

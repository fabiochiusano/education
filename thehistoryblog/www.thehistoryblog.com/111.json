The Narshykin family had bought the palace in 1799 and lived there until 1917 when the fled the country and the Bolsheviks on the double. They left behind many valuable objects which were transferred State Hermitage Museum in 1920.  \n But those were just the pieces that were easy to find. Before they left Russia with their portable wealth, the family carefully wrapped their antique silver and stashed it in a hidey hole between the second and third floors of the palace. It was so effective a hiding place that it wasn\u2019t even found when the palace was extensively renovated in the 1960s. It took a three-year project of re-engineering and restoration that began in 2009 to break through a brick wall and reveal the secret room crammed with cases full of treasure. \n Apparently some of the crew tried to take a cut of the loot, hiding it away before the construction company alerted the authorities to the find, but they weren\u2019t up to the job the Narshykin\u2019s had done so thoroughly before them and the police found the pieces when they searched the building. \n The Naryshkin family was one of the most important in Tsarist Russia going back hundreds of years. It could trace its roots to the 15th century, but the family leapt to prominence when the beautiful Natalya Naryshkina (1651-1694) wed Tsar Alexis after his first wife died birthing their 13th child. Their son would become Peter the Great and she was rule as regent of Russia during his minority. Peter showered favor on his maternal family and the Naryshkin princes held high office in the government, military and court from then until the brutal end of the Russian monarchy. \n In July of 1918, Colonel Kiril Mihailovich Naryshkin, adjutant to White Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Nikolaevich Rozanov, was one of the first people to enter the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg. Rozanov and Naryshkin broke down the defensive palisade encircling the house and went in together. There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants. \n While there was some talk at the time the treasure was discovered that Narshykin descendants might make an ownership claim on the silver or of the finders getting 50% of its value, but surprising nobody the collection was declared historically significant and therefore property of the state. Since then it has been studied, inventoried and conserved and is now on public view in the Catherine Palace, the main building of the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum, which is also home to the reconstructed Amber Room. \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\"

There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54703\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

One of these robes is known as a <em>kaparamip</em>, meaning \u201cthin cloth,\u201d because it was made of cotton that was traded from the Japanese mainland. A decorative effect was achieved by using contrasting shades of trade cloth such as indigo that was then overlaid with a white cutout pattern appliqu\u00e9 and accented with red thread in a variety of embroidery stitches.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Andreas Marks, the Minneapolis Institute of Art\u2019s Mary Griggs Burke Curator of Japanese and Korean Art, what the biggest challenges were in conserving such a varied collection. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest challenges in conservation of textiles are the protection from bugs and mold. This is primarily achieved through a sanitized and climate-controlled environment that includes storage in archival boxes. Furthermore, textiles that enter our collection undergo a time period of freezing that would kill any live insects. That way we can prevent bugs from entering. Certain textiles will have to be stored flat and not folded as they are too brittle because of material and/or age.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Japanese textiles are currently undergoing conservation and will go on full display in the fall of 2020.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-54519\" height=\"162\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-200x162.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-150x122.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-768x622.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front-430x348.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Siberian-salmon-skin-woman\u2019s-robe_front.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Siberian salmon-skin woman\u2019s robe (hukht), front; Salmon skin, sinew, cotton thread; appliqu\u00e9 and embroidery; The John R.

The watercolour over pencil work was painted by Pierre Pr\u00e9vost in 1815. As huge as this panorama is, it is just a fraction of what it was meant to be. It\u2019s a preparatory study for a panorama more than 100 feet wide.

The term was coined by artist Robert Barker in 1787 when he had the idea to create a 360\u00b0 view of a city in detailed perspective. Viewers would stand in the center of a custom-built rotunda and immerse themselves in the vista of a distant city. Barker built his first rotunda and panorama in 1793 and by 1800 they had taken off like wildfire. </p>\n<p>Pr\u00e9vost was one of the premiere artists of the form. His first panorama, View of Paris from the Tuileries, was created in 1799. Many others followed, including views of Amsterdam, Athens and Jerusalem. He went to London to make a panorama of the city in 1802 (also lost), during the brief break in the Napoleonic wars after the Piece of Amiens, and then returned after Waterloo in 1815 to create the view from Westminster Abbey of which this prep is all that remains. </p>\n<p>Painted from the bell tower of St Margaret\u2019s church, right next to Westminster Abbey, the view encompasses the Abbey, its graveyard, the Middlesex Guildhall (then only 10 years old), the medieval Houses of Parliament which would be destroyed in a catastrophic fire in 1834, St. James\u2019 Park, the Palace of Whitehall\u2019s Banqueting House, the future Trafalgar Square and the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Pr\u00e9vost captures not just London\u2019s architecture, but its lifeblood as well. There are street scenes of people going about their business \u2014 carts carrying goods, shops, a factory \u2014 and views of the bustling shipping trade on the Thames.</p>\n<p>The finished panorama was exhibited in a rotunda in Paris. That the preparatory drawing has survived is remarkable. Highly finished, detailed, scale sketches were necessary to create so enormous a finished painting, but only one other is known from the many panoramas in Pr\u00e9vost\u2019s oeuvre, a view of Constantinople now in the Louvre.</p>\n<p>It was recently rediscovered at sold at auction at Sotheby\u2019s on July 4th, 2018, for 250,000 ($330,000). The Museum of London was able to acquire it with the support of the Art Fund, the Aldama Foundation and several private donors. Since then it has been conserved by museum experts and is on display for the first time as of today.</p>\n<p>The photograph cannot do this work justice because it\u2019s so much wider than it is high, but thankfully the Museum of London has create a neat video that scrolls over the panorama with key sites labelled.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/324459518?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Panorama of London 20 feet wide goes on display\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54589\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54589#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54572\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54572\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Boston College tackified and neglected mascot is Meiji masterpiece\">Boston College tackified and neglected mascot is Meiji masterpiece</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, March 13th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54574\" height=\"249\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-200x249.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-200x249.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-121x150.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-768x955.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Attrib.-Suzuki-Ch\u014dkichi-Eagle-McMullen-Museum-Boston-College-430x535.jpg 430w\" title=\"Attrib.

The 340-pound bronze of an eagle taking flight (or landing) was donated to Boston College in 1954 by Gus Anderson, a gardener who had inherited it from the estate of collectors Larz and Isabel Weld Anderson (no relation) after the latter\u2019s death in 1948. The Andersons had acquired it in Japan during their 1897 honeymoon. They installed it in the Japanese garden of their palatial estate, Weld, in Brookline, Massachusetts, where it remains for five decades. When it moved to Boston College it was again placed outdoors, this time perched atop a 34-foot column in front of Gasson Hall. It was also gilded for some ungodly reason, possibly because the eagle is the mascot of the college\u2019s sports teams and their colors are maroon and gold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54576\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 71px) 100vw, 71px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-71x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-71x150.jpg 71w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-143x300.jpg 143w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-768x1614.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati-381x800.jpg 381w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cecilia-Beaux-Mrs.-Larz-Anderson-the-Society-of-the-Cincinnati.jpg 1565w\" title=\"Cecilia Beaux (1855\u20131942), Mrs. Larz Anderson, 1900\u201301.

It was removed from the column and disassembled into five component parts. Each of them was used to make a plaster cast from which a replica of the eagle was created. The replica was then put on top of the column and the original boxed up, each part in its own box, and stored in the studio where the casts had been made.</p>\n<p>It was broken down and unappreciated for a couple of decades until an artist who had traced its history alerted the college that they actually had something special there. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The university called in the local firm Rika Smith McNally &amp; Associates to conserve the work.</p>\n<p>A Meiji attribution was confirmed by an analysis by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

In 2014, the brand funded a \u20ac1.5 million restoration of the Spanish Steps. That was completed in 2016, and in a shocking development, there was \u20ac485,593 of that funding left when the job was done. Bulgari had agreed up front that any unused moneys would be relayed to another historical site in Rome among the countless number in dire need of care.</p>\n<p>Bulgari and city officials have been working out what to do with the remainder of the donation since last year. Last month Rome mayor Virginia Raggi announced that the Area Sacra of the Largo Argentina was the lucky winner, and that Bulgari had chipped in an addition \u20ac500,000 to make the site fully accessible to visitors. </p>\n<p>Attempted restorations to the Area Sacra are nothing new. The city has been at it off and on for a decade, starting a project when they\u2019ve scared up a few ducats to only to stop abruptly when the coffers are empty again. The result is a confused mixture of weedy and garbage-strewn ruins with stacks of unlabeled stones. It\u2019s a damn shame, and not so much because you can get a glimpse of part of the tufa foundations of the curia of Pompey\u2019s Theater. That\u2019s really more of a Julius Caesar-related marketing ploy. Yes, Caesar was stabbed to death in that general area. He walked up what is now the Via Arenula to the curia where Brutus, Cassius and the rest of the lean-and-hungry assemblage of assassins awaited him with concealed daggers. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Largo-di-Torre-Argentina.jpg\"><img alt=\"Circular Temple built by Quintus Lutatius Catulus in 101 B.C.

Even when it was intact the curia was a comparatively small bit at the end of a 100-column quadriporticus, dwarfed by the amphitheater at the other end which was kind of the point of the exercise as Rome\u2019s first permanent theater. </p>\n<p>The overall significance of the site, and the reason the curia was used for senatorial business, are the four Republican-era temples whose remains still stand in the Area Sacra. It is the largest surviving section of Republican architecture in Rome. They range in date from the 4th to the 2nd century B.C., and the parts of them that managed to cling to life after centuries of quarrying and overbuilding were rediscovered in the early 20th century during works to modernize Rome\u2019s infrastructure. Protective walls were built around the temple site and the piazza with its tram lines and wide roads was constructed with a big ol\u2019 Republican pit in the middle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments.jpg\"><img alt=\"Stacks of architectural remnants in the Area Sacra and overseer.\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-21123\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-200x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-200x128.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cat-surveys-historical-monuments-430x275.jpg 430w\" width=\"200\"/></a>Now that the Area Sacra of Largo Argentina has been selected as the recipient, concrete steps have to be taken to convert theoretical plans into practical plan of execution. Experts will need to study the site thoroughly, make specific architectural designs and invite bids from contractors for the new construction. None of that has happened yet. Right now, the preliminary plan is that the ruins will be secured, the randomly arranged architectural remains organized, two new walkways and an elevator will be installed to make the descent down the Republican level possible. The ambitious goal is for the project to be completed by mid-2021. We shall see.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the big question that leaps to everyone\u2019s mind, I\u2019m sure, is what is to become of the cats? <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53003\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">As an unabashed fan</a> of the Largo Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, naturally I had to reach out to the fine folks who run it to get the real scuttlebutt on the refurbishment plans and the impact they might have on the sanctuary. Silvia Zerenghi confirmed that the sanctuary was not in any danger. About a month ago their lawyers were called and reassured that the revitalization project would not displace them, that the sanctuary would remain undisturbed in its current location.</p>\n<p>So it seems the cats and their staff will be left alone, which is very much how they like it. All the same, the sanctuary is not resting on its laurels (getit?!). \u201cWe are always a little suspicious, of course,\u201d says Zerenghi. \u201cIt is the feline nature, I think, we have learned,\u201d and just like the adorable deadly predators it caters to, the sanctuary is fully prepared to hiss and bite should circumstances shift treacherously. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21109\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The last time they were threatened with eviction</a>, the sanctuary marshaled its supporters to call, email, blog and generally deluge the mayor, the Superintendence and the press with protests. All talk of eviction ceased and the status quo won the day. They\u2019re ready to turn on the floodgates again at a moment\u2019s notice. Clearly the lesson was learned thoroughly the first time which is why the government went out of its way to forestall any concerns the sanctuary might have before the news broke. Mess with the cat, you get the claws.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Bulgari funds Largo Argentina refurb; cats are cool with it\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54544\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54544#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54537\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54537\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Princess vs. Countess: a topless duel over flowers\">Princess vs. Countess: a topless duel over flowers</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, March 9th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>In August of 1892, a duel took place in Liechtenstein.

The National Gallery, London.\" width=\"106\"/></a>The precise nature of the disagreement has been lost in the mists of time. All we know is that Princess Pauline Metternich, granddaughter of Napoleonic-era Austrian statesman Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, and Countess Anastasia Kilmannsegg, wife of the Statthalter of Lower Austria, had conflicting visions of how the flowers should be arranged at the Viennese International Exhibition of Music and Theater of 1892. Both of the ladies were high society fixtures in Paris and Vienna of the late 19th century. Both of them volunteered for a number of charitable organizations and were active supporters of the arts. </p>\n<p>The Internationale Musik und Theaterwesenausstellung was <strong>the</strong> artistic event of fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna, and while little remembered today, its influence was enormous and has played a foundational role in the perception of musical culture extending to the present. Inspired by the madly popular trend for world fairs launched by the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations at the Crystal Palace in London in 1851, the Viennese International Exhibition was a showcase of the greatest music Europe\u2019s most musical city could offer and the first large-scale marketing blitz to monetize and promote that artistic output. It was the first and only world\u2019s fair ever to focus exclusively on music and theater, and the very idea of \u201cclassical music,\u201d defined as European music from the mid-16th century through the end of the 19th, was birthed there on May 7th, 1892. By the time the exhibition ended on October 9th, the notion was firmly established, as was the image of Vienna as the capital of European music.</p>\n<p>Princess Pauline and Countess Kilmannsegg held important volunteer positions at this once-in-a-lifetime event. The Princess served as Honorary President, the Countess as President of the Ladies Committee. It was the Princess\u2019 idea, in fact, the expand the purview of the festival to cover theater as well as music, and to make it international (in the Eurocentric sense) instead of a the original idea which was a far more modest exhibition dedicated to the history of Austrian music. Because of her operas like Ruggero Leoncavallo\u2019s <em>Pagliacci</em> and Pietro Mascagni\u2019s <em>Cavalleria Rusticana</em> were staged to great acclaim at the Exhibition. (Not in a single bill together, though. The classic CavPag pairing debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in New York a year later.)</p>\n<p>The Princess also founded the Flower Parade down the main street of the Prater, a tradition she began in 1886 that continues to this day, and she was described <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29343147/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in one paper</a> (before the duel) as \u201chaving inherited a courage which borders on insanity from her father, Count Sandor, who was famous for his hair-brained extravagances.\u201d So maybe that explains why whatever the Countess had to say about the flower arrangements at the International Exhibition so deeply appalled the Princess and why she was willing to take it to the point of bloodshed.</p>\n<p>Princess Pauline Metternich, then 56 years of age and so great a doyenne in Austrian society that she was held in far higher social regard than the Empress Elizabeth, challenged Countess Kilmannsegg to a duel. As dueling was illegal in Austria, they and their seconds Princess Schwarzenberg and Countess Kinsky respectively, went to Vaduz, capital of Liechtenstein, to let their rapiers do the talking.</p>\n<p>Presiding over the encounter was Baroness Lubinska, a Polish noblewoman who had been sent for from Warsaw to oversee the violence. The Baroness was a medical doctor, a rarity for women at that time, and rarer than that, she practiced Listerite principles. This was an important asset for someone who might have to field-dress rapier wounds. The Baroness had seen first-hand how easily infection could set in with even superficial cuts in battle because dirty clothes would be stabbed into the wound and make it fester, so she told the male footmen and coachman to turn around and ordered the dueling parties to strip to the waist.</p>\n<p>This was not to be a duel to the death. The aim was first blood only. Princess Metternich and Countess Kilmannsegg, both topless, picked up their rapiers and engaged. After a few exchanges, one received a small cut to the nose, the other one to the arm. Contemporary reports, sparse on detail, are inconsistent about which one of them took which blow. Either way, first blood had been drawn by Princess Metternich. She was declared the winner and fighting ceased. The doctor dressed their wounds and the seconds suggested the ladies embrace and kiss. They did so and thus ended the great Topless Flower Arrangement Duel of 1892. </p>\n<p>The encounter <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29343103/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">caused a sensation</a>. It became known as the Emancipated Duel and scenes of topless women swordfighting became very popular on stage, screen and in naughty postcards.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54540\" height=\"343\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-430x343.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-430x343.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel-200x159.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emancipated-Duel.jpg 600w\" title=\"Emancipated Duel postcard.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>EDIT: Darnit, too many smart people read this blog.

Written on vellum in the 15th century, the fragment was part of a manuscript of Book 1 of <em>The Canon of Medicine</em>, a five-volume overview of medical knowledge in the Islamic world written in 1025 by Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna in the Latinized version). The fragment is small, consisting of parts of descriptions of the physiology of the jaws, nose and back. It is an Irish translation of the Latin version of the text translated from the Arabic by Gerard of Cremona in the 13th century. This fragment is the only known example of Avicenna\u2019s <em>Canon</em> in Irish. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The \u2018Canon of Medicine\u2019 was a great medical encyclopedia which, through translation into Latin (from which the Irish text itself is translated), achieved great popularity in Europe, where state-of-the-art medical theory and practice in medieval times had their origins in the Muslim world. The Irish fragment contains parts of the opening chapters on the physiology of the jaws, the nose and the back. The existence of this text was not hitherto known in Ireland.</p>\n<p>Medical scholarship in medieval Gaelic Ireland was on a par with that practised on the Continent and was the most outward-looking of all the native branches of learning. There is evidence of Irish scholars travelling to European medical schools, and bringing their learning back to the medical schools of Ireland.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A century later, a sheet of the manuscript was heavily trimmed along the top and sides, sheering off a significant portion of the text, and folded four times to be used as a bifolium cover of a printed book.

There are archaeological remains on the islands of the archipelago indicating human occupation going back 50,000 years, and Aboriginal petroglyphs abound. When the American whalers followed migrating herds of humpbacks to the Dampier Archipelago, the sailors left their marks over earlier indigenous rock art.</p>\n<p>We know from a few surviving ship logbooks that foreign whaling ships were plying their bloody trade in the area as early as 1801, six decades before the British established permanent colonies on the islands. The indigenous residents, the Yaburara people, were devastated by clashes with the colonists and their oral histories and knowledge of life before colonization were devastated along with them. Their rock art is an important and rare surviving cultural record. The mixture of earlier Yaburara petroglyphs with pre-colonization but post-contact inscriptions from whalers sheds light on little-known period of transition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Connecticut-inscription.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54464\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Connecticut-inscription-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Connecticut-inscription-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Connecticut-inscription-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Connecticut-inscription-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Connecticut-inscription-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Connecticut inscription. Photo courtesy the Centre for Rock Art Research + Management.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The inscriptions were found on Rosemary and West Lewis Islands. The one on Rosemary was left by sailors on the <em>Connecticut</em> in 1842, engraved on a basalt stone on a high ridgeline overlooking the coast. The site had a great view for whale watching, and the Aboriginal people who lived there for thousands of years left more than 265 rock art panels and more than 70 standing stones. Of more than 800 motifs recorded in the petroglyphs in this area, 81 of them are grids, vertical and horizontal lines intersecting like graph paper.</p>\n<p>Over this grid, the whalers engraved the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sailed August 12th<br/>\n1841<br/>\nAnd This Was Right? [written] August 18th 1842<br/>\nJACOB ANDERSON<br/>\nNew London<br/>\nIN THE SHP<br/>\nCONNECTICUT of<br/>\nNew London<br/>\ncpt D \u2013 CROKER<br/>\nCAPT D CROCKER<br/>\n12 mths out? 18[4]1 </p></blockquote>\n<p>The logbook of the <em>Connecticut</em> has not survived, but other records note that it was a 398-ton bark that departed New London with a crew of 26. Daniel Crocker, 33 years of age, was the captain. Jacob Anderson was an 18-year-old New Londoner of \u201cblack complexion.\u201d (Black men were common in whaling crews by the mid-19th century. Records show that by the end of the 1850s, one in six whalers were described as African-American.) It returned to New London on June 16th, 1843, carrying 1800 barrels of whale oil.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Delta-inscription.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54462\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Delta-inscription-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Delta-inscription-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Delta-inscription-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Delta-inscription-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Delta-inscription-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Delta inscription. Photo courtesy the Centre for Rock Art Research + Management.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The engravings by the crew of the <em>Delta</em> are much less formal. They consist of the name of the ship (repeated in different hands), the date, initials and the name J. Leek. They were found on the headland of West Lewis Island, again superimposed over pre-existing rock art. The logbook of this voyage has survived, so we know that the <em>Delta</em>, commanded by Captain David Weeks, was working the area in spring and summer of 1849, and that crews would go ashore often to collect water and wood, to hunt or enjoy \u201cliberty\u201d time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although there is no specific mention in any of the ships\u2019 logbooks of encounters with Aboriginal people in the Dampier Archipelago, the whalemen\u2019s inscriptions are significant, as \u201cthey are an indication of cultural contact at a time when very little colonial development had occurred in that part of Australia,\u201d says Jason Raup, a maritime archaeologist at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s \u201cfantastic\u201d to have found inscriptions from around the time of first contact with the islands\u2019 Yaburara people, agrees Peter Jeffries, a local elder and CEO of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation. He says a number of Aboriginal petroglyphs across the region may depict first contact. These include possible depictions of ships with sails and a sailor with a hat that has \u201cpointy ends,\u201d which was typical for naval dress of that period.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"American whaler rock art found in northwest Australia\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54460\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54460#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

The Narshykin family had bought the palace in 1799 and lived there until 1917 when the fled the country and the Bolsheviks on the double. They left behind many valuable objects which were transferred State Hermitage Museum in 1920. </p>\n<p>But those were just the pieces that were easy to find. Before they left Russia with their portable wealth, the family carefully wrapped their antique silver and stashed it in a hidey hole between the second and third floors of the palace. It was so effective a hiding place that it wasn\u2019t even found when the palace was extensively renovated in the 1960s. It took a three-year project of re-engineering and restoration that began in 2009 to break through a brick wall and reveal the secret room crammed with cases full of treasure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54704\" height=\"130\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-200x130.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-768x501.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-2-430x281.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

It could trace its roots to the 15th century, but the family leapt to prominence when the beautiful Natalya Naryshkina (1651-1694) wed Tsar Alexis after his first wife died birthing their 13th child. Their son would become Peter the Great and she was rule as regent of Russia during his minority. Peter showered favor on his maternal family and the Naryshkin princes held high office in the government, military and court from then until the brutal end of the Russian monarchy.</p>\n<p>In July of 1918, Colonel Kiril Mihailovich Naryshkin, adjutant to White Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Nikolaevich Rozanov, was one of the first people to enter the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg. Rozanov and Naryshkin broke down the defensive palisade encircling the house and went in together. There were survivors left to rescue, only evidence of the slaughter that had taken place six days earlier when the guards, knowing White Russian forces were almost upon them, executed the Tsar, his family and loyal attendants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54703\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Narshykin-silver-on-display-3-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Narshykin silver on display at the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum.

Since then it has been studied, inventoried and conserved and is now on public view in the Catherine Palace, the main building of the Tsarskoye Selo palace museum, which is also home to the reconstructed Amber Room.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Russian aristocratic silver goes on display\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54700\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>"}

Some of them have been on display consistently, but others will be seen by the public for the first time in Roman Mosaics Across the Empire, a new exhibition that opened on Wednesday at the Getty Villa. It features mosaics from provinces of the Roman Empire all over the Mediterranean \u2014 Italy, France, North Africa, Syria \u2014 done in different styles with different themes.  \n There\u2019s bear hunt from Baiae, outside of Naples, a head of Medusa surrounded by a glorious optical illusion-inducing geometrical design from Rome, an Orpheus surrounded by animals from Saint-Romain-en-Gal, France, a hare and two birds with geometric border panels from Antioch, Syria, a dramatic lion attacking an onager from Hadrumentum, modern-day Sousse, Tunisia. These are top quality artworks which adorned the homes of the very wealthy, public baths, even early Christian churches. \n The show also features a close look at the Getty Conservation Institute\u2019s work conserving the mosaics from the Imperial Roman heyday of Bulla Regia in Tunisia, North Africa. Known for its unique villas with subterranean floors \u2014 smart design in the heat of Tunisia \u2014 Bulla Regia had the greatest numbers of senators in Roman North Africa. It was an important city and its exquisite art and architecture testify to that importance. The GCI is working with the Institut National du Patrimoine of Tunisia and the World Monuments Fund to fully conserve one of the most important private residences in the city, the House of the Hunt, and to devise a plan for the long-term conservation and maintenance of the 400 mosaics that have already been unearthed at Bulla Regia over the past hundred years. Some of the works will be restored for display; others will be reburied. The idea is to make Bulla Regia a template for in situ conservation that can be applied to mosaics elsewhere in North Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in the Mediterranean.  \n Highlights of the site\u2019s breathtaking beauty can be seen in this video about the project: \n [youtube=https://youtu.be/LedaeWnjudE&w=430] \n The focus on best practices of situ conservation is in marked contrast to the Getty\u2019s past see-no-evil acquisition policy evinced in more than one of the mosaics on display in this exhibition. The Getty bought 23 panels of the Bear Hunt in 1972 from a Switzerland-based antiques dealer (surprise!) who told them only that it had been in an Italian collection. It was almost certainly illegally exported, but the museum looked the other way as it so often did. Recently Getty researchers attempted to trace the ownership history and there\u2019s a big gap between 1929 and 1972. The last known owner in 1929 was refused an export license because there were doubts as to whether he actually had legal title to the mosaic. Somewhere in those four decades, probably closer to 1972 than 1929, the mosaic was trafficked to Zurich and thence to the Getty. Four other panels from the original mosaic were eventually found by the Italian police and are now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples. \n The Getty is offering a number of lectures related to the exhibition. The Handling Session looks particularly compelling. \n How were mosaics created from pieces of stone and glass? Learn how these intricate architectural decorations were made in this multisensory handling session. Touch tools and materials similar to those used by ancient mosaicists, including tesserae, slaked lime, marble dust, and nippers.  \n Lucky Angelenos can take an early lunch and handle tesserae every Thursday and Friday from 11:00 AM-12:00 PM through September 9th. The exhibition runs until September 12th, 2016. For those of us who won\u2019t be able to see the mosaics live, the Getty has made a companion catalogue to the exhibition available free online: Roman Mosaics in the J. Paul Getty Museum. \n  \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\"

Known for its unique villas with subterranean floors \u2014 smart design in the heat of Tunisia \u2014 Bulla Regia had the greatest numbers of senators in Roman North Africa. It was an important city and its exquisite art and architecture testify to that importance. The GCI is working with the Institut National du Patrimoine of Tunisia and the World Monuments Fund to fully conserve one of the most important private residences in the city, the House of the Hunt, and to devise a plan for the long-term conservation and maintenance of the 400 mosaics that have already been unearthed at Bulla Regia over the past hundred years. Some of the works will be restored for display; others will be reburied. The idea is to make Bulla Regia a template for in situ conservation that can be applied to mosaics elsewhere in North Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in the Mediterranean. </p>\n<p>Highlights of the site\u2019s breathtaking beauty can be seen in this video about the project:</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/LedaeWnjudE&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The focus on best practices of situ conservation is in marked contrast to the Getty\u2019s past see-no-evil acquisition policy evinced in more than one of the mosaics on display in this exhibition. The Getty bought 23 panels of the <em>Bear Hunt</em> in 1972 from a Switzerland-based antiques dealer (surprise!) who told <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41459\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt-430x320.jpg 430w\" title=\"Panels of bear hunt mosaic, Baiae, Italy, 300-400 A.D.

It was almost certainly illegally exported, but the museum looked the other way <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/4744\" target=\"_blank\">as it so often did</a>. Recently Getty researchers attempted to trace the ownership history and there\u2019s a big gap between 1929 and 1972. The last known owner in 1929 was refused an export license because there were doubts as to whether he actually had legal title to the mosaic. Somewhere in those four decades, probably closer to 1972 than 1929, the mosaic was trafficked to Zurich and thence to the Getty. Four other panels from the original mosaic were eventually found by the Italian police and are now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples.</p>\n<p>The Getty is offering a number of lectures related to the exhibition. The Handling Session looks particularly compelling.</p>\n<blockquote><p>How were mosaics created from pieces of stone and glass? Learn how these intricate architectural decorations were made in this multisensory handling session. Touch tools and materials similar to those used by ancient mosaicists, including tesserae, slaked lime, marble dust, and nippers. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Lucky Angelenos can take an early lunch and handle tesserae every Thursday and Friday from 11:00 AM-12:00 PM through September 9th. The exhibition runs until September 12th, 2016. For those of us who won\u2019t be able to see the mosaics live, the Getty has made a companion catalogue to the exhibition available free online: <a href=\"www.getty.edu/publications/romanmosaics\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Roman Mosaics in the J.

The buyer is American and applied to the Culture Ministry for an export license. The Art Council\u2019s Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA) recommended that Culture Minister Ed Vaizey block export to give UK museums or collectors the opportunity to raise the purchase price and keep the artifact in the country.</p>\n<p>In 1315, Robert the Bruce granted the Abbey, with which he had a longstanding relationship and where he would be buried after his death, a royal charter. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cRobert, by the grace of God King of Scots, to all upright men in his whole land, greeting: Know ye that, for the safety of our own soul and that of our predecessors and successors, Kings of Scotland, we have given, granted, and by this our present Charter, have confirmed to God, the Blessed Mary the Virgin, the Church of the Holy Trinity, and St. Margaret, Queen of Dunfermlyn, and to the monks serving and to serve God for ever in the same, the right of patronage of the vicar Church of Inverkeithing, with the pertinents, as freely and quietly, fully, peacefully, and honourably as the predecessors formerly of Roger de Moubray, knight, who had forfeited it to us, have held and possessed the said right of patronage most freely, quietly, and honourably in all things, by rendering to us nothing therefore by only the suffrages of their prayers: Besides, we give and grant, and, by this our present charter, confirm to the foresaid monks, the whole of our new great Customs from all their lands within our kingdom, viz., the land of the burghs of Dunfermlyne, Kirkcaldy, Musselburgh, and Queensferry, and from all their other lands whatsoever; To also let the said monks have and use their own Koketa, according to the liberties of their regality, and our present concession in all their foresaid lands; and let this Koketa be acknowledged and admitted by all burgesses and our people, and foreign merchants throughout our whole kingdom, without obstruction from our chamberlains, or other servants of ours whatsoever for the time being, without petition from any other allocation of liberation, by finding for this our donation and concession of the said Customs for us and our successors, in honour of God and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the aforesaid Blessed Margaret in the Choir in front of her shrine, one wax candle solemnly lighted, continually and forever.

The two-part bronze seal, known as a Cokete Seal, was commissioned by the Bruce for the Abbey to use on customs documents. We know the exact date it was made because there\u2019s a record of it in the archives of Dunfermline Abbey: \u201cThe Cocquet Seal of the Regality Court of Dunfermline was engraven this year by sanction of King Robert the Bruce, by Chapter, dated at Scone, 10th July, 1322, along with letters patent to all who paid customs at Bruges, in Flanders, or elsewhere, notifying that wherever this Seal was in due form produced, it was to be recognised as the authority for collecting the customs granted to the Abbey by the King, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robert-the-Bruce-seal-matrix-pair.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41421\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robert-the-Bruce-seal-matrix-pair-146x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robert-the-Bruce-seal-matrix-pair-146x150.jpg 146w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robert-the-Bruce-seal-matrix-pair-200x205.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robert-the-Bruce-seal-matrix-pair-430x440.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robert-the-Bruce-seal-matrix-pair.jpg 1392w\" title=\"Robert the Bruce seal matrix and impressions pair.

The obverse seal matrix features an image of Saint Margaret, Queen consort of King Malcolm III of Scotland, founder and patron of Dunfermline Abbey, and is bordered with the Lombardic Latin legend \u201c+ S\u2019COKETE REGALITATIS.DE.

It\u2019s less than 1% funded at this point, and I suspect the money is more likely to be raised by the institution itself tapping its private donors and launching a public campaign like the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum did with <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34791\" target=\"_blank\">Wolsey\u2019s Angels</a>. The National Museum already has <a href=\"http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-180-001-739-C\" target=\"_blank\">an impression of the obverse</a> in its collection.

Just days before the end of the dig, the team found an oddly shaped sandstone slab embedded in the foundations of a temple wall. When they first unearthed a section of the stone, they weren\u2019t sure what it was. An unfinished column base or a recycled podium stand were suggested as possibilities, but when more of the slab was revealed, they saw the faint traces of an inscription and realized it was stele. It took the team several days of cautious excavation to find the inscription was an unusually long one, with multiple characters engraved along the edges of the stele.</p>\n<p>The slab weighs about 500 pounds and is almost four feet high and more than two feet wide. It dates to around the 6th century B.C. Archaeologists believe the stele was part of a sacred display in the first temple built on the site, an oval structure made of wood that bucchero pottery fragments date to after the early 7th century B.C. It was demolished around 2,500 years ago and new, larger temple was built with a stone podium and stone Tuscan Doric column bases. The old stele was reused as a foundation stone in the new temple.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Turning-the-stele.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-41404\" height=\"156\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Turning-the-stele-200x156.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Turning-the-stele-200x156.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Turning-the-stele-150x117.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Turning-the-stele-430x335.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Turning-the-stele.jpg 960w\" title=\"Turning the stele before transportation.

Two days after the stone was excavated, visiting Etruscan scholars watched as professional art and artifact movers recommended by the Tuscan Archaeological Superintendency lifted the stele from the site, strapped it to a sled and slowly lowered it down the wooded hillside to a waiting pickup truck. It was then transported to the laboratories of the Superintendency in Florence for conservation. </p>\n<p>Conservators are photographing and laser scanning the stele to reveal the full details of the inscription. The sandstone has been worn and chipped away and one side has been reddened, probably by fire. It will have to be cleaned before experts have a chance of deciphering the inscription, but they have counted more than 75 characters (letters and punctuation marks), an unusually long text for an Etruscan stele.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Detail-of-inscription.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-41405\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Detail-of-inscription-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Detail-of-inscription-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Detail-of-inscription-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Detail-of-inscription-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Detail-of-inscription.jpg 960w\" title=\"Detail of inscription before cleaning.

It was so costly that scribes often recycled pages from earlier books, removing the ink to create a blank sheet. In the early Middle Ages, the ink was washed off and over time the shadow of former writing reappeared like a pentimento in a painting. In the later Middle Ages, they used pumice powder to scrape the ink away for good. </p>\n<p>Volumes with the ghostly memories of previous texts still impressed in the pages are called palimpsests and researchers have been trying to read the vanished writing for centuries, either by careful sight-reading of whatever could be discerned or, starting in the 18th century, by the use of chemicals like tincture of gall which is high in tannic acid and badly damages the manuscript. Nowadays we have new options courtesy of spectral imaging technology.</p>\n<p>Researchers Gunther Martin of the University of Bern and Jana Gruskov\u00e1 of Comenius University in Bratislava enlisted the aid of Los Angeles-based organization the Early Manuscripts Electronic Library (EMEL) to examine a palimpsest in the Austrian National Library in Vienna using brand new multi-spectral technology. The text in question is the <em>Codex Vindobonensis historicus gr. 73</em>. The bound collection of 10th century ecclesiastical ordinances was acquired in the 16th century by Ogier de Busbecq, Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I\u2019s envoy to Constantinople, an avid manuscript collector who would bequeath his collection to the imperial library in Vienna. The parchment pages of the codex came from two different 11th century manuscripts, with 11 pages of monastic rules and prayers added in the 13th century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spectral-imaging-by-the-early-manuscripts-electronic-library.-processed-image-by-david-kelbe.-\u00a9-project-fwf-p24523-g19.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" by=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-41392\" codex=\"\" david=\"\" early=\"\" electronic=\"\" fwf=\"\" height=\"300\" image=\"\" kelbe.=\"\" library.=\"\" manuscripts=\"\" p24523-g19.\"=\"\" processed=\"\" project=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spectral-imaging-by-the-early-manuscripts-electronic-library.-processed-image-by-david-kelbe.-\u00a9-project-fwf-p24523-g19-198x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spectral-imaging-by-the-early-manuscripts-electronic-library.-processed-image-by-david-kelbe.-\u00a9-project-fwf-p24523-g19-198x300.jpg 198w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spectral-imaging-by-the-early-manuscripts-electronic-library.-processed-image-by-david-kelbe.-\u00a9-project-fwf-p24523-g19-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spectral-imaging-by-the-early-manuscripts-electronic-library.-processed-image-by-david-kelbe.-\u00a9-project-fwf-p24523-g19-430x651.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spectral-imaging-by-the-early-manuscripts-electronic-library.-processed-image-by-david-kelbe.-\u00a9-project-fwf-p24523-g19.jpg 800w\" the=\"\" title=\"Spectral imaging of the \" vindobonensis\"=\"\" width=\"198\" \u00a9=\"\"/></a>The presence of hidden text in the <em>Codex Vindobonensis</em> was discovered decades ago, but even under UV light the text was too faint to be read accurately. A few years ago the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) funded Martin and Gruskov\u00e1\u2019s research into palimpsests, allowing them to look behind the visible script of the codex with EMEL\u2019s multi-spectral technology. The pages were irradiated with lights of different wavelengths. Each type of light is absorbed into the parchment and ink to different degrees. Photographs capture the degrees of absorption and then computer software stitches the pictures together to create a detailed image of the hidden text.</p>\n<p>With this system, Martin and Gruskov\u00e1 were able to read pieces of the ancient Greek text underwriting the medieval and discovered a precious treasure: significant sections of <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/54092-goth-greek-battle-revealed-in-ancient-text.html\" target=\"_blank\">a history of Rome\u2019s 3rd century Gothic wars</a> written by 3rd century Athenian historian P. Herennius Dexippus. His history, the <em>Scythica</em> (Dexippus called the Goths Scythians), was only known from very fragmentary quotes in much later books. These hefty passages shed a whole new light on the wars of the mid-3rd century. </p>\n<p>Martin and Gruskov\u00e1 published several of the passages into German in 2014. Now Oxford University\u2019s Christopher Mallan and the University of Queensland\u2019s Caillan Davenport have <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=9995674\" target=\"_blank\">translated one of the fragments into English</a>. It\u2019s a splendid description of a battle at Thermopylae, probably the most famous battle site of the ancient world where in 480 B.C. King Leonidas\u2019 300 Spartan warriors and other Greek forces took their brave last stand against the far larger army of Persian King Xerxes. </p>\n<p>I find it a tremendous bummer when news stories about this kind of discovery do not include the full text, even when it\u2019s a bit dry or appeals only to the nerdiest history nerds, and in this case the lack of the complete quote in the press accounts is unforgivable because it\u2019s pure awesome. All killer, no filler. </p>\n<blockquote><p>[The Goths invaded Thra]ce and Macedonia, and plundered the entire countryside therein. And then, making an assault upon the city of the Thessalonians, they tried to capture it as a close-packed band. But since those on the walls defended themselves valiantly, warding off the battle columns with the assistance of many hands, and as none of the Scythians\u2019 hopes came to pass, they abandoned the siege. The prevailing opinion of the host was to make for Athens and Achaia, envisioning the gold and silver votive offerings and the many processional goods in the Greek sanctuaries: for they learned that the region was exceedingly wealthy in this respect. When the approach of the Scythians was reported to the Greeks, they gathered at Thermopylae, and set about <the of=\"\" task=\"\"> blocking them from the narrow passes there. Some carried small spears, other axes, others wooden pikes overlaid with bronze and with iron tips, or whatever each man could arm himself with. And when they came together, they completely fortified the perimeter wall and devoted themselves to its protection with haste. And it seemed that the area was otherwise very secure, since the road which led to Greece beyond the Gates was narrow and impracticable on account of the harsh terrain. For the Euboean Sea, at its greatest extent, stretches up to the flat lands near the mountains and makes them most difficult to access on account of the mud, and adjacent to these extends Mt Oeta [, which\u2026] on account of the closeness of the rocks, makes the place almost impassable for both infantry and cavalry. The generals elected for the entire war were proclaimed by the Greeks: first Marianus, who had been chosen previously by the emperor to govern Greece inside the Gates; in addition to him, Philostratus the Athenian, a man mighty in speech and thought; and also Dexippus, who was holding the chief office among the Boeotians for the fifth time. It seemed that the most prudent course was to encourage the men with a speech, and to recall the memory of their ancestors\u2019 valour, so that they would undertake the entire war with greater heart and not give up either during an extended period of watch, or during an attempt on the wall, if such an attempt were to take place at some point in time. When the men had gathered together, Marianus, who had been given the responsibility of addressing them on account of his status, spoke as follows: \u2018O Greeks, the occasion of our preservation for which you are assembled and the land in which you have been deployed are both truly fitting to evoke the memory of virtuous deeds. For your ancestors, fighting in this place in former times, did not let Greece down and deprive it of its free state, for they fought bravely in the Persian wars and in the conflict called the Lamian war, and when they put to flight Antiochos, the despot from Asia, at which time they were already working in partnership with the Romans who were then in command. So perhaps it may be good fortune, in accordance with the <em>daimonion</em>, that it has been allotted to the Greeks to do battle against the barbarians in this region (indeed your own principles of fighting the wars have turned out to be valid in the past). But you may take confidence in both your preparation for these events and the strength of the region \u2014 as a result of which, in previous attacks you seemed terrifying to the enemies. On account of these things future events do not appear to me not without hope, as to better\u2026</the></p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s the content and style of the writing that identifies it as the work of Dexippus. The <em>Scythica</em> was known to include several siege narratives and long speeches (likely fictionalized) by military leaders. The details about the engagement at Thermopylae \u2014 the geography of the site, the weapons of the militia, the names and origins of the generals \u2014 indicate this passage was part of a far larger narrative history of the period. No other history written in Greek during the 3rd century goes into such detail about events in the reign of the emperor Gallienus. Only <em>Scythica</em> fits the bill.</p>\n<p>There are other characteristics that mark it as Dexippus\u2019 history. The author uses no Roman terms, titles or Latinisms. The focus is on regional figures \u2014 Dexippus the Boeotian and Philostratus the Athenian \u2014 working in tandem with Roman authorities \u2014 Marianus \u2014 and on the valor and achievements of Greeks. Even the Roman general makes a point of admiring the history of Greeks\u2019 fight for freedom.</p>\n<p>On these points Mallan and Davenport agree with Martin and Gruskov\u00e1, but there are significant areas of disagreement as well. For example, Martin and Gruskov\u00e1 believe this battle happened during the Herulian invasions (267/8 A.D.), when the barbarian invaders defeated the Greeks at Thermopylae, but Mallan and Davenport make a strong case, in my opinion, for the battle taking place during an earlier Gothic invasion in around 262 A.D. The Herulian invasions were predominantly seaborne, but there\u2019s no mention of naval engagements in any of the newly discovered fragments, nor do any other sources on the Herulian invasions mention a battle at Thermopylae, which, given its iconic status, is an unlikely oversight. Also Thessaloniki was successfully besieged by the Heruli. This passage describes the Thessalonian defenders as victorious.</p>\n<p>Another area of disagreement is the identity of the Roman general Marianus. Martin and Gruskov\u00e1 identify him as <em>dux</em> Aurelius Marcianus, one of Gallienus\u2019 generals who fought against the Goths in the late 260s and conspired to kill the emperor in 268. Mallan and Davenport posit that he is a previously unknown general named Marianus, a senator and proconsul of the Roman province of Achaia. (In keeping with his rejection of Latinisms, Dexippus\u2019 reference to Achaia is a geographical region of Greece, not the Roman province. The Greeks called the Roman province \u201cGreece inside the Gates.\u201d) Since proconsuls had limited garrisons at their immediate disposal, he would have had to turn to local militias to help defend the pass.</p>\n<p>The reference to the generals being \u201celected\u201d suggests the defensive forces were assembled by a Greek political body, probably the Panhellenion which was the only body in the 3rd century that covered the regions of Greece represented by the three generals: Boeotia (Dexippus), Athens (Philostratus) and Marianus (Achaia). No other sources mention the Panhellenion appointing military leaders, but the invasion was an extraordinary circumstance which required a speedy military response.</p>\n<p>Mallan and Davenport therefore propose a new reconstruction of the Gothic invasion of the early 260s. In late 261 or early 262, the Goths invaded Greece and laid waste to the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia. They besieged Thessaloniki, but it was ably defended by the residents so they moved on to the Roman province of Achaia. The Greeks, likely through the Panhellenion, quickly organized a defense of the province under three generals with Marianus, Roman proconsul of Achaia, at the lead. The Goths invaded Achaia by late 262, early 263, but were turned back by Marianus and Greek militia at the pass of Thermopylae. They didn\u2019t leave empty-handed. On their way out they sacked the rich temples and sanctuaries of Greece before moving on to the Roman Asia province at the end of 263. The threat to Greece was over (for a few years). </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Another Battle of Thermopylae found in palimpsest\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41391\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41391#comments\">12 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-41372\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41372\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Concretions removed to reveal iron body of &lt;em&gt;Hunley&lt;/em&gt;\">Concretions removed to reveal iron body of <em>Hunley</em></a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, March 27th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41382\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"The iron hull of the H.

Hunley</em> has been revealed after 137 years in the salt water of Charleston Harbor, 13 years in a tank of cold fresh water and two years off and on in a sodium hydroxide solution. Conservators at Clemson University\u2019s Warren Lasch Conservation Center have been working to preserve the delicate vessel since it was raised in 2000. The long water bath was necessary to slowly stabilize the iron which would have cracked and corroded if exposed to oxygen after so many years underwater. The weak sodium hydroxide solution (99% water, 1% NaOH) helped leech salt out of the iron and soften the concretion layer. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-in-cold-fresh-water-bath-in-truss.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41388\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-in-cold-fresh-water-bath-in-truss-150x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-in-cold-fresh-water-bath-in-truss-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-in-cold-fresh-water-bath-in-truss-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-in-cold-fresh-water-bath-in-truss-430x278.jpg 430w\" title=\"H.

The concretion layer that coated the entire submarine, inside and out, was so thick, the original iron has been obscured since the <em>Hunley</em> was first raised from the harbor floor. Some areas of concretion were harder than the iron underneath them. In order for the sodium hydroxide treatment to leech the corrosive salt out of the iron skin effectively, the concretion had to be removed first. In May of 2014, the submarine was <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30415\" target=\"_blank\">immersed in sodium hydroxide</a> for the first time. That initial three-month soak was intended to loosen the concretions. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Conservators-working-on-concretionsJPG.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41386\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Conservators-working-on-concretionsJPG-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Conservators-working-on-concretionsJPG-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Conservators-working-on-concretionsJPG-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Conservators-working-on-concretionsJPG-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Conservators drill away at concretions.

The submarine <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23067\" target=\"_blank\">drove a spar-mounted torpedo</a> into the starboard stern of the Union warship and its payload of 135 pounds of gunpowder exploded, blowing a large hole in the side of the enemy vessel. While the hand-cranked submarine with its crew of eight men was very close to the explosion \u2014 the spar was only 16 feet long \u2014 the <em>Hunley</em> and its crew survived. They signalled the success of the mission with a blue magnesium light, as previously arranged, and then were never heard from or seen again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Front-hatch.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41373\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Front-hatch-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Front-hatch-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Front-hatch-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Front-hatch-430x283.jpg 430w\" title=\"Front hatch.

Bullet holes would have confirmed this report and would have explained why the vessel was too damaged to return to safety. One large hole was found, but it was the result of years of scouring by sand and salt before the submarine was covered by the sand on the ocean floor and kept relatively intact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Johanna-Rivera-Diaz-removes-concretion.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41381\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Johanna-Rivera-Diaz-removes-concretion-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Johanna-Rivera-Diaz-removes-concretion-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Johanna-Rivera-Diaz-removes-concretion-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Johanna-Rivera-Diaz-removes-concretion-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Conservator Johanna Rivera-Diaz removes concretion from interior.

It too is covered in concretions, and this workspace is even more cramped. The crew compartment is less than four feet in diameter. It\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll find one key piece of evidence that explains the fate of the <em>Hunley</em> in the interior. This part of the project is focused on what happened in the claustrophobic nightmare of that tiny iron cigar in the last moments of the crewmen\u2019s lives. Conservators hope to find artifacts \u2014 personal effects, uniform buttons, tools \u2014 that will help them piece together what happened to the <em>Hunley</em>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anytime an artifact is found, the scientists will have to stop scraping to map its location on a 3-D grid.</p>\n<p>Scafuri said that all these clues are probably all scientists will have to piece together the final moments of the first attack sub. Every piece of evidence suggests one thing and eventually that research will point to an answer for the biggest lingering question: why didn\u2019t the Hunley return after sinking the Housatonic.</p>\n<p>Between work on the interior, conservators are busy restoring pieces of the sub that were removed \u2014 rubber gaskets and glass deadlights, for instance. All those pieces will be replaced when the caustics treatment ends and the sub is ready for dry display.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s going to be a few years before the submarine is ready for permanent display in the open air. The sodium hydroxide soaks will continue for at least five years and possibly as many as seven more years. The solution must be replaced every three to four months even when all the concretion has been removed because it will get too salty to be effective. </p>\n<p>There are some excellent shots in this video by the <a href=\"http://hunley.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Friends of the Hunley</a> of the <em>Hunley</em> before and after the concretions were removed. It looks amazing.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/RsXW7UlCsCo&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Concretions removed to reveal iron body of Hunley\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41372\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41372#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-41312\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41312\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Gods and mortals from ancient Dion in New York\">Gods and mortals from ancient Dion in New York</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, March 26th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Zeus-Hypsistos_7815.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41356\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Zeus-Hypsistos_7815-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Zeus-Hypsistos_7815-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Zeus-Hypsistos_7815-200x264.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Zeus-Hypsistos_7815-430x568.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cult statue of Zeus Hypsistos, 2nd century AD.

It was a lot easier to carry animals to the base of the mountain than to climb its nearly 10,000-foot heights. The first known altar to Zeus Olympios was built in Dion in the 10th century B.C. </p>\n<p>The small town grew into a prominent city under the Macedonians who revered it as the center of their religion. In the late 5th century B.C., Macedonian King Archelaus I founded the Olympian Games there, a yearly festival of the arts and athletic contents in honor of Olympian Zeus and his daughters the Muses. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Relief-Stele-Depicting-Isis-as-Demeter_410.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41344\" height=\"139\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Relief-Stele-Depicting-Isis-as-Demeter_410-150x139.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Relief-Stele-Depicting-Isis-as-Demeter_410-150x139.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Relief-Stele-Depicting-Isis-as-Demeter_410-200x186.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Relief-Stele-Depicting-Isis-as-Demeter_410-430x400.jpg 430w\" title=\"Relief Stele Depicting Isis as Demeter with Dedicatory Inscription, second half of 3rd\u2013early 2nd century BC.

The kings of Macedon made sacrifices at the altar to ring in every new year (the end of September in the Macedonian calendar), celebrated their military victories and invoked the protection and support of Olympian Zeus before setting out on new adventures. Philip II of Macedon celebrated his successful siege and destruction of Olynthos in 348 B.C. at Dion. His son Alexander the Great sacrificed to the gods there before taking his conquering armies East. He also imported the worship of Isis from Egypt to Dion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hermaic-Stele-Portrait-of-Herennianus_5438.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41341\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hermaic-Stele-Portrait-of-Herennianus_5438-55x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hermaic-Stele-Portrait-of-Herennianus_5438-55x150.jpg 55w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hermaic-Stele-Portrait-of-Herennianus_5438-110x300.jpg 110w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hermaic-Stele-Portrait-of-Herennianus_5438-293x800.jpg 293w\" title=\"Hermaic Stele with a Portrait of Herennianus, late 2nd\u2013early 3rd century AD.

Octavian founded a colony there in 31 B.C., and later emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries lent it their support. In the waning days of the empire, Dion was still prominent as the seat of a bishopric. Bishops of Dion took part in important church synods (Serdike in 343 A.D. and Ephesos in 431 A.D.), but at the end of the 5th century the city fell to the armies of Ostrogoth King Theodoric the Great and it never recovered. It gradually lost importance and population due to a series of earthquakes and floods from the river Vaphyras. By the 10th century it was an abandoned ruin. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Slab-with-the-Imprint-of-Two-Feet_419.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41345\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Slab-with-the-Imprint-of-Two-Feet_419-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Slab-with-the-Imprint-of-Two-Feet_419-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Slab-with-the-Imprint-of-Two-Feet_419-200x259.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Slab-with-the-Imprint-of-Two-Feet_419-430x557.jpg 430w\" title=\"Slab with the Imprint of Two Feet and Dedicatory Inscription, Late 2nd\u20133rd century AD.

There was a 30-year lapse in archaeological exploration between 1931 and 1960. Since 1973, Dr. Dimitrios Pandermalis has led excavations at the site, returning every summer with a team of archaeologists, students and volunteers from the modern village to brave the oppressive heat and humidity. They have expanded the excavation area considerably to include the ancient sanctuaries, graveyards, tumulus burials and the town center. Spared development, reconstruction and the potentially destructive fumbling of early archaeologists, Dion has proved an archaeological treasure trove. Thanks to its wetlands environment at the base of the mountain between two rivers, Dion\u2019s remains have been well preserved by water and mud layers. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracelet-Lion-Head.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41335\" height=\"136\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracelet-Lion-Head-150x136.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracelet-Lion-Head-150x136.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracelet-Lion-Head-200x181.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bracelet-Lion-Head-430x389.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold bracelet with lion\u2019s head finials, late 3rd century BC.

There\u2019s a Hellenistic theater, a Great Baths complex, a partially preserved 2nd century A.D.

Archaeologists discovered a great many ancient artworks: sculptures, decorative elements from expensive furniture, and mosaics of exceptional quality. Among the most prized sculptures is a group of four seated men representing Epicurean philosophers, three students and one teacher identifiable by his bearded adulthood and the open scroll he holds. The heads of the students were recarved in the 3rd century AD to give them portrait features, possibly to make them look like members of the family who lived in the house at the time. Other artworks found in the house include a hauntingly beautiful portrait of Agrippina the Elder, mother of Nero, and a glorious 100 square meter floor mosaic in the banquet hall depicting the Epiphany of Dionysus. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mosaic_Epiphany-of-Dionysus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41320\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mosaic_Epiphany-of-Dionysus-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mosaic_Epiphany-of-Dionysus-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mosaic_Epiphany-of-Dionysus-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mosaic_Epiphany-of-Dionysus-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mosaic of the Epiphany of Dionysus, Late 2nd\u2013early 3rd century AD.

The villa being in ruins, there has been great concern about preserving the mosaic. The authorities built a custom addition to the museum to house the mosaic in ideal conservation conditions, but money was hard to come by. That changed last year when the Onassis Foundation funded the removal of the mosaic from the villa to the new building.

The fort is itself a replica, built on the site of the original Fort William Henry, a British outpost from the Seven Years\u2019 War. It was besieged by the French and their Indian allies in 1757 and was compelled to surrender when reinforcements were not forthcoming. Some of the surrendering prisoners were killed by Indian warriors disgruntled by the French prohibition that kept them from looting the defeated fort. It was widely publicized as a massacre at the time and figures as high as 1,500 slaughtered were bandied about in the immediate aftermath. The real number, modern historians believe, is more like 200 killed and wounded, about 7.5% of the prisoners. The siege of Fort William Henry played a central role in James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s <em>The Last of the Mohicans</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Hotel-by-Deloss-Barnum-1860s-1890s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41307\" height=\"73\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Hotel-by-Deloss-Barnum-1860s-1890s-150x73.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Hotel-by-Deloss-Barnum-1860s-1890s-150x73.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Hotel-by-Deloss-Barnum-1860s-1890s-200x98.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Hotel-by-Deloss-Barnum-1860s-1890s-430x211.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fort William Henry Hotel on the banks of Lake George.

To take advantage of the historical tourism market, the replica was constructed in 1954 as full-scale copy of the original. To lend it authenticity, the owners of the attraction wanted some genuine Colonial artillery. Among the 19 antiques were nine cannons which had been salvaged a few years earlier in the Florida Keys. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41308\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Museum-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Museum-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Museum-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fort-William-Henry-Museum-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fort William Henry Museum\" width=\"150\"/></a>Newspapers at the time of the sale noted the pieces were bought from treasure hunter Art McKee who had raised them from a wreck off the coast of Looe Key, a key named after the British warship HMS <em>Looe</em> which hit a reef in the area and sank in 1744. Named after the town of Looe, Cornwall, the ship only saw two years of service before its demise. The <em>Looe</em> was dispatched to protect the south Atlantic coast of America from Spanish incursions and interfere with Spanish shipping during a conflict that would later be blessed with one of the greatest names of all time: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Jenkins%27_Ear\" target=\"_blank\">the War of Jenkins\u2019 Ear</a>. On February 5th, 1744, the <em>Looe</em> struck a reef and was grounded. The captured Spanish merchant ship following her suffered the same fate. The crews were evacuated, all food stores that could be salvaged were salvaged and then both ships were burned.</p>\n<p>In 1951, the Smithsonian Institution sent an expedition to Looe Key to explore a reported shipwreck from which a few coins had been retrieved. At the time, not even the precise date of the ship was known and certainly not the name. The fact that the key was named after a British warship that had gone down off its coast had been lost in the mists of time. Metal, glass and porcelain artifacts had survived the conflagration. The team recovered large numbers of artifacts \u2014 among them iron ballast, shot, bolts, nails, rum bottles, Chinese porcelain fragments, earthenware, pipes, animal bones from the pickled meat stores, the eyepiece of a navigation instrument and one 2,000-pound cannon barrel. </p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t find a smoking gun, so to speak, that would immediately identify the ship, but they did find some clues. One of the 6-pound shots had an arrow on it, a mark indicating it was the property of the British royal family. The barrel was marked with a crowned rose, the insignia of Tudor and Stuart monarchs which was no longer used after Queen Anne\u2019s death 1714. The lifespan of an iron cannon on a ship was no more than 40 years, which gave researchers an outside date for the ship of 1754. Inside the barrel the team found the remains of a wooden tompion which indicated the ship had not gone down in battle but rather by accident or misadventure. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Liz-Zieschang-left-and-Claudia-Young-measuring-one-of-nine-mystery-cannons-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41301\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Liz-Zieschang-left-and-Claudia-Young-measuring-one-of-nine-mystery-cannons-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Liz-Zieschang-left-and-Claudia-Young-measuring-one-of-nine-mystery-cannons-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Liz-Zieschang-left-and-Claudia-Young-measuring-one-of-nine-mystery-cannons-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Liz-Zieschang-left-and-Claudia-Young-measuring-one-of-nine-mystery-cannons-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Liz Zieschang, left, and Claudia Young measuring one of nine mystery cannons at the Fort William Henry Museum in 2014.

Looking through the ship casualty lists for a British warship that sank between 1720 and 1750, was armed with both six and 12-pound cannons and was lost by accident, Peterson found an entry in Clowes <em>The Royal Navy</em> for \u201c1743 <em>Looe</em> 44 guns, Capt. Ashby Utting, Lost in America.\u201d He then confirmed that among those 44 guns were six and 12-pounders. Suddenly the name of the key made a new kind of sense, and it helped confirm that Peterson had identified the wreck.</p>\n<p>Looe Key is now part of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary so treasure hunters couldn\u2019t make a meal of its underwater historic sites today, but back then it was unprotected. Art McKee followed in the Smithsonian\u2019s footsteps. Once they were gone, he pulled up the heavy artillery they had left behind and sold it to the Fort William Henry Museum. At the time they were still marked with the crowned rose, a fact noted in articles about the acquisition. Exposure to more than 60 Adirondack winters has claimed the insignia, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/documentary-filmmaker-Peter-Pepe-left-and-maritime-archaeologist-Joseph-W.-Zarzynski-examine-a-cannon-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41300\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/documentary-filmmaker-Peter-Pepe-left-and-maritime-archaeologist-Joseph-W.-Zarzynski-examine-a-cannon-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/documentary-filmmaker-Peter-Pepe-left-and-maritime-archaeologist-Joseph-W.-Zarzynski-examine-a-cannon-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/documentary-filmmaker-Peter-Pepe-left-and-maritime-archaeologist-Joseph-W.-Zarzynski-examine-a-cannon-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/documentary-filmmaker-Peter-Pepe-left-and-maritime-archaeologist-Joseph-W.-Zarzynski-examine-a-cannon-at-the-Fort-William-Henry-Museum-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Documentary filmmaker Peter Pepe, left, and maritime archaeologist Joseph W.

The Shang was China\u2019s second dynasty and the oracle bones are the oldest surviving texts in the Chinese language. They are the main source historians have about Shang China and Bronze Age China in general, but were only recognized as the immense cultural patrimony they are in 1899. Antiquarian Wang Yirong found some oracle bones being sold in Peking as \u201cdragon bones\u201d which were ground into powder and used in traditional medicine to staunch a bleeding wound. He recognized they were engraved with ancient script. The oracle bones were dated to the Shang dynasty when the origin of the ones floating around in markets was discovered near the village of Xiaotun in Henan Province, the Shang capital.</p>\n<p>The late 19th, early 20th century was a turbulent time in China. Cultural patrimony issues were not governmental priorities and foreign scholars and collectors stepped into the void. One of them was Lionel Charles Hopkins, brother and biographer of the famous poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, a diplomat who went to China in 1874 and remained there until his retirement in 1908. He collected almost 900 oracle bones which he studied over the four decades of his retirement. He died in 1952 at the age of 98. Hopkins left his <a href=\"http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/oracle.html\" target=\"_blank\">oracle bone collection to Cambridge University</a>.</p>\n<p>Hopkins broke a lot of ground in the study of oracle bones, but he too was fooled by fakes. There were so many of them that for a couple of decades after their discovery, the authenticity of all of them were in question. It was only when excavations began in the late 1920s at Xiaotun that large numbers of oracle bones were confirmed to be part of the Shang royal archive. About 200,000 thousand bone fragments are known today, a quarter of which are inscribed. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41279\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-back-130x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-back-130x150.jpg 130w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-back-200x230.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-back-430x495.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-back.jpg 1399w\" title=\"Divination pits on the back of CUL 52. Image courtesy Cambridge University.\" width=\"130\"/></a>Diviners used the oracle bones to invoke the ancestors of the Shang dynasty royal family who were believed to know the future. They were also thought to have influence on future events. When a Shang royal wanted to know the outcome of a war, the success of a harvest, an impending natural disaster or anything else, they turned to diviners and their oracle bones. On the reverse of the bones diviners carved out divots known as divination pits. The pits were exposed to fire, creating vertical cracks with a short perpendicular crack halfway down on the obverse of the bone. The cracks were interpreted as answers to the diviners\u2019 questions and those questions were engraved next to the crack. The divination served double duty: predicting the future and securing the benign intervention of the ancestors. The inscriptions are invaluable records of Shang society, and can be of international import. One of the oracle bones in the Hopkins Collection is the <a href=\"http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/00cul1.html\" target=\"_blank\">oldest dated record of a lunar eclipse</a> known in the world.</p>\n<p>The texture of the bones and writing is important to historians, as are the divination pits and cracks. Within a couple of years of Wang Yirong\u2019s discovery, rubbings of the inscriptions were published in books and suddenly collectors were clamouring to buy oracle bones. As usually happens when there\u2019s an overwhelming demand for a finite material, unscrupulous dealers quickly produced as many forgeries as possible. Many oracle bones have both original engravings, pits and cracks, and forged text added to make a simple bone look fancier. The more text, the more expensive the artifact. Sorting out the genuine from the fraud requires careful examination of the bones, their inscriptions and cracks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41282\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3-59x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3-59x150.jpg 59w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3-118x300.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3-316x800.jpg 316w\" title=\"CUL 155. Inscriptions refer to a boar hunt using dogs. Image courtesy Cambridge University.\" width=\"59\"/></a>Since the earliest discoveries, the surface of oracle bones were captured with rubbings. In 1982, oracle bone expert Mme. Qi Wenxin visited the UK to make rubbings of all the bones in public and private collections. Cambridge\u2019s Hopkins Collection was one of her stops. These rubbings are not the kind you made on gravestones in 5th grade art class with a crayon and tracing paper. Mme. Qi\u2019s tools were a brush made of fine human hair, the finest quality Chinese black ink, very thin tissue-like paper, a piece of silk wrapped around natural cotton and a water infused with the herb baiji (Bletilla Rhizome). Baiji is used in traditional Chinese medicine to stop bleeding and reduce swelling, but infused in the rubbing water, it helps the paper adhere to the bone. If plain water was used, the paper would come off during rubbing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41281\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 54px) 100vw, 54px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3-back-54x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3-back-54x150.jpg 54w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Oracle-bone-3-back-109x300.jpg 109w\" title=\"Back of CUL 155. Image courtesy Cambridge University.\" width=\"54\"/></a>The side of the bone not being rubbed was fixed to the table with putty. Then the paper was placed on top and brushed with the baiji solution. Mme. Qi tapped the wet paper into the engraving by lightly hitting it with the human hair brush until every letter of the inscription showed through the paper. When the paper was dry, the silk-wrapped cotton was dabbed into the sticky ink and stippled on with care not to cake it on too thickly. Once the ink layer dried, another was applied. The process was repeated until the inscription becomes clear, a white negative against the inky black background. You can see Mme. Qi at work <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8fP3TVpdGMo\" target=\"_blank\">in this video</a>.</p>\n<p>Now the Cambridge University Library has taken the first step in establishing a new kind of archive. It has <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/world-first-as-3000-year-old-chinese-oracle-bones-go-3d\" target=\"_blank\">scanned the first of the 614 oracle bones in its collection in high resolution 3D</a>. As far as we know, it\u2019s the first oracle bone in the world to be 3D scanned. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The image brings into sharp focus not only the finely incised questions on the obverse of the bone, but also the divination pits engraved on the reverse and the scorch marks caused by the application of heat to create the cracks (which were interpreted as the answers from the spirit world). These can be seen more clearly than by looking at the actual object itself, and without the risk of damage by handling the original bone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once scanned, a precise replica of the bone was 3D printed so it can handled and examined by students and researchers who would otherwise not be allowed access to the originals for conservation purposes. If the 3D scanning trend catches on, there\u2019s another exciting possibility: that more of the hundreds of thousands of fragments may be pieced back together thanks to computer matching.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"320\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/3e3f56b59d27465d87daa3dc20f45449/embed\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; margin: 5px; color: #4A4A4A;\">\n<a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/3e3f56b59d27465d87daa3dc20f45449?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge UL Oracle Bone CUL.52 Hi Res</a><br/>\n    by <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/d.powlesland?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Dominic Powlesland</a><br/>\n    on <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchfab</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Chinese oracle bones: from rubbings to 3D scans\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41278\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41278#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-41255\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41255\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Viking hoard in Carolingian pot revealed\">Viking hoard in Carolingian pot revealed</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, March 23rd, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Carolingian-pot.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41272\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Carolingian-pot-136x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Carolingian-pot-136x150.jpg 136w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Carolingian-pot-200x219.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Carolingian-pot-430x470.jpg 430w\" title=\"Carolingian lidded vessel unearthed in Galloway and Dumfries, September 2014.

Archaeologists took the unusual step of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33382\" target=\"_blank\">CT scanning the rare silver alloy vessel</a> shortly after it was unearthed because they were concerned it was too fragile to just take the lid off and see what it contained. The scan identified at least one Anglo-Saxon openwork brooch, four other silver brooches, some gold ingots and ivory beads coated in gold, each wrapped in an organic material.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gold-pendant.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41269\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gold-pendant-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gold-pendant-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gold-pendant-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gold-pendant-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold pendant, possible reliquary.

In addition to the ingot and silver-encased ivory beads detected on the scan, they found a total of six Anglo-Saxon silver brooches, one penannular brooch likely made in Ireland, a richly decorated gold pendant which may have held holy relics, several mysterious gold and crystal objects and, breaking the precious metals trend, two large seeds of nuts. The nuts have yet to be identified, but obviously they came from a very special plant that probably wasn\u2019t indigenous to the area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-Scottish-penannular-brooch.jpg target=blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41268\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-Scottish-penannular-brooch-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-Scottish-penannular-brooch-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-Scottish-penannular-brooch-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-Scottish-penannular-brooch-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Irish penannular brooch.

It\u2019s the largest Carolingian pot ever discovered and there are only six known. Scholars believe it may have had been used for important Christian ceremonies and was raided during a Viking incursion on a monastery or church in Germany or France.

The pieces on top were valuable, but most of them were the kind of thing that was cut up for currency, ie, hacksilver before the hacking. The pot, on the other hand, and its contents, must have been deemed of greater significance to their owner. Each object was wrapped in a textile and placed inside the vessel which was topped with its lid and then it too was wrapped with cloth or leather. Textile experts studied the fragments from inside the pot and identified several of them as silk samite, a super deluxe fabric woven in Byzantium, North Africa, or southern Spain. This fabric was exclusively the province of monarchs, the highest ecclesiastical officials and the remains of venerated saints buried in churches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Anglo-Saxon-brooch.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41265\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Anglo-Saxon-brooch-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Anglo-Saxon-brooch-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Anglo-Saxon-brooch-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Anglo-Saxon-brooch-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Anglo-Saxon brooch.

In the 9th century there was extensive Norse settlement of Scotland and the their military victories continued even as the country unified under Kenneth MacAlpin, King of the Picts and first King of Scotland (Alba). Several of his successors \u2014 Constantine I, Indulf \u2014 died fighting the Norse. Then there were the English to deal with. In 937 King of Scotland Constantine II allied with his once and future enemy Olaf Guthfrithson, the Viking king of Dublin, to defeat the invading army of \u00c6thelstan, King of England. They lost. It was a one-battle alliance anyway, and the conflict between the Scots and Norse continued throughout the century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Intertwined-serpents-brooch11vikingtreasure.ngsversion.1458769492763.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41259\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Intertwined-serpents-brooch11vikingtreasure.ngsversion.1458769492763-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Intertwined-serpents-brooch11vikingtreasure.ngsversion.1458769492763-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Intertwined-serpents-brooch11vikingtreasure.ngsversion.1458769492763-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Intertwined-serpents-brooch11vikingtreasure.ngsversion.1458769492763-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Intertwined serpents brooch.

It\u2019s in southwest Scotland, with Norse-heavy Cumbria just to the south and the Norse-dominated Irish Sea to the west. The people who lived there in the 10th century were mostly Vikings in language and culture. The person who buried the hoard was likely trying to protect his savings rather than burying it as a religious offering. That\u2019s why he was so very careful about how the valuables were buried.

Its market value will be assessed by Scotland\u2019s Treasure Trove Unit and the hoard will be offered to Scottish museums. Whichever museum wants it will have to raise the value of the hoard as a reward which will be split between the metal detectorist who discovered it, Derek McLennan, and the landowner, the Church of Scotland. The value is sure to be very high. No other Viking hoard has been found with such a wide variety of objects \u2014 gold, silver, glass, enamel, textiles \u2014 from such a wide geographic area. Preliminary estimates put it at between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31 million, closer to the latter than the former.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Viking hoard in Carolingian pot revealed\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41255\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41255#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-41241\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41241\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Explore Richard III\u2019s grave in 3D\">Explore Richard III\u2019s grave in 3D</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, March 22nd, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_grave1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41252\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_grave1-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_grave1-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_grave1-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_grave1-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Richard III's grave.

He said: \u201cPhotographs and drawings of the grave, whilst dramatic, are only two-dimensional and do not always best show nuances in spatial relationships that a three-dimensional model can.</p>\n<p>\u201cPhotogrammetry provides a fantastic analytical tool that allows us to examine the grave from angles that would have been physically difficult or impossible to achieve during the excavation, and gives us the ability to continue to examine the king\u2019s grave long after the excavation has finished.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_model_software2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41249\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_model_software2-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_model_software2-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_model_software2-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RichardIII_model_software2-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Richard III grave model with photographs applied.

It\u2019s too short for one, which is particularly half-assed when you consider that Richard\u2019s spinal curvature made him shorter than average. (Without the scoliosis, he would have been 5\u20198\u2033 tall, about average height for the time. The S-curve in his spine knocked a couple of inches off his height.) The sides of the grave were not dug straight, but with sloping sides. The bottom of the grave was uneven. You can see on the 3D model just how restricted the space was, how the body leans towards one side like when you\u2019re way too old to have to sleep in a twin bed and the head is propped up uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>The interactive model has been uploaded to the 3D sharing platform <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/00d23c7defd0476db1a36c08728fa60f\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchfab</a>. There are five points of note marked out \u2014 his skull with its war wounds, his curved spine, his missing feet, lost when a pit intersecting with the unknown grave was dug centuries later, the titled head indicating the grave was too short for the body and the sloped sides emphasizing how carelessly the grave was dug. There\u2019s very little content, but when you click on one of the numbers, the view shifts in a neat way. It\u2019s fascinating to see the grave from every possible angle, as if you were lying underneath it, above it, inside it or next to it. </p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"320\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/00d23c7defd0476db1a36c08728fa60f/embed\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; margin: 5px; color: #4A4A4A;\">\n<a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/00d23c7defd0476db1a36c08728fa60f?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">King Richard III's grave</a><br/>\n    by <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/leicester-archaeology?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Archaeological Services (ULAS)</a><br/>\n    on <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchfab</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Explore Richard III\u2019s grave in 3D\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41241\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41241#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2016/03/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

Known for its unique villas with subterranean floors \u2014 smart design in the heat of Tunisia \u2014 Bulla Regia had the greatest numbers of senators in Roman North Africa. It was an important city and its exquisite art and architecture testify to that importance. The GCI is working with the Institut National du Patrimoine of Tunisia and the World Monuments Fund to fully conserve one of the most important private residences in the city, the House of the Hunt, and to devise a plan for the long-term conservation and maintenance of the 400 mosaics that have already been unearthed at Bulla Regia over the past hundred years. Some of the works will be restored for display; others will be reburied. The idea is to make Bulla Regia a template for in situ conservation that can be applied to mosaics elsewhere in North Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in the Mediterranean. </p>\n<p>Highlights of the site\u2019s breathtaking beauty can be seen in this video about the project:</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/LedaeWnjudE&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The focus on best practices of situ conservation is in marked contrast to the Getty\u2019s past see-no-evil acquisition policy evinced in more than one of the mosaics on display in this exhibition. The Getty bought 23 panels of the <em>Bear Hunt</em> in 1972 from a Switzerland-based antiques dealer (surprise!) who told <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41459\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bear-hunt-430x320.jpg 430w\" title=\"Panels of bear hunt mosaic, Baiae, Italy, 300-400 A.D.

It was almost certainly illegally exported, but the museum looked the other way <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/4744\" target=\"_blank\">as it so often did</a>. Recently Getty researchers attempted to trace the ownership history and there\u2019s a big gap between 1929 and 1972. The last known owner in 1929 was refused an export license because there were doubts as to whether he actually had legal title to the mosaic. Somewhere in those four decades, probably closer to 1972 than 1929, the mosaic was trafficked to Zurich and thence to the Getty. Four other panels from the original mosaic were eventually found by the Italian police and are now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples.</p>\n<p>The Getty is offering a number of lectures related to the exhibition. The Handling Session looks particularly compelling.</p>\n<blockquote><p>How were mosaics created from pieces of stone and glass? Learn how these intricate architectural decorations were made in this multisensory handling session. Touch tools and materials similar to those used by ancient mosaicists, including tesserae, slaked lime, marble dust, and nippers. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Lucky Angelenos can take an early lunch and handle tesserae every Thursday and Friday from 11:00 AM-12:00 PM through September 9th. The exhibition runs until September 12th, 2016. For those of us who won\u2019t be able to see the mosaics live, the Getty has made a companion catalogue to the exhibition available free online: <a href=\"www.getty.edu/publications/romanmosaics\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Roman Mosaics in the J.

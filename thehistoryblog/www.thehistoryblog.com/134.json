Heaven on Display. The Altenberg Altar and Its Imagery brings together 37 precious devotional objects from the late 13th and early 14th centuries that have been in separate collections since Napoleon was cutting a swath through Europe.  \n The star of the show is the Early Gothic Altenberg Altar, a folding high altar retable with a shrine cabinet, a polychrome statue of the Madonna and Child in the middle niche and painted panels on each side. The wings, some of the earliest surviving examples of German panel painting, are part the St\u00e4del\u2019s permanent collection, but the rest is on loan. Other objects include reliquaries the once were kept in the shrine cabinet of the altarpiece, goldsmithery, 13th century altar crosses, figural glass paintings from an early 14th century window and two embroidered linen altar cloths made around 1330.  \n The altar cloths are large, elaborately decorated pieces that were placed on the altar in front of the retable. No other altar cloths from the Early Gothic period in Germany have survived. \n Sometime before 1192, Emperor Barbarossa granted the convent the status of imperial immediacy, which put it under the direct rule of the Holy Roman Emperor, exempting it from vassalage to the local lords, essentially a guarantee of independence. The daughters of area nobles joined the convent and endowments from their families over time transformed a small, obscure abbey into one of wealth and power.  \n One of those daughters was Gertrude, the child of St. Elizabeth of Hungary and Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, who died a few months before Gertrude was born. After her beloved husband\u2019s death, Elizabeth dedicated her life to asceticism and charitable works, so much so that she gave up basically everything in the world that she loved, including her children. Little Gertrude was two years old when she was sent to live with the canoness of Aldenberg. She took the veil and became cannoness herself when she was just 21. Her rule lasted until her death 49 years later. \n Elizabeth was already dead by the time her daughter dedicated her own life to piety and mortification of the flesh, felled by a fever when she was 24 years old. Only five years later she was canonized. Gertrude collected relics of the mother she had only had childhood memories of, if any, for the abbey. The works on display are examples of Gertrude\u2019s devotion to her literally sainted mother. There\u2019s a tapestry from 1270 woven with scenes from the life of Elizabeth and Louis IV which may have been hung behind the altar on important occasions before the altarpiece was built, an arm reliquary shaped like an arm and containing an arm, Elizabeth\u2019s silver jug and a ring that once belonged to Louis. \n The convent managed to retain its imperial status through the Reformation, the decline of imperial power and rise of the princes after the Thirty Years\u2019 War. It came to an end with the Final Recess of 1803 when Napoleon compensated German princes who had lost lands west of the Rhine to France with ecclesiastical territories. Altenberg, monastery, church and extensive agricultural and forested lands, became the personal property of the Princes of Solms-Braunfels who had long coveted it. They turned the convent into a summer residence and distributed its works of art and devotional objects throughout their castles. The altar went to Braunfels Castle, the arm reliquary of St. Elisabeth to the chapel of Sayn Palace.  \n From there they made their way into museums and collections around the world. The St\u00e4del Museum in got the wings of the altar in 1925. Other collections including those of the city of Frankfurt, Munich\u2019s Bayerische Nationalmuseum, the Hermitage in St Petersburg and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City all have bits and pieces of Altenberg. It\u2019s an impressive feat reuniting so many elements of the medieval convent to put the objects in some semblance of their original context. \n The exhibition is on right now and runs through September 25th, 2016. \n  \n  \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\"

No other altar cloths from the Early Gothic period in Germany have survived.</p>\n<p>Sometime before 1192, Emperor Barbarossa granted the convent the status of imperial immediacy, which put it under the direct rule of the Holy Roman Emperor, exempting it from vassalage to the local lords, essentially a guarantee of independence. The daughters of area nobles joined the convent and endowments from their families over time transformed a small, obscure abbey into one of wealth and power. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43055\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200-430x644.jpg 430w\" title=\"Crucifix Mount and Processional Crucifix, Limoges, c. 1200.

After her beloved husband\u2019s death, Elizabeth dedicated her life to asceticism and charitable works, so much so that she gave up basically everything in the world that she loved, including her children. Little Gertrude was two years old when she was sent to live with the canoness of Aldenberg. She took the veil and became cannoness herself when she was just 21. Her rule lasted until her death 49 years later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43047\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh-95x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh-95x150.jpg 95w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh-190x300.jpg 190w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh-430x675.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh.jpg 1443w\" title=\"Arm Reliquary of St. Elizabeth, Central Germany, second half of the thirteenth century Silver (without a wooden core), gilt, chased, embossed and engraved; filigree work, precious stones 49 \u00d7 12.5 \u00d7 10.3 cm Bendorf-Sayn, Sayn Palace, palace chapel \u00a9 Sammlung F\u00fcrst zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, Sayn.\" width=\"95\"/></a>Elizabeth was already dead by the time her daughter dedicated her own life to piety and mortification of the flesh, felled by a fever when she was 24 years old.

It\u2019s a Viking tomb of a type known as a death house, a palisade structure similar to the simple roofed post-in-ground structures that would evolve into stave churches. This is the first death house found in Denmark. It measures four by thirteen meters (about 13 x 43 feet) and has one large room with two graves, and an addition that was built later to house one more grave.

Its imposing size made it an intimidating and highly destructive weapon when wielded by an able fighter. Its weight and size made it a useful tool break apart enemy shields along their seams. In the 10th century, this would have been extremely expensive, an elite weapon for nobility or the obscenely wealthy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Reconstruction-of-woman-burial.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43037\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Reconstruction-of-woman-burial.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum.-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Reconstruction-of-woman-burial.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum.-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Reconstruction-of-woman-burial.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum.-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Reconstruction-of-woman-burial.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum.-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"Reconstruction of woman's burial.

The remains of a clay vessel found in the woman\u2019s grave is of a type produced in the Baltic, and she also had two silver coins from what is now Afghanistan. The couple either acquired goods from traders who ranged far and wide or were perhaps well-travelled themselves. If the death house was inspired by a similar structure from elsewhere, that might explain why not other such tombs have been found in Denmark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Smaller-axe-found-in-third-grave.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43040\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Smaller-axe-found-in-third-grave.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum.-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Smaller-axe-found-in-third-grave.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum.-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Smaller-axe-found-in-third-grave.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Smaller-axe-found-in-third-grave.-Image-courtesy-the-Silkeborg-Museum.-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Smaller axe found in third grave.

The child of a free mulatto woman and a white father, he was what the Danish categorized as a \u201cmustice\u201d or \u201cmustee.\u201d His family was comparatively well-off; it is believed his father was Norwegian lawyer Jacob Bentzon who was a royal judge advocate on St Thomas for several years. Peter was sent to school in Philadelphia when he was eight years old, and was apprenticed to a Philadelphia silversmith in 1799 when he was 16. His completed his apprenticeship in 1806 and moved to Christiansted, St Croix, where he started his own silversmithing business. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Makers-mark-det.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42997\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Makers-mark-det.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Makers-mark-det.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Makers-mark-det.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Makers-mark-det.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture.-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bentzon's hallmark.

Denmark reclaimed St Croix in 1816 and Bentzon made arrangements to move his family and business back to Philly. He lived and worked there until 1829, after which he returned to St. Croix for another 20 years. He relocated to Philadelphia again in 1848. His name is on the 1850 Census. After that, he disappears from the historical record. Wherever he was living, he regularly traveled back and forth between Philadelphia and St Croix.</p>\n<p>Bentzon was the only free silversmith of African descent in slavery-era America whose work can be identified from his hallmarks, P. BENTZON and PB. There were at least four other black silversmiths in Philadelphia during his time. Henry Bray and Anthony Sowerwalt are listed as silversmiths and \u201cpersons of color\u201d in the 1813 and 1818 Philadelphia directories. Joseph Head and John Frances, a runaway slave, were also working as silversmiths. None of the four produced work under their own hallmark, however, so it\u2019s impossible to link any surviving silver to them.</p>\n<p>Very few of Bentzon\u2019s pieces are known to have survived, fewer than three dozen, most of them teaspoons. That makes his work rarer than that of famed fellow silversmiths like Paul Revere and Thomas Fletcher. The Smithsonian\u2019s teapot is the only one confirmed to have been made in Bentzon\u2019s Philadelphia shop. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Top-view.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43000\" height=\"94\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Top-view.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture.-150x94.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Top-view.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture.-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Top-view.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture.-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Top-view.-Collection-of-the-Smithsonian-National-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture.-430x269.jpg 430w\" title=\"Overhead view.

It is stamped twice on the bottom with Bentzon\u2019s mark and is inscribed \u201cRebecca Dawson\u201d on the base.

For a long time the Board of the Smithsonian itself questioned whether the collection could sustain a stand-alone African-American history museum, and it wasn\u2019t until December of 2003 that all the pieces came together with the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ184/html/PLAW-108publ184.htm\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum of African American History and Culture Act</a> establishing the new museum within the rubric of the Smithsonian Institution. It took another three years for the site, part of the Washington Monument grounds, to be selected. Settling on a design for the building took even more time. Finally, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/arts-post/post/national-museum-of-african-american-history-and-culture-groundbreaking/2012/02/21/gIQALzw4RR_blog.html\" target=\"_blank\">ground was broken</a> on February 22nd, 2012.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Smithsonian took the innovative step of creating a virtual museum when the physical museum was still years away from construction.

The four appear to be young people, one of them a teenage girl, who made it outside the city gate but must have been compelled to stop and seek shelter, probably in the futile attempt to dodge the pyroclastic flow ringing the death knell for the city. The remains were jumbled up against the wall, the result of looters known as fossores who tunneled through the ash to scavenge any valuables people had taken with them when they tried to outrun the volcano. The exact date of this incursion is hard to establish; sometime between the eruption of 79 A.D. and the official excavations of the 19th century. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Porta-Ercolano-coin-Vespasian.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42986\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 117px) 100vw, 117px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Porta-Ercolano-coin-Vespasian-117x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Porta-Ercolano-coin-Vespasian-117x150.jpg 117w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Porta-Ercolano-coin-Vespasian-200x255.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Porta-Ercolano-coin-Vespasian-430x549.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Porta-Ercolano-coin-Vespasian.jpg 1564w\" title=\"Gold coin with profile of Vespasian, ca. 74-78.

The town had a central plaza, surrounded by three platform mounds, houses and defensive walls 10 feet tall and more than 1,000 feet long in each direction. Known as the Lawrenz Gun Club Site after a shooting club built on one of the mounds in the mid-20th century, the site has been studied by archaeologists and students from the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) <a href=\"http://www.sj-r.com/news/20160616/indiana-university-students-explore-prehistoric-city-under-cass-county-cornfield\" target=\"_blank\">every summer for six years</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fragment-of-decorated-pottery.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42965\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fragment-of-decorated-pottery.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fragment-of-decorated-pottery.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fragment-of-decorated-pottery.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fragment-of-decorated-pottery.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fragment of decorated pottery.

IUPUI\u2019s archaeology field school used remote sensing technology to establish the perimeter of the site and, since they can\u2019t dig up the whole cornfield, to identify areas likely to contain artifacts. This excavation season alone they\u2019ve unearthed 97 bags of archaeological material including projectile points, pottery of many different kinds from cookware to storage vessels to dishes, stone tools, plant and animal remains. Only once in the six years have they encountered a human burial. Officials were notified in compliance with federal law, the grave was reburied and the remains left undisturbed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe last couple of years, we have focused inside the city\u2019s walls.

Bastions and archers\u2019 towers, you see a change in shape as they go from more circular to more rectangular in design. It shows they are really taking their time and thinking about their defensive fortifications,\u201d Flood said. \u201cWe see that throughout all sorts of archaeology all over the world. Usually about the time you see agriculture, things like corn or maize, all of a sudden when you have food in one location, you find you have a need to protect that food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou also need to make your presence known,\u201d Flood said. \u201cIf you\u2019re coming down the river and see a big, fortified city with 10-foot walls and archers\u2019 towers, that\u2019s a big mark of presence. It says \u2018we\u2019re here, and we\u2019re here to stay.'\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Soil-removed-from-around-artifacts.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42964\" height=\"107\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Soil-removed-from-around-artifacts.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-150x107.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Soil-removed-from-around-artifacts.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-150x107.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Soil-removed-from-around-artifacts.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-200x143.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Soil-removed-from-around-artifacts.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-430x309.jpg 430w\" title=\"Soil removed from around artifacts.

The inhabitants grew crops, primarily maize, and also foraged wild resources from their environment, including seeds, grasses, nuts and marshelder, a ragweed relation with edible seeds that was cultivated by the earlier Kansas City Hopewell culture of Kansas and Missouri before maize displaced it. The surrounding area also provided abundant hunting and fishing. The IUPUI team has found a great many bones of fish, waterfowl and land mammals.</p>\n<p>A large community with impressive fortifications in a fertile location with plentiful plant and animal resources, the village likely traded with the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18777\" target=\"_blank\">great city of Cahokia</a>, now the <a href=\"http://cahokiamounds.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site</a>, to the north. Like Cahokia and other known Mississippian communities, the Lawrenz Site met an abrupt end in the mid-15th century. Archaeologists believe a combination of the Little Ice Age and severe drought may have brought on repeated crop failures which drove the population to abandon their settlements and seek greener pastures. With no food left to protect, fortifications that once defended the stores become prison walls enclosing only the prospect of mass starvation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dr.-Jeremy-Wilsons-dog-Oscar-helps-excavate.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42967\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dr.-Jeremy-Wilsons-dog-Oscar-helps-excavate.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dr.-Jeremy-Wilsons-dog-Oscar-helps-excavate.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dr.-Jeremy-Wilsons-dog-Oscar-helps-excavate.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dr.-Jeremy-Wilsons-dog-Oscar-helps-excavate.-Photo-by-Rich-Saal-The-State-Journal-Register.-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Team leader Dr. Jeremy Wilson's dog Oscar helps excavate the Lawrenz Site.

By the mid-17th century the overhanging jetties projected so far over the alleyways that they kissed the jetties from buildings across the street, which made fire very easy to spread and practically impossible to stop. When the fire started in Thomas Farriner\u2019s bakery on Pudding Lane, it quickly jumped from building to building and soon formed an implacable wall of flame too hot for people to even attempt to counter. Perhaps controlled demolition of structures forming a firebreak perimeter could have contained it, but Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth didn\u2019t order those until the fire had burned all night and day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Singed-tin-glazed-floor-tile-from-Monument-House-c-Museum-of-London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42932\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Singed-tin-glazed-floor-tile-from-Monument-House-c-Museum-of-London-150x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Singed-tin-glazed-floor-tile-from-Monument-House-c-Museum-of-London-150x148.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Singed-tin-glazed-floor-tile-from-Monument-House-c-Museum-of-London-200x198.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Singed-tin-glazed-floor-tile-from-Monument-House-c-Museum-of-London-430x426.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blue and white tin-glazed earthenware decorated floor tile blackened by the fire from Monument House \u00a9 Museum of London\" width=\"100\"/></a>What little firefighting equipment existed was small-scale and ineffective: tall ladders, leather buckets of water and squirt guns that look like large syringes could douse a building fire when deployed quickly, but once fire spread these tools couldn\u2019t keep up. Long firehooks were used to pull down buildings, and when the buildings were too high for that, controlled demolition by gunpowder might do the trick. Once the fire was raging, it was too hot and fast for these methods to work. Once the Thames waterfront was on fire, the city\u2019s supply of water was cut off. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-c-Museum-of-London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42941\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 84px) 100vw, 84px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-c-Museum-of-London-84x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-c-Museum-of-London-84x150.jpg 84w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-c-Museum-of-London-168x300.jpg 168w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-c-Museum-of-London-430x766.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-c-Museum-of-London.jpg 975w\" title=\"17th century fire engine \u00a9 Museum of London\" width=\"84\"/></a>Early fire engines carried barrels of water to a fire and pumped it out, but they delivered a comparatively meager stream of water, and that\u2019s assuming they could even make it down the winding alleys of the City of London. Some were on sleds, other on wheels. The Museum of London has a very rare surviving 17th century fire engine which it acquired in 1928.

They used traditional methods, tools and material to recreate the carriage. With no plans to go by, the coachbuilders used a 19th century photograph located by museum curators of the engine from when it was still complete with undercarriage, tow bar and pumping arms. Curators also found a print showing the fire engine, designed by John Keeling in London around 1678, in action, which helped the craftsmen replicate the original.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42925\" height=\"105\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-4-150x105.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-4-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-4-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-4-430x303.jpg 430w\" title=\"Tim Brisley and Nick Gill set the iron tyre on the wheel.

My favorite part is when they take the completed wheel made of three different kinds of woods \u2014 elm for the hub, oak for the spokes, ash for the felloes (the part that goes around the spokes) \u2014 and fit the iron rim onto it. The rim has to be slightly smaller than the wheel to keep it all together, so they heat that bad boy up so it expands, slap it on the wheel, then quickly dump cold water on it to keep the hot iron from burning the wood and to force the iron to contract around the wheel. It\u2019s smoke-filled awesomeness.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/NFX7IopucV4&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-9.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-42917\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-9-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-9-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-9-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fire-Engine-Restoration-9-430x321.jpg 430w\" title=\"Coachbuilders Tim Brisley and Nick Gill adjust pump levers.

Found in a <em>mokgwakmyo</em>, a traditional wooden coffin, in a marshy area, the skeleton was complete and relatively well-preserved, albeit fragmented in places. Grave goods, including pottery and a wooden comb, were found inside the coffin that identify it as a Silla-era burial.</p>\n<p>The Silla Kingdom started as a small city-state in 57 B.C. and ruled an increasingly large part of the Korean Peninsula until 935 A.D. Its thousand-year duration is one of the longest in the historical record, and two of its ruling dynasties \u2014 the Parks and the Kims \u2014 transcended the kingdom to become the most common family names in Korea today. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-with-other-relics-and-mud-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42882\" height=\"125\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-with-other-relics-and-mud-in-situ-150x125.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-with-other-relics-and-mud-in-situ-150x125.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-with-other-relics-and-mud-in-situ-200x167.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-with-other-relics-and-mud-in-situ-430x360.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skull fragments with other relics mingled in the mud in the coffin. http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156632.g002.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Despite the Silla Kingdom\u2019s long life and enormous influence on the history and modern culture of Korea, researchers have had few opportunities to study Silla bones at all, and never with multiple analytical technologies. Intact human remains from the Silla period are rare because Korea\u2019s acidic soil and the cycles of hot/wet, cold/dry weather accelerate the decomposition of soft tissue and bone alike. A 4th-6th century grave <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/2583\" target=\"_blank\">discovered in 2009</a> contained unprecedented complete sets of human and horse armor, for example, but not a single human remain. The wooden coffin survived, as did a box with assorted grave goods. The bones had disintegrated. The discovery of a complete skeleton in 2013 gave scientists the chance to carry out anthropological analysis, extract mitochondrial DNA, run stable isotope tests and craniofacial analyses that led to a full facial reconstruction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-after-pre-treatment.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42883\" height=\"117\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-after-pre-treatment-150x117.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-after-pre-treatment-150x117.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-after-pre-treatment-200x157.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Skull-fragments-after-pre-treatment-430x337.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skull fragments after cleaning and drying. http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156632.g003.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The person deceased was a woman between 35 and 39 years of age at time of death. The length of the femur indicated she was around 155 cm (five feet) tall.

Stable isotope analysis found that her diet consisted mainly of foods in the C<sub>3</sub> category (wheat, rice and potatoes) and was likely vegetarian.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-skull.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42884\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-skull-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-skull-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-skull-200x243.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-skull-430x523.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-skull.jpg 1545w\" title=\"Restored skull. http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156632.g005.\" width=\"123\"/></a>Her skull was found broken in dozens of pieces. In order to help determine her gender and to create a facial reconstruction, archaeologists cleaned the fragments and dried them. Each piece was scanned and imported into 3D modelling software to figure out how the pieces fit together. Once the model was complete, the team then puzzled together the actual skull from the fragments.</p>\n<p>Her skull was unusually long and narrow. This kind of head shape often seen in cases of intentional cranial deformation. It appears to be natural in her case. Intentionally deformed crania are flatter in the front and the bones of the side grow to compensate from the pressure of the deforming agent (usually a piece wood or tight bindings applied to infants when their skulls are still soft).</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the craniometric analysis, the major cranial indices were compared with the corresponding data derived from the subjects of modern Korean adults. The results showed that the skull has longer, narrower and lower cranium with a narrower facial bone and orbits than those from the modern Korean adults groups. The nasal aperture demonstrated an average width in the nasal index. In terms of appearance, it was assumed that the individual had horizontally long &amp; vertically short head with inclined forehead from lateral view and narrower face from frontal view. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This dolichocephalic or long-headedness trait is rare in the population of Korea today. Koreans are more often brachycephalic, defined as the width of their skull being at least 80% of the length. </p>\n<p>Here is the complete craniofacial reconstruction:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Facial-reconstruction.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-42885\" height=\"216\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Facial-reconstruction-430x216.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Facial-reconstruction-430x216.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Facial-reconstruction-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Facial-reconstruction-200x100.jpg 200w\" title=\"Facial reconstruction of Silla woman. http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156632.g007\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>You can read the full study <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156632\" target=\"_blank\">published in the journal PLOS ONE here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Long head of Silla woman reconstructed from skull fragments\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42880\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42880#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-42887\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42887\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to &lt;em&gt;La Belle&lt;/em&gt; restoration complete\"><em>La Belle</em> restoration complete</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, June 22nd, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-La-Belle-Texas-AM-University.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-42889\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-La-Belle-Texas-AM-University-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-La-Belle-Texas-AM-University-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-La-Belle-Texas-AM-University-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Restored-La-Belle-Texas-AM-University-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Restored hull of La Belle in the main gallery of the Bullock Museum.

Their poor maps of the Gulf sent the explorers way off course. When his main storeship, <em>L\u2019Aimable</em>, ran aground, La Salle was compelled to transfer as much of her contents as he could salvage to <em>La Belle</em>, so when a storm claimed her too off the coast in Matagorda Bay, 400 miles west of the Mississippi Delta, in 1686, she sank with a disproportionately huge complement of artifacts and supplies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/02a.Excavation_cofferdam.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33032\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/02a.Excavation_cofferdam-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/02a.Excavation_cofferdam-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/02a.Excavation_cofferdam-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/02a.Excavation_cofferdam-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"La Belle excavated in the cofferdam, 1996.

They built a double-walled cofferdam around the wreck, pumped out the water and from September of 1996 to April of 1997, excavated the surviving bottom third of the ship\u2019s oak hull. By the end of the excavation they had recovered nearly 1.6 million objects \u2014 barrels of gunpowder, weaponry, personal items, cookware, crates full of trade geegaws (brass rings, pins, hundreds of thousands of glass beads). </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Conservator-Peter-Fix-works-on-hull.-Photo-by-Rosario-Casarez..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-42890\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Conservator-Peter-Fix-works-on-hull.-Photo-by-Rosario-Casarez.-200x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Conservator-Peter-Fix-works-on-hull.-Photo-by-Rosario-Casarez.-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Conservator-Peter-Fix-works-on-hull.-Photo-by-Rosario-Casarez.-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Conservator-Peter-Fix-works-on-hull.-Photo-by-Rosario-Casarez.-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Conservator Peter Fix works on reassembling the hull at the Bullock Museum.

While the hull timbers were back together again, the restoration wasn\u2019t finished yet. The were gaps that needed to be closed and additional surviving sections of the hull added to the structure. While conservators were working on that, the main gallery was refurbished around the ship\u2019s hull to create the permanent exhibition that would fully showcase <em>La Belle</em> and its many artifacts.</p>\n<p>The restoration is now complete and the ship positioned at a 21-degree angle, just as it was on the sea floor when archaeologists excavated it. The temporary exhibition <a href=\"http://www.thestoryoftexas.com/la-belle/the-exhibit\" target=\"_blank\"><em>La Belle: The Ship That Changed History</em></a>, is ongoing now.

Made in the Grand Ducal workshops in Florence between 1600 and 1620, the table top is a glorious technicolor extravaganza of marble and semi-precious stone including agate, quartz, chalcedony, jasper and imported Persian lapis lazuli of the highest quality. </p>\n<p>The four corners of the table are inlaid with coats of arms of the Grimani family, one of Venice\u2019s most wealthy and powerful noble families. Family crests are rare motifs in the hard stone tables made by the Grand Ducal workshops, and this table is unique in having four of them. The abstract decoration around the crests is also unique. Other armorial table tops were commissioned by the Medici family as gifts for allies and dignitaries, and almost everything produced in the workshops was done at the behest of the Medici family. It is possible that the Grimanis arranged a private commission. There are no extant records to confirm either way. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Portrait-of-Cardinal-Domenico-Grimani-Cristofano-dellAltissimo-circa-1500-\u00a9-Cultura-Italia.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42866\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Portrait-of-Cardinal-Domenico-Grimani-Cristofano-dellAltissimo-circa-1500-\u00a9-Cultura-Italia-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Portrait-of-Cardinal-Domenico-Grimani-Cristofano-dellAltissimo-circa-1500-\u00a9-Cultura-Italia-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Portrait-of-Cardinal-Domenico-Grimani-Cristofano-dellAltissimo-circa-1500-\u00a9-Cultura-Italia-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Portrait-of-Cardinal-Domenico-Grimani-Cristofano-dellAltissimo-circa-1500-\u00a9-Cultura-Italia-430x546.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Portrait-of-Cardinal-Domenico-Grimani-Cristofano-dellAltissimo-circa-1500-\u00a9-Cultura-Italia.jpg 1575w\" title=\"Doge Antonio Grimani, Venetian School, circa 1500 \u00a9 National Trust, Attingham Park.\" width=\"118\"/></a>The family certainly had enough pull to access the Grand Ducal workshops. Founded by spice and textile merchant Antonio Grimani (1434-1523), the family\u2019s fabulous wealth catapulted them to the top of Venetian society. Antonio was the first Doge, elected in 1521 and serving until his death. There would be another two Doges in the family \u2014 Marino Grimani (1532-1605) and Pietro Grimani (1677-1752) \u2014 and a great many other big shots in the Church, business and politics. </p>\n<p>The table top\u2019s decoration telegraphs the prominence of the family in multiple fields. Each of the four crests is topped with a different symbol. The red domed hat (bottom right corner in the picture) is the Corno Ducale, the traditional headpiece of the Doge. The crossed keys of St. Peter (bottom left) represent the family\u2019s support of the papacy and the many papal offices they held in reward for that support. The lion holding a book (top left) is the symbol of St. Mark the Evangelist, Venice\u2019s patron saint, is a nod to two cardinals in the family who held the prestigious position of Cardinal Priest of San Marco. The double cross (top right) refers to the Grimaldi holders of the coveted and highly lucrative position of Cardinal Patriarch of Aquileia.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/View-of-Palazzo-Grimani-di-San-Luca-Canaletto-1756-\u00a9-National-Gallery-London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42865\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/View-of-Palazzo-Grimani-di-San-Luca-Canaletto-1756-\u00a9-National-Gallery-London-150x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/View-of-Palazzo-Grimani-di-San-Luca-Canaletto-1756-\u00a9-National-Gallery-London-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/View-of-Palazzo-Grimani-di-San-Luca-Canaletto-1756-\u00a9-National-Gallery-London-200x158.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/View-of-Palazzo-Grimani-di-San-Luca-Canaletto-1756-\u00a9-National-Gallery-London-430x341.jpg 430w\" title=\"View of Palazzo Grimani di San Luca, Canaletto, 1756 \u00a9 National Gallery, London\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Grimanis were not shy about parading their wealth. They amassed major collections of antiquities and art and packed them into two great palaces, the Palazzo Grimani di Santa Maria Formosa and the Palazzo Grimani di San Luca on the Grand Canal. Both palaces employed some of the greatest architects of their time, including Sansovino and Palladio. Family members and the palaces were painted by the likes of Tintoretto and Canaletto. The pietre dure table top had to be grand to decorate these homes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Watercolour-of-the-Florentine-top-sent-to-Lord-Warwick-from-William-Taylor-Money-for-review-and-sale-1830.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42864\" height=\"145\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Watercolour-of-the-Florentine-top-sent-to-Lord-Warwick-from-William-Taylor-Money-for-review-and-sale-1830-150x145.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Watercolour-of-the-Florentine-top-sent-to-Lord-Warwick-from-William-Taylor-Money-for-review-and-sale-1830-150x145.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Watercolour-of-the-Florentine-top-sent-to-Lord-Warwick-from-William-Taylor-Money-for-review-and-sale-1830-200x194.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Watercolour-of-the-Florentine-top-sent-to-Lord-Warwick-from-William-Taylor-Money-for-review-and-sale-1830-430x417.jpg 430w\" title=\"Watercolour of the Florentine top sent to Lord Warwick from William Taylor Money for review and sale, 1830. \u00a9 Warwick County Record Office CR1886/Box393/3\" width=\"150\"/></a>The fortunes of the Grimani family began to decline in the late 18th century courtesy of the Napoleonic invasions. The family started selling off their collections piecemeal in 1806. They sold off the Palazzo Grimani di San Luca to their new Austrian overlords in around 1816-1818 and the Austrians converted it into a post office. The table top was in the Palazzo Grimani Santa Maria Formosa until 1829 when it was acquired by Henry Greville, 3rd Earl of Warwick (1779-1853) through British Consul William Taylor Money (1765-1834) who acted as Lord Warwick\u2019s agent in the purchase of the table top and a marble floor for the earl to install in the renovated Great Hall of Warwick Castle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-English-Elizabethan-style-gilt-wood-base.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42870\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-English-Elizabethan-style-gilt-wood-base-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-English-Elizabethan-style-gilt-wood-base-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-English-Elizabethan-style-gilt-wood-base-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-English-Elizabethan-style-gilt-wood-base-430x290.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-English-Elizabethan-style-gilt-wood-base.jpg 1541w\" title=\"Florentine table top on English Elizabethan style gilt wood base.

The insisted on keeping the legs and base of the table which they then topped with a fake apparently to save face. Lord Warwick had a new base made and by 1847 the table was on display in the Gilt Drawing Room. <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/grimani-tables-l15235/lot.202.html\" target=\"_blank\">Another pietre dure table top</a> Warwick bought from the Grimani\u2019s was displayed in the State Bedroom. The second table top was made in Rome and doesn\u2019t have anything like the same visual impact or historic iconography, but it\u2019s still an exceptional example of the art form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-carved-giltwood-19th-century-English-base.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-42868\" height=\"116\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-carved-giltwood-19th-century-English-base-150x116.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-carved-giltwood-19th-century-English-base-150x116.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-carved-giltwood-19th-century-English-base-200x155.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-carved-giltwood-19th-century-English-base-430x335.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Table-top-on-carved-giltwood-19th-century-English-base.jpg 1544w\" title=\"Roman table top on carved giltwood 19th century English base.

The UK is not blocking export of that one, but there\u2019s no reason to assume the buyer applied for an export license in the first place. British institutions have until September to raise the purchase price plus VAT of the Florentine table to keep it in country. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Grimani-table-top-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-42869\" height=\"295\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Grimani-table-top-2-e1466495786566-430x295.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Grimani-table-top-2-e1466495786566-430x295.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Grimani-table-top-2-e1466495786566-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Grimani-table-top-2-e1466495786566-200x137.jpg 200w\" title=\"Grimani table top made in Rome.

No other altar cloths from the Early Gothic period in Germany have survived.</p>\n<p>Sometime before 1192, Emperor Barbarossa granted the convent the status of imperial immediacy, which put it under the direct rule of the Holy Roman Emperor, exempting it from vassalage to the local lords, essentially a guarantee of independence. The daughters of area nobles joined the convent and endowments from their families over time transformed a small, obscure abbey into one of wealth and power. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-43055\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_kreuzbeschlag_und_vortragekreuz_um_1200-430x644.jpg 430w\" title=\"Crucifix Mount and Processional Crucifix, Limoges, c. 1200.

After her beloved husband\u2019s death, Elizabeth dedicated her life to asceticism and charitable works, so much so that she gave up basically everything in the world that she loved, including her children. Little Gertrude was two years old when she was sent to live with the canoness of Aldenberg. She took the veil and became cannoness herself when she was just 21. Her rule lasted until her death 49 years later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-43047\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh-95x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh-95x150.jpg 95w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh-190x300.jpg 190w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh-430x675.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/st_presse_sdh_armreliquiar_der_hl_elisabeth_mitte_13jh.jpg 1443w\" title=\"Arm Reliquary of St. Elizabeth, Central Germany, second half of the thirteenth century Silver (without a wooden core), gilt, chased, embossed and engraved; filigree work, precious stones 49 \u00d7 12.5 \u00d7 10.3 cm Bendorf-Sayn, Sayn Palace, palace chapel \u00a9 Sammlung F\u00fcrst zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, Sayn.\" width=\"95\"/></a>Elizabeth was already dead by the time her daughter dedicated her own life to piety and mortification of the flesh, felled by a fever when she was 24 years old.

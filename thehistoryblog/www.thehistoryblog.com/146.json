In it he summarizes in his characterstically witty style the inscructions for necromancy, raising the dead for the purpose of foretelling the future, found on a tablet (K.2779) in the British Museum. \n  \n Written in Neo-Babylonian in the 7th century B.C., the tablet was one of tens of thousands discovered at Nineveh that were part of what is known as the Library of Ashurbanipal. Only the top half of it and a few fragments have survived so we don\u2019t have the full recipe for conjuring the spirits of the dead, sad to say, and there are a few lines of magical incantantions that are untranslatable because they were written in what scholars think may be a mixed-up kind of Sumerian seeing as by the 1st milennium B.C. nobody could speak the real thing anymore. This kind of magic-speak has been found on tablets before, including ones dealing with necromancy.  \n There aren\u2019t a great many specifically dedicated to the raising of ghosts and questioning them, interestingly enough. The namburbi genre this tablet is a part of usually deals with warnings and magic to repel ghosts and contain the damage they can do. Tablet 2779 is unusual in that it covers both subjects: how to raise the ghost and then how to prevent its evil from harming the home and its residents. As it was not incised in Nineveh, it\u2019s likely the tablet was brought to the library in a deliberate attempt to flesh out the collection in subject areas that were sparsely covered. \n Here\u2019s a translation of the surviving cuneiform from K.2279, minus the couple of lines of untranslatable verse: \n An incantation to enable a man to see a ghost.\nIts ritual: (you crush) mouldy wood, fresh leaves of Euphrates poplar in water, oil, beer (and) wine. You dry, crush and sieve snake-tallow, lion-tallow, crab-tallow, white honey, a frog (that lives) among the pebbles, hair of a dog, hair of a cat, hair of a fox, bristle of a chameleon (and) bristle of a (red) lizard, \u201cclaw\u201d of a frog, end-of-intestines of a frog, the left wing of a grasshopper, (and) marrow from the long bone of a goose.  You mix (all this) (in) wine, water (and) milk with amhara plant. You recite the incantation three times and you anoint your eyes (with it) and you will see the ghost: he will speak with you. You can look at the ghost: he will talk with you.\nIn order to avert the evil (inherent) in a ghost\u2019s cry you (sic) crush a potsherd from a ruined tell in water. He should sprinkle the house (with this water). For three days he should make offerings to the family ghosts.\nHe should pour out beer (flavoured with) roast barley. He should scatter juniper over a censer before Samas, pour out prime beer, offer a resent to Samas, and recite as follows:\nO Samas, Judge of Heaven and Underworld, Foremost One of the Anunnaki!\nO Samas, Judge of all the Lands, Samas Foremost and Resplendent One!\nYou keep them in check, O Samas, the Judge. You carry those from Above down to Below,\nThose from Below up to Above. The ghost who has cried out in my house, whether of (my) father or mother, whether (my) brother or sister,\nWhether a forgotten son of someone, whether a vagrant ghost show has no-one to care for it,\nAn offering has been made for him! Water has been poured out for him! May the evil in his cry away behin him!\nLet the evil in his evil cry not come near me! <\u2026> You do this repeatedly for three days, and <\u2026>\nYou wash his hands, you anoint him with U.SIKIL: \u201cIt is finished\u201d: in oil. \n I love that they pour out beer for him. Very 90s rap. \n The only negative thing I can say about Finkel\u2019s explanation of the tablet is that it\u2019s way too short. I\u2019m hoping he does what he did with Ur and films himself actually performing the ritual. He\u2019s already scared up a suitable skull (Mesopotamian, one hopes, although there is nothing in the literature that suggests the skulls used in these rituals needed to have belonged to any specific individual, group or time period). It\u2019s just the ingredients for the magical brew he\u2019s having difficulty obtaining. That, Dr. Finkel, is what the Internet is for. All you need is a little viral luck and within days you will be inundated with sufficient snake tallow, frog end-of-intestines and chameleon bristles to raise an army of the dead. \n   ", "html":

You mix (all this) (in) wine, water (and) milk with amhara plant. You recite the incantation three times and you anoint your eyes (with it) and you will see the ghost: he will speak with you. You can look at the ghost: he will talk with you.</p>\n<p>In order to avert the evil (inherent) in a ghost\u2019s cry you (sic) crush a potsherd from a ruined tell in water. He should sprinkle the house (with this water). For three days he should make offerings to the family ghosts.</p>\n<p>He should pour out beer (flavoured with) roast barley. He should scatter juniper over a censer before Samas, pour out prime beer, offer a resent to Samas, and recite as follows:</p>\n<p>O Samas, Judge of Heaven and Underworld, Foremost One of the Anunnaki!<br/>\nO Samas, Judge of all the Lands, Samas Foremost and Resplendent One!<br/>\nYou keep them in check, O Samas, the Judge. You carry those from Above down to Below,<br/>\nThose from Below up to Above. The ghost who has cried out in my house, whether of (my) father or mother, whether (my) brother or sister,<br/>\nWhether a forgotten son of someone, whether a vagrant ghost show has no-one to care for it,<br/>\nAn offering has been made for him! Water has been poured out for him! May the evil in his cry away behin him!<br/>\nLet the evil in his evil cry not come near me! &lt;\u2026&gt; You do this repeatedly for three days, and &lt;\u2026&gt;</p>\n<p>You wash his hands, you anoint him with U.SIKIL: \u201cIt is finished\u201d: in oil.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love that they pour out beer for him. Very 90s rap.</p>\n<p>The only negative thing I can say about Finkel\u2019s explanation of the tablet is that it\u2019s way too short. I\u2019m hoping he does what he did with Ur and films himself actually performing the ritual. He\u2019s already scared up a suitable skull (Mesopotamian, one hopes, although there is nothing in the literature that suggests the skulls used in these rituals needed to have belonged to any specific individual, group or time period). It\u2019s just the ingredients for the magical brew he\u2019s having difficulty obtaining. That, Dr. Finkel, is what the Internet is for. All you need is a little viral luck and within days you will be inundated with sufficient snake tallow, frog end-of-intestines and chameleon bristles to raise an army of the dead.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Irving Finkel on how to raise the dead\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49418\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49418#comments\">13 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-49399\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49399\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Portland Vase keeps confounding experts after 500 years\">Portland Vase keeps confounding experts after 500 years</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, October 30th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Scene-A-of-the-Portland-Vase..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49409\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Scene-A-of-the-Portland-Vase.-126x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Scene-A-of-the-Portland-Vase.-126x150.jpg 126w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Scene-A-of-the-Portland-Vase.-200x238.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Scene-A-of-the-Portland-Vase.-768x915.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Scene-A-of-the-Portland-Vase.-430x512.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scene A of The Portland Vase, perhaps from Rome, Italy, ca. 5-25 CE.

Finely crushed glass particles are mixed into a paste with a binding material (and colours), which is then put on the inner surface of a mould and then fired.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49401\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002-150x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002-768x496.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002-430x277.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002.jpg 1071w\" title=\"Bubbles trapped in the glass of the Portland Vase.

It is believed to have been found in a tomb just southeast of the ancient Servian walls that still marked the official boundary between the old city (where bodies could not be buried) and the outskirts (where they could). Known as the Monte del Grano (the hill of grain), the grave purportedly contained a large marble sarcophagus thought to be the final resting place of Emperor Severus Alexander (r. 222-235 A.D.) and his mother Julia Mamaea. The imperial attribution proved to be groundless, but the legend stayed attached to the vase, which was found inside the sarcophagus and because of its exceptional quality was assumed to have been used to contain the ashes of the emperor, for centuries. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxv-rear-of-the-previous-special-urn-1756.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49405\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxv-rear-of-the-previous-special-urn-1756-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxv-rear-of-the-previous-special-urn-1756-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxv-rear-of-the-previous-special-urn-1756-200x151.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxv-rear-of-the-previous-special-urn-1756-768x578.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxv-rear-of-the-previous-special-urn-1756-430x324.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxv-rear-of-the-previous-special-urn-1756.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Rear of the previous special urn, engraving The Roman antiquities, t. 2, Plate XXXV, by Piranesi. 1756\" width=\"150\"/></a>The discovery was not documented at the time so a lot of this story is nebulous in its details. It was well-established as the background of the vase by the 18th century, but the first known recorded reference to the Portland Vase was a comment by Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc who saw the artifact in the winter of 1600-1 in the collection of Cardinal del Monte. Peiresc was riveted by it as were his friends Peter Paul Rubens and antiquary Cassiano dal Pozzo whose \u201cPaper Museum\u201d (a collection of more than 7,000 paintings, watercolors and sketches of antiquities, botany, zoology, architecture and more) included multiple drawings of the vase. The three of them wrote to each other about it often, discussing its aesthetic attributes, imagery, original shape and date of manufacture.</p>\n<p>As secretary to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, dal Pozza had front-row seats to the cameo glass vase. Cardinal Del Monte died in 1626 and the vase was acquired by the Cardinal\u2019s brother Antonio, both nephews of Pope Urban VIII. That\u2019s where the vase got its next name: the Barberini Vase. The family was the most powerful in Rome at that time and had patronage ties to artists all over Italy. Word of the rare beauty of the vase spread far and wide in the artistic community, and by the end of the century it was considered a must-see for antiquarians, artists and well-bred amateurs who would later become known as Grand Tourists.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxiv-grand-marble-urn-believed-to-alexander-severus-and-his-mother-1756.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49404\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxiv-grand-marble-urn-believed-to-alexander-severus-and-his-mother-1756-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxiv-grand-marble-urn-believed-to-alexander-severus-and-his-mother-1756-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxiv-grand-marble-urn-believed-to-alexander-severus-and-his-mother-1756-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxiv-grand-marble-urn-believed-to-alexander-severus-and-his-mother-1756-768x570.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxiv-grand-marble-urn-believed-to-alexander-severus-and-his-mother-1756-430x319.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-roman-antiquities-t-2-plate-xxxiv-grand-marble-urn-believed-to-alexander-severus-and-his-mother-1756.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Grand marble urn believed to Alexander Severus and his mother Julia Mamea (figures engraved by Barbault), The Roman antiquities, t. 2, Plate XXXIV, by Piranesi.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Not that anybody had any accurate idea of where it came from or even what it was made out of at this point. Late 17th century sources from encyclopedist Bernard de Montfaucon to Giovanni Battista Piranesi, meticulous engraver of antiquities and fantasy prison landscapes, repeated the story that the vase had been found in the Monte del Grano tomb in the sarcophagus of Severus Alexander. Piranesi engraved the tomb, sarcophagus and vase in his characteristic high detail, but he hadn\u2019t seen them together as the original context was long since scattered. Montfaucon and Piranesi both mistakenly thought the vase was made of sardonyx agate, and they weren\u2019t the only ones to make that mistake. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wedgwood-black-and-blue-versions-of-Portland-Vase-in-Jasperware.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49408\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wedgwood-black-and-blue-versions-of-Portland-Vase-in-Jasperware-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wedgwood-black-and-blue-versions-of-Portland-Vase-in-Jasperware-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wedgwood-black-and-blue-versions-of-Portland-Vase-in-Jasperware-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wedgwood-black-and-blue-versions-of-Portland-Vase-in-Jasperware-768x577.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wedgwood-black-and-blue-versions-of-Portland-Vase-in-Jasperware-430x323.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wedgwood-black-and-blue-versions-of-Portland-Vase-in-Jasperware.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Wedgwood black and blue versions of Portland Vase in Jasperware.

In 1784, the vase ceased to be a Barberini and found a new home (and a new name) with the Duchess of Portland. She died the next year and her great collection was sold at a multi-day auction.

On February 7th, 1845, a paranoid alcoholic on a bender picked up one of the carved stones on display in the gallery and smashed the Portland Vase and its vitrine to bits. It wound up in 37 pieces but was puzzled back together by restorer John Doubleday within a year. It was finally bought by and entered the permanent collection of the British Museum in 1945.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Portland Vase keeps confounding experts after 500 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49399\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49399#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-49391\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49391\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Dragons return to Kew Gardens\u2019 Great Pagoda\">Dragons return to Kew Gardens\u2019 Great Pagoda</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, October 29th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kew-Gardens-Great-Pagoda.-Photo-by-Rafa-Esteve.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49394\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kew-Gardens-Great-Pagoda.-Photo-by-Rafa-Esteve-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kew-Gardens-Great-Pagoda.-Photo-by-Rafa-Esteve-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kew-Gardens-Great-Pagoda.-Photo-by-Rafa-Esteve-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kew-Gardens-Great-Pagoda.-Photo-by-Rafa-Esteve-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kew-Gardens-Great-Pagoda.-Photo-by-Rafa-Esteve-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"Kew Gardens Great Pagoda.

This is a tall order, no pun intended, for a wooden octagonal tower ten stories high that was built in 1762. Towering 50 meters (164 feet) above London, the Great Pagoda was unique for its time with its height, Chinese-inspired design and spectacular bird\u2019s eye view of the city. It was the highest Chinese-style building in Europe. A great many people doubted that so tall and thin a structure could even survive and expected it to fall down at any moment. Not everyone would have been unhappy with that outcome, mind you. Horace Walpole, antiquarian, author and son of Prime Minister Robert Walpole, disliked it immensely. He complained in correspondence with a friend that he could see it from his Strawberry Hill House, his Gothic estate in Twickenham, and that if it kept on like this, soon it could be seen from Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>Kew Gardens wasn\u2019t the national botanical garden then that it is now. That didn\u2019t happen until 1840. It started out as a private garden with a collection of exotic plants created by Lord Capel John of Tewkesbury on the grounds of Kew Park near Richmond Palace. After the 1751 death of Frederick, Prince of Wales, heir to the throne and father of the future King George III, his wife Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales, greatly expanded the little exotic garden. She commissioned architect Sir William Chambers, a favorite of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, Augusta\u2019s closest advisor (some said lover, some Svengali), to design several new structures and follies for Kew Gardens. Over the decades he built the Gallery of Antiquities (now demolished), the Temple of Pan (demolished), the Temple of the Sun (demolished), and still standing today, the Ruined Arch, the Temple of Bellona, the Temple of Aeolus, the Orangery and the Great Pagoda.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tao-Ho-pagoda-drawing-by-William-Chambers.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49395\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 102px) 100vw, 102px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tao-Ho-pagoda-drawing-by-William-Chambers-102x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tao-Ho-pagoda-drawing-by-William-Chambers-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tao-Ho-pagoda-drawing-by-William-Chambers-200x294.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tao-Ho-pagoda-drawing-by-William-Chambers-768x1128.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tao-Ho-pagoda-drawing-by-William-Chambers-430x631.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tao-Ho-pagoda-drawing-by-William-Chambers.jpg 1525w\" title=\"Tao Ho pagoda drawing by William Chambers.\" width=\"102\"/></a>Chambers was uniquely suited to that last task. Born in Sweden to a Scottish merchant, he had worked for the Swedish East India Company for almost a decade starting when he was 17 years old. While in its employ, Chambers went to China three times and dedicated himself to the study of Chinese architecture. When he came back to Europe for good, he chose to pursue architecture, studying with masters in Paris and Italy before opening starting his own firm in London in 1755. Just two years later, thanks to John Stuart, he had made the big time garnering an appointment as tutor in architecture to the Prince of Wales. That same year he published a book about Chinese architecture that made a huge splash and popularized Chinese style in design, fashion and the decorative arts. His list of subscribers might as well have been Debrett\u2019s Peerage \u2014 His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, Her Royal Highness the Princess Dowager of Wales, His Royal Highness the Duke, and a few rungs down on the ladder, the Earl of Bute.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how he described Chinese towers <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/DesignsChineseb00Cham#page/5/mode/1up\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in <em>Designs of Chinese Buildings, Furniture, Dresses, Machines, and Utensils</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The towers called by the Chinese <em>Taa</em>, and which the Europeans call likewise pagodas, are very common in China. In some provinces, says Du Halde, you find them in every town, and even in the large villages. The most considerable of them all are the famous porcelain-tower at Nang-Kingj, and that of Tong-Tchang-Fou, both of which are very magnificent structures. </p>\n<p>In regard to their form, the <em>Taas</em> are all nearly alike being of an octagonal figure, and consisting of seven, eight, and sometimes ten stories, which grow gradually less both in height and breadth all the way from the bottom to the top. Each story is finished with a kind of cornish, that supports a roof, at the angles of which hang little brass bells ; and round each story runs a narrow gallery, inclosed by a rail or balustrade. These buildings commonly terminate in a long pole, surrounded with several circles of iron, hanging by eight chains fixed to the top of the pole, and to the angles of the covering of the last story.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UB_Maastricht_-_Nieuhof_1665_-_Toren.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49393\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UB_Maastricht_-_Nieuhof_1665_-_Toren-150x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UB_Maastricht_-_Nieuhof_1665_-_Toren-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UB_Maastricht_-_Nieuhof_1665_-_Toren-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UB_Maastricht_-_Nieuhof_1665_-_Toren-768x494.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UB_Maastricht_-_Nieuhof_1665_-_Toren-430x277.jpg 430w\" title=\"Illustration of the Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing in the 1665 edition of Johan Nieuhof's Het Gezandtschap der Ne\u00earlandtsche Oost-Indische Compagnie.\" width=\"150\"/></a>He began construction on the Great Pagoda at Kew Gardens in 1761, four years after the book was published. Chambers followed the template he\u2019d written about in his book to the letter, using the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing as his model. He went for the most ambitious goal referenced in his book, the ten story tower, even though in reality Chinese towers have uneven numbers of floors, seven ideally. Each floor he made just 30 cm (12 inches) narrower than the one underneath it. It was also a riot of color originally. The roofs were tiled with varnished iron plates and had a dragon perched on each corner. The dragons were hand-carved out of wood and gilded. Over time the varnished iron roof tiles were replaced with slate and the dragons were removed in 1784 during roof repairs. Nobody knows for sure what became of them. Gossip has it that they were sold to pay King George IV\u2019s gambling debts, but they weren\u2019t made out of solid gold and you can\u2019t really hock gilded wood dragons. The true story, confirmed by at least one contemporary, is probably more mundane than that: they were simply neglected and rotted away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pagoda-roof-view-repaired-hole.-Kew-Gardens-Historic-Royal-Palaces..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Pagoda roof view of repaired hole from World War II bomb tests.

Piecemeal restorations have taken place since, mainly to the roofs \u2014 holes were cut in each floor during World War II so British bomb designers could test the trajectories and movements of their bombs when dropped \u2014 and while there was some talk of going for a larger magnitude reconstruction that would include replica dragons, nothing came of it for decades.</p>\n<p>Except for a brief window in 2006, the tower has been closed to the public. That sad loss is soon to be remedied, however, because the ambitious restoration is scheduled to be completed and the Great Pagoda reopened in all its iridescent 18th century glory come spring of 2018. And yes, there will be dragons. All 80 of them are going back to their respective corners. The eight dragons on the first roof will be carved by hand out of wood, just like the originals. The ones on the higher story will be more workmanlike, made out of nylon on 3D printers and virtually indestructible. </p>\n<p>Technology can only help so much. This is not a relatively simple matter of creating an exact copy of an existing object. Not only were all the dragons long gone decades before Louis Daguerre took that first picture of a Parisian street, but they aren\u2019t even any extant depictions of the dragons. Curators have had to rely on archival resources and research into the Chinoiserie style of the period to recreate the carving and paint colors.

Most of them, 60, were discovered in a ceramic pot stashed in a room of a structure from the Middle Assyrian period. It and two other vessels had been wrapped in a protective coating of clay, which was providence because the building itself was long-since destroyed. It might even have been a deliberate choice spurred by the tablets themselves.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe vessels may have been hidden this way shortly after the surrounding building was destroyed. Perhaps the information inside it was meant to be protected and preserved for posterity,\u201d [dig leader] Professor [Peter] Pf\u00e4lzner said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is not yet known if the tablets contain business, legal, or religious records.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur philologist, Dr. Betina Faist, deciphered one small fragment of a clay tablet. It mentions a temple to the goddess Gula, suggesting that we may be looking at a religious context.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope the texts will yield a wide variety of detail about the history, society, and culture of this little-researched area of northern Mesopotamia in the second millennium BC,\u201d he added.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A team from the Institute for Ancient Near Eastern Studies (IANES) at the University of T\u00fcbingen has been excavating the site near the town of Dohuk in the autonomous providence of Kurdistan, northern Iraq, since 2013. It was a statue fragment looted during from the Iraqi National Museum in 2003 during the chaotic period after the US invasion that tipped archaeologists off to Bassetki\u2019s potential significance. The statue in question was a cast copper base with human legs and lower body of a naked man which had been discovered in 1975 near the modern-day village of Bassetki. Even though the top of it is missing, it is still incredibly heavy at 150 kg (330 lb) and an inscription on the base tells of Akkadian king Naram-Sin (2254\u20132218 B.C.), grandson of Sargon the Great, first ruler of the Akkadian Empire. It recounts his successful suppression of a revolt, his elevation to the godhead by the residents of Akkad city and their construction of a temple to him in the city center.</p>\n<p>The statue, the only ancient object known to have been found in the Bassetki area, was later recovered by US troops who found it hidden in a cesspool behind the house of antiquities dealers suspected of trafficking in looted artifacts which they obviously were. The rediscovery of the enormously significant piece piqued the interest of Professor Peter Pf\u00e4lzner who, in collaboration with the Directorate of Antiquities in Dohuk, began to excavate Bassetki with the IANES team. They found that today\u2019s sleepy little village was preceeded by a bustling settlement that was founded around 3000 B.C. and thrived for at least 1200 years after that. As early as 2700 B.C. a defensive wall protecting the upper city from would-be marauders was already standing. The team also found large stone structures dating to around 1800 B.C. and Assyrian cuneiform tablet fragments from around 1300 B.C. Translations of the tablet remains, as much as they were possible, revealed there had once been a temple to the weather god Adad at Bassetki.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sheep-graze-in-the-shadow-of-Bassetki.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49386\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sheep-graze-in-the-shadow-of-Bassetki-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sheep-graze-in-the-shadow-of-Bassetki-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sheep-graze-in-the-shadow-of-Bassetki-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sheep-graze-in-the-shadow-of-Bassetki-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sheep-graze-in-the-shadow-of-Bassetki-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sheep graze in the shadow of ancient Mesopotamian site of Bassetki. The mound in the middle background is the archaeological site. Photo by Peter Pf\u00e4lzner.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Geomagnetic surveys also discovered a smattering of ruins outside the ancient downtown. There was a lower town about a half mile long, a complex network of roads, multiple residential neighborhoods, expensive and expansive homes of the wealthy and a monumental building of some sort dating to the Bronze Age. The town was hopping in its day, located on a highway dating to around 1800 B.C. that connected it to Mesopotamia and facilitated extensive trade. The whole time they were doing this work, by the way, they were less than 30 miles from ISIS-controlled territory. Archaeology ain\u2019t for the lily-livered.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOur finds provide evidence that this early urban center in northern Mesopotamia was settled almost continuously from approximately 3000 to 600 BC,\u201d Professor Pf\u00e4lzner said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat indicates that Bassetki was of key significance on important trade routes.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Most of the 93 recently-discovered cuneiform tablets were unfired, which always makes them a conservation and translation headache. They are brittle and easily worn by simple erosive elements. Their preservation challenges only increased when the building burned down around them. Researchers will study them with the latest and greatest equipment in the hope of being able to read at least part of the texts.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Cache of Assyrian cuneiform tablets found in Iraq\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49384\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49384#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-49376\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49376\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Looks like Obelix dropped something in Helvetia\">Looks like Obelix dropped something in Helvetia</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, October 27th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stone-block-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-49378\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stone-block-in-situ-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stone-block-in-situ-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stone-block-in-situ-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stone-block-in-situ-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stone-block-in-situ-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Stone block, possibly a Bronze Age menhir, in situ.

The location of the stone, equidistant from several Bronze Age houses, could imply that it played a role in the construction of the city, for example as a point of reference. Similarly, other blocks, which have not yet been exhumed, may have been around. It is also possible that the stone was used in earlier times, in the Neolithic, and that it was moved to make room for the construction of the Bronze Age houses.</p>\n<p>By its size and shape, the stone of Kehrsatz looks like a menhir (breton maen <stone>, hir <long>). This term refers to oblong, often uncut, isolated stones used to mark the location of places of worship or assembly. The megalithic alignments and dolmens (tumulus) of the Neolithic, about 4500 to 5000 years old, probably had similar functions. In Switzerland, there are about a hundred of these megalithic monuments, mainly in the Lake Geneva region, in Valais and at the foot of the Jura. In the canton of Bern, a dolmen used as a collective grave was updated a few years ago in Oberbipp.</long></stone></p>\n<p>To date, only about fifteen isolated menhirs have been discovered in Switzerland. These are usually simple blocks from one to four meters high. The best example of the canton of Bern is for the moment in Sutz-Lattrigen, on Lake Biel. The discovery of a menhir at Kehrsatz would therefore be an event. This interpretation must in any case be verified by examining other stones in the vicinity. This discovery would be all the more interesting because, with the exception of a few isolated finds, very little is known about the settlement in the Stone Age around the city of Bern.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The possible menhir has been raised and moved to an indoor facility where it can be protected from the elements and studied further. Once the site has been fully excavated, authorities plan to return the stone where it was found and put it on public display. Construction on the mixed-used development will proceed after excavations have been completed.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Block-raised.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-49379\" height=\"287\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Block-raised-430x287.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Block-raised-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Block-raised-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Block-raised-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Block-raised-768x512.jpg 768w\" title=\"Stone block raised for study and later exhibition to the public.

The ages of the objects vary significantly as well. The hoard was buried in the early 10th century, but the Carolingian pot was at least a century old by then, so it was likely kept as an heirloom for several generations before being used to hold the treasures it still contained a thousand years later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-ring-and-bird-pin-on-display.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-49366\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-ring-and-bird-pin-on-display-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-ring-and-bird-pin-on-display-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-ring-and-bird-pin-on-display-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-ring-and-bird-pin-on-display-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gold-ring-and-bird-pin-on-display-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold finger ring and unique gold bird-shaped pin on display at National Museums Scotland.

They are the remains of textiles that survived wrapped around several of the pieces stored inside the vessel and around the pot itself, plus leather and wood fragments. These exceedingly rare surviving organic materials, never found before in a hoard of this age, contain a wealth of information about the Viking Age, its travel and trade routes. They\u2019re also a major conservation challenge, which is one of the reasons the Galloway Hoard was not allocated to a Galloway museum. NMS has the resources, expertise and carefully controlled conservation environment to ensure the continued survival organic remains.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cross-on-display.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49367\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cross-on-display-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cross-on-display-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cross-on-display-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cross-on-display-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cross-on-display-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Silver and enamel cross on display at National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh this summer.

Marine astrolabes are very rare with only 108 of them known to exist. This one is the oldest of them all.</p>\n<p>When divers discovered the copper alloy disc in the debris field of the <em>Esmeralda</em>, a ship in da Gama\u2019s fleet that sank in 1503, there was no direct evidence on its surface of it being an astrolabe. All that was clearly visible were raised decorations \u2014 a Portuguese royal coat of arms and the <em>esfera armilar</em> (armillary sphere), King Manuel I\u2019s personal emblem \u2014 which identified it as Portuguese. There is no writing on the disk and no other artifacts that might shed light on some aspect of the disk (age, purpose) were discovered near the find spot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/front_stl_mesh.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49358\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/front_stl_mesh-146x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/front_stl_mesh-146x150.jpg 146w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/front_stl_mesh-200x205.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/front_stl_mesh-768x787.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/front_stl_mesh-430x440.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/front_stl_mesh.jpg 867w\" title=\"Scan of the front of the disk.

Its round shape, its dimensions (17.5cm in diameter, 1.5mm thick), the hole in the center and the remains of what was likely a suspension bracket at the top so it could be worn as around the neck suggested it might be a very early astrolabe. Age of Discovery marine astrolabes were generally heavier and ballasted so they could hang plumb for optimal calculations even on a swaying, bobbing, rearing ship in heavy winds.</p>\n<p>The <em>Esmeralda</em> disk doesn\u2019t have the weight or cutouts common to the more typical examples from the 16th century. Because of the significant design differences, the marine archaeologists who examined it could not compare it to its brethren to confirm whether it even was an astrolabe. They\u2019d need navigational markings to know for sure and while they thought there might be some very faint lines on the back, they were barely visible to the naked eye.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rear_with_gradient_lines_point_cloud.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49357\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rear_with_gradient_lines_point_cloud-142x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rear_with_gradient_lines_point_cloud-142x150.jpg 142w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rear_with_gradient_lines_point_cloud-200x212.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rear_with_gradient_lines_point_cloud-768x814.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rear_with_gradient_lines_point_cloud-430x456.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rear_with_gradient_lines_point_cloud.jpg 821w\" title=\"Back of the disk with etched gradient lines.

The high-tech scan and 3D model created from the data revealed that there were indeed markings on the disk, lines etched along the edges, each line exactly five degrees apart. Those are the navigational markings the team was looking for. Sailors used them to measure the height of the noonday sun to calculate their latitude on long voyages through wide-open seas. Vasco da Gama\u2019s second voyage to India in which the <em>Esmeralda</em> was lost took his fleet down all of west Africa, across the Cape of Good Hope, up the east coast to Mombasa and then east to India. It took years and was extremely dangerous. A tool that could give you some idea of where in the dickens you were was invaluable on journeys of such enormous scale.</p>\n<p>The precise date of manufacturer is unknown at this time, but it\u2019s decades older than the any other marine astrolabe we know of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Expedition leader David] Mearns said: \u201cWe know it had to have been made before 1502, because that\u2019s when the ship left Lisbon and Dom Manuel didn\u2019t become King until 1495, and this astrolabe wouldn\u2019t have carried the emblem of the King unless he was King.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s probably fair to say it dates roughly to between 1495 to 1500.

Her remains were found buried in the Huaca de los Idolos, a pyramidal structure made of overlapping platforms accessible via a central staircase built by the Norte Chico civilization, the oldest in the Americas which flourished in the area between the 4th and 2nd millennia B.C. She was carefully positioned in a crouch and wrapped in layers of textiles, a swath of cotton wrapped around her head, another cotton textile wrapped around body. Thus wrapped, her body was then bundled in a final layer, a reed fiber mat that was fastened closed with ropes. The mummy bundle was placed atop a stone basin containing plant matter offerings including a bowl of mate fragments, tubers and seeds. That was covered with a layers of ash and soil.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Drawing-of-mummy-bundle-layers.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49084\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Drawing-of-mummy-bundle-layers-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Drawing-of-mummy-bundle-layers-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Drawing-of-mummy-bundle-layers-200x199.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Drawing-of-mummy-bundle-layers-768x765.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Drawing-of-mummy-bundle-layers-430x428.jpg 430w\" title=\"Drawing of mummy bundle layers unwrapped.

They were placed on top of her shoulders and earned her her modern moniker. Underneath her where her tucked head almost touched her knees was a splendidly long necklace made of 460 white mollusk shell beads with a large pendant made from the shell of the spondylus mollusk. This was a rare and luxurious item that attests to her high position in Apero society, as do the tupu fasteners.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooches-found-in-the-mummy-bundle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49086\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooches-found-in-the-mummy-bundle-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooches-found-in-the-mummy-bundle-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooches-found-in-the-mummy-bundle-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooches-found-in-the-mummy-bundle-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooches-found-in-the-mummy-bundle-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bone brooches found in the mummy bundle.

Covering more than 150 acres in area and inhabited by 3,000 people at its peak, it one of the largest Norte Chico sites known and its most thoroughly studied. No evidence has been found of defensive structures \u2014 no walls, no earthenware ditches, no battlements \u2014 nor have any weapons, mass graves or other indicators of warfare. Neither have archaeologists found remains suggesting the Norte Chico peoples practiced human sacrifice as later civilizations like the Incas would. About 14 miles from the main city of Caral, Apero was Caral\u2019s harbour town and its primary source of fish.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Howler-monkey-brooch.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49081\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Howler-monkey-brooch-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Howler-monkey-brooch-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Howler-monkey-brooch-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Howler-monkey-brooch-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Howler-monkey-brooch-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Howler monkey brooch.

This was not a simple task. Her skull is 4,500 years old, after all, and has areas that are missing or severely stained by the decomposition process and the remains of the organic materials she was wrapped in. Brazilian 3D computer graphic artist Cicero Moraes was enlisted to turn that skull into a face. It took him two months to fill the gaps in the skull, replacing the missing eye socket by mirroring the complete one, comparing the Lady\u2019s skull with that of a modern Peruvian woman of similar age and genetic ancestry and utilizing computer technology that simulates natural facial muscles using the skull as a foundation.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Comparing-a-modern-female-skull-of-compatible-ancestry-R-and-age-with-the-skull-of-the-ancient-mummy-L-which-has-a-robust-jaw-and-flattened-head.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-49079\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Comparing-a-modern-female-skull-of-compatible-ancestry-R-and-age-with-the-skull-of-the-ancient-mummy-L-which-has-a-robust-jaw-and-flattened-head-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Comparing-a-modern-female-skull-of-compatible-ancestry-R-and-age-with-the-skull-of-the-ancient-mummy-L-which-has-a-robust-jaw-and-flattened-head-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Comparing-a-modern-female-skull-of-compatible-ancestry-R-and-age-with-the-skull-of-the-ancient-mummy-L-which-has-a-robust-jaw-and-flattened-head-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Comparing-a-modern-female-skull-of-compatible-ancestry-R-and-age-with-the-skull-of-the-ancient-mummy-L-which-has-a-robust-jaw-and-flattened-head-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Comparing-a-modern-female-skull-of-compatible-ancestry-R-and-age-with-the-skull-of-the-ancient-mummy-L-which-has-a-robust-jaw-and-flattened-head-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"The modern female skull of compatible ancestry and age (L) compared with the skull of the ancient mummy (R) which has a robust jaw and flattened head.

What\u2019s the point of using all those complex data tables and software to build up the soft tissues in an anatomically accurate manner if you\u2019re going to gin up the bones they map to because you think a lady\u2019s jawline isn\u2019t dainty enough?<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThis bizarre choice is covered in the news stories and press materials entirely without comment as if it were totally ho-hum and not worth addressing. They just get right to the (admittedly compelling) finished digital reconstruction, unveiled Wednesday, October 11th, by the Ministry of Culture in Lima. I get it, because I\u2019m always curious about facial reconstructions and have covered several, but I\u2019ve never seen this kind of deliberate modification based on perceived chin cuteness and the artist\u2019s preferred head shape. So I\u2019d like to tell here she is, but the best I can do is say here are a few parts of her, including how her handsome adornments looked when worn.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Peruvian-mummy-facial-reconstruction.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-49082\" height=\"212\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Peruvian-mummy-facial-reconstruction-430x212.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Peruvian-mummy-facial-reconstruction-430x212.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Peruvian-mummy-facial-reconstruction-150x74.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Peruvian-mummy-facial-reconstruction-200x99.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Peruvian-mummy-facial-reconstruction-768x379.jpg 768w\" title=\"Stages of facial reconstruction.

Her intensive research on Roman hairstyling coming from her perspective as a professional stylist, a unique viewpoint that gave her special insight into an arena most historians know nothing about, led her to fascinating discoveries like that Roman matrons likely had their elaborate braided updos sewn together instead of wearing wigs.

The good news is that even though the busts are still on shelves up against the walls facing the room, many of the female portraits have been turned just enough that you can see the sides and back of their hair. You might have to crane a bit to do it, but it is now possible to see the business end of the Roman women\u2019s hairstyles and even get a pretty decent picture of several of the most interesting ones. Yes, some Stretch Armstronging is required, but nothing too contortionist for single-jointed, non-rubberized people to handle.</p>\n<p>I looked for hair that I couldn\u2019t recall having seen her recreate on her YouTube channel yet and that had some intricate elements to it. Nobody famous, therefore, because Janet has already done quite a few empresses and society leaders. My final choices range in date from the 1st century A.D. through the 4th, and all these nameless Roman ladies have in common are great ornatrices and fly dos.</p>\n<p><center><a

Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times.\" width=\"200\"/></a>On Thursday evening, a section of marble <em>opus sectile</em> flooring from a great barge built by the infamous Emperor Caligula <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/design/a-remnant-from-caligulas-ship-once-a-coffee-table-heads-home.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was officially returned to Italy</a>. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. confiscated the piece (which was being used as a coffee table in New York City) last month as part of an investigation into antiquities trafficking. The investigation revealed the true origin of the \u201ccoffee table\u201d was one of the Ships of Nemi, built around 35 A.D., and that it had been stolen from Italy during World War II. It was made into a table top and acquired by a Park Avenue antiques dealer who kept it for almost five decades without realizing its unique history and inestimable archaeological value.</p>\n<p>The Ships of Nemi were the only known examples of Roman ceremonial parade barges, not so much functional ships as massive floating palaces. Caligula\u2019s were decorated with the same luxurious materials and architectural finishes found in an early imperial terrestrial palace: lavish marble inlay floors, statuary, fountains, gardens, heated baths and even a temple to Diana. They were so huge \u2014 the largest 73 meters long by 24 meters wide, the smaller 71 x 20 \u2014 that they would barely have had any room to maneuver on the surface of the small Lake Nemi. The emperor likely used them as extensions to his lakeside villa, follies harkening back to the pleasure barges of Greece and Egypt of the type enjoyed by his ancestor Marc Anthony during his years at the side of Queen Cleopatra. They may have been used to celebrate the festival of <em>Isidis Navigium</em>, a ritual dedicated to Isis in her role as protector of sailors that took place on March 15th to reopen the navigation season.</p>\n<p>After Caligula was assassinated in 41 A.D., the barges were sunk in Lake Nemi and all knowledge of their connection to the emperor was lost. Fishermen pulled up ancient maritime artifacts from the wreck sites for centuries, and their tales of Roman treasure ships wrecked in antiquity lying on the lake bed were widely known in Italy. The first attempts to raise the barges took place in the 15th century when architect Leon Battista Alberti was commissioned by Cardinal Prospero Colonna to recover what was then believed to be a single wreck. Alberti built a floating platform from which he dropped ropes fixed to harpoons. It wasn\u2019t just a failure, it was enormously destructive. The scale of the barges and their depth (about 60 feet below the surface) made getting purchase on the whole structure impossible. The hooks tore up hunks of wood which Alberti studied, learning for the first time that some were sheathed in lead. He also recovered some lead piping whose maker\u2019s marks were erroneously associated with Tiberius and later Trajan, but the project never went any further.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Second-Nemi-ship-emerges.-Museo-scienza-e-tecnologia-Milano.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-49300\" height=\"138\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Second-Nemi-ship-emerges.-Museo-scienza-e-tecnologia-Milano-200x138.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Second-Nemi-ship-emerges.-Museo-scienza-e-tecnologia-Milano-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Second-Nemi-ship-emerges.-Museo-scienza-e-tecnologia-Milano-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Second-Nemi-ship-emerges.-Museo-scienza-e-tecnologia-Milano-768x529.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Second-Nemi-ship-emerges.-Museo-scienza-e-tecnologia-Milano-430x296.jpg 430w\" title=\"Second barge emerges from Lake Nemi. Museo Scienza e Tecnologia di Milano.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Later attempts to explore the wrecks weren\u2019t salvage operations so much as straight looting expeditions. Pieces of wood were pried off the ships and carved into curios for the tourist trade. Bronze oar locks sculpted into the shape of lions\u2019 heads were sold to antiques collectors. Finally in 1928 a pioneering maritime excavation was initiated to save the Nemi ships from the depredations of time and covetous people. The water level of the lake was lowered to expose the remains of the barges. They looked great, but decay set in immediately as soon as they were exposed to the air. With no means to preserve the delicate wood, experts suspended the project in 1930, resuming only when the government agreed to build a museum on the spot, right over the wrecks. That would keep them safe from the elements.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.museonaviromane.it/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Museo delle Navi Romane</a> opened on the shores of Lake Nemi in 1936, a proud Benito Mussolini presiding over the inauguration. Only eight years later, these one-of-a-kind survivals of Roman shipbuilding burned to the ground the night of May 31st, 1944. Allied bombs hit the museum in response to Nazi anti-aircraft artillery. Museum staff also report having seen German troops going through the museum that night with a torch, so it\u2019s possible they burned it down themselves because they sucked so hard. By the time US troops arrived on June 4th, the only artifacts left in the museum were a few of the salvage items recovered from the wrecks before they were raised.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Museo-delle-Navi-Romane-Nemi.-Beni-Culturali..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-49301\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Museo-delle-Navi-Romane-Nemi.-Beni-Culturali.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Museo-delle-Navi-Romane-Nemi.-Beni-Culturali.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Museo-delle-Navi-Romane-Nemi.-Beni-Culturali.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Museo-delle-Navi-Romane-Nemi.-Beni-Culturali.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Museo-delle-Navi-Romane-Nemi.-Beni-Culturali.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scale reproductions of the lost ships in the museum today.

This one piece of marble mosaic floor is one of only a handful of objects still known to exist from the Nemi Ships.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The antiques dealer, Helen Fioratti, said she and her husband, Nereo Fioratti, a journalist, had bought the mosaic in good faith in the late 1960s from a member of an aristocratic family. The sale was brokered, she said, by an Italian police official famed for his success in recovering artwork looted by the Nazis.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was an innocent purchase,\u201d Ms. Fioratti said in an interview. \u201cIt was our favorite thing and we had it for 45 years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Fioratti, who owns L\u2019Antiquaire and the Connoisseur, a noted gallery for antiques from Europe on East 73rd Street, said she did not intend to fight the seizure because of the expense and time it would take. Still, she said she believes she has a legitimate claim to ownership. \u201cThey ought to give me the legion of honor for not fighting it,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>For her part, Ms. Fioratti said she had no papers proving ownership and she could not remember what her husband had paid for the mosaic. She said he had learned about the piece from a friend, who told him the aristocratic family was looking for a buyer.</p>\n<p>When the piece arrived at their Park Avenue home, they paid to have a marble frame attached to the square of flooring and then put it on a pedestal in their living room. Over the years, Ms. Fioratti said, curators who visited had told her they were interested in procuring it for their collections. \u201cI could have made a fortune,\u201d she said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pardon me while I roll my eyes as far back as humanly possible.

British Museum\u2019s Middle East curator and foremost cuneiform expert, outdid himself in that video where he <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47491\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">played the Royal Game of Ur</a>, you\u2019re going to love his Halloween themed video. In it he summarizes in his characterstically witty style the inscructions for necromancy, raising the dead for the purpose of foretelling the future, found on a tablet (<a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?assetId=109579001&amp;objectId=310760&amp;partId=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">K.2779</a>) in the British Museum.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oq2ccSZkmn8?rel=0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Written in Neo-Babylonian in the 7th century B.C., the tablet was one of tens of thousands discovered at Nineveh that were part of what is known as the Library of Ashurbanipal. Only the top half of it and a few fragments have survived so we don\u2019t have the full recipe for conjuring the spirits of the dead, sad to say, and there are a few lines of magical incantantions that are untranslatable because they were written in what scholars think may be a mixed-up kind of Sumerian seeing as by the 1st milennium B.C. nobody could speak the real thing anymore. This kind of magic-speak has been found on tablets before, including ones dealing with necromancy. </p>\n<p>There aren\u2019t a great many specifically dedicated to the raising of ghosts and questioning them, interestingly enough. The namburbi genre this tablet is a part of usually deals with warnings and magic to repel ghosts and contain the damage they can do. Tablet 2779 is unusual in that it covers both subjects: how to raise the ghost and then how to prevent its evil from harming the home and its residents. As it was not incised in Nineveh, it\u2019s likely the tablet was brought to the library in a deliberate attempt to flesh out the collection in subject areas that were sparsely covered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/109579001.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-49435\" height=\"167\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/109579001-200x167.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/109579001-200x167.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/109579001-150x125.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/109579001-768x641.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/109579001-430x359.jpg 430w\" title=\"Tablet K.2779, Neo-Babylonian, 7th century B.C. Photo courtesy the Trustees of the British Museum.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Here\u2019s a translation of the surviving cuneiform from K.2279, minus the couple of lines of untranslatable verse:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An incantation to enable a man to see a ghost.</p>\n<p>Its ritual: (you crush) mouldy wood, fresh leaves of Euphrates poplar in water, oil, beer (and) wine. You dry, crush and sieve snake-tallow, lion-tallow, crab-tallow, white honey, a frog (that lives) among the pebbles, hair of a dog, hair of a cat, hair of a fox, bristle of a chameleon (and) bristle of a (red) lizard, \u201cclaw\u201d of a frog, end-of-intestines of a frog, the left wing of a grasshopper, (and) marrow from the long bone of a goose.  You mix (all this) (in) wine, water (and) milk with amhara plant. You recite the incantation three times and you anoint your eyes (with it) and you will see the ghost: he will speak with you. You can look at the ghost: he will talk with you.</p>\n<p>In order to avert the evil (inherent) in a ghost\u2019s cry you (sic) crush a potsherd from a ruined tell in water. He should sprinkle the house (with this water). For three days he should make offerings to the family ghosts.</p>\n<p>He should pour out beer (flavoured with) roast barley. He should scatter juniper over a censer before Samas, pour out prime beer, offer a resent to Samas, and recite as follows:</p>\n<p>O Samas, Judge of Heaven and Underworld, Foremost One of the Anunnaki!<br/>\nO Samas, Judge of all the Lands, Samas Foremost and Resplendent One!<br/>\nYou keep them in check, O Samas, the Judge. You carry those from Above down to Below,<br/>\nThose from Below up to Above. The ghost who has cried out in my house, whether of (my) father or mother, whether (my) brother or sister,<br/>\nWhether a forgotten son of someone, whether a vagrant ghost show has no-one to care for it,<br/>\nAn offering has been made for him! Water has been poured out for him! May the evil in his cry away behin him!<br/>\nLet the evil in his evil cry not come near me! &lt;\u2026&gt; You do this repeatedly for three days, and &lt;\u2026&gt;</p>\n<p>You wash his hands, you anoint him with U.SIKIL: \u201cIt is finished\u201d: in oil.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love that they pour out beer for him. Very 90s rap.</p>\n<p>The only negative thing I can say about Finkel\u2019s explanation of the tablet is that it\u2019s way too short. I\u2019m hoping he does what he did with Ur and films himself actually performing the ritual. He\u2019s already scared up a suitable skull (Mesopotamian, one hopes, although there is nothing in the literature that suggests the skulls used in these rituals needed to have belonged to any specific individual, group or time period). It\u2019s just the ingredients for the magical brew he\u2019s having difficulty obtaining. That, Dr. Finkel, is what the Internet is for. All you need is a little viral luck and within days you will be inundated with sufficient snake tallow, frog end-of-intestines and chameleon bristles to raise an army of the dead.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Irving Finkel on how to raise the dead\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49418\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>"}

Moctezuma either gave it to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s as a gift upon his arrival at Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire and modern day Mexico City, or it was pillaged by Cort\u00e9s\u2019 forces after the siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521. \n There is no record of where it was taken, nor is there any evidence that it belonged to Moctezuma. We don\u2019t even know for sure that it\u2019s a headdress. It doesn\u2019t match any of the headdresses depicted in contemporary accounts. In the 19th century the assumption was that it was a mantle, and recent scholarship suggests they might have been right about it being a mantle, but that it was worn by a priest to ritually transform him into the incarnation of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, rather than by the king. \n What we do know is that by 1575 it was in the extensive private collection of Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, at Ambras Castle in Innsbruck. Ferdinand was the nephew of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V who was also King of Spain during the Conquista. He could easily have gotten his hands on the headdress via his family connections. \n It remained in the castle until the early 19th century when Vienna\u2019s Museum of Ethnology was entrusted with most of the Castle Ambras collection. The headdress was the subject of much anthropological fascination from then on, including from Zelia Nuttall, the American archaeologist, anthropologist and expert in pre-Columbian Mexico who in 1890 first identified it as an Aztec \u201cquetzalapanecayotl\u201d or a featherwork crown. \n The piece is 46 inches high at the peak and 69 inches wide. In addition to the 400 dramatic quetzal tail feathers that adorn the outer layer, there are rows of blue Lovely Cotinga feathers, pink flamingo feathers, smaller quetzal feathers and white and red feathers from the squirrel cuckoo. The inner rings are studded with gold and gemstones. The Aztecs venerated the Resplendent Quetzal as the god of the air, a symbol of rebirth and of freedom. \n Given its beauty, historical significance and powerful symbolism, it\u2019s no surprise that the headdress has been the subject of a long-standing dispute between Mexico and Austria. There are no Aztec headdresses left in Mexico because the Spanish took them all \u2014 the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City only has a replica of Moctezuma\u2019s headdress on display \u2014 so Mexico has been trying for decades to get this one back, even going so far as to petition the United Nations for its return, but to no avail. \n In 2008, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) entered into talks with the Austrian Government and the Kunsthistorisches Museum, the parent institution of the Museum of Ethnology. They agreed first to do an extensive scientific analysis on the headdress to assess its condition and do any conservation necessary that will allow the piece to travel. In 2011, a tentative deal was struck: Mexico would officially recognize Austria\u2019s uncontested ownership of the headdress, Austria would loan Mexico the headdress and in return Mexico would loan Austria the golden stagecoach of Maximilian I of Mexico, emperor of the Second Mexican Empire (1863-1867) and brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. \n There was still one major stumbling block, however. According to Mexican law, all pre-Columbian artifacts belong to the nation. Once they cross the border, no matter who else might lay claim to them, they become property of the state and cannot leave the country. No matter the terms of the loan agreement, Austria had no intention of letting the headdress into Mexico until the government\u2019s assurances had the force of law. \n A new bilateral cultural exchange agreement between Austria and Mexico that would resolve the issue has just been approved by the Mexican Senate and Austria\u2019s cabinet. The Senate\u2019s amendments to the cultural property law allow for long-term loans of artifacts while acknowledging the lender\u2019s ownership rights. Austria\u2019s legislature has to approve the deal, which is expected to happen within the next few months, and both parties need to sort out how to transport the fragile headdress without damaging it, but it looks like the biggest obstacle to the return of this glorious symbol of Mexican heritage might just have been overcome. \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0

The Aztecs venerated the Resplendent Quetzal as the god of the air, a symbol of rebirth and of freedom.</p>\n<p>Given its beauty, historical significance and powerful symbolism, it\u2019s no surprise that the headdress has been the subject of a long-standing dispute between Mexico and Austria. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Replica of Moctezuma's headdress at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16461\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Replica of Moctezuma's headdress at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City\" width=\"200\"/></a>There are no Aztec headdresses left in Mexico because the Spanish took them all \u2014 the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City only has a replica of Moctezuma\u2019s headdress on display \u2014 so Mexico has been trying for decades to get this one back, even going so far as to petition the United Nations for its return, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>In 2008, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) entered into talks with the Austrian Government and the Kunsthistorisches Museum, the parent institution of the Museum of Ethnology. They agreed first to do an extensive scientific analysis on the headdress to assess its condition and do any conservation necessary that will allow the piece to travel. <a href=\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?articleid=384813&amp;categoryid=13003\" target=\"_blank\">In 2011, a tentative deal was struck</a>: Mexico would officially recognize Austria\u2019s uncontested ownership of the headdress, Austria would loan Mexico the headdress and in return Mexico would loan Austria the golden stagecoach of Maximilian I of Mexico, emperor of the Second Mexican Empire (1863-1867) and brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.</p>\n<p>There was still one major stumbling block, however. According to Mexican law, all pre-Columbian artifacts belong to the nation. Once they cross the border, no matter who else might lay claim to them, they become property of the state and cannot leave the country. No matter the terms of the loan agreement, Austria had no intention of letting the headdress into Mexico until the government\u2019s assurances had the force of law.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=498266&amp;CategoryId=14091\" target=\"_blank\">new bilateral cultural exchange agreement</a> between Austria and Mexico that would resolve the issue has just been approved by the Mexican Senate and Austria\u2019s cabinet. The Senate\u2019s amendments to the cultural property law allow for long-term loans of artifacts while acknowledging the lender\u2019s ownership rights. Austria\u2019s legislature has to approve the deal, which is expected to happen within the next few months, and both parties need to sort out how to transport the fragile headdress without damaging it, but it looks like the biggest obstacle to the return of this glorious symbol of Mexican heritage might just have been overcome.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mexico inches closer to loan of Moctezuma\u2019s headdress\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16445\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16445#comments\">18 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16411\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16411\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Fall into LoC\u2019s rabbit hole of performing arts posters\">Fall into LoC\u2019s rabbit hole of performing arts posters</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, April 29th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/aida.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Aida, 1908\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16427\" height=\"95\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/aida-150x95.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/aida-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/aida-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/aida-430x275.jpg 430w\" title=\"Aida, 1908\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Library of Congress\u2019 online <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/library/libarch-digital.html\" target=\"_blank\">collections of historical images</a> are some of my favorite time sinks.

Sometimes it\u2019s the little guy who has the best graphics. The Minstrel Poster Collection is, as the name suggests, chock full o\u2019 racist caricatures. Those shows were popular for an incredibly long time. The <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/var/item/var1993000238/PP/\" target=\"_blank\">oldest poster in the collection</a> dates to 1847, the pre-Civil War heyday of white actors blackening their faces with burnt cork and acting like buffoons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/New-Orleans-Ethiopian-Serenaders-1847.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The New Orleans Ethiopian Serenaders, 1847\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-16435\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 78px) 100vw, 78px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/New-Orleans-Ethiopian-Serenaders-1847-78x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/New-Orleans-Ethiopian-Serenaders-1847-78x150.jpg 78w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/New-Orleans-Ethiopian-Serenaders-1847-157x300.jpg 157w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/New-Orleans-Ethiopian-Serenaders-1847-419x800.jpg 419w\" title=\"The New Orleans Ethiopian Serenaders, 1847\" width=\"78\"/></a>The troupe advertised in the poster, the New Orleans Ethiopian Serenaders (also known as Buckley\u2019s Serenaders after troupe leader James Buckley), were touring England at the time where they were a notable success. Contrary to the standard song and dance style of minstrel shows, the New Orleans Ethiopian Serenaders\u2019 1847 performance at London\u2019s Princess Theater kicked off with a burlesque version of the opera <em>La Sonnambula</em> by Vincenzo Bellini. This became something of a trademark for Buckley\u2019s shows even when they returned to the United States and set up permanent shop in a theater on Broadway until it closed in 1862.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Burlesque-Nettie-Barton-1899.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Burlesque performer Nettie Barton, 1899\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16424\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 74px) 100vw, 74px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Burlesque-Nettie-Barton-1899-74x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Burlesque-Nettie-Barton-1899-74x150.jpg 74w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Burlesque-Nettie-Barton-1899-148x300.jpg 148w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Burlesque-Nettie-Barton-1899-396x800.jpg 396w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Burlesque-Nettie-Barton-1899.jpg 1523w\" title=\"Burlesque performer Nettie Barton, 1899\" width=\"74\"/></a>The Theatrical Poster Collection has the lion\u2019s share of art works, over 1800 posters covering multiple genres of variety stage theater.

She was something of a prodigy, debuting as Lucia in Donizetti\u2019s <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em> in 1859 when she was just 16 years old. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Adelina_Patti.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Adelina Patti\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-16418\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 79px) 100vw, 79px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Adelina_Patti-79x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Adelina_Patti-79x150.jpg 79w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Adelina_Patti-159x300.jpg 159w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Adelina_Patti-424x800.jpg 424w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Adelina_Patti.jpg 815w\" title=\"Adelina Patti\" width=\"79\"/></a>Two years later, she was invited to perform at Covent Garden in a non-burlesque version of <em>La Sonnambula</em> and was a smash hit. She continued to be a smash for decades, even though her voice changed and deepened as she aged. Verdi adored her, calling her the greatest singer who ever lived. In 1862, she performed the popular song \u201cHome, Sweet Home\u201d at the White House for President Abraham Lincoln and First Lady Mary Todd. They were moved to tears and asked her to sing it again. After that, the song became a signature piece for her.</p>\n<p>By the time of the male (1898), Black (1899) and child (1894) Pattis, the original Patti was in her 50s singing at her mature peak, making thousands of dollars a night which she insisted be paid to her in gold before every performance. She retired from public performance in the early 1900s, but still put on the occasional private or charity concert. Her bags of gold and smart investments ensured that her retirement was a luxurious one. She died in 1919 and is buried at Paris\u2019 P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/The-Black-Patti-Mme.-M.-Sissieretta-Jones-1899.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The Black Patti, Mme.

M. Sissieretta Jones, 1899\" width=\"100\"/></a>I very much doubt the other Pattis were so fortunate. I couldn\u2019t find out what happened to Stuart and Louise Marguerite, but Matilda Sissieretta Joyner Jones was a pioneer and a trailblazer. She\u2019s probably the only one of the three who came by her moniker legitimately, since it was Adelina Patti\u2019s manager who saw her perform in 1888 and suggested she take her soprano virtuosity on tour. In 1892 she was the first African American to sing at New York\u2019s Music Hall (renamed Carnegie Hall a year later). That same year she sang at the White House for President Benjamin Harrison. She would sing for the next three presidents after him \u2014 Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt \u2014 and for the British royal family.</p>\n<p>Despite her success as a soprano in Europe and the United States, she soon hit the segregation ceiling. When she found that the major opera houses like the Metropolitan would not hire a black artist, she formed a troupe of her own, the Black Patti Troubadours, and went on the road with a musical review that included vaudeville and minstrel acts as well as greatest hits of opera, not just arias but fully staged scenes. The troupe was a success for two decades and earned her a great deal of money.</p>\n<p>She retired in 1915 at the age of 46 due to illness and to care for her sick mother in Providence, Rhode Island. The money she had made sadly did not last. Eventually she had to sell all her properties, her awards, and her trophies just to pay the bills.

After 11 years of Puritan rule under Cromwell (and briefly his son), the return of the monarch ushered in an era of newly permissive social mores. Theaters reopened and for the first time in England, they were licensed to allow women to tread the boards instead of the young men in drag who used to play all the female roles.</p>\n<p>Two of these new English actresses would become famous mistresses of Charles II. Their portraits are on display at the Hampton Court Palace show along with the portraits of Charles\u2019 other major mistresses, together in one exhibit for the first time. In contrast to the formality of earlier court portraiture, these paintings are considerably more revealing. Nell Gwynne, one of the actresses Charles plucked from the theater and installed in mansions, posed nude as Venus in a less than modest pose. With her is her and King Charles\u2019 illegitimate son Charles Beauclerk, who is portrayed as Cupid.</p>\n<p>Themes explored in the exhibit are the association of beauty with virtue and how indulgence of the senses in pursuit of beauty could be justified as a spiritual pursuit; also featured are some of the shameless libertines who cut a swath through the ladies of the court.</p>\n<p>On a lighter note of ribaldry, Hampton Court Palace has created a companion website called <a href=\"http://www.askchiffinch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ask Chiffinch</a> on which <a href=\"http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/wchiffinch.html\" target=\"_blank\">William Chiffinch</a>, Page of his Majesty\u2019s Bed-Chamber and Keeper of the King\u2019s Private Closet, aka the King\u2019s \u201cPimpmaster General,\u201d answers questions from the lovelorn in 17th century style.

The battle between the Protestant forces of King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden and the Catholic Habsburg imperial army led by Czech General Albrecht von Wallenstein took place over four hours in the afternoon of November 16 (according to the Gregorian calendar used by the Catholic Holy Roman Empire and us; November 6 according to the Julian calendar used by the Protestant Swedes), 1632.

They\u2019ve taken a more high-tech approach to the recovery of the human remains, however. To excavate the mass grave under ideal conditions, without interference from bad weather, hooligans, and environmental contaminants, the entire grave, all 452 square feet and 55 tons of it, was cut out of the earth by heavy machinery. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Raising-the-mass-grave-soil-block.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Cranes lift huge block of soil encasing the mass grave\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16395\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Raising-the-mass-grave-soil-block-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Raising-the-mass-grave-soil-block-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Raising-the-mass-grave-soil-block-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Raising-the-mass-grave-soil-block-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Raising-the-mass-grave-soil-block.jpg 850w\" title=\"Cranes lift huge block of soil encasing the mass grave\" width=\"150\"/></a>The solid block of soil and human remains was split in two to make it easier to transport, then carried on flatbed trucks to the laboratory of the Saxony-Anhalt State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology 45 minutes away in Halle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bodies-excavated-in-one-of-the-blocks.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bodies excavated in the lab from one of the blocks\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-16396\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bodies-excavated-in-one-of-the-blocks-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bodies-excavated-in-one-of-the-blocks-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bodies-excavated-in-one-of-the-blocks-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bodies-excavated-in-one-of-the-blocks-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Bodies-excavated-in-one-of-the-blocks.jpg 850w\" title=\"Bodies excavated in the lab from one of the blocks\" width=\"150\"/></a>At first <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20120324-41541.html\" target=\"_blank\">archaeologists estimated there were around 75 bodies buried</a> naked, unarmed, close together in layers. After months of close examination in the lab that estimate has more than doubled, but they\u2019re still in the early stages of excavation and only 20 bodies have been unearthed thus far, one layer from one of the blocks. They were indeed buried naked, without weapons or personal effects, close together with their legs facing each other.</p>\n<p>It was the people of L\u00fctzen who removed the dead from the battlefield and buried them carefully on the side of the road. The soldiers who survived the battle were immediately shipped off to the next battle. The job was so overwhelming the townspeople asked soldiers in the nearby garrison of Weissenfels to help them.

Soldiers from Scotland, England, Croatia, Germany, Austria, Finland and Sweden all fought in the battle. Strontium isotope analysis on their bones will hopefully provide information on their recent travels, and strontium isotope analysis on their teeth will shed light on where they spent their childhoods. Osteological examination has already returned evidence of perimortem injuries, like skull fractures and a lead bullet recovered from a pelvic bone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mass-grave-detail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Died November 16, 1632\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-16393\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mass-grave-detail-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mass-grave-detail-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mass-grave-detail-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mass-grave-detail-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mass-grave-detail.jpg 850w\" title=\"Died November 16, 1632\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Battle of L\u00fctzen was in theory a Protestant victory. Wallenstein\u2019s imperial forces left the field to the armies of the Swedish King who accomplished their primary goal of stopping the Catholic advance into Saxony. However, the Catholics lost fewer men and most saliently, they didn\u2019t lose their leader. Gustavus Adolphus\u2019 death left the Protestant forces confused and demoralized, leaving the French to take the dominant role in the anti-Hapsburg alliance. The war went on for another 16 years until the Peace of Westphalia finally put an end to it in 1648.</p>\n<p>The spot on the L\u00fctzen battlefield where King Gustav II Adolf fell was marked by a granite boulder the day after the battle. It\u2019s called the Schwedenstein, or Swedes\u2019 Stone, and is still marking the spot today.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mass grave from bloody 30 Years\u2019 War battle found\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16383\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16383#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16363\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16363\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Opera glasses Lincoln was holding when shot on sale\">Opera glasses Lincoln was holding when shot on sale</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, April 26th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lincoln-opera-glasses.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Abraham Lincoln's Black enameled Gebruder Strausshof Optiker, Berlin opera glasses\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16371\" height=\"146\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lincoln-opera-glasses-200x146.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lincoln-opera-glasses-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lincoln-opera-glasses-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lincoln-opera-glasses-430x315.jpg 430w\" title=\"Abraham Lincoln's Black enameled Gebruder Strausshof Optiker, Berlin opera glasses\" width=\"200\"/></a>The opera glasses Abraham Lincoln brought to Ford\u2019s Theater to view \u201cOur American Cousin\u201d in binocular close-up on the night he was assassinated are <a href=\"http://www.natedsanders.com/LotDetail.aspx?lotid=2266&amp;searchby=0&amp;searchvalue=None&amp;page=0&amp;sortby=0&amp;displayby=2&amp;lotsperpage=25&amp;category=17&amp;seo=Abraham-Lincoln\" target=\"_blank\">going up for sale</a> at Nate D.

Three doctors who happened to be at the theater that night attended the mortally wounded President in the box, and then decided to move him. A shockless carriage ride to the White House being out of the question, the doctors, some soldiers in the audience and an on-duty Washington City Guard and Union veteran Captain named James M. McCamly carried Lincoln\u2019s unconscious body across the street to William Petersen\u2019s boarding house.</p>\n<p>While crossing the street, McCamly saw a pair of opera glasses fall from Lincoln\u2019s body. He picked them up and pocketed them, barely paying attention. He remained at the vigil all night. At 7:22 AM, April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln died. After the President\u2019s body was brought to the White House, McCamly was relieved of duty and went home to finally get some sleep. It was at his quarters that he realized he still had the opera glasses.</p>\n<p>Captain McCamly commanded the Veteran Reserve Corps honor guard that accompanied Lincoln\u2019s body back to Springfield, Illinois for the funeral. The men of the honor guard were the only ones allowed to move the coffin. James McCamly was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for this somber service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Parks-confirmation.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"1968 letter from Chief Curator of the National Park Service Harold L.

Most relevant in terms of authentication, in 1968 the Chief Curator of the National Park Service, Harold L. Peterson, wrote to Robert C. Hartt, Mrs. James McCamly\u2019s great-grandson, that he had checked the opera glasses against the carrying case that is in the Ford\u2019s Theatre National Park Collection and found that they \u201cprecisely fit the opera glass case.\u201d</p>\n<p>The opera glasses remained in McCamly\u2019s family for three generations until they were sold in 1979 to magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes Sr. The current owner is anonymous. The last time the glasses were offered for sale in June 2011, with a pre-sale estimate of $500,000 to $700,000, they failed to sell. The Sanders\u2019 estimate is the same exact range, $500,000 to $700,000. It\u2019s three days before the auction and already 14 online bids have brought the price to $252,582.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m guessing at these prices the National Park Service isn\u2019t in the bidding, which is a big shame because it would be great if the glasses and the case could be reunited in the Ford\u2019s Theater collection.

It was the most ambitious and most successful fundraising campaign in the Library\u2019s history, marshaling donations from the likes of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the British Library trusts, the Art Fund, the Garfield Weston Foundation, the Foyle Foundation, major individual donors and members of the public.</p>\n<p>Although the former owners, the Society of Jesus, had loaned the book to the Library since 1979, since it wasn\u2019t publicly owned the institution could not spend any money on conservation. It was on display, but with the cover closed to avoid any damage to the pages. Once the money to acquire the Gospel was secured, the British Library brought in leading conservation experts to assess the ancient volume. They found it in unbelievably good condition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Cuthbert-Gospel-f.1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The first page of the Gospel of John in the St. Cuthbert Gospel\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-16355\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Cuthbert-Gospel-f.1-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Cuthbert-Gospel-f.1-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Cuthbert-Gospel-f.1-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Cuthbert-Gospel-f.1-430x642.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Cuthbert-Gospel-f.1.jpg 990w\" title=\"The first page of the Gospel of John in the St. Cuthbert Gospel\" width=\"100\"/></a>The Gospel has now gone on display in the entrance hall of the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/whatson/permgall/treasures/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sir John Ritblat Gallery</a> in the British Library building at St. Pancras and for the first time it is open so that visitors can see two of the pages. This exhibit closes on June 17th.</p>\n<p>The St. Cuthbert Gospel is a copy of the Gospel of St. John written in Latin around 687 A.D., the year Cuthbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne, died. The cover and back are made of crimson goatskin leather over birch boards, with a chalice and vine motif embossed on the front. It\u2019s an incredibly rare surviving example of Anglo-Saxon leather work.

When the coffin was opened, Cuthbert\u2019s body was found to be incorrupt for the first, but not the last, time.</p>\n<p>The Vikings invaded Lindisfarne in 875, and the monks fled carrying the coffin and its precious cargo with them. They were on the lam for seven years until they settled in Durham. The saint was kept in a church on the site of the present Durham Cathedral (with occasional interludes elsewhere while escaping later invaders), then in Durham Cathedral as we know it today until Henry VIII\u2019s marauders came to pillage the cathedral during the Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1541.</p>\n<p>The monks hid St. Cuthbert\u2019s body, but the Gospel was taken during this time and passed into private hands. It turned up again in 1769 when a private collector gave it to the English Jesuit College at Li\u00e8ge, later moved to England and renamed Stonyhurst College. The Jesuits kept it in the Stonyhurst Library until they loaned it permanently to the British Library in 1979.</p>\n<p>Despite this checkered past, the St. Cuthbert Gospel has been preserved in a virtually incorrupt state of its own. You would never imagine looking at it that it\u2019s 1300 years old. Now that the Library owns it, they are making long-term conservation plans to ensure that it retains its preternatural condition. They\u2019ve also <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_89000\" target=\"_blank\">digitized the entire volume and uploaded it to their website</a>.</p>\n<p>The British Library is partnering with Durham Cathedral so the Gospel will split its time between London and Durham.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Very Reverend Michael Sadgrove, Dean of Durham, said: \u201cIt is the best possible news to know that the Cuthbert Gospel has been saved for the nation. For the people of Durham and North East England, this is a most treasured book. Buried with Cuthbert and retrieved from his coffin, it held a place of great honour in Durham Cathedral Priory. The place in the Cathedral where it was kept in the Middle Ages is still the home of our unique manuscript collection.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to pay tribute to the heroic efforts of the British Library in achieving this wonderful outcome. It has been a privilege to be associated with this fundraising campaign. I am pleased that the Friends of Durham Cathedral have supported it with a generous gift, and that one of the fund\u2019s donors has chosen to channel a major gift through the Cathedral.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs part of the plan agreed between the World Heritage Site and the British Library for its display, we look forward from time to time to welcoming this precious book back to the peninsula where Cuthbert\u2019s remains are honoured. It will be always be loved and cherished here. I am sure Cuthbert shares our delight.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"British Library buys oldest intact book in Europe\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16347\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16347#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16339\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16339\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Bouncy Stonehenge!\">Bouncy Stonehenge!</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, April 24th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bouncy-Stonehenge.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bouncy Stonehenge!\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16343\" height=\"166\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bouncy-Stonehenge-430x166.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bouncy-Stonehenge-430x166.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bouncy-Stonehenge-150x58.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bouncy-Stonehenge-200x77.jpg 200w\" title=\"Bouncy Stonehenge!\" width=\"430\"/></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.glasgowinternational.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art</a> opened on April 20th, and one particular piece has become a sensation: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/apr/20/jeremy-deller-inflatable-stonehenge-glasgow?newsfeed=true\" target=\"_blank\">a life-sized inflatable bouncy Stonehenge</a>. It\u2019s called <em>Sacrilege</em> and was designed by Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller. He worked with <a href=\"http://www.inflatable-world.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Inflatable World Leisure</a> for two months to create this masterpiece of public art, and although you might think some Scots would be displeased to have an icon of English history on Glasgow Green, in fact people of all ages are having a complete blast on it because it\u2019s undeniably awesome.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The installation is deflated at 6pm every night and re-inflated in minutes the following morning. Project manager James Hutchinson said it had caught the imagination of Glaswegians.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it would take a mean heart not to smile as you are passing by,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been wanting to get on and we have had all ages from seven to 70. Nobody knows what Stonehenge is for. It doesn\u2019t belong to anybody. Not the Druids or those interested in British or English history or Glaswegians.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe come to the green a lot and I was surprised to see it and wondered what it was, but I think it\u2019s great,\u201d says Robert Barnes, 72, who lives locally. \u201cMy grandson\u2019s been playing on it and I can\u2019t get him off.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Deller envisioned it as both an interactive public sculpture and a tactile, playful way to introduce ancient history to young children. The constraints of preservation often by necessity keep people at a distance, including at Stonehenge where visitors are no longer allowed to roam amidst the sarsen stones. A version you can bounce on brings the remote into the immediate.</p>\n<p>ForArgyll\u2019s Paul Hadfield has written <a href=\"http://forargyll.com/2012/04/soft-archaeology-funhenge-on-glasgow-green/\" target=\"_blank\">a detailed review</a> of inflatable Stonehenge\u2019s bouncing good times. Key points:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were bouncings, boundings, hurlings against the megaliths, collapses for a breather, group bounces, hide and seeks.</p>\n<p>You can\u2019t get near the real thing any more but oh boy, you can get up close and very personal with this one.</p>\n<p>The \u2018stones\u2019 are surprisingly hefty. You can throw yourself at them with impunity \u2013 but you know you\u2019ve met. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>You can see people starting off just bouncing, then getting more inventive, then teaming up in impromptu mass playfulness and daft game strategies, then splitting and going off in separate directions but somehow lighter footed than when they arrived.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Sacrilege</em> will remain in Glasgow until the festival ends on May 7th, then it will travel to various locations in the UK until it arrives in London for the Olympic Games.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s video of Funhenge guaranteed to make you want to play on it even more than reading about it did:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOSKkLJdjfA&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Bouncy Stonehenge!\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16339\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16339#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-16323\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16323\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Mole archaeologists excavate where humans can\u2019t\">Mole archaeologists excavate where humans can\u2019t</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, April 23rd, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Whitley-Castle-Epiacum-Northumberland.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Molehills dot the Epiacum Roman fort site\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16331\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Whitley-Castle-Epiacum-Northumberland-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Whitley-Castle-Epiacum-Northumberland-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Whitley-Castle-Epiacum-Northumberland-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Whitley-Castle-Epiacum-Northumberland-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Molehills dot the Epiacum Roman fort site\" width=\"200\"/></a>Whitley Castle, a.k.a. Epiacum, is a Roman fort in Northumberland close to the border with Cumbria, 12 miles south of Hadrian\u2019s Wall. It\u2019s also a scheduled ancient monument, a legal designation that prohibits all excavation on the site. Not even the landowners (Elaine and John Edgar of Castle Nook farm) are allowed to touch the soil. Moles, however, care not for our puny human \u201claws.\u201d Moles laugh in the court\u2019s collective peruked face and dig with impunity as deep under the fort as their little hearts desire.</p>\n<p>Seizing the opportunity afforded by the moles\u2019 tireless efforts, a team of 37 volunteers assembled on the site to <a href=\"http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2012/04/21/roman-artefacts-at-epiacum-churned-up-by-moles-61634-30806040/\" target=\"_blank\">sift carefully through the molehills for ancient artifacts</a> under the careful supervision of <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">English Heritage</a> whose presence made the sifting legal and who assessed the artifacts as they were found.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Among the finds were:</p>\n<p>A quarter-inch-long piece of rare Samian ware, tableware known as the classic Roman ceramic discovery;</p>\n<p>A number of pottery rim fragments from Roman serving bowls and earthenware pots;</p>\n<p>A jet bead from a Roman necklace or bracelet.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Roman pieces that had been brought to the surface by the dirt-churning vigor of the moles were found last year too, including a number of nails that confirmed the fort was not solely built out of stone but also of wood. A visitor on a guided walk stumbled on a small bronze dolphin that might have been part of a bath tap.</p>\n<p>For now, the Roman artifacts are in the care of Paul Frodshaw, one of the directors of <a href=\"http://www.epiacumheritage.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Epiacum Heritage Ltd</a>, a company dedicated to the promotion and development of Epiacum. Elaine Edgar is a co-founder and one of the directors. Frodshaw will catalogue every artifact before returning them to the landowners.

Its unique diamond-shaped structure once housed a garrison of about 500 Roman soldiers who were probably in charge of supervising local lead and silver mining operations. It was built at the same time as Hadrian\u2019s Wall (ca. 122 A.D.), but the wall a dozen miles away gets thousands of visitors each year, while Epiacum, despite its unusual design, extensive remains including a civilian settlement, a bath house, some of the best preserved stone ramparts in the entire Roman Empire, not to mention the in-house mole archaeologists, goes almost entirely unnoticed.</p>\n<p>It never really has gotten the attention it is due. Small excavations in the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries turned up a number of important artifacts like intact leather shoes, coins, pottery and altars to Apollo, Hercules, Minerva and Mithras. Nonetheless, even before it became a scheduled monument Epiacum was barely touched.</p>\n<p>The new corporation has plans to create an interpretation center and hopefully lure tourists to the \u201chidden gem of the North pennines\u201d but they\u2019ll need to raise more funds to make it happen. They also need volunteers to help develop the site within the parameters of the scheduled ancient monument designation. For instance, volunteers can help survey the site in more detail, adding to our understanding of the fort and its occupants during its 200 or so years of habitation.

It was the setting for his 1801 poem <a href=\"http://scott-minstrel.cath.vt.edu/documents.php?select=John\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Eve of St. John</em></a>, and makes an appearance in <a href=\"http://ia700306.us.archive.org/31/items/marmion04010gut/marmn10ah.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marmion</em></a>, his epic poem about the 1513 Battle of Flodden in which several Pringles died. In 1831, ill and just a year from death, Sir Walter Scott would return for one last emotional visit to Smailholm with artist J.M.W. Turner.</p>\n<p>Despite its historical and literary significance, Smailholm Tower continued to decay. In 1950 it was given to the state by John Sutherland Egerton, 5th Earl of Ellesmere, and various restoration attempts ensued, including a new whinstone rubble roof added in the 1960s over the elliptical stone vault that was originally built to support the long-gone stone slab roof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-roof-construction.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Smailholm Tower roof construction\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16314\" height=\"130\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-roof-construction-200x130.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-roof-construction-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-roof-construction-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-roof-construction-430x280.jpg 430w\" title=\"Smailholm Tower roof construction\" width=\"200\"/></a>By 2006, cracks in the rubble roof were leaking water, damaging structural timbers and the top story rooms of the tower. Since rebuilding the original slab roof was not an option due to concerns about whether the current structure could support it and because we don\u2019t know exactly how the original was built, <a href=\"http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/news/news_article.htm?articleid=35762\" target=\"_blank\">Historic Scotland initiated a project</a> to replace the leaky roof with a grass one that would absorb water.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIn 2006, the agency trialled two different specifications of living roof. One was based on traditional puddled clay below turf, and the other a proprietary clay membrane beneath a sedum mat. The tests were checked over a period of two years, with visual inspections and electronic monitoring, and we discovered that both roofs had been successful in preventing rainwater penetration.\u201d</p>\n<p>Historic Scotland decided to combine the best features of both specifications to achieve long-term durability. The capping was based on the sedum system but modified to enhance drought resistance, and to encourage the growth of a thicker sward to improve overall rainwater retention.</p>\n<p>The Tower\u2019s new roof is fully reversible, and replicates evidence of previous vegetation that once grew on the roof, as documented in historic images.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So far it is working like a charm. The sedum roof has stopped all water penetration into the tower and it looks fantastic to boot. It\u2019s like a Chia Tower now.  <img alt=\":love:\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/love.gif\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-tower.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Smailholm Tower with its new living roof\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16315\" height=\"283\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-tower-430x283.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-tower-430x283.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-tower-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-tower-200x131.jpg 200w\" title=\"Smailholm Tower with its new living roof\" width=\"430\"/></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-turf-roof.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Detail of Smailholm Tower living roof\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16316\" height=\"280\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-turf-roof-430x280.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-turf-roof-430x280.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-turf-roof-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Smailholm-turf-roof-200x130.jpg 200w\" title=\"Detail of Smailholm Tower living roof\" width=\"430\"/></a></p>\n<p>Pictures of the roof construction and the lovely new green roof courtesy of and copyrighted by <a href=\"http://www.geograph.org.uk/profile/6638\" target=\"_blank\">Walter Baxter</a>, who generously allowed me to use the glorious high resolution versions you see above.

The dirtiest pages are the ones that were open the most, and therefore most read and referred to.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Rudy said: \u201cAlthough it is often difficult to study the habits, private rituals and emotional states of people, this new technique can let us into the minds of people from the past.</p>\n<p>\u201cReligion was inseparable from physical health, time management, and interpersonal relationships in medieval times.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the century before printing, people ordered tens of thousands of prayer books \u2013 sometimes quite beautifully illuminated ones \u2013 even though they might cost as much as a house.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a result they were treasured, read several times a day at key prayer times, and through analysing how dirty the pages are we can identify the priorities and beliefs of their owners.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Sebastian-Andrea-Mantegna.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, ca. 1470-1475\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-16301\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 89px) 100vw, 89px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Sebastian-Andrea-Mantegna-134x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Sebastian-Andrea-Mantegna-134x300.jpg 134w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Sebastian-Andrea-Mantegna-67x150.jpg 67w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Sebastian-Andrea-Mantegna-358x800.jpg 358w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-Sebastian-Andrea-Mantegna.jpg 616w\" title=\"St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, ca. 1470-1475\" width=\"89\"/></a>Dr. Rudy analyzed a number of European prayer books. She found that one of the most read pages was a prayer to St. Sebastian, the saint who was shot full of arrows at the command of Diocletian but didn\u2019t die from it. The iconography of the nearly nude martyr with wounds all over his body that he survived associated Sebastian with surviving the plague. Legend has it that after an altar was built in his honor in 7th century Lombardy he stopped a plague, so praying to St. Sebastian was deemed a protection against it. Given the alarming frequency and mortality of plague in medieval Europe, it makes sense that the prayers to Sebastian would be among the most frequently recited.</p>\n<p>In people-are-people news, prayers for the salvation of one\u2019s own soul were more often read than prayers for the salvation of other people\u2019s souls, and the prayers read in the wee hours of the night and morning are dirty mainly on the first couple of pages. After that, readers consistently stopped, no doubt because they were face down in a puddle of their own drool, snoring happily.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Dirty pages reveal medieval fears, prayer habits\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16296\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16296#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2012/04/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

width=\"150\"/></a>Moctezuma\u2019s headdress is a large and elaborate 16th century crown which according to legend once belonged to Aztec emperor Moctezuma II, made from the iridescent green tail feathers of the Resplendent Quetzal. Moctezuma either gave it to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s as a gift upon his arrival at Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire and modern day Mexico City, or it was pillaged by Cort\u00e9s\u2019 forces after the siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521.</p>\n<p>There is no record of where it was taken, nor is there any evidence that it belonged to Moctezuma. We don\u2019t even know for sure that it\u2019s a headdress. It doesn\u2019t match any of the headdresses depicted in contemporary accounts. In the 19th century the assumption was that it was a mantle, and recent scholarship suggests they might have been right about it being a mantle, but that it was worn by a priest to ritually transform him into the incarnation of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, rather than by the king.</p>\n<p>What we do know is that by 1575 it was in the extensive private collection of Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, at Ambras Castle in Innsbruck. Ferdinand was the nephew of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V who was also King of Spain during the Conquista. He could easily have gotten his hands on the headdress via his family connections.</p>\n<p>It remained in the castle until the early 19th century when Vienna\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ethno-museum.ac.at/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Ethnology</a> was entrusted with most of the Castle Ambras collection. The headdress was the subject of much anthropological fascination from then on, including from <a href=\"http://www.americanethnography.com/article.php?id=40\" target=\"_blank\">Zelia Nuttall</a>, the American archaeologist, anthropologist and expert in pre-Columbian Mexico who in 1890 first identified it as an Aztec \u201cquetzalapanecayotl\u201d or a featherwork crown.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Resplendant-Quetzal.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Resplendant Quetzal\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-16446\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Resplendant-Quetzal-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Resplendant-Quetzal-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Resplendant-Quetzal-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Resplendant-Quetzal-430x644.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Resplendant-Quetzal.jpg 1067w\" title=\"Resplendant Quetzal\" width=\"100\"/></a>The piece is 46 inches high at the peak and 69 inches wide. In addition to the 400 dramatic quetzal tail feathers that adorn the outer layer, there are rows of blue Lovely Cotinga feathers, pink flamingo feathers, smaller quetzal feathers and white and red feathers from the squirrel cuckoo. The inner rings are studded with gold and gemstones. The Aztecs venerated the Resplendent Quetzal as the god of the air, a symbol of rebirth and of freedom.</p>\n<p>Given its beauty, historical significance and powerful symbolism, it\u2019s no surprise that the headdress has been the subject of a long-standing dispute between Mexico and Austria. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Replica of Moctezuma's headdress at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16461\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Replica-Mexico-City.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Replica of Moctezuma's headdress at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City\" width=\"200\"/></a>There are no Aztec headdresses left in Mexico because the Spanish took them all \u2014 the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City only has a replica of Moctezuma\u2019s headdress on display \u2014 so Mexico has been trying for decades to get this one back, even going so far as to petition the United Nations for its return, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>In 2008, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) entered into talks with the Austrian Government and the Kunsthistorisches Museum, the parent institution of the Museum of Ethnology. They agreed first to do an extensive scientific analysis on the headdress to assess its condition and do any conservation necessary that will allow the piece to travel. <a href=\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?articleid=384813&amp;categoryid=13003\" target=\"_blank\">In 2011, a tentative deal was struck</a>: Mexico would officially recognize Austria\u2019s uncontested ownership of the headdress, Austria would loan Mexico the headdress and in return Mexico would loan Austria the golden stagecoach of Maximilian I of Mexico, emperor of the Second Mexican Empire (1863-1867) and brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.</p>\n<p>There was still one major stumbling block, however. According to Mexican law, all pre-Columbian artifacts belong to the nation. Once they cross the border, no matter who else might lay claim to them, they become property of the state and cannot leave the country. No matter the terms of the loan agreement, Austria had no intention of letting the headdress into Mexico until the government\u2019s assurances had the force of law.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=498266&amp;CategoryId=14091\" target=\"_blank\">new bilateral cultural exchange agreement</a> between Austria and Mexico that would resolve the issue has just been approved by the Mexican Senate and Austria\u2019s cabinet. The Senate\u2019s amendments to the cultural property law allow for long-term loans of artifacts while acknowledging the lender\u2019s ownership rights. Austria\u2019s legislature has to approve the deal, which is expected to happen within the next few months, and both parties need to sort out how to transport the fragile headdress without damaging it, but it looks like the biggest obstacle to the return of this glorious symbol of Mexican heritage might just have been overcome.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mexico inches closer to loan of Moctezuma\u2019s headdress\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/16445\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>"}

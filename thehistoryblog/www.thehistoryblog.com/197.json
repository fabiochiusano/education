Egyptian style had become a fad in Rome following Octavian\u2019s conquest of Egypt in 30 B.C., and the wealthy Gaius Cestius, who in life had been praetor, tribune of the plebs and a member of the Septemviri Epulonum, a religious college responsible for throwing banquets for the gods, left instructions in his will that a pyramid be built in 330 days to house his remains. \n Built out of brick-faced concrete on a foundation of travertine, Cestius\u2019 pyramid is 100 Roman feet (about 97 imperial ones) square at the base and 125 Roman feet (about 120 imperial ones) high, making it an extremely acute pyramid with a very pointy top. White Carrara marble slabs face the exterior which was entirely sealed with no entrance point after Gaius Cestius\u2019 burial. Inside is a frescoed burial chamber that held Cestius\u2019 ashes; it was looted in antiquity and tunneled into by disappointed thieves during the Middle Ages. \n The pyramid was built at the intersection of two Roman roads outside of the city, but as the city expanded the entire structure was incorporated into the Aurelian walls during their construction between 271 and 275 A.D. It\u2019s still embedded in a particularly well-preserved area of the wall next to the Porta San Paolo gate. Getting absorbed by the wall might have been the best thing that ever happened to the pyramid. None of the other crazy vanity pyramids ancient sources mention having been built in Rome have survived. \n The other side of the pyramid abuts the Cimitero Acattolico (the non-Catholic cemetery, also known as the Protestant Cemetery though people of many faiths are buried there) where the Romantic poets Shelley and Keats slumber eternally. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful and fantastical spots in Rome, a favorite of my childhood thanks to the huge colony of semi-feral cats who live at the pyramid\u2019s base. Whenever we were in the area for the San Paolo market, I\u2019d insist we stop so I could look over the railing at the cats. \n Like many of the most beautiful spots in Rome, the pyramid of Gaius Cestius is in dire need of maintenance. The marble exterior is pollution-blackened, cracked and bristling with vegetation. Water is seeping through the walls and damaging the frescoes, already faded and degraded from millennia of looters/hostile elements, in the burial chamber. Past restorations haven\u2019t been kind to it either. The acid used to clean the exterior in the 1970s left the marble vulnerable to attacks from microorganisms and particulate matter. \n Restoration work was last done in 2002. Advances in technology since then will allow restorers to use new organic products to clean the surface and protect it from future damage. They also plan to use steel beams 23 feet long to stabilize the marble blocks. While they\u2019re at it, researchers will follow up on some ultrasound data from a few years ago which turned up anomalous blank spots on the inside. They will use endoscopes to explore the anomalies. They\u2019re probably not secret chambers but everyone\u2019s hoping for them anyway. \n Yuzo Yagi is the owner of Tsusho Limited, an Osaka-based chain of 400 clothing outlets. He has been doing business in Italy, importing Italian clothes for his stores, for 40 years. All he asks in return for the donation is that a plaque with his name on it be placed near the pyramid. No advertising heinousness. He will sign the official agreement in January and work is slated to begin in April. \n And now, let\u2019s usher in the new year with two wonderfully on-topic verses from Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats by Percy Bysshe Shelley. \n Go thou to Rome\u2013at once the Paradise,\nThe grave, the city, and the wilderness;\nAnd where its wrecks like shatter\u2019d mountains rise,\nAnd flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress\nThe bones of Desolation\u2019s nakedness\nPass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead\nThy footsteps to a slope of green access\nWhere, like an infant\u2019s smile, over the dead\nA light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;\nAnd gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time\nFeeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;\nAnd one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,\nPavilioning the dust of him who plann\u2019d\nThis refuge for his memory, doth stand\nLike flame transform\u2019d to marble \u2026. \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC

Getting absorbed by the wall might have been the best thing that ever happened to the pyramid. None of the other crazy vanity pyramids ancient sources mention having been built in Rome have survived.</p>\n<p>The other side of the pyramid abuts the <a href=\"http://www.protestantcemetery.it/about/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cimitero Acattolico</a> (the non-Catholic cemetery, also known as the Protestant Cemetery though people of many faiths are buried there) where the Romantic poets Shelley and Keats slumber eternally. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful and fantastical spots in Rome, a favorite of my childhood thanks to the huge colony of semi-feral cats who live at the pyramid\u2019s base. Whenever we were in the area for the San Paolo market, I\u2019d insist we stop so I could look over the railing at the cats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Pyramid burial chamber, tunnels from the Middle Ages\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14259\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber-300x201.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber-1024x687.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Pyramid burial chamber, tunnels from the Middle Ages\" width=\"150\"/></a>Like many of the most beautiful spots in Rome, the pyramid of Gaius Cestius is in dire need of maintenance. The marble exterior is pollution-blackened, cracked and bristling with vegetation. Water is seeping through the walls and damaging the frescoes, already faded and degraded from millennia of looters/hostile elements, in the burial chamber. Past restorations haven\u2019t been kind to it either. The acid used to clean the exterior in the 1970s left the marble vulnerable to attacks from microorganisms and particulate matter.</p>\n<p>Restoration work was last done in 2002. Advances in technology since then will allow restorers to use new organic products to clean the surface and protect it from future damage. They also plan to use steel beams 23 feet long to stabilize the marble blocks. While they\u2019re at it, researchers will follow up on some ultrasound data from a few years ago which turned up anomalous blank spots on the inside. They will use endoscopes to explore the anomalies. They\u2019re probably not secret chambers but everyone\u2019s hoping for them anyway.</p>\n<p>Yuzo Yagi is the owner of Tsusho Limited, an Osaka-based chain of 400 clothing outlets. He has been doing business in Italy, importing Italian clothes for his stores, for 40 years. All he asks in return for the donation is that a plaque with his name on it be placed near the pyramid. No advertising heinousness. He will sign the official agreement in January and work is slated to begin in April.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Keats-grave-pyramid-e1325393250769.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Keats' grave in the Protestant Cemetery, Pyramid of Cestius visible in the right background\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14253\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Keats-grave-pyramid-e1325393250769-97x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Keats-grave-pyramid-e1325393250769-97x150.jpg 97w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Keats-grave-pyramid-e1325393250769-195x300.jpg 195w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Keats-grave-pyramid-e1325393250769-668x1024.jpg 668w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Keats-grave-pyramid-e1325393250769.jpg 1008w\" title=\"Keats' grave in the Protestant Cemetery, Pyramid of Cestius visible in the right background\" width=\"97\"/></a>And now, let\u2019s usher in the new year with two wonderfully on-topic verses from <a href=\"http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/1879.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats</em></a> by Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Go thou to Rome\u2013at once the Paradise,<br/>\nThe grave, the city, and the wilderness;<br/>\nAnd where its wrecks like shatter\u2019d mountains rise,<br/>\nAnd flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress<br/>\nThe bones of Desolation\u2019s nakedness<br/>\nPass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead<br/>\nThy footsteps to a slope of green access<br/>\nWhere, like an infant\u2019s smile, over the dead<br/>\nA light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;</p>\n<p>And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time<br/>\nFeeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;<br/>\nAnd one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,<br/>\nPavilioning the dust of him who plann\u2019d<br/>\nThis refuge for his memory, doth stand<br/>\nLike flame transform\u2019d to marble \u2026.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Donor gives \u20ac1 million to restore a pyramid in Rome\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14250\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14250#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-14210\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14210\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Year in History Blog History\">The Year in History Blog History</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, December 30th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Mr. Murphy dropped a note through the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/contact-me\" target=\"_blank\">contact form</a> last week suggesting that I write a Year in Review entry, a summary of the most popular posts both in views and comments, favorite stories, favorite referrals, all that good stuff. I thought that was a brilliant notion, especially since the Christmas-to-New Year\u2019s interregnum can be something of a news desert. Strangely, I haven\u2019t had much trouble finding stories to blog about this holiday season, but I\u2019m still doing the review because it\u2019s a great idea that I hope to make a year-end tradition. </p>\n<p>Pedant note: I\u2019m going to refer to the blog as \u201cwe\u201d in this entry. This is because it looks weird saying \u201cI\u201d when I mean \u201cthe blog\u201d and it looks weird when I say \u201cthe blog\u201d over and over again instead of using a handy pronoun.

Starting in September of 2010, viewership doubled from an average of about 20,000 views a month to between 40,000 and 50,000. The major bump can be traced directly to the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/7679\" target=\"_blank\">Master of Blue Jeans</a> entry which was linked to by two bloggers with huge audiences: <a href=\"http://kottke.org/10/09/the-master-of-blue-jeans\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Kottke</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2010/10/renaissance-denim/181657/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Sullivan</a>. </p>\n<p>In March of 2011, we crossed the 60,000 views a month line and hovered around it until September when we were just 462 views shy of 70,000. November was our biggest month to date with 88,943 views and December will almost match it (we\u2019re at 84,262 at print time) despite the usual holiday decline in readership. The total number of views for 2010 was 386,069. The total for 2011 two days before the end of it is 803,854.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/monthlies.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14227\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/monthlies-1024x235.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/monthlies-1024x235.png 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/monthlies-150x34.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/monthlies-300x68.png 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/monthlies.png 1259w\" title=\"Monthly statistics\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Many of those views seem to be the result of Google searches, often image searches.

That\u2019s also mainly from search engine traffic, only instead of a huge crazy spike it\u2019s from a hundred or so searches for \u201cMichelangelo\u2019s David\u201d every day.

The custodian showed him a large, crusty, oily, blackened hand with curled fingers and long fingernails. </p>\n<p>Byrne asked if he could have it but the lamas refused because its loss would lead to great misfortune for the monastery. Eventually he negotiated a bargain: he could take one of the fingers as long as he replaced with a reasonable facsimile and made a donation towards the upkeep of the temple. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Pangboche_monastery-prayer-room.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14198\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Pangboche_monastery-prayer-room-1024x354.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Pangboche_monastery-prayer-room-1024x354.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Pangboche_monastery-prayer-room-150x51.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Pangboche_monastery-prayer-room-300x103.jpg 300w\" title=\"Pangboche monastery prayer room\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Byrne cabled the information to Tom Slick Jr. and Slick had Byrne return to London to consult with primatologist Dr. Osman Hill.   Slick, Byrne and Dr. Hill met for luncheon at the Regents Park Zoo. During a discussion of how they would secure an appropriate replacement finger, Hill upended his bag and dumped a dried human hand onto the table. Problem solved.</p>\n<p>Byrne returned to Pangboche with his replacement hand and ten thousand rupees (about $160.00 at today\u2019s exchange rate) to donate to the temple. He cut off the index finger from the Yeti hand and wired the human finger in its place. The next obstacle to overcome was the illegality of smuggling a historical artifact out of the country. So Byrne gave the Yeti finger to Jimmy Stewart to smuggle out of India in his wife\u2019s lingerie case. </p>\n<p>Yes <em>that</em> Jimmy Stewart. Jimmy Stewart was a personal friend of Tom Slick\u2019s and just happened to be in India in December of 1958 on a tiger hunt. When Byrne got word to Slick that he had secured the Yeti finger, he cabled Byrne telling him to take it to the Grand Hotel in Calcutta where a Mr. and Mrs. Stewart would take custody of the article and smuggle it to Dr. Hill in London. They hid it in Gloria\u2019s lingerie suitcase (rich ladies had dedicated suitcases for their unmentionables in those days). When they arrived, guess which bag was lost? Two days later a customs agent showed up at their hotel with the lingerie case in hand. Gloria asked if they had opened it and the customs agent assured her they would never paw through a lady\u2019s delicates.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/yeti-finger.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14200\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/yeti-finger.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/yeti-finger.jpg 960w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/yeti-finger-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/yeti-finger-300x168.jpg 300w\" title=\"Pangboche Yeti finger\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Thus the finger made its adventurous way to Dr. Osman Hill. He examined it and declared it the finger of a hominid of some kind, he couldn\u2019t be sure of which kind. When Hill died in 1975, he bequeathed his collection of research specimens to the Royal College of Surgeons\u2019 Hunterian Museum (the same museum where <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14105\" target=\"_blank\">the Irish Giant\u2019s bones</a> are on display). </p>\n<p>Hill\u2019s collection wasn\u2019t well catalogued and didn\u2019t have immediate research value so it was stored and pretty much forgotten about until 2008 when curators going through the Hill collection found a box containing a plaster cast of a large footprint, some hair, scat samples and a large, blackened finger. Hill\u2019s notes identified it as a Yeti finger from Pangboche Temple in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Scientists have more tools than Hill did to determine just what creature once pointed that index finger, namely DNA analysis. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16264752\" target=\"_blank\">Royal College of Surgeons allowed a small sample to be taken</a> to find out once and for all if it is a Yeti\u2019s digit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The finger is of human origin, according to Dr Rob Jones, senior scientist at the Zoological Society of Scotland.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have got a very, very strong match to a number of existing reference sequences on human DNA databases.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very similar to existing human sequences from China and that region of Asia but we don\u2019t have enough resolution to be confident of a racial identification.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>BBC radio followed the story, interviewing Peter Byrne, now 85 years old and living in the United States. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g6wq\" target=\"_blank\">You can listen to the program here</a>. There\u2019s some discussion at the end of the broadcast about sending the finger back to Pangboche. The original hand was stolen in 1999 after a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75cYxUOc59o\" target=\"_blank\">1991 episode of Unsolved Mysteries</a> analyzed a sample from the finger (results were inconclusive) and made the Pangboche monastery a newly popular location for cryptozoological tourism. </p>\n<p>The income from tourism plummeted after the theft. Mike Allsop, an Air New Zealand pilot and Everest mountaineer, created a replica of the hand and skullcap to donate to the monastery in the hope that it would give them something to show tourists and perhaps inspire the return of the purloined Yeti parts. Getting the original finger back would mean a lot to the monastery.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Yeti finger turns out to be human after all\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14196\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14196#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-14185\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14185\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Tower of Babel floor plan and elevation\">Tower of Babel floor plan and elevation</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, December 28th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Tower-of-Babel-stele.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The Tower of Babel stele\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-14190\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Tower-of-Babel-stele-167x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Tower-of-Babel-stele-167x300.jpg 167w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Tower-of-Babel-stele-83x150.jpg 83w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Tower-of-Babel-stele-570x1024.jpg 570w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Tower-of-Babel-stele.jpg 814w\" title=\"The Tower of Babel stele\" width=\"167\"/></a>A stele from the collection of Norwegian businessman <a href=\"http://www.schoyencollection.com/historyBabylonian.html\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Schoyen</a> includes the <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45724541/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.TvvYQDUS3cw\" target=\"_blank\">clearest image of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II extant and the earliest images of the Great Ziggurat of Babylon</a>, aka Etemenanki, the leading candidate for the Biblical Tower of Babel. This is one of only four known images of Nebuchadnezzar, and the other three are carved on cliff-faces in Lebanon and have been hard used by the elements. The stele shows the king in profile, wearing the conical hat of royalty, holding a staff in his left hand and an unknown object that might be a foundation nail or a scroll with plans for the tower in his right hand.</p>\n<p>Nebuchadnezzar reigned over the Neo-Babylonian Empire between 605 B.C. and 562 B.C. During that time he restored and completed the great ziggurat which was first built by an earlier king at an indeterminate time (the Schoyen scholars say 1792-1750 B.C.) in honor of the god Marduk but had been damaged by the Assyrian King Sennacherib when he destroyed Babylon in 689 B.C. Restoration began under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s father Nabopolassar and was completed during the son\u2019s reign 43 years later. Nebuchadnezzar boasts of his construction prowess on the stele, describing himself as the \u201cgreat restorer and builder of holy places.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI mobilized (all) countries everywhere, (each and) every ruler (who) had been raised to prominence over all the people of the world (as one) loved by Marduk\u2026\u201d he wrote on the stele.</p>\n<p>\u201cI built their structures with bitumen and (baked brick throughout).

Unambiguously labeled as \u201cThe house, the foundation of heaven and earth, the ziggurat in Babylon,\u201d these are the only contemporary images of the tower known to exist.</p>\n<p>The ziggurat was ill-used by subsequent conquerors. Cyrus the Great of Persia took Babylon in 538 B.C. and pulled down the three stair ramps so the tower couldn\u2019t be used as a fortress. By the time Alexander the Great took over in 331 B.C., water damage penetrating through the torn down stair ramps had caused severe structural damage. Alexander planned to restore the foundation of heaven and earth, but when he returned the next year no work had been done so he ordered the ziggurat torn down and rebuilt. It was torn down, but he died before it could be rebuilt.</p>\n<p>All we\u2019ve got left now is the square base of the Great Ziggurat just south of Baghdad.

Founded in 1788 by 1,487 British expatriates (778 of them convicts), the colony was so short on coin that rum was used as currency. The New South Wales Corps, the permanent local regiment that was supposed to maintain order, quickly became known as the Rum Corps due to their extra-legal control of the rum trade. In 1805 Governor William Bligh, the same William Bligh who had been captain of <em>The Bounty</em> until Fletcher Christian led a successful mutiny against him, tried to stop the Corps\u2019 rum trade. The Corps responded with the Rum Rebellion of 1808, wherein William Bligh was forcibly deposed from yet another leadership position by underlings he could not control.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lachlan_macquarie-1822.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Lachlan Macquarie, by Richard  Read, 1822\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14165\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lachlan_macquarie-1822-130x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lachlan_macquarie-1822-130x150.jpg 130w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lachlan_macquarie-1822-260x300.jpg 260w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lachlan_macquarie-1822-889x1024.jpg 889w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lachlan_macquarie-1822.jpg 912w\" title=\"Lachlan Macquarie, by Richard  Read, 1822\" width=\"130\"/></a>For the next two years the Corps ran the colony as they willed, until the arrival of Governor Lachlan Macquarie at the end of 1809. He was tasked with arresting the leaders of the Rum Rebellion and reclaiming political and military control of the colony from the New South Wales Corps. In 1812 the British government sent Macquarie \u00a310,000 in Spanish dollars. Heavy in pure silver and worth eight reales, these Spanish pieces of eight had been used worldwide for currency since they were first struck in 1497. In Australia in 1812 their worth was fixed at five shillings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1796-Spanish-Dollar.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"1796 Spanish Dollar\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14169\" height=\"75\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1796-Spanish-Dollar-150x75.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1796-Spanish-Dollar-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1796-Spanish-Dollar-300x150.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1796-Spanish-Dollar-1024x512.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1796-Spanish-Dollar.jpg 1500w\" title=\"1796 Spanish Dollar\" width=\"150\"/></a>Instead of releasing them into general circulation where they would be spent on goods arriving on merchant trade ships from all over the world and thus leave the colony almost as quickly as they arrived, Macquarie decided to solve the currency crisis by making these Spanish dollars a New South Wales currency. In keeping with his liberal policy of appointing emancipists (freed or pardoned convicts) to government jobs, Macquarie hired convicted counterfeiter William Henshall to punch holes in the Spanish dollars and overstamp both the outer pieces and the inner plugs (known as \u201cdumps\u201d) as NSW currency.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Macquarie provided Henshall with a workshop in the basement of a building known as \u2018The Factory\u2019 to make the holey dollars and dumps. This building, used by government printer George Howe, was near the corner of Bridge and Loftus streets, by the eastern bank of the Tank Stream. It was effectively Australia\u2019s first mint, with Henshall Australia\u2019s first mint master.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Dump1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"New South Wales dump\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-14172\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Dump1-300x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Dump1-300x150.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Dump1-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Dump1-1024x513.jpg 1024w\" title=\"New South Wales dump\" width=\"200\"/></a>Macquarie initially anticipated that the task of converting the 40,000 Spanish coins would take three months, but the project took over a year to complete. Henshall had to experiment with making the necessary machinery, which proved difficult. It seems that a drop hammer, as opposed to a screw press, was used to stamp the coins. Henshall stamped the coins with their new value and \u2018NEW SOUTH WALES 1813\u2019. He incorporated his \u2018H\u2019 initial into the spray of leaves of the counterstamp design and also inscribed his initial between the words \u2018FIFTEEN\u2019 and \u2018PENCE\u2019 on the dump reverse dies.</p>\n<p>(The dump pictured above left is from a holey dollar cast of out a 1773 piece of eight in the <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/album/albumView.aspx?acmsID=431559&amp;itemID=825709\" target=\"_blank\">State Library of New South Wales</a>).</p></blockquote>\n<p>This move doubled the number of coins in circulation, increased their worth by 25% and ensured that the money would not leave the colony. The holey dollars and dumps remained in circulation until 1822, when the government was able to supply sufficient sterling coinage to recall the holey ones. By 1829, most of the 40,000 holey dollars had been exchanged for legal tender. The government melted them down for bullion. Only a few collectors kept the holey dollars and dumps, which is why there are only 300 of the former left and about 1000 dumps. </p>\n<p>The National Museum\u2019s holey dollar will probably go on display in the <a href=\"http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/landmarks/home\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Landmarks: People and Places across Australia</em></a> gallery in 2013, along with other artifacts from the Macquarie era.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Australian museum buys 1 holey dollar for $130,000\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14157\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14157#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-14151\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14151\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Yew don\u2019t look a day over 619\">Yew don\u2019t look a day over 619</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, December 26th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wakehurst-yew.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Wakehurst Place yew, b. 1391\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14154\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wakehurst-yew-300x225.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wakehurst-yew-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wakehurst-yew-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wakehurst-yew.jpg 640w\" title=\"Wakehurst Place yew, b. 1391\" width=\"300\"/></a>A handsome but unassuming yew tree (<em>Taxus baccata</em>) near the mansion at <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Wakehurst Place</a>, the Kew Botanical Garden\u2019s country estate in West Sussex, turns out to be <a href=\"http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9431402.Sussex_tree_amazes_experts/\" target=\"_blank\">620 years old</a>. Twenty feet in diameter, it\u2019s not the largest yew, never mind the largest tree, nor the most impressive (there are 100-year-old yews at Wakehurst that have grown up naturally on stones which are far splashier and more often painted/pictured/talked about than our medieval tree friend). Nobody at Wakehurst had any idea that particular yew was so ancient.</p>\n<p>The tree was examined by a dendrochronologist as part of research for a long-term conservation management plan for the Wakehurst gardens. He took a core sample from the tree \u2014 you don\u2019t need to cut the whole thing down to count its rings anymore \u2014 and found that the yew was planted in 1391, ten years after the Peasants\u2019 Revolt and eight years before King Richard II was deposed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Andy Jackson, the head of Wakehurst, said: \u201cI am shocked and amazed. I thought I knew almost all there was to know about Wakehurst\u2019s landscape, but it has unveiled a new layer to me. I\u2019ve walked past this remarkably humble tree almost every day without realising just how old it is.</p>\n<p>The yew is like an ancient key, unlocking information about the past and suggesting there was a much older designed landscape at Wakehurst that we didn\u2019t know was there.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The de Wakehurst family owned the land that would become the country estate starting in 1205. There\u2019s a man-made terrace under the 1391 yew, so Jackson thinks the yew may be evidence of the earliest formal garden designed for the de Wakehursts. Last year archaeologists found remains of a 14th century house that was built near the current mansion (constructed in the 16th century) which is where the yew currently stands, so it may have been part of a line of landscaped trees planted to grace that first house.</p>\n<p>(Sorry about the groaner in the title.

Led by archaeologist Julia Mayo of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama City, the team began excavating the El Ca\u00f1o site in 2005 and by 2010 had found the gold-packed burial of a chieftain. That was just the beginning.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/breastplate-arm-cuffs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14144\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/breastplate-arm-cuffs-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/breastplate-arm-cuffs-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/breastplate-arm-cuffs-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/breastplate-arm-cuffs.jpg 670w\" title=\"Breastplate and arm cuffs\" width=\"150\"/></a>The team returned last year during the January-to-April dry season and unearthed a second burial every bit as rich as the first. Bearing two gold breastplates in front, two in back, four arm cuffs, and a luminous emerald, the deceased was surely another supreme chief. Near him lay a baby similarly adorned in gold, most likely his son. Beneath both of them stretched a layer of tangled human skeletons, possibly sacrificed slaves or war captives. Radiocarbon tests would date the burials to about A.D. 900\u2014the era when the Maya civilization, some 800 miles to the northwest, was beginning to unravel.</p>\n<p>Mayo barely had time to catalog the new finds before her team uncovered more gold. Glinting from the walls of the pit, the artifacts marked the edges of four more tombs. As she surveyed the scene, she couldn\u2019t help but feel stunned. \u201cI was just speechless\u2014fascinated, but also worried,\u201d she remembers. The rains had already begun, and she was now in a race to retrieve all the treasure before the neighboring river flooded the site. Also, she knew looters were sure to come if news of the discoveries got out. She swore her team to silence and prayed for clear skies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The conquistadores encountered the Sitio Conte people in the 1500s and described their astounding array of gold armature and jewelry (while slaughtering them and taking said gold, of course). It appears that the culture changed very little between the time of the burials Mayo discovered and their descendants\u2019 encounters with the pointy side of the Spanish invaders 700-500 years later. With the exception of some carved stone monoliths, the Sitio Conte didn\u2019t build monumental or even modest but enduring architecture like other Mesoamerican peoples. They lived in bamboo huts and used stone tools, and annual floods have laid waste to organic remains.</p>\n<p>At the same time, they had goldsmiths with an exceptional level of skill. This is why earlier archaeologists who studied the Sitio Conte sites in the 1930s and later thought that the gold artifacts must have been imports from more sophisticated neighboring cultures. Mayo\u2019s team has proven definitely that this is not the case.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Specialists at the Smithsonian Institution are analyzing the array of materials Mayo\u2019s team has unearthed and have already made a major discovery. Natural impurities in the gold indicate that the metal was mined and worked in the region. This firmly puts to rest any debate about whether Panama\u2019s treasures were imported from farther south, where cultures were supposedly older and more advanced. The native people in this area may have lived in simple huts, but they were rich enough to support master craftsmen and sophisticated enough to appreciate fine art.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And how:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/chief-seahorse-pendant-breastplate-jewels.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14146\" height=\"149\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/chief-seahorse-pendant-breastplate-jewels-300x198.jpg\" title=\"Seahorse pendant, partial breastplate, various jewels\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/two-headed-bat-pendant.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14143\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/two-headed-bat-pendant-300x200.jpg\" title=\"Two-headed bat pendant\" width=\"200\"/></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/emerald-gold-imaginary-creature-pendant.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14142\" height=\"143\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/emerald-gold-imaginary-creature-pendant-300x215.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/emerald-gold-imaginary-creature-pendant-300x215.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/emerald-gold-imaginary-creature-pendant-150x107.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/emerald-gold-imaginary-creature-pendant.jpg 670w\" title=\"Gold pendant of imaginary creature with emerald inset\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/human-headed-pendant.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14141\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/human-headed-pendant-300x200.jpg\" title=\"Human-headed pendant\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"No frankincense or myrrh, but here\u2019s some gold\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14140\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14140#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-14130\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14130\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Yahweh invoked in ancient Antioch curse tablet\">Yahweh invoked in ancient Antioch curse tablet</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, December 24th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lead-curse-tablet.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='Lead curse tablet invoking \"Iao,\" Antioch, 4th c.

There\u2019s no way of knowing what religion he may have been. Antioch in the 4th century had large Christian, Jewish, Jewish Christian (the latter two inspired the future saint John Chrysostom to write <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/chrysostom-jews6.asp\" target=\"_blank\">some opprobrious homilies</a> that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place engraved on lead and thrown down a well) and polytheistic communities. It\u2019s possible that the unfortunate target of the curse was Christian, as the name Babylas was also the name of a third-century bishop of Antioch and martyr who died in prison during the suppression of Christianity under the emperor Decius (253 A.D.).</p>\n<p>Babylas\u2019 putative Christianity could have inspired his hater to ask Yahweh to hit him with the full thunder-and-lightning treatment, or the curser might simply have picked the deity that most suited him for his own reasons. University of Washington professor Alexander Hollmann who translated the tablet at first thought that the use of \u201cIao\u201d suggested the curse writer was Jewish, but after examining comparable magic invocations Hollman realized Yahweh was deployed in spells cast by polytheists as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily any connection with the Jewish community,\u201d [Hollman] said. \u201cGreek and Roman magic did incorporate Jewish texts sometimes without understanding them very well.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The curse was discovered in the 1930s during an excavation by Princeton University. They found many curse tablets from hundreds of years of Antiochans (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapaclassics.org%2Fimages%2Fuploads%2Fdocuments%2Fabstracts%2FHOLLMANN_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">one from the late 5th, early 6th century A.D.</a> asks Kronos to bring down the horses of the Green and White chariot factions), so many that scholars are still translating them. The collection, including this most recently translated \u201cIao\u201d curse, is kept in the Princeton University Art Museum.</p>\n<p>Since curses were often rolled or folded up and then dropped in wells or drains to do their otherworldly damage unimpeded, it takes considerable conservation effort and care to open them up to the point where they can be read and translated, hence the deliberate pace.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Yahweh invoked in ancient Antioch curse tablet\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14130\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14130#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-14115\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14115\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to An embarrassment of digitized riches\">An embarrassment of digitized riches</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, December 23rd, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Rubens-Peter-Paul-Marchesa-Maria-Serra-Pallavicino-1606.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14126\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Rubens-Peter-Paul-Marchesa-Maria-Serra-Pallavicino-1606-188x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Rubens-Peter-Paul-Marchesa-Maria-Serra-Pallavicino-1606-188x300.jpg 188w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Rubens-Peter-Paul-Marchesa-Maria-Serra-Pallavicino-1606-94x150.jpg 94w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Rubens-Peter-Paul-Marchesa-Maria-Serra-Pallavicino-1606-643x1024.jpg 643w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Rubens-Peter-Paul-Marchesa-Maria-Serra-Pallavicino-1606.jpg 745w\" title='\"Marchesa Maria Serra Pallavicino\" by Peter Paul Rubens, 1606' width=\"188\"/></a>The most ambitious digitization project I\u2019ve ever heard of is halfway to its goal of putting every single publicly owned oil painting (plus tempera and acrylic) in the United Kingdom online.

Just to give you a sense of the scale, there are only 3,000 paintings in the immense National Gallery. </p>\n<p>You\u2019d have to visit over 3,000 art galleries, museums, libraries, etc. to see the Your Paintings collection in person, and even that wouldn\u2019t be enough.

Barnum\u2019s American Museum in New York City). Born in 1761, Byrne was already abnormally tall in childhood, and by the time he was a teenager his height had made him a popular local sideshow attraction. When he was 21, he left Ireland to seek fame and fortune in London. His 7\u20197\u2033 height garnered him the giant gig at Cox\u2019s Museum and he was instantly a huge hit. Unfortunately it was a short-lived success. Under the strain of his deteriorating health and the pressures of celebrity, barely more than a year after his move to London, the Irish Giant drank himself to death.</p>\n<p>After a lifetime spent on display, Byrne\u2019s deepest fear was that his body would be stolen by \u201cresurrection men\u201d in the employ of eminent Scottish anatomist John Hunter who was famous for his collection of anatomical specimens and oddities. Byrne told his friends that when he died he wanted to be sealed in a lead coffin and buried at sea to avoid this horror. One of those friends turned coat in the most despicable way: he became the resurrection man Byrne feared. Hunter paid him 500 pounds (almost $80,000 in today\u2019s money) to steal the body when the burial party stopped overnight on their way to the English Channel. He put heavy stones in the casket and gave Hunter his friend\u2019s body.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/John_Hunter_by_John_Jackson.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"John Hunter, portrait by John Jackson\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14108\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 117px) 100vw, 117px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/John_Hunter_by_John_Jackson-117x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/John_Hunter_by_John_Jackson-117x150.jpg 117w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/John_Hunter_by_John_Jackson-234x300.jpg 234w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/John_Hunter_by_John_Jackson-799x1024.jpg 799w\" title=\"John Hunter, portrait by John Jackson\" width=\"117\"/></a>Hunter boiled it immediately, probably in fear of imminent discovery, and hid the skeleton for four years. Once he figured the coast was clear, he put the giant\u2019s skeleton on display in his museum. After Hunter\u2019s death, his collection was bought by the British government and became the core of the <a href=\"http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/museums/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hunterian Museum</a> at the Royal College of Surgeons in London which to this day has Charles Byrne\u2019s body on display.</p>\n<p>Professor of medical ethics Len Doyal and lawyer Thomas Muinzer <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7597\" target=\"_blank\">argue in the latest issue of the British Medical Journal</a> that it\u2019s high time Charles\u2019 wishes were respected and his remains buried at sea.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The fact is that Hunter knew of Byrne\u2019s terror of him and ignored his wishes for the disposal of his body. What has been done cannot be undone but it can be morally rectified. Surely it is time to respect the memory and reputation of Byrne: the narrative of his life, including the circumstances surrounding his death.</p>\n<p>The Hunterian Museum and the Royal College of Surgeons\u2019 possession of Byrne\u2019s skeleton may have led to beneficial medical outcomes. However, as a justification for not burying his skeleton, that case is no longer tenable. Past research on Byrne did not require the display of his skeleton; merely medical access to it. Moreover, now that Byrne\u2019s DNA has been extracted, it can be used in further research. Equally, it is likely that if given the opportunity to make an informed choice, living people with acromegaly will leave their bodies to research or participate in it while alive, or both. Finally, for the purposes of public education, a synthetic archetypical model of an acromegalic skeleton could be made and displayed. Indeed, such skeletons are now used in medical education throughout the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/dec/22/irish-giant-skeleton-museum-display\" target=\"_blank\">Royal College of Surgeons disagrees</a>. Their position is that the skeleton is still a unique source of important medical research.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Skeleton-Charles-Byrne-display.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Skeleton of Charles Byrne on display\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14109\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Skeleton-Charles-Byrne-display-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Skeleton-Charles-Byrne-display-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Skeleton-Charles-Byrne-display-224x300.jpg 224w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Skeleton-Charles-Byrne-display-766x1024.jpg 766w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Skeleton-Charles-Byrne-display.jpg 958w\" title=\"Skeleton of Charles Byrne on display\" width=\"112\"/></a>Dr. Sam Alberti, director of the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, said: \u201cThe Royal College of Surgeons believes that the value of Charles Byrne\u2019s remains, to living and future communities, currently outweighs the benefits of carrying out Byrne\u2019s apparent request to dispose of his remains at sea.</p>\n<p>\u201cA vivid example of the value of having access to the skeleton is the current research into Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenoma (FIPA).</p>\n<p>\u201cThis genetically links Byrne to living communities, including individuals who have requested that the skeleton should remain on display in the museum.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the present time, the museum\u2019s Trustees consider that the educational and research benefits merit retaining the remains.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I can\u2019t say I find the utilitarian argument tremendously persuasive. It seems to me Charles Byrne has given far more than his fair share of himself to science already. Time for what\u2019s left of him to rest in peace and, for the first time, in privacy.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Should \u201cthe Irish giant\u201d finally be buried at sea?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14105\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14105#comments\">11 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2011/12/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

href=\"http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/japanese-investor-to-restore-ancient-roman-pyramid/story-e6frfq80-1226233075621\" target=\"_blank\">donate \u20ac1 million ($1.3 million) to restore the tomb of Gaius Cestius</a>, a marble-clad pyramid built in Rome between 18 and 12 B.C. Egyptian style had become a fad in Rome following Octavian\u2019s conquest of Egypt in 30 B.C., and the wealthy Gaius Cestius, who in life had been praetor, tribune of the plebs and a member of the <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Epulones.html\" target=\"_blank\">Septemviri Epulonum</a>, a religious college responsible for throwing banquets for the gods, left instructions in his will that a pyramid be built in 330 days to house his remains.</p>\n<p>Built out of brick-faced concrete on a foundation of travertine, Cestius\u2019 pyramid is 100 Roman feet (about 97 imperial ones) square at the base and 125 Roman feet (about 120 imperial ones) high, making it an extremely acute pyramid with a very pointy top. White Carrara marble slabs face the exterior which was entirely sealed with no entrance point after Gaius Cestius\u2019 burial. Inside is a frescoed burial chamber that held Cestius\u2019 ashes; it was looted in antiquity and tunneled into by disappointed thieves during the Middle Ages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Piramide-with-Porta-S-Paolo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Pyramid of Cestius in the Aurelian wall, Porta San Paolo on the right\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14254\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Piramide-with-Porta-S-Paolo-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Piramide-with-Porta-S-Paolo-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Piramide-with-Porta-S-Paolo-300x201.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Piramide-with-Porta-S-Paolo-1024x687.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Pyramid of Cestius in the Aurelian wall, Porta San Paolo on the right\" width=\"150\"/></a>The pyramid was built at the intersection of two Roman roads outside of the city, but as the city expanded the entire structure was incorporated into the Aurelian walls during their construction between 271 and 275 A.D. It\u2019s still embedded in a particularly well-preserved area of the wall next to the Porta San Paolo gate. Getting absorbed by the wall might have been the best thing that ever happened to the pyramid. None of the other crazy vanity pyramids ancient sources mention having been built in Rome have survived.</p>\n<p>The other side of the pyramid abuts the <a href=\"http://www.protestantcemetery.it/about/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cimitero Acattolico</a> (the non-Catholic cemetery, also known as the Protestant Cemetery though people of many faiths are buried there) where the Romantic poets Shelley and Keats slumber eternally. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful and fantastical spots in Rome, a favorite of my childhood thanks to the huge colony of semi-feral cats who live at the pyramid\u2019s base. Whenever we were in the area for the San Paolo market, I\u2019d insist we stop so I could look over the railing at the cats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Pyramid burial chamber, tunnels from the Middle Ages\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14259\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber-300x201.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PC-burial-chamber-1024x687.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Pyramid burial chamber, tunnels from the Middle Ages\" width=\"150\"/></a>Like many of the most beautiful spots in Rome, the pyramid of Gaius Cestius is in dire need of maintenance. The marble exterior is pollution-blackened, cracked and bristling with vegetation. Water is seeping through the walls and damaging the frescoes, already faded and degraded from millennia of looters/hostile elements, in the burial chamber. Past restorations haven\u2019t been kind to it either. The acid used to clean the exterior in the 1970s left the marble vulnerable to attacks from microorganisms and particulate matter.</p>\n<p>Restoration work was last done in 2002. Advances in technology since then will allow restorers to use new organic products to clean the surface and protect it from future damage. They also plan to use steel beams 23 feet long to stabilize the marble blocks. While they\u2019re at it, researchers will follow up on some ultrasound data from a few years ago which turned up anomalous blank spots on the inside. They will use endoscopes to explore the anomalies. They\u2019re probably not secret chambers but everyone\u2019s hoping for them anyway.</p>\n<p>Yuzo Yagi is the owner of Tsusho Limited, an Osaka-based chain of 400 clothing outlets. He has been doing business in Italy, importing Italian clothes for his stores, for 40 years. All he asks in return for the donation is that a plaque with his name on it be placed near the pyramid. No advertising heinousness.

Amy Clapp inherited a bureau from her great cousin last Christmas. She doesn\u2019t remember ever having met him and she certainly knew nothing about his furnishings. It\u2019s a 20th century piece, solidly made, attractive but nothing of great value. It has two wide drawers and two half-width ones in the front, and a bunch of small ones when the desk is open. She looked through all the drawers and cubbies before calling Hansons Auctioneers to have it appraised for sale. \n Furniture expert Edward Rycroft examined the piece to assess its value. He estimated it was worth about \u00a380 ($106). Then he looked a little deeper and found three secret drawers. One of them held secret treasure. \n He said: \u201cI know bureaus like this often have tiny, secret drawers \u2013 sometimes called coin drawers \u2013 so I always check them just in case.But in 10 years of valuing furniture I have never found anything in them \u2013 until now.\u201d\nMuch to his amazement, he discovered a 22ct gold coin hidden in a secret drawer. It turned out to be rare, more than 650 years old and highly valuable.\nThe Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied coin dates back to 1365. Its guide price is \u00a31,200-\u00a31,800 but the experts at Hansons think it could sell for as much as \u00a33,000. According to their coin valuer Don Collins, it\u2019s very unusual. In more than half a century of coin valuing he has never seen one exactly like it. \n Amy Clapp was thrilled by the unexpected windfall as her family has been through some hard times lately. Her daughter has a genetic condition, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which has severely affected her sight. Mrs. Clapp works for the charitable organization Bardet-Biedl Syndrome UK and plans to donate some of the proceeds to the charity. Here\u2019s hoping it sells way above estimate when it goes up for auction next month. \n The bureau goes under the hammer tomorrow. I\u2019d buy it in a heartbeat for twice the price. God I love secret compartments.  \n This video shows where the secret drawer was found in the desk.  \n  \n Did I run to my modern Georgian repro secretary with a similar drawer layout as soon as I saw this video to pull the drawers all the way out in breathless hope of revealing a hidden compartment? Yes. Yes I did. Was there one? No. No there was not.

It had a hole in the middle and two raised decorations (a Portuguese royal coat of arms and the <em>esfera armilar</em>, King Manuel I\u2019s personal emblem), but no unambiguous evidence of its function could be seen with the naked eye. In 2016, laser scans by Professor Mark Williams at WMG, University of Warwick, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49329\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found lines etched along the edge</a> of the upper right quadrant exactly five degrees apart, markers used by sailors to calculate their latitude.

Before this discovery, the oldest known astrolabe was found on a Portuguese shipwreck that sank off the coast of Namibia in 1533. The <em>Esmeralda</em>\u2018s bell dating to 1498 has also been confirmed as the oldest known ship\u2019s bell, beating the previous record-holder the venerable <em>Mary Rose</em>, the Tudor flagship that sank in the Solent in 1545.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/esmereldas-bell-1498-date-e1552964027568.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54616\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/esmereldas-bell-1498-date-e1552964027568-140x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/esmereldas-bell-1498-date-e1552964027568-140x150.jpg 140w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/esmereldas-bell-1498-date-e1552964027568-200x214.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/esmereldas-bell-1498-date-e1552964027568-768x823.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/esmereldas-bell-1498-date-e1552964027568-430x461.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/esmereldas-bell-1498-date-e1552964027568.jpg 1292w\" title=\"Esmeralda ship's bell, marked with its date of manufacture, 1498.

It\u2019s a great paper for layperson and scholar alike. It lays out the archaeological record of marine astrolabes, how rare they are overall and how almost none of them were excavated archaeologically which makes determining their provenance and background extremely challenging. Only ten were known in 1957 when the first astrolabe register was created by David Waters, curator of navigation and astronomy at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. As of publication, there are 105 astrolabes and four alidades (sights used on astrolabes) on the current list, which you can see a cool (but alas too small) picture of on page two of the paper. The Sodr\u00e9 astrolabe (named after Vicente Sodr\u00e9 who commanded the <em>Esmeralda</em>) is number 108.</p>\n<p>It also explains the whole story of how and why the Sodr\u00e9 brothers and their ships wound up in pieces off the coast of an Oman island and covers the excavation in which more than 2,800 objects were recovered, an incredible wealth of archaeological material that lends invaluable insight into Portuguese navigation in the Age of Discovery.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Esmeralda.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54617\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Esmeralda-430x242.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Esmeralda-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Esmeralda-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Esmeralda-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Esmeralda-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Esmeralda.jpg 1429w\" title=\"Illustration from the Livro das Armadas da \u0301India, c.1568, depicting the loss of Bras and Vicente Sodr\u00e9s ships.

Is it possible that at the time it was created the Portuguese, or at least the maker of this particular specimen, had not refined or standardized the design of their instruments to allow measuring altitude to the precision of 1-degree? Cline (1990: 130) claims that prior to the development of the heavy, open-wheel types, the early navigators were unable to take measurements within four to five degrees even on a ship that was not rolling. This might explain the absence of individual degree marks in the Sodr\u00e9 astrolabe if 5-degree divisions were deemed to be adequate by the navigators, presuming they could always estimate the position of the alidade between scale marks. Considering the general corroded state of the undecorated side and perimeter of the Sodr\u00e9 astrolabe, it is equally possible, however, that the individual gradations have been eroded away and that the faint traces of the 5-degree gradations were preserved because of their position further from the perimeter or possibly because the maker had scored them to a greater depth. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The astrolabe is unique in the archaeological record in a number of ways. It is the only known solid disc (type 0) mariner\u2019s astrolabe with a verifiable provenance and age. This suggests it might be a transitional instrument in the development of mariner\u2019s astrolabes.[\u2026]</p>\n<p>The Sodr\u00e9 astrolabe is also unique in that, of the 104-known instruments, it is the sole specimen decorated with a national symbol: the royal coat of arms of Portugal. Together with Manuel\u2019s <em>esfera armilar</em>, these decorations dominate one side of the Sodr\u00e9 astrolabe. Their conspicuous placement, in relief, ensures that they stand out and would appear to mark the astrolabe as an object of the state. This is significant in light of Manuel\u2019s use of royal symbolism to project his power at the precise time Portuguese ships were discovering new lands and his country was on the cusp of building the world\u2019s first global empire.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, this is a page-turner, one of the most interesting, content-rich and comprehensible research papers I\u2019ve read in a long time. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Da Gama astrolable certified as world\u2019s oldest\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54612\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54612#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54423\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54423\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Raphael\u2019s School of Athens cartoon restored\">Raphael\u2019s School of Athens cartoon restored</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, March 7th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The_School_of_Athens__by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54502\" height=\"155\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The_School_of_Athens__by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino-200x155.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The_School_of_Athens__by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino-200x155.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The_School_of_Athens__by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino-150x116.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The_School_of_Athens__by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino-768x596.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The_School_of_Athens__by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino-430x334.jpg 430w\" title=\"The School of Athens by Raphael, 1509-1511.

Raphael painted the fresco for the Stanza della Segnatura, the room in the Vatican housing Pope Julius II\u2019s library, between 1509 and 1511.  The artist started with a <a href=\"https://www.ambrosiana.it/en/opere/the-school-of-athens/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">full-scale preparatory cartoon</a> in charcoal, red and white chalk on paper in 1508-9. It was massive, over nine feet high and 26 feet wide, and was made by gluing together 210 pieces of \u201croyal paper\u201d (large format sheets about 12\u00d716 inches in dimension). More than 50 individuals, the great philosophers of antiquity centered around Plato and Aristotle, populate the cartoon, with only a couple of figures from the final fresco missing, including Heraclitus, whose face is said to be a portrait of Michelangelo, then working just down the hall on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It is the largest surviving Renaissance cartoon.</p>\n<p>Raphael was employed by Pope Julius on the recommendation of Bramante to fresco the room. The commission served a political role as much an aesthetic one. There were already frescoes on the walls by Piero della Francesca, but he had been hired Alexander VI whose papacy was already infamous. Julius was keen to cover the walls with new frescoes that would erase the imprint of his Borgia predecessor, a sort of <em>damnatio memoriae</em> by artistic proxy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54501\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-det-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-det-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-det-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-det-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-det-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cartoon detail. Photo courtesy Veneranda Biblioteca Ambrosiana/Mondadori Portfoli.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Only 27 years old when he began <em>The School of Athens</em>, Raphael created a vision that transposed the ideas of Renaissance humanist thought into figural and architectural forms. The fluid lines of his initial drawing illuminate his creative process, the apparent ease with which he conceived an intricate mural that would take two years to complete. It\u2019s also the only version of <em>The School of Athens</em> done entirely by Raphael\u2019s own hand. He had staff to help him paint the fresco itself.</p>\n<p>He used the cartoon as a literal outline, poking holes (still clearly visible today) through the lines of the faces, garments, folds and bodies. Because the completed cartoon was so massive, it could not be applied smoothly all at once to the plaster surface of the wall and have the trace-over last for two years of painting. Raphael instead used it to show Julius II a clear view of the full complex composition of the fresco and as a master template, drawing through the perforations onto individual papers just large enough to cover one day\u2019s work. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Heraclitus-Michelangelo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54504\" height=\"215\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Heraclitus-Michelangelo-200x286.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Heraclitus-Michelangelo-200x286.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Heraclitus-Michelangelo-105x150.jpg 105w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Heraclitus-Michelangelo-430x616.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Heraclitus-Michelangelo.jpg 715w\" title=\"Heraclitus, or the Thinker, with the face of Michelangelo.

The architectural design on the top part of the fresco is not on the cartoon, or rather just the foundations of it are, barely visible and only spotted by researchers in 1972. Most of the remarkable vaulted gallery in deep one-point perspective that rises above and behind Plato and Aristotle was painted directly onto the plaster.</p>\n<p>Even in Raphael\u2019s all-too-short lifetime (he died at age 37) the cartoon was recognized as a masterpiece in its own right. It was described as the \u201cwell-finished cartoon\u201d because the lion\u2019s share of the information necessary for the fresco was included: the figures, the setting, the poses, the facial expressions, the direction of the light, the highlights and lowlights of his chiaroscuro.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cartoon-rolled.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54426\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cartoon-rolled-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cartoon-rolled-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cartoon-rolled-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cartoon-rolled-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cartoon-rolled-430x323.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cartoon-rolled.jpg 1224w\" title=\"Cartoon rolled up for transportion. Photo courtesy Veneranda Biblioteca Ambrosiana/Mondadori Portfoli.\" width=\"150\"/></a>That a cartoon as delicate as it is massive survives intact after five centuries of wars, pillage and dispersed cultural patrimony is largely due to Cardinal Federico Borromeo (1564-1631), Archbishop of Milan and founder of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, the second public library in Europe after the Bodleian. He was an erudite man, a prolific writer and connoisseur of the arts who amassed an immense collection of 45,000 manuscripts and books with the deliberate intent of creating a library that would be an invaluable resource for scholars. </p>\n<p>For a hundred years after its creation, the cartoon disappears from the historical record. It reappears in 1610 in a legal document stating that Fabio II Visconti Borromeo, Count of Brebbia (and holder of two far more excellent titles: Decurion of Milan and Judge of the Streets), loans the cartoon to Cardinal Borromeo until such time as Visconti requests its return. That time never came.</p>\n<p>In 1618 the cardinal founded Pinacoteca Ambrosiana to house his great collection of paintings and drawings, including works by Caravaggio (Basket of Fruit) and Leonardo da Vinci (Portrait of a Musician) alongside Raphael\u2019s cartoon, still technically on loan. It became officially part of the Ambrosiana collection in 1626 when the cardinal bought it from the count\u2019s widow Bianca Spinola Borromeo for the then-astronomical sum of 600 imperial lire.</p>\n<p>It remained at the Pinacoteca, one of its greatest treasures and biggest draws, until 1796 when the greatest scourge of Italy\u2019s patrimony, Napoleon Bonaparte, entered Milan.  Five days after his forces took the city, Napoleon proclaimed that Milan now owed France 15 million lire and any and all artworks of value.  Dominique-Vivant Denon, director of the Louvre, was tasked with drawing up a list of Milan\u2019s most important pieces that would be summarily pillaged and sent to the museum in Paris. </p>\n<p>On June 25, 1796, box upon box of treasures from the Ambrosiana left Milan destined for the Louvre. Leonardo\u2019s Musician was in them, his notebooks from the library\u2019s collection and Raphael\u2019s <em>The School of Athens</em> cartoon. It was subject to extensive restoration \u2014 relined with canvas, mounted on a new frame, missing parts filled in \u2014 before being put on display. After Napoleon\u2019s defeat at Waterloo in 1815, the sculptor Antonio Canova was dispatched to the Louvre to reclaim the works taken from the Papal States. While he was at it, he arranged the return of the Ambrosiana\u2019s stuff too. The cartoon was back in Milan by 1816.</p>\n<p>It was restored again in 1887. This time the work done was even more extensive. The cartoon was reframed, and most significantly, was attached to a new canvas backing for support. The wars of the 20th century jerked it around some more. In 1915, with northern Italy the target of Austro-Hungarian aerial bombing, the cartoon went back to Rome for first time since it was drawn by Raphael 400 earlier. It was kept safe in the Vatican until the war was over. In 1942 it went underground, secured in the bank vault of the Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde, and good thing too because the Abrosiana was bombed and had to be rebuilt after the war.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-before-restoration.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54503\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-before-restoration-430x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-before-restoration-430x149.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-before-restoration-150x52.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-before-restoration-200x69.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cartoon-before-restoration-768x266.jpg 768w\" title=\"The School of Athens cartoon in 1966 frame before restoration.

On a custom table with a moveable bridge that allowed conservators to hover over the surface, the cartoon was cleaned with low pressure micro-suction devices like those used in surgery. Old polymer glue used with strips of canvas in the 1966 restoration to expand the perimeter which had shrunk over time was removed. Conservators also repaired tears and lined the back with layers of Japanese tissue paper in different sizes and shapes to relieve stress on the supports and recover the original flatness of the cartoon.

July 1559), her mother Mary of Guise (June 1560) and her husband Francis II (December 1560) of France. White had been a popular mourning color in France for centuries by the time Mary donned it. She had unusually bucked that association and worn white for her 1558 wedding to the then-Dauphin of France, only to find herself having to wear white again in its traditional symbolism after his death just two and a half years later. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54371\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-200x277.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-768x1062.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc-430x595.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mary-en-deuil-blanc.jpg 1417w\" title=\"Mary, Queen of Scots, en dueil blanc, copy after Fran\u00e7ois Clouet, c. 1560-1580.

Her caretaker/keeper/jailer George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, allowed her to sit for Nicholas Hilliard, the premiere miniature portraitist of the Tudor court.

Photo by Antonio Quattrone.\" width=\"200\"/></a><em>Putto with Dolphin</em>, a bronze sculpture by 15th century master Andrea del Verrocchio, is <a href=\"https://www.artfixdaily.com/artwire/release/1448-newly-restored-putto-with-a-dolphin-featured-in-verrocchio-master\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">undergoing much-needed restoration</a> in time for a landmark exhibition of Verocchio\u2019s work. This is the first scientific conservation the <em>Putto</em> will have ever undergone, which is remarkable considering it spent the first 500 years of its life outdoors.</p>\n<p>The polished bronze depicts a chubby winged boy standing on one leg on a half-sphere. In his arms he holds a squirming dolphin. It was commissioned in 1470 by Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici for Villa Medici at Careggi, one of the family\u2019s country homes in the Tuscan hills. Cosimo died there in 1464, and when his grandson Lorenzo, the future Magnificent, took over as head of the family and de facto ruler of Florence in December 1469, he wasted no time in making improvements the Careggi villa and grounds, especially the gardens. The putto was made to top a fountain in the garden, with a spray of water emerging from the dolphin\u2019s rostrum. In 1557, the bronze was moved to the Palazzo Vecchio where it was placed atop the porphyry fountain in the first courtyard. The priceless masterwork remained there until the 1950s, when it was removed from the fountain and put on display as a museum exhibit on the second floor of the Palazzo Vecchio. A replica was installed in its former position on the fountain.</p>\n<p>The restoration project began in 2018 in view of the public in a dedicated workspace in the Palazzo Vecchio. A technical analysis of its condition underneath the surface found evidence of deterioration of the bronze. The surface needed extensive cleaning as calcium and water stains had built up over the centuries. There were also residues left by previous attempts at restoration, some of them using harmful substances. Conservators carefully removed those residues and revealed previously unknown details. They were then able to address the biggest threat: corrosion of the bronze. The last step is to cover the surface with gentle, non-invasive treatments to even out the color and protect the bronze from further corrosion. The process has been thoroughly documented through photographs and videos to learn more about Verrocchio\u2019s sculpture and for the benefit of future conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>The restored <em>Putto</em> will go on display next month in <a href=\"https://www.palazzostrozzi.org/mostre/verrocchio-il-maestro-di-leonardo/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Verrocchio, Master of Leonardo</em></a> at the Palazzo Strozzi, the first ever monographic Verocchio exhibition. It will illuminate his working process thanks to a new technical study of his work, and bring together for the first time more than 120 artworks, paintings, drawings and sculptures by Verrocchio and the masters who learned their art in his workshop. The most important artists of the Renaissance \u2014 Leonardo da Vinci, Domenico del Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli and Pietro Perugino \u2014 all studied under Verrocchio. Together they defined the artistic output of Lorenzo the Magnificent\u2019s Florence between 1460 and 1490. With loans from major museums worldwide, the show will trace the artistic connections linking Leonardo to Verocchio, reconstructing the formation of his style in the interchange between student and master. </p>\n<p>The exhibition begins in Florence, running from March 9th through July 14th at the Palazzo Strozzi, with a special section at the National Museum of the Bargello (home of Verrocchio\u2019s <em>David</em>, iconic symbol of Republicanism).

Photo by AFP.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Guano Mummy was discovered after an earthquake struck the town on August 5th, 1949. In the rubble of the Asunci\u00f3n Church, rescuers found the well-preserved remains of a man wedged between two of only three sections of walls that remained of the 400-year-old church. The man was positioned vertically, as if standing, between the walls. He had not deliberately mummified, and neither was the mummified mouse found next to him. It seems the body was sprinkled with lime to speed decomposition but instead the dry, cold conditions preserved his tissues (and those of the unfortunate rodent) in excellent condition. His clothing also survived in remarkably fine fettle. There was a purple scarf wrapped around his jaw (perhaps to keep his mouth from gaping open) and a long white robe covering his body. </p>\n<p>After its discovery, the mummy was moved to the town library where it was displayed in less than adequate conditions which caused some deterioration of the organic remains. In 2003, a team of researchers from the US did a thorough study of the mummy, X-raying and carbon-dating it to the 16th century. The date coupled with archival research pointed to a possible candidate for the identity of the mummy: Fray L\u00e1zaro de la Cruz de Santofimia, a Franciscan monk who traveled to Guano from Spain to take charge of the religious community there.</p>\n<p>Asunci\u00f3n Church was built between approximately 1560 and 1572, commissioned by the Franciscan missionaries who were evangelizing the indigenous Puruh\u00e1 culture. Later a monastery and cemetery would be built next to the church.

The organs were not intact inside the bodies, but even without hearts to explore, researchers were able to detect hardened calcium, ie plaque, in the remains of blood vessels in the chest and neck.</p>\n<blockquote><p>From Egypt to Mongolia and now Greenland, mummies throughout the ages have shown evidence of atherosclerosis. The Greenland mummies were of particular interest due to their diet, which would have primarily consisted of fish and sea mammals.</p>\n<p>While increased fish consumption is commonly touted as heart-healthy \u2014 which may make the findings of atherosclerosis seem surprising \u2014 [associate director of the Brigham\u2019s Cardiovascular Imaging Program Dr. Ron] Blankstein emphasized that scientists still have much to learn about its relationship to cardiovascular health. For example, although it is known that consuming fish rich in omega-3 fats has benefits, some types of fish can also be high in cholesterol and, in the current era, contain toxins like mercury or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that may pose risk, he said.</p>\n<p>Lifestyle factors, such as exposure to cooking smoke in their dwellings, may have also contributed to the mummified individuals developing cardiovascular disease during their lifetimes, Blankstein said. Given that and the small sample sizes of these mummy scans, he noted that the team\u2019s findings shouldn\u2019t be taken too much to heart, so to speak.</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7GRt1YhFvA\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"16th c.

These improvements will enhance the experience for the thousands of pilgrims who flock to the basilica to celebrate religious events, making it much easier to get a decent view of the Pope and other concelebrants. An even greater advantage will go to the lovers of art and architecture who also flock to St. Peter\u2019s and wait in its insane lines without the consolation of religious fervor. The architectural and decorative features of one of the masterpieces of Renaissance construction are now visible in a whole new depth. The areas that were lit by the old system, like the main dome, originally designed by Bramante and redesigned and strengthened by Michelangelo, are now so clearly lit that details can be seen which were previously invisible. Places that could not be lit under the old regime are now dazzling, including the octagons and mini-cupolas of the side aisles. You simply could not see the rich mosaics that adorn these features from the ground unaided. Five hundred years ago they were lit by candles, so effectively not lit at all. Now they\u2019re plain as day for the first time in half a millennium. </p>\n<p>The photographs look so good I might even brave those insane lines myself next time I\u2019m in Rome, which is saying something because I took one look at them and ran the hell out of there in 2017. I didn\u2019t even attempt it in 2018.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54085\" height=\"291\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-430x291.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-430x291.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-768x520.jpg 768w\" title=\"LED lights in the dome of St. Peter's.

Its homecoming is so heralded because the sculptor himself sent it to Dresden 432 years ago.</p>\n<p>Born Jean Boulogne in Douai, Flanders, in 1529, Giambologna traveled to Rome in 1550 where he was influenced by Classical art and Renaissance masters like Michelangelo and Raphael. He moved to Florence in 1553 where his refined approach to the contortionist Mannerist style earned him a position as the top sculptor at the court of the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany by 1560.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-det.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54069\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-det.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-det.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-det.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-det.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-768x1025.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-det.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-430x574.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-det.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Mars detail.

His works were so famous they were widely copied. Very few of his sculptures have undisputed documentation of having been produced by his hand during his lifetime. <em>The Dresden Mars</em> is one of them.</p>\n<p>It is the earliest cast of the artist\u2019s Mars, made by Giambologna as a personal gift for <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-The-Dresden-Mars-8.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54074\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-The-Dresden-Mars-8-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-The-Dresden-Mars-8-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-The-Dresden-Mars-8-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-The-Dresden-Mars-8-768x1025.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-The-Dresden-Mars-8-430x574.jpg 430w\" title=\"Side view showing sword hilt in right hand.

It is the most significant and powerful of his male nudes, the strength of the mythological deity conveyed by his dynamic stride, detailed musculature and intense glare. The usual attributes of Mars \u2014 helmet, shield, spear \u2014 are absent, with only the hilt of a sword clutched in his right fist standing in for them.</p>\n<p>It was made before 1587, the year it arrived in Saxony. Inventory records of the Dresden Kunstkammer note its arrival: \u201cBrass cast portrait of Mars, sent by Giovanni Bologna to His Grace the Elector.\u201d It\u2019s the only Giambologna piece known to have been created for a prince and the sculptor made certain that it was of royal quality. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-portrait-by-Hendrik-Goltzius-1591.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54073\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-portrait-by-Hendrik-Goltzius-1591-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-portrait-by-Hendrik-Goltzius-1591-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-portrait-by-Hendrik-Goltzius-1591-200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-portrait-by-Hendrik-Goltzius-1591-768x961.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Giambologna-portrait-by-Hendrik-Goltzius-1591-430x538.jpg 430w\" title=\"Hendrick Goltzius, Ritratto di Giambologna, 1591, Teylers Museum, Haarlem.\" width=\"120\"/></a>Christian I was keenly aware that it was an exceptional work. In return, the Elector commissioned a hugely expensive necklace from  goldsmith Urban Schneeweiss to thank Giambologna for his generous gift. It is believed he was wearing the prized jewel when he sat for a 1591 chalk portrait by Hendrik Goltzius now in the collection of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem.</p>\n<p>After three centuries at the Kunstkammer, the masterpiece went into private ownership in 1924, a casualty of the complicated aftermath of World War I. In the wake of Germany\u2019s defeat in 1918 and the abdication of the Kaiser, the last King of Saxony, Frederick Augustus III abdicated as well. The kingdom became the Free State of Saxony, a semi-autonomous state in the Weimar Republic. The new state confiscated the former king\u2019s assets but he refuse to walk away from them as he had the throne. Instead he hired a lawyer and in 1919 sued the Free State of Saxony for illegally requisitioning his family patrimony. He claimed a passel of real estate, millions in cash and securities and 17.5 million marks\u2019 worth of art.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54071\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-200x268.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-768x1028.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-430x575.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys.jpg 1000w\" title=\"The Dresden Mars, left view.

It took many years of stops and starts, amendments and provisos before the deal was sealed. In 1924, Frederick Augustus got castles, lots of cash and a buttload of art from the collections of multiple museums, including the Kupferstichkabinett Dresden, now the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (SKD).</p>\n<p>He was more into the castles and cash than the art. The Dresden Mars was consigned to an art gallery in Berlin which sold it to Theodor Plieninger, General Director of Chemische Werke Griesheim-Elektron, in 1927. Griesheim-Elektron gave it to a member of the board of directors Constantin Jacobi as a retirement present in 1943. Sure beats the usual gold watch. It remained in his family until 1988 when his son and heir Walter Jacobi gave it Bayer AG.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Bayer decided to sell Mars at a Sotheby\u2019s auction. The company\u2019s art collection is almost entirely modern, with the Giambologna as its only Renaissance piece and the infusion of millions of dollars from the sale would give them the chance to grow the collection\u2019s contemporary art. Sotheby\u2019s pre-sale estimate was \u00a33-5 million ($4-6.6 million) and it was thrilled to be handling an original Giambologna because they basically never come on the market.</p>\n<p>A week before the auction, the SKD, armed with contributions from Free State of Saxony, the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media, the Ernst von Siemens Kunststiftung, the German Federal Cultural Foundation and the Friends of the SKD, approached Bayer AG offering a private sale. On July 3rd, the day before the scheduled auction, the deal was made and the lot withdrawn. </p>\n<p>The Dresden Mars will go on permanent display in the SKD\u2019s Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister when it reopens after refurbishment in December of this year. As of this week, it is going on a Welcome Home Tour through Saxony, beginning at the Stadt-und Bergbaumuseum Freiberg then moving to the Schloss Hartenfels in Torgau and making its last stop on the tour at the Schlossbergmuseum Chemnit.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"The Dresden Mars returns to Dresden\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54067\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54067#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

Amy Clapp inherited a bureau from her great cousin last Christmas. She doesn\u2019t remember ever having met him and she certainly knew nothing about his furnishings. It\u2019s a 20th century piece, solidly made, attractive but nothing of great value. It has two wide drawers and two half-width ones in the front, and a bunch of small ones when the desk is open. She looked through all the drawers and cubbies before calling Hansons Auctioneers to have it appraised for sale.</p>\n<p>Furniture expert Edward Rycroft examined the piece to assess its value. He estimated it was worth about \u00a380 ($106). Then he looked a little deeper and found three secret drawers. One of them held secret treasure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He said: \u201cI know bureaus like this often have tiny, secret drawers \u2013 sometimes called coin drawers \u2013 so I always check them just in case.But in 10 years of valuing furniture I have never found anything in them \u2013 until now.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54625\" height=\"153\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-200x153.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-200x153.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-150x115.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-768x589.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse-430x330.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coin-reverse.jpg 1321w\" title=\"Reverse of Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied gold coin. Photo courtesy Hansons Auctioneers.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Much to his amazement, he discovered a 22ct gold coin hidden in a secret drawer. It turned out to be rare, more than 650 years old and highly valuable.</p>\n<p>The Raymond IV Prince of Orange Franc A Pied coin dates back to 1365. Its guide price is \u00a31,200-\u00a31,800 but the experts at Hansons think it could sell for as much as \u00a33,000. According to their coin valuer Don Collins, it\u2019s very unusual. In more than half a century of coin valuing he has never seen one exactly like it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Amy Clapp was thrilled by the unexpected windfall as her family has been through some hard times lately. Her daughter has a genetic condition, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which has severely affected her sight. Mrs. Clapp works for the charitable organization Bardet-Biedl Syndrome UK and plans to donate some of the proceeds to the charity. Here\u2019s hoping it sells way above estimate when it goes up for auction next month.</p>\n<p>The bureau goes under the hammer tomorrow. I\u2019d buy it in a heartbeat for twice the price. God I love secret compartments. </p>\n<p>This video shows where the secret drawer was found in the desk. </p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/62nDc1txTs4\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Did I run to my modern Georgian repro secretary with a similar drawer layout as soon as I saw this video to pull the drawers all the way out in breathless hope of revealing a hidden compartment? Yes. Yes I did. Was there one? No. No there was not.

Laura Hill and her family were prepping the backyard for a new lawn when the backhoe they\u2019d rented revealed animal bones. Hill thought they were historic, maybe the remains of a cow or horse that had belonged to one of the pioneers who settled the Utah Territory in the 19th century. \n A few months later, Laura Hill visited Lehi\u2019s Thanksgiving Point Museum of Ancient Life and approached museum paleontologist Rick Hunter to tell him about the bones in her yard. Hunter assembled a team of scientists and volunteers to examine and fully excavate the find.  \n They quickly determined that it far predated pioneer Utah. The small horse is 14,000 to 16,000 years old, which means it roamed the area during the Pleistocene Epoch when most of what we know today as the state of Utah was covered by Lake Bonneville. It is therefore rare to find a land mammal like a horse from this period.  \n The Thanksgiving Point team spent Tuesday excavating the bones. The horse \u2014 which Hunter described as about the size of a Shetland pony, but built stockier \u2014 was mostly a complete skeleton. The horse was laying on its left side with its front legs tucked under and back legs straight out.\n\u201cThis is some of the best articulation I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Hunter said, explaining that means the horse\u2019s bones were still intact. \u201cIt tells us that the sediment covered it almost immediately after it died. The thing was just beautiful.\u201d\nHunter also is excited about how much bone he and his team have to work with.\n\u201cIn dinosaurs, if we find 20 percent of the bones, we\u2019re excited,\u201d he said Thursday as an assistant chipped rock away from a large dinosaur bone in the lab. \u201cBut we have more of this guy. I estimate we have about 85 percent of it here.\u201d \n The bones have not even mineralized yet, although they are remarkably well-preserved thanks to the sandy soil they\u2019ve been embedded in for thousands of years. Now that they\u2019ve been excavated, they will dry out rapidly which poses a conservation danger. The rate of drying has to be controlled to ensure the bones don\u2019t become brittle. \n After the bones are fully dry, they will be coated with consolidants that will harden them and preserve them for long-term storage and study. Preliminary osteological examination has already discovered that the horse had arthritis in his back and there is evidence of bone cancer in one ankle. That suggests the animal was of advanced age. \n Once the bones are stable and have been thoroughly researched, documented and put back together, the skeleton, dubbed the Hill Horse, will be displayed at the museum. That could take up to a year, but the Hill family is already riding high. \n Hill\u2019s children and nearby neighborhood kids all got to participate in the archaeological excavation, with Hunter guiding them and teaching them along the way.\n\u201cIt could not have been cooler for my kids. They were so good with them. It was fun to have them here,\u201d Hill said of Hunter\u2019s team. \u201cIt totally inspired my kids to be into paleontology and archaeology. It\u2019s all become really real.\u201d \n   ", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n\n<html lang=\"en-US\"

Some of the tablets are still enveloped in the original clay covers which served as a means of data protection. The majority of cuneiform tablets document financial transactions, inventory, a wide assortment of business, religious and government records. If the inscription was exposed, figures could be easily be changed by simply dunking the tablet in water to soften it a little. Such records would be under constant threat of fraud and forgery. The outer clay layer made it impossible to alter the document without breaking the envelope and making the interference unmistakably clear.</p>\n<p>When the study of cuneiform tablets began in earnest the 19th century, archaeologists had no qualms about breaking the hard candy shell to get to the chocolaty text within. These days destruction in the name of knowledge acquisition is no longer an acceptable approach to archaeological materials. Technology has made non-invasive methods of investigation not only possible, but exponentially superior to the crude bull-in-a-china-shop methods of yore. Synchroton light, lasers and CT scanners can see far better than the human eye.</p>\n<p>To that end, <a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2018/04/4000-year-old-clay-tablets-in-hypermodern-scanner\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NINO researchers have enlisted the aid of the micro-CT-scanner</a> at Delft University of Technology to see into the clay tablets that still retain their envelopes. The micro-CT scan generates a 3D model of the object in sections and in enough detail that the surface of the tablet within the clay cover can be read. </p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5RmTpMoH-1o?rel=0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Look inside a cuneiform tablet\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51299\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51299#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-51290\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51290\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Roman skeletons found under hotel swimming pool\">Roman skeletons found under hotel swimming pool</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, April 28th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-burial-ground-underneath-hotel-swimming-pool.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-51292\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-burial-ground-underneath-hotel-swimming-pool-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-burial-ground-underneath-hotel-swimming-pool-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-burial-ground-underneath-hotel-swimming-pool-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-burial-ground-underneath-hotel-swimming-pool-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-burial-ground-underneath-hotel-swimming-pool-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Roman burial ground underneath hotel swimming pool.

The graves were shallow which had made them more susceptible to the ravages of later agricultural and construction activity. Layers of medieval plough soil were found above the graves, some with fragments of bone and pottery, and home construction in the 1820s disturbed the burials as well. Only 10% of the skeletons were discovered intact, but thankfully those 10% were in good enough condition for osteological examination and stable isotope testing to tell us more about how the regular folk of Roman York lived.</p>\n<p>Even before the medieval and modern earth-churning, the cemetery was in use for so long that newer graves cut through poorly marked older ones.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Field-archaeologist-records-burial.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-51295\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Field-archaeologist-records-burial-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Field-archaeologist-records-burial-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Field-archaeologist-records-burial-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Field-archaeologist-records-burial-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Field-archaeologist-records-burial-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"Field archaeologist records burial.

At first glance, the image is decidedly chaotic: rather than lying in regimented rows the graves crowd together, oriented towards all points of the compass and frequently intercutting.</p>\n<p>As for who was buried there, this was a demographically diverse cemetery, populated by both men and women, and individuals of all ages from infants to elderly adults \u2013 although they seem to have been broadly of the same social class.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Partially-excavated-skeleton-and-pot.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-51293\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Partially-excavated-skeleton-and-pot-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Partially-excavated-skeleton-and-pot-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Partially-excavated-skeleton-and-pot-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Partially-excavated-skeleton-and-pot-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Partially-excavated-skeleton-and-pot-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Partially excavated skeleton and pot.

The road is an offshoot of the main Roman road that ran between York and Lincoln, and Roman burials were largely concentrated along roadsides. The property nearest the city was the most expensive, used by the elite to showcase their extravagant tombs. The farther away from the city they got, the more modest the graves. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-pottery-flask.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-51296\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-pottery-flask-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-pottery-flask-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-pottery-flask-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-pottery-flask-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roman-pottery-flask-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"Roman pottery flask found in one of the graves.

The people under the swimming pool were buried in simple graves with no elaborate markers. Their grave goods consisted almost entirely of inexpensive earthenware pottery. Only two of the graves held anything else. One contained a jet pin, the other the remains of a copper alloy head ornament. These inexpensive objects were likely part of the deceased\u2019s funerary styling, not separate grave goods. Still, the pots that were found in graves are in excellent condition, practically mint. Archaeologists suspect they were bought for the funeral rather than pieces the deceased used in their lifetimes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Girls-from-Bootham-School-work-at-Trentholme-Drive-dig.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-51297\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Girls-from-Bootham-School-work-at-Trentholme-Drive-dig-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Girls-from-Bootham-School-work-at-Trentholme-Drive-dig-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Girls-from-Bootham-School-work-at-Trentholme-Drive-dig-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Girls-from-Bootham-School-work-at-Trentholme-Drive-dig-768x768.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Girls-from-Bootham-School-work-at-Trentholme-Drive-dig-430x430.jpg 430w\" title=\"Girls from Bootham School work at Trentholme Drive dig in the 1950s.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Cemeteries have been found before in this area.

They believe the mud layer once covered the entire sandy dune where the ritual took place, and it was disturbed during the preparation of the burial pits and the subsequent sacrifice event.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Largest known child sacrifice found in Peru\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51282\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51282#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-51275\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51275\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Child skeleton found in Pompeii\u2019s Central Baths\">Child skeleton found in Pompeii\u2019s Central Baths</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, April 26th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Skeleton-discovered-at-Pompeii.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-51279\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Skeleton-discovered-at-Pompeii-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Skeleton-discovered-at-Pompeii-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Skeleton-discovered-at-Pompeii-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Skeleton-discovered-at-Pompeii-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Skeleton-discovered-at-Pompeii-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skeleton discovered at Pompeii.

The find was unexpected, a fortuitous discovery during work to strengthen and restore the complex that had already been extensively excavated in the 19th century. It\u2019s also unusual from a stratigraphic perspective, because it was found just 10 centimeters underneath an entrance area instead of under a thick layer of pumice fall, another created by the pyroclastic flow of superheated gases and volcanic material and a top layer of ash sealing everything below. The child was covered only by the pyroclastic layer, not the pumice or ash. </p>\n<p>While the structures in the rest of the city experienced roof collapses from being pummeled by hot pumice for hours (many Pompeiians died from being crushed under busted roofs, not from the direct effects of the eruption), the area of the Central Baths where the child was found appears to have kept its lid. The pyroclastic flow must have come in through the windows, which is like something out of <em>The Blob</em> only way, way scarier.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Child-skeleton-in-context.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51277\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Child-skeleton-in-context-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Child-skeleton-in-context-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Child-skeleton-in-context-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Child-skeleton-in-context-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Child-skeleton-in-context-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Child skeleton in context. Photo courtesy Pompeii Archaeological Park.\" width=\"200\"/></a>First to emerge was the child\u2019s skull, followed by the articulated bones of the body. Because of its in situ, intact discovery, archaeologists were able to make an educated guess that the child was seven or eight years old at the time of death and that he or she had fled into the baths seeking refuge from the eruption. It\u2019s a lucky that the find site was excavated in 1877-8 but the burial was not disturbed at that time, not dug up, no plaster cast made. That\u2019s probably due to the ancient pyroclastic material being too difficult at that time to create a cast, and making the castings was the top priority.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cPompeii is at a turning point for archaeological research,\u201d says Massimo Osanna, Director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, \u201cnot only for the exceptional discoveries that give strong emotions as in the case of this discovery, but above all because it has consolidated a new model of scientific approach that deals with the interdisciplinary excavation investigations. A team of specialized professionals such as archaeologists, architects, restorers but also engineers, geotechnicals, archaeobotanists, anthropologists, vulcanologists work steadily, side by side and with the support of cutting-edge technological resources, so as not to leave any scientific element to chance, and then reconstruct in the most accurate way a new piece of history that, through the excavations, is returned to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Central Baths, located at the intersection of Via di Nola and via Stabiana, develop on the space of an entire block, the insula 4 of the Regio IX, made available by the leveling of pre-existing buildings, probably damaged by the earthquake of 62 AD. Their construction is later than that date and at the time of the eruption it was not completed. The entire complex is the subject of consolidation (treatment of holes, consolidation, perforation of the lesions, restoration of the walls, restoration of sill levels and thresholds, replacement of architraves) and restoration (revision and restoration of walls and walls of plasters, cleaning and restoration of the flood, of the tanks and of the staircase; restoration of the tubules in the calidarium) started last January.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Child skeleton found in Pompeii\u2019s Central Baths\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51275\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51275#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-51269\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51269\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Britain\u2019s oldest gold bought at car boot sale\">Britain\u2019s oldest gold bought at car boot sale</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, April 25th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bronze-Age-gold-strip.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51271\" height=\"143\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bronze-Age-gold-strip-200x143.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bronze-Age-gold-strip-200x143.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bronze-Age-gold-strip-150x107.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bronze-Age-gold-strip-768x549.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bronze-Age-gold-strip-430x307.jpg 430w\" title=\"Early Bronze Age gold strip found at car boot sale in Oxfordshire.

The Oxford Coroner\u2019s Court ruled on April 17th that the folded gold strip dating to the Early Bronze Age qualifies as treasure on the grounds of its prehistoric age and its high percentage of precious metal content. </p>\n<p>The number of objects of this age and type discovered in Britain can literally be counted on the fingers of one hand. They date to around 2400-200 B.C., which make them the earliest gold artifacts in Britain. The strip is now in two pieces but that happened after it was folded and lost. Even put together the two pieces do not make up the complete original and because there is no find site or any way of locating it, the odds of finding missing fragments are infinitesimally small. </p>\n<p>There are punched dots along the edge of the tapered end and three circles pierced through another terminal in a triangular shape. These could be decorative features or evidence that the gold was once mounted to something \u2014 a scabbard, jewelry, clothing. <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3192825&amp;partId=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A similar strip</a> found near Winchester in 2000 and now in the collection of the British Museum is also perforated at the terminal in a triangular shape.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr Workman spotted the unusual piece and showed it to friends who had interest in metal detecting and was encouraged to get in touch with the British Museum.</p>\n<p>[Oxfordshire Finds liaison officer Anni] Byard described the piece as \u2018exceptionally rare\u2019 and said \u2018very rare doesn\u2019t seem to do it justice\u2019.</p>\n<p>She added: \u201cAs soon as I heard about it I knew it was Bronze Age and realised it was pretty unusual and quite rare.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause they are so rare we don\u2019t know what they would have been used for, it could have been on the side of a sword or could have been worn around the neck as jewellery. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now that it has been ruled official treasure, the gold strip is property of the crown and will be assessed for fair market value. A local museum will be given first dibs at acquiring it for the assessed value, the award to go to the finder. The Oxfordshire Museum is keen to secure the piece for the county. The monetary value won\u2019t be prohibitive. The Winchester strip was valued at \u00a32,000, and while this piece is a little larger and gold has increased in value since then, it should still be well within reach of the Oxfordshire Museum. Its historic value, of course, is inestimable.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Britain\u2019s oldest gold bought at car boot sale\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51269\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51269#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-51262\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51262\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Mosaic looted from Cyprus church repatriated\">Mosaic looted from Cyprus church repatriated</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, April 24th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria.-Photo-by-Julez-A..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-51267\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria.-Photo-by-Julez-A.-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria.-Photo-by-Julez-A.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria.-Photo-by-Julez-A.-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria.-Photo-by-Julez-A.-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria.-Photo-by-Julez-A.-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Panagia Kanakaria.

The northeastern Karpass peninsula was heavily targeted by heritage despoilers, with thefts going on for years after the invasion. The church of Panagia Kanakaria in the village of Lythrangomi, an extremely rare survival of a 6th century monastery church famed for its Byzantine mosaics, was pillaged by Turkish occupation troops in 1979. Its mosaics of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and apostles, iconographically unique masterpieces of Early Christian mosaic art, were stripped off the walls and sold to antiquities buyers who didn\u2019t give a damn about the brutality underpinning their acquisitions.</p>\n<p>The looting was reported to UNESCO, other international heritage and policing organizations. Experts in Byzantine art were also notified so they could keep an eye out for the mosaics in institutions and collections. In 1983, two of the Apostle medallions that once adorned the apse of the church were located by a London art dealer and returned through Germany.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria-St.-Matthew.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51266\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria-St.-Matthew-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria-St.-Matthew-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria-St.-Matthew-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria-St.-Matthew-768x1153.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria-St.-Matthew-430x646.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panagia-Kanakaria-St.-Matthew.jpg 1199w\" title=\"Panagia Kanakaria St. Matthew medallion, one of the four bought by Peg Goldberg.

Paul Getty Museum in California, but the Getty was suspicious and alerted Greek Cypriot authorities. The Autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus filed a restitution claim in an Indianapolis federal court. Goldberg fought back, but her look-the-other-wayism was so egregious \u2014 the dealer claimed he had found the priceless mosaics \u201cin an abandoned church,\u201d she knew one of the middlemen was a convicted art forger, she only inspected the mosaics for a moment in the middle of the Geneva airport \u2014 that the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana sided with the plaintiffs and ordered the mosaics returned to the Church. They were repatriated in August of 1991 and are now in the Byzantine Museum in Nicosia.</p>\n<p>Turkish art dealer Aydin Dikmen was arrested in 1998 for having sold the looted Kanakaria mosaics to Peg Goldberg as well as other artifacts ripped from the walls of churches and monasteries. Greek Cypriot police and Department of Antiquities officials suspect him of having been instrumental in the savaging of Cyprus\u2019 patrimony after the invasion and then spending decades selling his ill-gotten gains. </p>\n<p>Another of the missing medallions, the one depicting the Apostle Thomas, was found in Dikmen\u2019s possession during a police sting in October of 1997. Thaddeus was found the month before that. The hands of Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary were found the month after that. More of them have been recovered since, leaving only two Apostle medallions still missing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mosaic-fragment-depicting-Saint-Andrew.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-51264\" height=\"214\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mosaic-fragment-depicting-Saint-Andrew-200x214.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mosaic-fragment-depicting-Saint-Andrew-200x214.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mosaic-fragment-depicting-Saint-Andrew-140x150.jpg 140w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mosaic-fragment-depicting-Saint-Andrew-768x820.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mosaic-fragment-depicting-Saint-Andrew-430x459.jpg 430w\" title=\"Medallion depicting St. Andrew, 6th century. \" width=\"200\"/></a>Now one of those last remaining two, a vividly colored depiction of St. Andrew, has been recovered and <a href=\"http://cyprus-mail.com/2018/04/23/one-last-two-pieces-looted-kanakaria-mosaics-back-cyprus/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">repatriated to Cyprus</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The mosaic was found in 2014 by the art historian Maria Paphiti.

This was the first book by a classical ancient author to be translated into English, as well as the first Renaissance humanist author translated into English. </p>\n<p>Unlike <em>The Golden Legend</em>, of which thousands of manuscripts and printed editions survive, there are only 13 known extant copies of the Caxton Cicero.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end of the first text, Caxton includes a colophon [\u2026], which is an imprint by the printer that includes information about the book\u2019s publication.</p>\n<p>The printed text states that the book is \u201cimprinted by me simple person William Caxton into English at the pleasure, solace and reverence of men growing into old age.\u201d The writing in ink below the statement is likely a person practising their handwriting, trying to emulate the type \u2013 likely from the end of the 15th century, says [interim head of rare books and manuscripts at Fisher Library, Pearce] Carefoote.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero-page.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-51258\" height=\"105\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero-page-150x105.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero-page-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero-page-200x140.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero-page-768x538.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero-page-430x301.jpg 430w\" title=\"First page of the Caxton Cicero.

It was then given to 16th-century politician Sir Robert Coke, who passed it on to his nephew. After his nephew\u2019s death, the book was given to Sion College in London, which kept it until 1977 when it was bought by Mexican author Roberto Salinas Price through a rare book dealer.</p>\n<p>U of T acquired the text from Price\u2019s estate, which was made possible by many donors, led by the B.H. Breslauer Foundation and with the support from the University of Toronto through a matching grant.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a random but satisfying numerological coincidence, it is the 15th millionth book in the Fisher Library collection. It will be of inestimable scholarly value to students of the classics, Renaissance, the history of the English language (Caxton\u2019s publications were instrumental in establishing the primacy of the London dialect, standardizing English and spreading literacy), the physical object of the book and more. Library staff also plan to digitize the book so that it can be accessed by interested parties all over the world.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero.-Photo-courtesy-the-University-of-Toronto..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-51259\" height=\"287\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero.-Photo-courtesy-the-University-of-Toronto.-430x287.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero.-Photo-courtesy-the-University-of-Toronto.-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero.-Photo-courtesy-the-University-of-Toronto.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero.-Photo-courtesy-the-University-of-Toronto.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero.-Photo-courtesy-the-University-of-Toronto.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Caxton-Cicero.-Photo-courtesy-the-University-of-Toronto..jpg 1140w\" title=\"Caxton Cicero.

Ancient sources vary on the date of this mythical event (in fact, archaeological evidence indicates Rome has been inhabited since Paleolithic times, ca. 14,000 years ago) but for the past couple of thousand years the most widely accepted date for the founding is 753 B.C., which makes the Eternal City 2,772 years old today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Summerston-distance-stone-det.-Photo-courtesy-University-of-Glasgow.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-51245\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Summerston-distance-stone-det.-Photo-courtesy-University-of-Glasgow-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Summerston-distance-stone-det.-Photo-courtesy-University-of-Glasgow-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Summerston-distance-stone-det.-Photo-courtesy-University-of-Glasgow-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Summerston-distance-stone-det.-Photo-courtesy-University-of-Glasgow-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Summerston-distance-stone-det.-Photo-courtesy-University-of-Glasgow-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Summerston distance stone det.

The soldiers left distance stones, slabs with reliefs and inscriptions documenting how much of the wall they\u2019d built, features unique to the Antonine Wall.</p>\n<p>A new study by University of Glasgow archaeologist Dr. Louisa Campbell has found that those distance slabs, now worn down to their natural sandstone, were originally painted in bright red and yellow. She used X-ray and laser technology to analyze the Second Legion\u2019s distance stone, found at Summerston Farm in the 17th century.</p>\n<p>Inscribed with a dedication to Antoninus Pius (\u201cFor the Emperor Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, father of his country, the Second Augustan Legion completed [this work] over a distance of 3666.5 paces\u201d), the stone depicts Roman cavalry with two captives on the left of the inscription, and an eagle on top of a capricorn (emblem of the Second Legion) on the right.

It presented some challenges which have now been mitigated and the next phase of the research seeks to determine whether other stone statuary, including Pictish symbol stones and other early medieval sculpture was adorned in colour.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Happy Birthday, Rome, from the Antonine Wall.\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51242\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> \n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51242#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2018/04/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

Photo courtesy Laura Hill.\" width=\"200\"/></a>A family in Lehi, Utah, <a href=\"https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/north/lehi/lehi-family-finds-prehistoric-bones-in-their-backyard/article_30cfdf9c-cfd5-555b-8cfb-ce41b23b0a57.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inadvertently unearthed the skeleton of an Ice Age equine</a> while working on landscaping project in their backyard. Laura Hill and her family were prepping the backyard for a new lawn when the backhoe they\u2019d rented revealed animal bones. Hill thought they were historic, maybe the remains of a cow or horse that had belonged to one of the pioneers who settled the Utah Territory in the 19th century.</p>\n<p>A few months later, Laura Hill visited Lehi\u2019s Thanksgiving Point Museum of Ancient Life and approached museum paleontologist Rick Hunter to tell him about the bones in her yard. Hunter assembled a team of scientists and volunteers to examine and fully excavate the find. </p>\n<p>They quickly determined that it far predated pioneer Utah. The small horse is 14,000 to 16,000 years old, which means it roamed the area during the Pleistocene Epoch when most of what we know today as the state of Utah was covered by Lake Bonneville. It is therefore rare to find a land mammal like a horse from this period. </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rick-Hunter-with-horse-bones.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51310\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rick-Hunter-with-horse-bones-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rick-Hunter-with-horse-bones-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rick-Hunter-with-horse-bones-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rick-Hunter-with-horse-bones-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rick-Hunter-with-horse-bones-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Rick Hunter with horse bones bagged and tagged at Museum of Ancient of Life.

The horse \u2014 which Hunter described as about the size of a Shetland pony, but built stockier \u2014 was mostly a complete skeleton. The horse was laying on its left side with its front legs tucked under and back legs straight out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is some of the best articulation I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Hunter said, explaining that means the horse\u2019s bones were still intact. \u201cIt tells us that the sediment covered it almost immediately after it died. The thing was just beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunter also is excited about how much bone he and his team have to work with.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn dinosaurs, if we find 20 percent of the bones, we\u2019re excited,\u201d he said Thursday as an assistant chipped rock away from a large dinosaur bone in the lab. \u201cBut we have more of this guy. I estimate we have about 85 percent of it here.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The bones have not even mineralized yet, although they are remarkably well-preserved thanks to the sandy soil they\u2019ve been embedded in for thousands of years. Now that they\u2019ve been excavated, they will dry out rapidly which poses a conservation danger. The rate of drying has to be controlled to ensure the bones don\u2019t become brittle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boxes-of-dried-horse-bones-and-drawing-of-horse-skeletal-structure.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-51311\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boxes-of-dried-horse-bones-and-drawing-of-horse-skeletal-structure-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boxes-of-dried-horse-bones-and-drawing-of-horse-skeletal-structure-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boxes-of-dried-horse-bones-and-drawing-of-horse-skeletal-structure-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boxes-of-dried-horse-bones-and-drawing-of-horse-skeletal-structure-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boxes-of-dried-horse-bones-and-drawing-of-horse-skeletal-structure-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Boxes of dried horse bones and drawing of horse skeletal structure at the Museum of Ancient Life.

Preliminary osteological examination has already discovered that the horse had arthritis in his back and there is evidence of bone cancer in one ankle. That suggests the animal was of advanced age.</p>\n<p>Once the bones are stable and have been thoroughly researched, documented and put back together, the skeleton, dubbed the Hill Horse, will be displayed at the museum. That could take up to a year, but the Hill family is already riding high.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hill\u2019s children and nearby neighborhood kids all got to participate in the archaeological excavation, with Hunter guiding them and teaching them along the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt could not have been cooler for my kids. They were so good with them. It was fun to have them here,\u201d Hill said of Hunter\u2019s team. \u201cIt totally inspired my kids to be into paleontology and archaeology. It\u2019s all become really real.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Bones of prehistoric horse found in Utah backyard\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51307\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>"}

When the mummy came to the museum from the Anatomical Institute of Ludwig-Maximilians University in 1970, all documentation of its origin was lost. It was first recorded at the university in 1904, but its movements before then were unknown. Because of the mummy\u2019s dark brown skin, it was thought to be a bog body, possibly recovered from the Dachauer moor outside of Munich. The plaited hair, the fetal position (minus the lower legs which were damaged by bombing in World War II), the well-preserved bone tissue all argued against a central European bog origin, however.</p>\n<p>The mummy has been on display at the State Archaeological Collection since the donation. To finally identify the mummy\u2019s origin, physical condition and cause of death, the museum decided to do <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0089528\" target=\"_blank\">a full forensic anthropological examination</a>. They took CT scans of the entire body, did stable and unstable isotope analysis of the teeth, examined tissue samples microscopically, tested ancient DNA and reconstructed any injuries found. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Mummy-plaits.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29409\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Mummy-plaits-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Mummy-plaits-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Mummy-plaits-200x298.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Mummy-plaits-430x641.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Mummy-plaits.jpg 1004w\" title=\"Mummy's plaits\" width=\"100\"/></a>Radiocarbon dating found the mummy dates to 1451\u20131642 A.D. and was between 20 and 25 years old at the time of death. Stable isotope analysis revealed that she ate maize and seafood and was from the Peruvian/Northern Chilean border along the coast. Her hair was dark in life (it has faded over the centuries) and her braids are tied with fiber bundles made from wavy camelid hair, a pattern characteristic of New World camelids (alpacas or llamas). Her skull also testifies to her origin: she has a Wormian or \u201cInca\u201d bone at her occiput, an extra wedge of bone between sutures that is found in native South American populations but not European ones, and the flattened back of her skull is typical of Inca intentional cranial deformation. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3D-reconstruction-of-head.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29407\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3D-reconstruction-of-head-119x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3D-reconstruction-of-head-119x150.jpg 119w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3D-reconstruction-of-head-200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3D-reconstruction-of-head-430x539.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3D-reconstruction-of-head.jpg 867w\" title=\"3D reconstruction of head\" width=\"119\"/></a>It was the skull that held the biggest surprise. She lost her front teeth after death and there\u2019s a small wound on her forehead, but other than that, from the outside, the head looks intact. The CT scans revealed impressions are vastly deceiving. She was a victim of massive blunt force trauma to the skull. her forehead, upper skull and face were completely staved in. The upper jaw was broken. Large chunks of bone are lying against the back of the skull, along with the remains of brain tissue and possible sites of blood accumulation. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CT-scan-skull-fragments.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29408\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 117px) 100vw, 117px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CT-scan-skull-fragments-117x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CT-scan-skull-fragments-117x150.jpg 117w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CT-scan-skull-fragments-200x255.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CT-scan-skull-fragments-430x550.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CT-scan-skull-fragments.jpg 942w\" title=\"CT scan showing destroyed front skull and fragments\" width=\"117\"/></a>This was a perimortem injury, inflicted around the time of death, not damage done to the body after death. Terrace-like shapes on the inside back of the skull suggest a rounded weapon was used to beat her face in by someone standing in front of her. How she might have encountered this brutal skull-collapsing fate is unclear. Ritual murder is one possible explanation, but without a burial context, it\u2019s probably unprovable. Osteological evidence suggests she lived fairly well \u2014 her dental wear was low and her joints and vertebra show no sign of stressful labor \u2014 but she was ill. Thickening of some of her heart and large intestine tissue and DNA found in rectal tissue indicate she suffered from a chronic parasitic infection by the protozoan <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em>, known as Chagas disease, since infancy. Perhaps her lifetime debilitating illness made her a candidate for sacrifice. If she\u2019s going to die anyway, goes the logic, might as well give her demise religious significance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Body-CT-scan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29406\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 78px) 100vw, 78px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Body-CT-scan-78x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Body-CT-scan-78x150.jpg 78w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Body-CT-scan-157x300.jpg 157w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Body-CT-scan-419x800.jpg 419w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Body-CT-scan.jpg 683w\" title=\"Full-body CT scan\" width=\"78\"/></a>As far as how she got from Peru to Germany, researchers believe the mummy was one of two brought to Germany by Princess Theresa  von Bayern of Bavaria at the turn of the century. Princess Theresa was the daughter of Prince Regent Luitpold who ruled Bavaria while King Ludwig II, the great palace builder sometimes known as Ludwig the Mad, was sidelined by purported mental illness. In her youth she and her cousin Otto, Ludwig\u2019s brother and successor, were in love but could not marry because of Otto\u2019s own struggles with mental illness and the political complications of her father being regent. She never married, dedicating her life to educating herself (women were not allowed to attend university) in the natural sciences.</p>\n<p>In 1898, Princess Theresa went on an expedition to Peru. According to her records, she carried two mummies with her back to Bavaria. There are no records of where she installed the mummies. She died in 1925, leaving her extensive collection of South American anthropological remains to the State Museum of Ethnology in Munich. Since this mummy appears in the Anatomical Institute records in 1904, just six years after her Peruvian expedition, if it was one of the Princess Theresa mummies, she probably donated it to them directly.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mummy in Germany is murdered Inca woman\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29401\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29401#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-29386\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29386\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Confirmed: Tetrarchs looted from Constantinople\">Confirmed: Tetrarchs looted from Constantinople</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, February 27th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-facade.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-29395\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-facade-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-facade-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-facade-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-facade-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs embedded in St. Mark's facade in Venice\" width=\"200\"/></a>Framing a corner of the facade of St. Mark\u2019s Basilica in Venice are high relief sculptures of four Roman emperors known as the Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs. Each pair is on a separate panel carved out of Imperial Porphyry, a dark purple-red color reserved in antiquity for emperors, in the early 4th century A.D. The figures are the two senior emperors (Augusti) and two junior emperors (Caesares) of the tetrarchy, a power-sharing system instituted by Emperor Diocletian in 293 that established one senior-junior pair to rule over the eastern empire (Oriens) and another over the western empire (Occidens). It only lasted two decades. By 313 civil war had chipped away at various usurpers and claimants leaving only Constantine I as Augustus Occidens and Licinius I as Augustus Oriens. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not possible to identify the specific rulers depicted in the sculpture. Unlike the portraiture of earlier Roman emperors, the Tetrarchs are not realistic. There are no identifying characteristics or attributes, no naturalism, no individuality in the carving of garments or the men wearing them. Each pair shares an embrace, one bearded figure and one clean-shaved. It\u2019s probable the bearded figures are Augusti and the Caesares are smooth-cheeked, but that\u2019s symbolic of their relative ages and ranks, not a reflection of tonsorial reality. It\u2019s also possible they were carved after the functional demise of the tetrarchy and are actually the three sons of Constantine (Constantine II, Constantius II, Constans) and his nephew Dalmatius, all of whom held the rank of Caesar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/The-Tetrarchs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-29392\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/The-Tetrarchs-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/The-Tetrarchs-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/The-Tetrarchs-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/The-Tetrarchs-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Tetrarchs\" width=\"200\"/></a>What\u2019s certain is they didn\u2019t originate in Venice. They were looted, carried back to the city after the 1204 Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. Their exact provenance has long been debated. No contemporary chronicles mention the Tetrarchs explicitly. There are references in 14th century sources to marble and porphyry tablets plundered from Constantinople, but not to sculptures. There are also references to stonework being looted from Acre after Venice defeated Genoese forces there in 1258. </p>\n<p>Some historians have posited that the 1258 date is accurate, but that it refers to the arrival of the Tetrarchs in Venice rather than plunder from the Genoese castle in Acre. By this theory, the Tetrarchs had remained in Constantinople during the short-lived Latin Empire when Crusaders ruled Byzantium between 1204 and the restoration of the Byzantine Empire under Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. When the situation started getting hairy for the Latin Empire, the Tetrarchs and other loot were sent to Venice and arrived contemporaneously around the time of the Genoese loss at Acre.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchs-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29391\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchs-side-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchs-side-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchs-side-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchs-side-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Tetrarchs from the side with the missing feet and base\" width=\"112\"/></a>A popular legend dispenses with all this Crusader jazz. According to this version of events, the sculpture was once four thieves who were caught in the act trying to steal of the basilica\u2019s treasure by Saint Mark himself. They were petrified for their crime affixed to the wall where the treasure is kept to guard it for eternity.</p>\n<p>In 1965, a Turkish-German archaeological excavation underneath the Bodrum Mosque, originally a 10th c. church called the Myrelaion, in Istanbul recovered a porphyry fragment of a heel standing on a rectangular base. It seemed to fit the Tetrarchs whose fourth figure is missing his original feet and base. The Myrelaion was built over a 5th century rotunda and next to the Capitolium, a temple associated with the imperial cult built during Constantine\u2019s reign. The Capitolium was also known as the Philadelphion, the \u201ctemple of brotherly love,\u201d after the sons of Constantine. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-heel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29396\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-heel-145x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-heel-145x150.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-heel-200x205.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-heel-430x442.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tetrarchy-heel.jpg 941w\" title=\"Tetrarchy heel now on display at the Istanbul Museum\" width=\"145\"/></a>This is the likely source of the Tetrarchs. Each pair would have adorned one of the massive porphyry columns on the portico of the main entrance. The building may even have become known as the Philadelphion because of the Tetrarchs. They were soon identified as Constantine\u2019s sons, regardless of whether that was the original intent, and since they\u2019re embracing, they were seen as representations of fraternal love. (<a href=\"http://www.byzantium1200.com/capitolium.html\" target=\"_blank\">This site</a> has some neat reconstructions of the Philadelphion and the Tetrarchs on their columns.)</p>\n<p>So the evidence has piled up, enough that for decades the Tetrarchs were widely assumed to have been plundered from Constantinople, but <a href=\"http://www.thevenicetimes.com/mystery-of-the-four-roman-emperors-in-venice-solved-206/\" target=\"_blank\">it has taken until now for an official confirmation</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last year, the Procurator of St. Mark made an exact replica of all four Tetrarchs in Venice and the foot found in Istanbul. The fragments were combined in one piece, which fits perfectly together. Additional analyses were also made of the materials and the porphyry used for the making of the sculptures and the foot fragment. The results have confirmed that indeed the same material was used for both and therefore they are identical.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Confirmed: Tetrarchs looted from Constantinople\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29386\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29386#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-29374\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29374\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to World\u2019s oldest cheese found on Chinese mummy\">World\u2019s oldest cheese found on Chinese mummy</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, February 26th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-face.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29377\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-face-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-face-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-face-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-face-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Beauty of Xiaohe, one of the oldest Tarim mummies at ca. 3,600 years old\" width=\"150\"/></a>Researchers have found the <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/02/25/worlds-oldest-cheese/5776373/\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s oldest cheese around the neck a of Chinese mummy</a> that was buried almost 4,000 years ago in the arid and salty Taklamakan Desert of the Tarim Basin, now in the Xinjiang region of northwest China.

These oldest cheese crumbles dates to approximately 1,615 B.C., an exceptional survival given how quickly dairy products decay. </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cheese-clumps.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29375\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cheese-clumps-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cheese-clumps-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cheese-clumps-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cheese-clumps-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cheese-clumps.jpg 834w\" title=\"Cheese clumps around the chest and neck of Beauty of Xiaohe\" width=\"150\"/></a>The analysis also showed the mummies\u2019 cheese was made by combining milk with a \u201cstarter,\u201d a mix of bacteria and yeast. This technique is still used today to make kefir, a sour, slightly effervescent dairy beverage, and kefir cheese, similar to cottage cheese.</p>\n<p>If the people of the cemetery did indeed rely on a kefir starter to make cheese, they were contradicting the conventional wisdom. Most cheese today is made not with a kefir starter but with rennet, a substance from the guts of a calf, lamb or kid that curdles milk. Cheese was supposedly invented by accident when humans began carrying milk in bags made of animal gut.</p>\n<p>Making cheese with rennet requires the killing of a young animal, Shevchenko points out, and the kefir method does not. He argues that the ease and low cost of the kefir method would have helped drive the spread of herding throughout Asia from its origins in the Middle East. Even better, both kefir and kefir cheese are low in lactose, making them edible for the lactose-intolerant inhabitants of Asia. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29376\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-200x260.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe-430x559.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Beauty-of-Xiaohe.jpg 1229w\" title=\"Beauty of Xiaohe, one of the oldest Tarim mummies at ca. 3,600 years old\" width=\"115\"/></a>We don\u2019t know why the Tarin mummies were buried with cheese. A snack for the afterlife is one obvious possibility and they were certainly interred with elaborate grave goods and rituals. The Beauty of Xiaohe was coated head to toe in a milky white substance then wrapped in a be-tasseled white woolen cloak. Her elegant attire also includes a felt hat, a string skirt and fur-lined leather boots, all of them in like-new condition. On her chest was placed a wooden phallus and the cloak has three small pouches attached the right edge which contain fragments of the evergreen ephedra, a stimulant with thousands of years of use in Chinese herbal medicine.

Clearing out the rest of the contents, they found a lot of dirt and a stack of $20 liberty head gold coins from the 1890s. The pair promptly returned to the find spot, an area they dubbed Saddle Ridge, and dug some more. They immediately found another can about a foot to the left of where they had found the first can.

Most of them, 1,373, to be precise, were $20 coins, 50 were $10 coins and four were $5 coins. Most were minted in San Francisco; one of the $5 coins was minted in Georgia. They date to between 1847 and 1894 and were stacked in approximate chronological order; all the 1840s and 50s coins in the first can and the rest by date in subsequent cans. The arrangement of coins and the varying condition of the cans suggest they were buried by someone over the course of years rather than the result of a single caper like a bank robbery. The total face value of the coins is $27,980. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Saddle-Ridge-Hoard-coins.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29353\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Saddle-Ridge-Hoard-coins-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Saddle-Ridge-Hoard-coins-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Saddle-Ridge-Hoard-coins-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Saddle-Ridge-Hoard-coins-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Selection of Saddle Ridge Hoard coins\" width=\"150\"/></a>In a panic over what to do with the immense gold treasure they had just found walking the dog, the owners took a page out of the original hoarder\u2019s book.

Two months later, they invited coin dealer Don Kagin and numismatic expert David McCarthy of <a href=\"http://www.kaginsinc.com/coins/?p=680\" target=\"_blank\">Kagin\u2019s, Inc.</a> to examine the hoard. They found an incredible wealth of rare coins in beautiful condition. Fully thirteen of them are either the finest examples known to exist or tied for the finest.

Someone in the area was bucking the trend and putting gold back into the ground, oftentimes before it had even circulated. Many of the Saddle Ridge Hoard coins are in near-perfect condition, even the older ones. Paper money wasn\u2019t legal in California until the 1870s, which means most of the coins from before then saw a great deal of circulation and wear. People didn\u2019t start keeping California gold coins in uncirculated condition until the 1880s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1866-S-20-With-Motto-PCGS-MS62+-finest-known.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29355\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1866-S-20-With-Motto-PCGS-MS62+-finest-known-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1866-S-20-With-Motto-PCGS-MS62+-finest-known-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1866-S-20-With-Motto-PCGS-MS62+-finest-known-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1866-S-20-With-Motto-PCGS-MS62+-finest-known-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"1866-S $20 With Motto in finest known condition\" width=\"150\"/></a>The exceptional condition and rarity of the coins makes their estimated market value around $10 million, far exceeding the estimated $1 million value of the other contender for biggest gold hoard found buried in the United States. The Tennessee Hoard was found in Jackson by workers building a city parking lot in 1985. The exact quantities found are not known because the workers pocketed much of the coins before the site was protected. Judging from the assessment of gold dealers who bought most of the Tennessee coins, there were hundreds totaling about $4,500 in face value and while the condition of some pieces was excellent, many of them were damaged by heavy machinery during the discovery while others were cleaned so roughly the coin surface was cracked.</p>\n<p>The couple has chosen to remain anonymous and keep their exact location secret to avoid turning their peaceful rural home into Sutter\u2019s Mill 2: Now We Have Metal Detectors. They plan to sell 90% of the coins in a landmark deal with Amazon\u2019s new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Collectibles\" target=\"_blank\">Collectibles &amp; Fine Art</a> store. This is the first coin treasure to be sold via Amazon. Most of the rest will be sold privately directly to collectors. The couple plans to keep a small selection of the hoard.

It was a utilitarian piece, a large stoneware jar made in southern China in the 13th or 14th century and exported to Japan for use as a commercial container. Large at 16.5 inches high with four lugs around the neck and a mottled amber iron glaze that swoops down in overlapping ovals, once in Japan it was used to store tea, and it was this association that paved its road to glory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ciphers-of-past-owners-on-base1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ciphers of past owners on Chigusa's base\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29348\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ciphers-of-past-owners-on-base1-125x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ciphers-of-past-owners-on-base1-125x150.jpg 125w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ciphers-of-past-owners-on-base1-200x240.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Ciphers-of-past-owners-on-base1-430x516.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ciphers of past owners on Chigusa's base\" width=\"125\"/></a>Chigusa worked uncomplainingly for centuries to earn a proper name, exquisite adornments and the contemplative gaze of some of the greatest masters of Japan\u2019s tea culture. It had an important job. Matcha, the powdered green tea used in the tea ceremony, is harvested in May when the leaves are still young. Tea connoisseurs would stamp their names on the base of their jars and send them to the growers in the spring so the freshly picked and steamed leaves could be placed directly in the vessel. The mouth was sealed with a stopper and the tea left alone for six months to allow the flavor to ripen and mature. In November, the jar was opened and the first tea of the year drunk, an important ritual in Japan\u2019s <em>chanoyu</em> (meaning \u201cthe way of tea\u201d).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-viewing-record-1587.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Tea master Kamiya Sotan's diary entry describing Chigusa, 1587\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29339\" height=\"118\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-viewing-record-1587-150x118.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-viewing-record-1587-150x118.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-viewing-record-1587-200x157.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-viewing-record-1587-430x338.jpg 430w\" title=\"Tea master Kamiya Sotan's diary entry describing Chigusa, 1587\" width=\"150\"/></a>The base of Chigusa has four names written in black lacquer. The first of them is Noami, a 15th century artist and tea expert for the Ashikaga shogunate. The next owner to leave his mark was Torii Insetsu (1448-1517), a tea master in the city of Sakai who would be revered by his successors. Ju Soho\u2019s cipher is next. He is known to have hosted a tea in 1573 attended by Chigusa and the tea master Sen no Rikyu, one of the most influential masters, if not <em>the</em> most influential, in the development of tea culture. We know Chigusa was there at this ceremony because another guest, Imai Sokyu, wrote about seeing the \u201clarge jar \u2026 Chigusa\u201d which had once belonged to the great Insetsu. A few years later the fourth owner, merchant Kondaya Tokurin, added his name to the base.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-documents.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Chigusa's historical documents\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29340\" height=\"127\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-documents-150x127.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-documents-150x127.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-documents-200x170.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-documents-430x366.jpg 430w\" title=\"Chigusa's historical documents\" width=\"150\"/></a>We don\u2019t know who named the jar, but it was likely a poetry reference. The word means \u201cmyriad varieties\u201d or \u201cthousand plants\u201d (it alters depending on which characters are used). By the time Sokyu wrote about Chigusa, its name was already known and the once workaday storage jar had become a <em>meibutsu</em>, a \u201ccelebrated tea object\u201d that inspired masters to look at it carefully, writing journal entries about the smallest details of its glaze, shape and aesthetic significance. Tea master Yamanoue Soji observed Chigusa at a ceremony hosted by warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi in Osaka Castle in 1584 and recorded it in his diary. So did Kamiya Sotan three years later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-with-mouth-cover-cords-net-bag.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Chigusa with mouth cover, cords, silk net bag\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29344\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-with-mouth-cover-cords-net-bag-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-with-mouth-cover-cords-net-bag-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-with-mouth-cover-cords-net-bag-200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chigusa-with-mouth-cover-cords-net-bag-430x537.jpg 430w\" title=\"Chigusa with mouth cover, cords, silk net bag\" width=\"120\"/></a>Over the centuries, its rustic beauty would be adorned with precious materials worthy of its importance: a mouth cover made out of gold brocade Ming Dynasty silk, a blue silk net bag from the Muromachi or Momoyama period in the 16th century, blue ornamental cords from the Meiji era (1868\u20131912). It has three nested storage boxes to keep it and its accoutrements safe. The innermost box was made during the Edo period (1615\u20131868) from lacquered paulownia wood. What is now the middle box was originally the outer box. It was also made in the Edo period out of cedar wood stained with persimmon tannin. The outermost box today is from the Meiji era. Trays inside the innermost box hold the cords, net, letters and other documentation that illustrates the rich history of this unique jar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nesting-boxes.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Chigusa's three nesting storage boxes\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29341\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nesting-boxes-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nesting-boxes-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nesting-boxes-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nesting-boxes-430x297.jpg 430w\" title=\"Chigusa's three nesting storage boxes\" width=\"150\"/></a>By the 17th century, Chigusa was so important it played a part in Japanese politics. During the Tokugawa shogunate, shoguns and daimyos gave it as a gift to seal alliances and prove their loyalty. It remained in Tokugawa hands until the end of the shogunate in 1868, after which Chigusa entered the tea collection market. Wealthy industrialists owned it, allowing it to go on display very occasionally. It only left Japan once in 2009 when it went to New York City to find a new home.

Sackler Gallery are the Smithsonian\u2019s Asian art branches, centered on core collections built by their eponymous founders. Chigusa is therefore in good company, despite its great distance from home. There are only a few hundred such large tea storage jars with all their accessories and documentation remaining in Japan, and only a smattering of remotely comparable pieces abroad.</p>\n<p>On February 22nd, <a href=\"http://www.asia.si.edu/press/2014/chigusa-and-the-art-of-tea.asp\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Chigusa and the Art of Tea</em></a> debuted at the Sackler.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In <em>Chigusa and the Art of Tea</em>, Chigusa holds court alongside other cherished objects, including calligraphy by Chinese monks, Chinese and Korean tea bowls and Japanese stoneware water jars and wooden vessels that were used and enjoyed during this formative time of Japanese tea culture.

The museum which had bought the painting in 1994 for \u00a322,000 ($36,583), pointed to a top expert\u2019s authentication and insisted the portrait was the pretender to the British throne. When said top expert admitted in 2009 that Grosvenor\u2019s argument was supported by the weight of the evidence (<a href=\"http://www.dnhdesign.com/BAJwebsite/BAJ-BG-HenryIX.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Grosvenor\u2019s paper in the British Art Journal</a> is pretty damn persuasive), the National Galleries <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6817863/Gallery-admits-portrait-is-not-Bonnie-Prince-Charlie.html\" target=\"_blank\">had to grudgingly admit</a> they had bought a prince in a poke, to coin a phrase.</p>\n<p>Grosvenor\u2019s vindication was not cause for unbridled joy. The painting in question was considered the best surviving portrait of Prince Charles in his prime. There are paintings of him as a youth and as an old man, but this one showed him in armor, the dashing prince seeking to reclaim his throne from the Hanoverians. It was printed in histories, biographies, on shortbread tins and was literally next to the prince\u2019s name in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. \u201cBonnie Prince Charlie is one of my heroes,\u201d said the art historian, \u201cand I always felt bad about debunking what used to be his most famous portrait.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/arts/visual-arts/bonnie-prince-charlie-portrait-found-in-scotland-1-3315365\" target=\"_blank\">So he set about looking for a real portrait of the prince</a>, one that was known to have existed in the 1740s but was lost after the defeat of the Jacobite Rebellion at the Battle of Culloden on April 16th, 1746.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Allan-Ramsay-Self-portrait-1756.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29328\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 102px) 100vw, 102px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Allan-Ramsay-Self-portrait-1756-102x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Allan-Ramsay-Self-portrait-1756-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Allan-Ramsay-Self-portrait-1756-200x293.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Allan-Ramsay-Self-portrait-1756-430x630.jpg 430w\" title=\"Self-portrait by Allan Ramsay, 1756\" width=\"102\"/></a>His first stop was the Royal Archives in Windsor Castle. There he found a letter from by Bonnie Prince Charlie\u2019s valet to renown Scottish painter Allan Ramsay. It said: \u201cSir, you are desired to come to the Palace of Holyroodhouse as soon as possible in order to take his Royal Highness\u2019 picture. So I expect you\u2019ll wait no further call. I am, your most humble servant, John Stuart, Holyrood House 26th of October 1745\u201d. That was important because it confirmed the existence of a portrait painted in Scotland, not England, by a Scottish painter rather than de La Tour.</p>\n<p>Grosvenor then went to the National Portrait Gallery in London to look through its archives. He found a black and white picture of a painting of Charles that bore some of the hallmarks of Ramsay\u2019s style. The sitter painter wasn\u2019t identified, but on the back of the photograph was a note saying that the portrait was at Gosford House, seat of the Earls of Wemyss in East Lothian, Scotland.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Dr-Bendor-Grosvenor-with-Charles-portrait.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29331\" height=\"105\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Dr-Bendor-Grosvenor-with-Charles-portrait-150x105.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Dr-Bendor-Grosvenor-with-Charles-portrait-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Dr-Bendor-Grosvenor-with-Charles-portrait-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Dr-Bendor-Grosvenor-with-Charles-portrait-430x303.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Dr-Bendor-Grosvenor-with-Charles-portrait.jpg 1002w\" title=\"Dr. Bendor Grosvenor with lost portrait of Bonnie Prince Charlie by Allan Ramsay, 1745\" width=\"150\"/></a>\u201cI went to Gosford House where the portrait had been hanging in a dark, downstairs corridor.

Charles took the painting with him in 1745 when he and his army got as far south as Derbyshire. It was still with him when his forces turned back to Scotland and met their fate at Culloden a few months later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Scent-bottle-with-lost-portrait-ca-1753.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29329\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 96px) 100vw, 96px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Scent-bottle-with-lost-portrait-ca-1753-96x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Scent-bottle-with-lost-portrait-ca-1753-96x150.jpg 96w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Scent-bottle-with-lost-portrait-ca-1753-192x300.jpg 192w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Scent-bottle-with-lost-portrait-ca-1753-430x669.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scent bottle with lost portrait, ca. 1753\" width=\"96\"/></a>With the Jacobite hopes dashed, even supporters weren\u2019t keen to be seen displaying fine portraits of the failed pretender. The original painting disappeared from the public record. The image survived thanks to an engraving made of the Ramsay portrait by Robert Strange. It appeared on Jacobite memorabilia, like <a href=\"http://www.europeanporcelain.com/archive/d/a-capodimonte-gold-and-enamel-mounted-scent-bottle-and-stopper-with-a-portrait-o/108562\" target=\"_blank\">this scent bottle</a> made in Bourbon-ruled Naples around 1753. Notice the addition of the green sash of the Scottish Order of the Thistle. The prince who had himself painted with specific English references to enlist iconography in supporting his claim was now wistfully draped in his Scottish colors too.</p>\n<p>No decision has been made about display of the portrait. Gosford House released a statement saying that they\u2019re considering where it might be exhibited in the near future.</p>\n<p>The BBC dedicated an episode of <em>The Culture Show</em>, hosted by Bendor Grosvenor, to the discovery.

That the bodies were buried to take up as little space as possible, mainly head to toe, and in uneven groupings with children placed in the small empty spaces is evidence that they were done in a hurry, likely as the result of an outbreak of contagious disease.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Uffizi-Ancient-cemetery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29316\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Uffizi-Ancient-cemetery-125x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Uffizi-Ancient-cemetery-125x150.jpg 125w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Uffizi-Ancient-cemetery-200x238.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Uffizi-Ancient-cemetery-430x513.jpg 430w\" title=\"Excavation of Uffizi skeletons\" width=\"125\"/></a>This area was just south of the Roman walls and prone to the alluvial floods of the Arno. The earliest remains found on the site were architectural and lapidary remains that appear to be construction debris dumped during the city expansion of the late 1st, early 2nd century A.D. The use of the spot as a dump ended by the 5th century when it began to be used as a necropolis. The choice of location \u2014 over a dump next to a river regularly in flood \u2014 confirms that the burials were an emergency, probably done in the summer while the river was at its lowest. </p>\n<p>The timing could coincide with the Plague of Justinian, an epidemic that devastated the Byzantine Empire and what was left of the Western one during the 6th century A.D. <a href=\"http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1003349\" target=\"_blank\">Recent DNA studies of 6th century burials in Germany</a> have found that the <em>Yersinia pestis</em> bacterium caused Justinian\u2019s Plague like it would the Black Death eight centuries later. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scheletri-uffizi.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29319\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scheletri-uffizi-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scheletri-uffizi-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scheletri-uffizi-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/scheletri-uffizi-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Uffizi skeletons\" width=\"150\"/></a>The bones have been documented in situ and once fully excavated will be studied by Italian archaeologists in conjunction with experts from the University of Mainz who specialize in paleogenetics.

Up until now, very few human remains from this time have been found in various parts of the city.

In 1262, it was conquered by the Mongol forces of Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan who expanded the southwestern Mongol empire from Uzbekistan to Syria. </p>\n<p>Hulagu was not known for his light hand. Any cities where he encountered resistance were destroyed and their inhabitants slaughtered. When the Mongols conquered Baghdad in 1258, they virtually leveled the city. It\u2019s said that the waters of the Tigris turned black with the ink from the thousands of books from the Grand Library of Baghdad that the Mongols threw into the river. Mosul was spared, however, because governor Badr al-Din Lu\u2019lu\u2019 agreed to support Hulagu\u2019s invasion of Syria. The Mongol Ilkhanid and Jalayrid dynasties ruled Mosul through the 15th century until it was conquered by the Turkic Aq Qoyunlu Confederation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29303\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 111px) 100vw, 111px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-111x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-111x150.jpg 111w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-200x268.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-430x578.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blacas Ewer, Mosul, 1232\" width=\"111\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29304\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-side-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-side-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-side-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blacas-Ewer-side-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blacas Ewer, side\" width=\"112\"/></a>Even before the arrival of the Mongols, Mosul was famed for its exceptional metalworking tradition. The technique originated in Persia, but Mosul\u2019s location at the cross-roads of trade influenced the craft, introducing new forms of vessels and designs from the Byzantine Empire. Brass containers were inlaid with silver and copper creating intricate geometric decoration and scenes of courtiers hunting, traveling, adorning themselves, drinking, eating and listening to live music. The <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=239367&amp;partId=1\" target=\"_blank\">Blacas Ewer</a>, now in the British Museum, is an exceptional example of Mosul metalwork.

This form is one of a kind, so exceptional that it is rarely included in studies of the craft. The artifact has been part of the Courtauld\u2019s permanent collection since 1966 when it was bequeathed to the institution by the grandson of collector and museum patron Thomas Gambier Parry. Experts have debated its function for decades. It\u2019s shaped like a clutch purse, but they weren\u2019t making brass ladies\u2019 handbags in 1300s Mosul. Some proposed functions include wallet, saddlebag and document carrier. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Islamic-bag-roundel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29299\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Islamic-bag-roundel-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Islamic-bag-roundel-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Islamic-bag-roundel-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Islamic-bag-roundel-430x431.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Islamic-bag-roundel.jpg 1495w\" title=\"Courtauld bag roundel\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Courtauld is putting on a new exhibition centered around this beautiful piece. <a href=\"http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/exhibitions/2014/Court-and-Craft/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Court and Craft: A Masterpiece from Northern Iraq</em></a> proposed a new function for the Courtauld wallet: a lady\u2019s shoulder bag. Exhibition curator Rachel Ward <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/19/handbag-courtauld-gallery-identity-treasure-fashion\" target=\"_blank\">found an important clue</a> in the decoration of the bag itself.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The key to unlocking its secret is an unusual panel on the top showing a nobleman and women and their attendants. One of those, a smiling page boy, has the bag around his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Wider research by Ward has turned up considerable visual evidence of bag-carrying page boys next to noblewomen but never alongside men.</p>\n<p>\u201cOther people in the past have called it everything from a work basket to a document wallet and inevitably male academics always assume it was for a man.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s a lady\u2019s bag. It is the forerunner of a designer bag.

The garbage begins three feet under street level and goes down another three feet. It\u2019s filled with liquor bottles and food waste and may be the impressive remains of a single epic party. Construction on City Hall began in 1810 and ended in 1812, so right around the time this infamous liquor and douche party may have taken place. Before that, the area was the city commons, known as \u201cThe Fields,\u201d site of public pasture land, the old Debtor\u2019s Prison, run as a POW jail by the brutal British Provost Marshall William Cunningham during the Revolutionary War, the Bridewell prison and the poorhouse. </p>\n<p>Vaginal syringes were used by women for contraceptive purposes to flush out sperm after intercourse and to treat gynecological ailments from venereal diseases to menstrual cramps to \u201cthe Whites,\u201d aka vaginal discharge. Although they became increasingly popular in the 19th century, syringes were in active use in modern Europe as early as the 17th century.

Jan Steen was overtly fond of painting domestic scenes of swooning women being treated by questionable doctors for \u201clovesickness.\u201d He made multiple versions of these tableaux, all of them with details like cupid statues, boys holding arrows or herrings meant to convey phalluses, background paintings of mythological sexytimes and unmade beds suggesting that taking the pulse of the lady wasn\u2019t going to cure what ailed her. Two of them, <a href=\"http://collectie.boijmans.nl/en/collection/VdV-77\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Sick Woman</em></a> (1660-70) and <a href=\"http://collectie.boijmans.nl/en/collection/VdV-76\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Doctor\u2019s Visit</em></a> (ca 1665), both now in the permanent collection of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, feature figures holding vaginal syringes.

This is an easy Preparation, and of few and simple Ingredients, but of no mean Use. It is a good Injection (Universals being first premised) against the Whites in Women, and the Gonorrhea in Men, though of never so long standing, and possibly may do more in two, three, or four Days Time, being injected, than all other Medicines could do in as many Years.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pewter-vaginal-syringe-19th-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29286\" height=\"88\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pewter-vaginal-syringe-19th-c-150x88.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pewter-vaginal-syringe-19th-c-150x88.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pewter-vaginal-syringe-19th-c-200x118.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Pewter-vaginal-syringe-19th-c-430x255.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pewter vaginal syringe in case, 19th c., Wellcome Library Wellcome Images\" width=\"150\"/></a>By the late 19th century, home medical care assumed the easy availability of vaginal syringes. Here is a treatment for leucorrhoea (the so-called \u201cWhites\u201d) from <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;id=8OYrAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA562\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Gunn\u2019s Newest Family Physician</em></a> by John C. Gunn, published in 1883:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The \ufb01rst is cleanliness, by bathing freely with cold or tepid water, and injecting it up the birthplace three or four times a day with a female syringe, which can be purchased at any drug store. The glass syringe is preferable. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>I have used an injection of Green Tea with much bene\ufb01t, which may be substituted for the simple water, either cold or tepid, which ever appears to be most bene\ufb01cial. Injection of Sugar of Lead forms one of the most cooling and astringent injections in this disease, in the commencement of the discharge, and should be injected two, or three, or four times a day; this remedy will, in mild cases, be attended with much bene\ufb01t, and in those of plethoric or full habit, this injection, with a dose of Salts occasionally, combined with the Bath, will be found very bene\ufb01cial. The proportion of the injection is from 5 to 8 grains of Sugar of Lead, medically called Aceti Plumbi, to three or four table-spoonfuls of Rain Water; or an injection made with 5 or 6 grains of White Vitriol, medically called Sulphate of Zinc, to the same quantity of Rain or Soft Water; or an Alum wash in similar proportions to the last, or a decoction of Oak Bark, or the Green Tea, as before mentioned, or a strong tea of Nut Galls; either one of these astringent articles, used as an injection, four or \ufb01ve times a day, will, if used regularly, remove the discharge, which few women, particularly if they are married, or mothers, escape completely, for, of all the diseases peculiar to the sex, there is none so common as the Whites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I\u2019m quite sure injecting lead and zinc sulphate into your vagina five times a day will work all kinds of wonders. It often amazes me that anyone ever survived their doctoring.</p>\n<p>As common as vaginal syringes were in the middle class households of the Victorian era, there were rumblings against their use, primarily in the nascent males-only profession of gynecology. In 1875, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZaYBAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA80\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Thomas More Madden presented a paper to the Dublin Obstetrical Society</a> advocating that gynecologists abandon the DIY vaginal syringe which could cause (admittedly very rare) complications in favor of the vaginal irrigator to be operated only by the doctor. Later that year, Dr. Alexander Padlock addressed the questions raised by the Dublin doctors <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=l4YCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA621\" target=\"_blank\">in a paper read before the East Tennessee Medical Society</a>. He gets into some pretty gruesome detail about his patients\u2019 experiences with vaginal syringes. Lots of \u201cuterine colic\u201d which does not sound at all fun followed by peritonitis which in addition to not being fun was also frequently fatal.</p>\n<p>Probably not coincidentally, the syringes fell out of favor in the 20th century, replaced by douches on a minor scale and gynecologists on the larger issues.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"1800s douche found under New York City Hall\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29284\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29284#comments\">8 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-29265\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29265\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Looter caught with Roman gold, silver hoard\">Looter caught with Roman gold, silver hoard</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, February 19th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rhineland-Palatinate-Minister-of-Culture-Doris-c-state-archaeologist-Axel-von-Berg-l-Head-of-state-archeology-Speyer-Director-of-the-Cultural-Heritage-Rhineland-Palatinate-Thomas-Metz-r.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29273\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rhineland-Palatinate-Minister-of-Culture-Doris-c-state-archaeologist-Axel-von-Berg-l-Head-of-state-archeology-Speyer-Director-of-the-Cultural-Heritage-Rhineland-Palatinate-Thomas-Metz-r-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rhineland-Palatinate-Minister-of-Culture-Doris-c-state-archaeologist-Axel-von-Berg-l-Head-of-state-archeology-Speyer-Director-of-the-Cultural-Heritage-Rhineland-Palatinate-Thomas-Metz-r-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rhineland-Palatinate-Minister-of-Culture-Doris-c-state-archaeologist-Axel-von-Berg-l-Head-of-state-archeology-Speyer-Director-of-the-Cultural-Heritage-Rhineland-Palatinate-Thomas-Metz-r-200x160.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rhineland-Palatinate-Minister-of-Culture-Doris-c-state-archaeologist-Axel-von-Berg-l-Head-of-state-archeology-Speyer-Director-of-the-Cultural-Heritage-Rhineland-Palatinate-Thomas-Metz-r-430x345.jpg 430w\" title=\"Observing part of the hoard are state archaeologist Axel von Berg (l), Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of Culture Doris Ahnen (c), Director of the Cultural Heritage of Rhineland-Palatinate Thomas Metz (r), photo courtesy Torsten Silz/DPA\" width=\"150\"/></a>An unnamed and unauthorized metal detectorist found a <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/20140219/german-amateur-treasure-hunter-bags-sensational-roman-hoard\" target=\"_blank\">late Roman gold and silver hoard in the forest near Ruelzheim</a> in Germany\u2019s southwestern Rhineland-Palatinate state and dug it up so he could sell it on the black market.

Different states have differing laws on the particulars. Some allow finders to keep half the value of a find, if not the find itself. The Rhineland-Palatinate is not one of them. Searching for ancient artifacts with a metal detector is a misdemeanor offence. Removing any artifacts discovered without reporting them rises to the level of fraud, and selling them can result in a charge of receiving stolen property. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-jewels-from-ceremonial-robe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29272\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-jewels-from-ceremonial-robe-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-jewels-from-ceremonial-robe-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-jewels-from-ceremonial-robe-200x151.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-jewels-from-ceremonial-robe-430x325.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold leaf clasps from ceremonial robe, photo courtesy Torsten Silz/DPA\" width=\"150\"/></a>Certainly if monetary value plays a part in determining the severity of a property crime in Germany as it does in the US, this looter is going to be in big trouble. The hoard includes three dozen beautifully detailed solid gold brooches shaped like leaves, even more gold square pyramids that archaeologists believe all once ornamented a ceremonial tunic of an important Roman official.

The Battle of Mainz took place in 406 A.D. not far from where this treasure was buried and it was a watershed event in the collapse of Roman control of Europe. Pressured by Huns in the east, migrating allied tribes including Alans, Suevi and Vandals assembled on the east bank of the Rhine. The Franks sent a raiding party across the river and succeeded in killing the Vandal king Godigisel, but the Alans turned the tide and defeated the Franks. The tribes then crossed the Rhine into Gaul on December 31st, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cut-silver-plate.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29269\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cut-silver-plate-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cut-silver-plate-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cut-silver-plate-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cut-silver-plate-430x292.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cut silver dish, possible hacksilver to be used as currency, photo courtesy Torsten Silz/DPA\" width=\"150\"/></a>406, breaching what had been for centuries one of Rome\u2019s strongest boundaries and pillaging Mainz, Rheims, Amiens and Strasbourg among many other Roman cities.

The jewels from ceremonial clothing, the elaborate silver and gold folding chair and the exquisite silver tableware all point to them having been the belongings of an important magistrate or even royalty. These were the highly recognizable attributes of Roman political authority. They were buried near a former Roman road, whether by its original owner of by marauders who wanted to keep it safe from competing marauders, in a relatively shallow hole. It\u2019s a testament to how dangerous the roads were that nobody made it back to reclaim so vast a treasure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-from-ceremonial-robe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29271\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-from-ceremonial-robe-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-from-ceremonial-robe-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-from-ceremonial-robe-200x151.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gold-from-ceremonial-robe-430x325.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold pyramids from ceremonial robe, photo courtesy Torsten Silz/DPA\" width=\"150\"/></a>The age and nature of this hoard makes it a unique find in Germany, worth at least a million euro on the market and worth far more than that in historical value. It would be worth inestimably more if it had been excavated with respect for its context. Instead, the looter pulled whatever he could out of the ground, having no care whatsoever for archaeological integrity. According to state archaeologist Axel von Berg, the curule chair, for example, was \u201cbrutally torn out of the earth and destroyed.\u201d The site itself was deliberately damaged.

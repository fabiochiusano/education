Although it may seem good to the naive reader -- like saying of a philosophy student that he speaks good English and attends regularly -- properly understood, the implicatures are catastrophic.  Since only success is mentioned, we must infer that it is passing silently over bad news concerning my health, happiness, and social relationships.  Worse, the cookie tells me only that I have the <i>ability</i> to overcome obstacles, not that I <i>will</i> overcome those obstacles.

Theory of Fortune Cookies</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>(your guide to properly understanding the dire messages from Panda Express)<p>\n\nFortune cookies explicitly state the good and silently pass over the bad.  In this way, they are like letters of recommendation.  The wise reader understands the Gricean <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/\">implicatures</a>.<p>\n\nGricean implicature involves implying one thing by saying something else, typically exploiting the hearer's or reader's knowledge of the context and of the norms of cooperative communication.  Probably the most famous example, from Grice's classic \"Logic and Conversation\" (1967), is this:<p>\n<blockquote><i>A</i> is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a philosophy job, and his letter reads as follows: 'Dear Sir, Mr. X's command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, etc.'</blockquote><p>\n\nAlthough <i>A</i> does not <i>explicitly say</i> that Mr. X is an unimpressive student, the letter implicates it.  For if Mr. X were an impressive student, the letter writer, as a cooperative conversation partner, would surely have said that.  The reader knows that <i>A </i>knows that letters of recommendation should praise the quality of students who deserve academic praise.  A thereby intentionally communicates to the reader that in his view Mr. X does <i>not </i>deserve academic praise.  The best that can be said about X concerns his attendance and command of English.<p>\n\nWith this in mind, consider these two principles governing the proper interpretation of fortune cookies:<p>\n\n(1.) Fortune cookies, like letters of recommendation, (a.) say only good things, and (b.) say the best that they can about those things.<p>\n\n(2.) All fortune cookies address the following four topics: health, success, social relationships, and happiness.<p>\n\nWhen a fortune cookie silently omits any of the four topics listed in Principle 2, it implicates that the news on that topic is bad.  Furthermore, when a fortune cookie says something limited about health, success, social relationships, or happiness, it implicates that nothing better can be said. This is the <i>Four-Implicature Theory of Fortune Cookies</i>.<p>\n\nConsider, for example, my most recent fortune: \"You have the ability to overcome obstacles on the way to success.\"<p>\n\nWhat a disastrous fortune!  Although it may seem good to the naive reader -- like saying of a philosophy student that he speaks good English and attends regularly -- properly understood, the implicatures are catastrophic.  Since only success is mentioned, we must infer that it is passing silently over bad news concerning my health, happiness, and social relationships.  Worse, the cookie tells me only that I have the <i>ability</i> to overcome obstacles, not that I <i>will</i> overcome those obstacles.  By Principle 1a, the fortune would have said that I will overcome those obstacles if in fact I will.  It follows that I will not in fact overcome.  Disaster on all four fronts!<p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MJ2y1awQEk8/W37f69z--oI/AAAAAAAABBg/dWRtWYonNXA6Nv9zCU21Pkc3i48J8l0VQCLcBGAs/s1600/fortune.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"651\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"130\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MJ2y1awQEk8/W37f69z--oI/AAAAAAAABBg/dWRtWYonNXA6Nv9zCU21Pkc3i48J8l0VQCLcBGAs/s320/fortune.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n\n[a dire fortune from Panda Express]<p>\n\nLet's try another fortune: \"You are kind-hearted and hospitable, cheerful and well-liked.\"  This fortune concerns both social relationships and happiness, two of the four topics that all cookies address.  We can therefore infer that the recipient will suffer ill-health and poverty.  Concerning happiness, the news is good: The recipient is cheerful!  However, the implicature concerning social relationships is mixed: If the best that can be said is that the recipient is kind, hospitable, and well-liked, and <i>not</i> that she finds love, or that people admire her, or that she has other such social goods, the implicature is that she is a bit of a doormat.  To the wise reader of cookies, the message is clear: Other people appreciate how cheerful the recipient remains as they take unfair advantage of her kind-hearted hospitality.<p>\n\nI leave the fortunes below as an exercise for the reader.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9og-tHVn0_g/W34JO8tvoXI/AAAAAAAABA8/2cprhb0xtMA15rzXNI6HHCv4TY3H4UxnACLcBGAs/s1600/FortuneCookies.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"929\" data-original-width=\"731\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9og-tHVn0_g/W34JO8tvoXI/AAAAAAAABA8/2cprhb0xtMA15rzXNI6HHCv4TY3H4UxnACLcBGAs/s400/FortuneCookies.jpg\" width=\"315\"/></a><p>\n<i>ETA Aug 24:<p></p></i>\n\nOMG, today's fortune is even worse!<p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tI_qOdQSEdU/W4B28nQHkTI/AAAAAAAABCE/4YKWfTdbmlUeeWr7AfyItaK1fmVzUkMIACLcBGAs/s1600/Fortune2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"615\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"123\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tI_qOdQSEdU/W4B28nQHkTI/AAAAAAAABCE/4YKWfTdbmlUeeWr7AfyItaK1fmVzUkMIACLcBGAs/s320/Fortune2.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n\n[printable fortune cookie sheet from <a href=\"http://www.red-castle.com/software/fw/printcookies.htm\">Red Castle</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/08/the-four-implicature-theory-of-fortune.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-08-23T09:31:00-07:00\">9:31 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4163724296280465977\" onclick=\"\">2\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/humor\" rel=\"tag\">humor</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, August 16, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2462920664380020251\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/08/to-reduce-risk-of-moral-catastrophes.html\">To Reduce the Risk of Moral Catastrophes, Should Society Hire Lots of Philosophers?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>In June, I wrote a post arguing that future generations might find our generation <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/will-future-generations-find-us.html\">especially morally loathsome</a>, even if we don't ourselves feel like we are morally that bad.  (By \"we\" I mean typical highly educated, middle-class people in Western democracies.) <b> We might be committing morally grievous wrongs</b> -- atrocities on par with the wrong that we now see in race-based slavery or the Holocaust or bloody wars of conquest -- <b>without (most of us) recognizing how morally terrible we're being.</b><p>\n\nIn <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10214679985105858\">Facebook discussion</a>, Kian MW pointed me to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10677-015-9567-7\">a fascinating article</a> by Evan G. Williams, which makes a similar point and adds the further thought, bound to be attractive to many philosophers, that <b>the proper response to such a concern is to hire lots of philosophers</b>.<p>\n\nOkay, hiring lots of philosophers isn't the <i>only </i>remedy Williams suggests, and he doesn't phrase his recommendation in quite that way.  What he says with that we need to dedicate substantial societal resources to (1) identifying our moral wrongdoing and to (2) creating social structures to implement major changes in light of those moral discoveries.  Identifying our moral wrongdoing will require progress, Williams says, both in moral theory and in related applied fields.  (For example, progress in animal ethics requires progress both in moral theory and in relevant parts of biology.)  Williams' call for dedicating substantial resources toward making progress in moral theory <i>seems </i>like a call for society to hire many more philosophers, though I suppose there are a variety of ways that he could disavow that implication if he cared to do so.<p>\n\nThe annual U.S. military budget is about $700 billion.  Suppose that President Trump and his allies in Congress, inspired by Williams' article, decided to divert 2% of U.S military spending toward identifying our society's moral wrongdoing, with half of that 2% going to ethicists and the other half to other relevant disciplines.  Assuming that the annual cost of employing a philosopher is $150,000 (about half salary, about half benefits and indirect costs), the resulting <b>$7 billion could hire about 50,000 ethicists.</b><p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nat5KmrBiQM/W3R4WJCqE2I/AAAAAAAABAI/ZKxHsUxK9fMNn-du_e2GfinlxGV6EL3GACLcBGAs/s1600/EmptyChairsPhilosophy.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"357\" data-original-width=\"635\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nat5KmrBiQM/W3R4WJCqE2I/AAAAAAAABAI/ZKxHsUxK9fMNn-du_e2GfinlxGV6EL3GACLcBGAs/s320/EmptyChairsPhilosophy.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[With 50,000 more ethicists, <a href=\"http://observer.com/2017/07/why-the-us-doesnt-understand-chinese-thought-and-must-xenophobia-confucius-xo-jinping-higher-education/\">these empty chairs</a> could be filled!]<p>\n\nTwo percent of the military budget seems like a small expenditure to substantially reduce the risk that we unwittingly perpetrate the moral equivalent of institutionalized slavery or the Holocaust, don't you think?   A B2 bomber costs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit\">about $1-$2 billion</a>.  The U.S. government might want to consider a few bomber-for-philosopher swaps.<p>\n\nI write this partly in jest of course, but also partly seriously.  If society invested more in moral philosophy -- and it needn't be a whole lot more, compared to the size of military budgets -- and if society took the results of that investment seriously, giving its philosophers prestige, attention, and policy influence, we might be morally far better off as a people.<p>\n\nWe <i>might</i>.  But I also think about <b>the ancient Athenians, the ancient Chinese, and the early 20th-century Germans.</b>  Despite the flourishing of philosophy in these times and places, the cultures did not appear to avoid moral catastrophe: The ancient Athenians were slave-owners who engaged in military conquest and genocide (perhaps even more than their neighbors, if we're grading on a curve), the flourishing of philosophy in ancient China coincided with the moral catastrophe of the period of the Warring States, and the Germans perpetrated the Holocaust and helped initiate World War II (with some of the greatest philosophers, including Heidegger and Frege, on the nationalistic, anti-Semitic, political right).<p>\n\nNow maybe these societies would have produced even worse moral catastrophes if philosophers had not also been flourishing in them, but I see no particular reason to think so.  <b>If there's a correlation between the flourishing of philosophy and the perpetration of social evil, the relationship appears to be, if anything, <i>positive</i>.</b>  This observation fits with my general concerns about the <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-often-do-ethics-professors-call-their-mothers\">not-very-moral behavior of professional ethicists</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">philosophers' apparent skill at post-hoc rationalization</a>.<p>\n\nI'm not sure how skeptical to be.  I hesitate to suggest that a massive infusion of social capital into philosophical ethics <i>couldn't</i> have a large positive impact on the moral choices we as a society make.  It might be truly awesome and transformative, if done in the right way.  But what would be the right way?<p>\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.bryanvannorden.com/\">Bryan Van Norden</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/08/to-reduce-risk-of-moral-catastrophes.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-08-16T07:24:00-07:00\">7:24 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2462920664380020251\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Saturday, April 21, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1871827610141782770\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/04/birthday-cake-and-chapel.html\">Birthday Cake and a Chapel</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Last weekend, at my 50th birthday party, one guest asked, \"Now that you're fifty, what wisdom do you have to share?\"  I answered, \"Eat more birthday cake!\"<p>\n\nHe seemed disappointed with my reply.  I'm a philosopher; don't I have something better to say than \"eat more cake\"?  Well, partly my reply was more serious than he may have realized; and partly I wanted to dodge the expectation that I have any special wisdom to share because of my age or profession.  Still, I could have given a better answer.<p>\n\nSo earlier this week, I drafted a post on love, meaningful work, joy, and kindness.  Some kind of attempt at wisdom.  Then I thought, too, of course one also needs health and security.  Well, it's an ordinary list; I wouldn't pretend otherwise.  Maybe my best attempt at wisdom reveals my lack of any special wisdom.  Better to just stick with \"eat more birthday cake\"?  I couldn't quite click the orange \"publish\" button.<p>\n\nThursday, a horrible thing happened to someone I love.  I won't share the details, for the person's privacy.  But that evening I found myself in a side room of the <a href=\"https://www.callutheran.edu/map/samuelson-chapel\">Samuelson Chapel</a> at California Lutheran University.  The chapel made me think of my father, who had been a long-time psychology professor at CLU.  (I've posted a reminiscence of him <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/memories-of-my-father.html\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nIn the 1980s, CLU was planning to build a new chapel at the heart of campus, and my father was on the committee overseeing the architectural plans.  As I recall, he came home one evening and said that the architect had submitted plans for a boring, rectangular chapel.  Most of the committee had been ready to approve the plans, but he had objected.<p>\n\n\"Why build a boring, blocky chapel?\" he said.  \"Why not build something glorious and beautiful?  It will be more expensive, yes.  But I think if we can show people something gorgeous and ambitious, we will find the money.  Alumni will be happier to contribute, the campus will be inspired it, and it will be a landmark for decades to come.\"  Of course, I'm not sure of his exact words, but something like that.<p>\n\nSo on my father's advice the committee sent the plans back to be entirely rethought.<p>\n\nSamuelson Chapel today:<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WCKyL_v1RbY/WtowtZiBhbI/AAAAAAAAAx0/IKXEfNn1r0oTarPyraHkkzREta9FiJSsgCLcBGAs/s1600/CLU-chapel1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"533\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WCKyL_v1RbY/WtowtZiBhbI/AAAAAAAAAx0/IKXEfNn1r0oTarPyraHkkzREta9FiJSsgCLcBGAs/s320/CLU-chapel1.jpg\" width=\"213\"/></a><p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--rjkoxnoEkE/WtowwysjBhI/AAAAAAAAAx4/431C7ToNYRQ7UseSJBOwcvmMIj2MXrabgCLcBGAs/s1600/CLU-chapel2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"768\" data-original-width=\"1024\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--rjkoxnoEkE/WtowwysjBhI/AAAAAAAAAx4/431C7ToNYRQ7UseSJBOwcvmMIj2MXrabgCLcBGAs/s320/CLU-chapel2.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n\nNot ostentatious, not grandiose, but neither just a boring box.  A bit of modest beauty on campus.<p>\n\nAs I sat alone in a side room of Samuelson Chapel on that horrible evening, I heard muffled music through the wall -- someone rehearsing on the chapel piano.  The pianist was un-self-conscious in his pauses and explorations, experimenting, not knowing he had an audience.  I sensed him appreciating his music's expansive sound in the high-ceilinged, empty sanctuary.  I could hear the skill in his fingers, and his gentle, emotional touch.<p>\n\nIn my draft post on wisdom, I'd emphasized setting aside time to relish small pleasures -- small pleasures like second helpings of birthday cake.  But <i>more cake</i> isn't really the heart of it.<p>\n\nIn Samuelson Chapel, on a horrible night, I marveled at the beauty of the music through the wall.  How many events, mostly invisible to us, have converged to allow that moment?  The pianist, I'm sure, knew nothing of my father and his role in making the chapel what it is.  There is something stunning, awesome, almost incomprehensible about our societies and relations and dependencies, about the layers and layers of work and passion by which we construct possibilities for future action, about our intricate biologies unreflectively maintained, about the evolutionary history that lays the ground of all of this, about the deepness of time.<p>\n\nAs I drove home the next morning, I found myself still stunned with awe.  I can drive 75 miles an hour in a soft seat on a ten-lane freeway through Pasadena -- a freeway roaring with thousands of other cars, somehow none of us crashing, and all of it so taken for granted that we can focus mostly on sounds from our radios.  One tiny part of the groundwork is the man who fixed the wheel of the tractor of the farmer who grew the wheat that became part of the bread of the sandwich of a construction worker who, sixty years ago, helped lay the first cement for this particular smooth patch of freeway.

It lacks balance, clarity, and (apparently) meaningful strategic choice. From this perspective, its prominence in the modern Hannukah tradition is puzzling. Why encourage children to spend a holy evening gambling, of all things?<p>\n\nThis perspective misses the brilliance of dreidel. Dreidel's seeming flaws are exactly its virtues. Dreidel is the moral world in miniature.<p>\n\nFor readers unfamiliar with the game, here's a tutorial. You sit in a circle with friends or relatives and take turns spinning a wobbly top, the dreidel. In the center of the circle is a pot of several foil-wrapped chocolate coins, to which everyone has contributed from an initial stake of coins they keep in front of them. If, on your turn, the four-sided top lands on the Hebrew letter <i>gimmel</i>, you take the whole pot and everyone needs to contribute again. If it lands on <i>hey</i>, you take half the pot. If it lands on <i>nun</i>, nothing happens. If it lands on <i>shin</i>, you put one coin in. Then the next player takes a spin.<p>\n\nIt all sounds very straightforward, until you actually start to play the game.<p>\n\nThe first odd thing you might notice is that although some of the coins are big and others are little, they all count just as one coin in the rules of the game. This is unfair, since the big coins contain more chocolate, and you get to eat your stash at the end.<p>\n\nTo compound the unfairness, there is never just one dreidel \u2014 each player may bring her own \u2014 and the dreidels are often biased, favoring different outcomes. (To test this, a few years ago my daughter and I spun a sample of eight dreidels 40 times each, recording the outcomes. One particularly cursed dreidel landed on <i>shin</i> an incredible 27/40 spins.) It matters a lot which dreidel you spin.<p>\n\nAnd the rules are a mess! No one agrees whether you should round up or round down with <i>hey</i>. No one agrees when the game should end or how low you should let the pot get before you all have to contribute again. No one agrees how many coins to start with or whether you should let someone borrow coins if he runs out. You could try to appeal to various authorities on the internet, but in my experience people prefer to argue and employ varying house rules. Some people hoard their coins and favorite dreidels. Others share dreidels but not coins. Some people slowly unwrap and eat their coins while playing, then beg and borrow from wealthy neighbors when their luck sours.<p>\n\nNow you <i>can</i>, if you want, always push things to your advantage \u2014 always contribute the smallest coins in your stash, always withdraw the largest coins in the pot when you spin <i>hey</i>, insist on always using what seems to be the \"best\" dreidel, always argue for rule interpretations in your favor, eat your big coins and use that as a further excuse to contribute only little ones, et cetera. You could do all of this without ever breaking the rules, and you'd probably end up with the most chocolate as a result.<p>\n\nBut here's the twist, and what makes the game so brilliant: The chocolate isn't very good. After eating a few coins, the pleasure gained from further coins is minimal. As a result, almost all of the children learn that they would rather enjoy being kind and generous than hoarding up the most coins. The pleasure of the chocolate doesn't outweigh the yucky feeling of being a stingy, argumentative jerk. After a few turns of maybe pushing only small coins into the pot, you decide you should put a big coin in next time, just to be fair to others and to enjoy being perceived as fair by them.<p>\n\nOf course, it also feels bad always to be the most generous one, always to put in big, take out small, always to let others win the rules arguments, and so forth, to play the sucker or self-sacrificing saint.<p>\n\nDreidel, then, is a practical lesson in discovering the value of fairness both to oneself and to others, in a context where the rules are unclear and where there are norm violations that aren't rules violations, and where both norms and rules are negotiable, varying from occasion to occasion. Just like life itself, only with mediocre chocolate at stake. I can imagine no better way to spend a holy evening.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/dreidel-seemingly-foolish-game-that.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-12-12T08:37:00-08:00\">8:37 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2556152517222069281\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, October 26, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"123876686394688099\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/in-25-years-your-employer-will-directly.html\">In 25 Years, Your Employer Will Directly Control Your Moods</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[Edit Oct. 28: After discussion with friends and commenters in social media, I now think that the thesis should be moderated in two ways.  First, before direct mood control becomes common in the workplace, it probably first needs to become voluntarily common at home; and thus it will probably take more than 25 years.  Second, it seems likely that in many (most?) cases the direct control will remain in the employee's hands, though there will likely be coercive pressure from the employer to use it as the employer expects.  (Thanks to everyone for their comments!)]<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBKmfmeEQt8/WfIxkOjIeRI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RWPwdvEKCXstFOa-7oxpEkf6ngGb6GHLQCLcBGAs/s1600/braincontrol.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"629\" data-original-width=\"564\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBKmfmeEQt8/WfIxkOjIeRI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RWPwdvEKCXstFOa-7oxpEkf6ngGb6GHLQCLcBGAs/s320/braincontrol.jpg\" width=\"287\"/></a></div><p>\n\nHere's the argument:<p>\n\n(1.) In 25 years, employers will have the technological capacity to directly control their employees' moods.<p>\n\n(2.) Employers will not refrain from exercising that capacity.<p>\n\n(3.) Most working-age adults will be employees.<p>\n\n(4.) Therefore, in 25 years, most working-age adults will have employers who directly control their moods.<p>\n\nThe argument is valid in the sense that the conclusion (4) follows if all of the premises are true.<p>\n<b>Premise 1 seems plausible</b>, given current technological trajectories.  Control could be either pharmacological or via direct brain stimulation.  Pharmacological control could, for example, be through pills that directly influence your mood, energy levels, ability to concentrate, feeling of submissiveness, or passion for the type of task at hand.  Direct brain stimulation could be through a removable <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/home/ovc-20163795\">TMS helmet</a> that magnetically stimulates and suppresses neural activity in different brain regions, or with some more invasive technology.  McDonald's might ask its cashiers to tweak their dials toward perky friendliness.  Data entry centers might ask their temp workers to tweak their dials toward undistractable focus.  Brothels might ask their strippers to tweak their dials toward sexual arousal.<p>\n\nContra Premise 1, society might collapse, of course, or technological growth could stall or proceed much more slowly.  If it's just slower, then we can replace \"25 years\" with 50 or 100 and retain the rest of the argument.  It seems unlikely that moods are too complex or finicky to be subject to fairly precise technological control, given how readily they can be influenced by low-tech means.<p>\n\nI don't know to what extent people in Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and elite universities already use high-tech drugs to enhance alertness, energy, and concentration at work.  That might already be a step down this road.  Indeed, coffee might partly be seen this way too, especially if you use it to give your all to work, and then collapse in exhaustion when the caffeine wears off and you arrive home.  My thought is that in a few decades the interventions might be much more direct, effective, and precisely targeted.<p>\n<b>Premise 2 also seems plausible</b>, given the relative social power of employers vs. employees.  As long as there's surplus labor and a scarcity of desirable jobs, then employers will have some choice about whom to hire.  If Starbucks has a choice between Applicant A who is willing to turn up the perky-friendly dial and otherwise similar Applicant B who is not so willing, then they will presumably tend to prefer Applicant A.  If the Silicon Valley startup wants an employee who will crank out intense 16-hour days one after the next, and the technology is available for people to do so by directly regulating their moods, energy levels, focus, and passion, then the people who take that direct control, for their employers' benefit, will tend to win the competition for positions.  If Stanford wants to hire the medical researcher who is publishing article after article, they'll find the researcher who dialed up her appetite for work and dialed down everything else.<p>\n\nEmployees might yield control directly to the employer: The TMS dials might be in the boss's office, or the cafeteria lunch might include the pharmacological cocktail of the day.  Alternatively, employees might keep the hand on the dial themselves, but experience substantial pressure to manipulate it in the directions expected by the employer.  If that pressure is high enough and effective enough, then it comes to much the same thing.  (My guess is that lower-prestige occupations (the majority) would yield control directly to the employer, while higher-prestige occupations would retain the sheen of self-control alongside very effective pressure to use that \"self-control\" in certain ways.)<p>\n\nContra Premise 2, (a.) collective bargaining might prevent employers from successfully demanding direct mood control; or (b.) governmental regulations might do so; or (c.) there might be a lack of surplus labor.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (a): The historical trend recently, at least in the U.S., has been against unionization and collective bargaining, though I guess that could change.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (b): Although government regulations could forbid certain drugs or brain technologies, if there's enough demand for those drugs or technologies, employees will find ways to use them (unless enforcement gets a lot of resources, as in professional sports).  Government regulations could specifically forbid employers from requiring that their employees use certain technologies, while permitting such technologies for private use.  (No TMS helmets on the job.)  But enforcement might again be difficult; and private use vs. use as an employee is a permeable line for the increasing number of jobs that involve working outside of a set time and location.  Also, it's easier to regulate a contractual demand than an informal de facto demand.  Presumably many companies could say that of course they don't <i>require </i>their employees to use such technologies.  It's up to the employee!  But if the technology delivers as promised, the employees who \"voluntarily choose\" to have their moods directly regulated will be more productive and otherwise behave as the company desires, and thus be more attractive to retain and promote.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (c): At present there's no general long-term trend toward a shortage of labor; and at least for jobs seen as highly desirable, there will always be more applicants than available positions.<p>\n<b>Premise 3 also seems plausible</b>, especially on a liberal definition of \"employee\".  Most working-age adults (in Europe and North America) are currently employees of one form or another.  That could change substantially with the \"gig economy\" and more independent contracting, but not necessarily in a way that takes the sting out of the main argument.  Even if an Uber driver is technically not an employee, the pressures toward direct mood control for productivity ought to be similar.  Likewise for computer programmers and others who do piecework as independent contractors.  If anything, the pressures may be higher, with less security of income and fewer formal workplace regulations.<p>\n\nThinking about Premises 1-3, I find myself drawn to the conclusion that my children's and grandchildren's employers are likely to have a huge amount of coercive control over their moods and passions.<p>\n\n-------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/what-would-or-should-you-do-with.html\">What Would (or Should) You Do with Administrator Access to Your Mind?</a>\" (guest post by Henry Shevlin, Aug 16, 2017).<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/misp.12034/abstract\">Crash Space</a>\" (a short story by R.

Most other defenses of the moral status of robots assume, implicitly or explicitly, that robots who are proper targets of moral concern will exist only in the future, once they have cognitive features <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights.htm\">similar to humans</a> or at least similar to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13347-013-0122-y\">non-human vertebrate animals</a>.<p>\n\nIn contrast, <b>Estrada argues that robots <i>already</i> deserve rights -- actual robots that currently exist</b>, even simple robots.<p>\n\nHis core argument is this:<p>\n\n1. Some robots are already \"social participants\" deeply incorporated into our social order.<p>\n\n2. Such deeply incorporated social participants deserve social respect and substantial protections -- \"rights\" -- regardless of whether they are capable of interior mental states like joy and suffering.<p>\n\nLet's start with some comparison cases.  Estrada mentions <b>corpses and teddy bears</b>.  We normally treat corpses with a certain type of respect, even though we think they themselves aren't capable of states like joy and suffering.  And there's something that seems at least a little creepy about abusing a teddy bear, even though it can't feel pain.<p>\n\nYou could explain these reactions without thinking that corpses and teddy bears deserve rights.  Maybe it's the person who existed in the past, whose corpse is now here, who has rights not to be mishandled after death.  Or maybe the corpse's relatives and friends have the rights.  Maybe what's creepy about abusing a teddy bear is what it says about the abuser, or maybe abusing a teddy harms the child whose bear it is.<p>\n\nAll that is plausible, but another way of thinking emphasizes the social roles that corpses and teddy bears play and the importance to our social fabric (arguably) of our treating them in certain ways and not in other ways.  Other comparisons might be: flags, classrooms, websites, parks, and historic buildings.  Destroying or abusing such things is not morally neutral. <b> Arguably, mistreating flags, classrooms, websites, parks, or historic buildings is a harm to society -- a harm that does not reduce to the harm of one or a few specific property owners who bear the relevant rights.</b><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uWw3woAxQZo/WR49PbzJxTI/AAAAAAAAALY/vPH1MkBo9N42OJW61dmIuao6jN6gtLALACLcB/s1600/KS_HitchBOT.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uWw3woAxQZo/WR49PbzJxTI/AAAAAAAAALY/vPH1MkBo9N42OJW61dmIuao6jN6gtLALACLcB/s320/KS_HitchBOT.jpg\" width=\"181\"/></a></div><p>\n\nArguably, the destruction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT\">hitchBOT</a> was like that.  HitchBOT was cute ride-hitching robot, who made it across the length of Canada but who was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/03/us/hitchbot-robot-beheaded-philadelphia-feat/\">destroyed by pranksters in Philadelphia</a> when its creators sent it to repeat the feat in the U.S.  Its destruction not only harmed its creators and owners, but also the social networks of hitchBOT enthusiasts who were following it and cheering it on.<p>\n\nIt might seem overblown to say that a flag or a historic building deserves <i>rights</i>, even if it's true that flags and historic buildings in some sense deserve respect.  If this is all there is to \"robot rights\", then we have a very thin notion of rights.  Estrada isn't entirely explicit about it, but I think he wants more than that.<p>\n\nHere's the thing that makes the robot case different: <b>Unlike flags, buildings, teddy bears, and the rest, robots can <i>act</i>.</b>  I don't mean anything too fancy here by \"act\".  Maybe all I mean or need to mean is that it's reasonable to take the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance\">intentional stance</a>\" toward them.  <b>It's reasonable to treat them as though they had beliefs, desires, intentions, goals -- and that adds a new richer dimension, maybe different in kind, to their role as nodes in our social network</b>.<p>\n\nMaybe that new dimension is enough to warrant using the term \"rights\".  Or maybe not.  I'm inclined to think that whatever rights existing (non-conscious, not cognitively sophisticated) robots deserve remain derivative on us -- like the \"rights\" of flags and historic buildings.  Unlike human beings and apes, <b>such robots have no <i>intrinsic </i>moral status</b>, independent of their role in our social practices.  To conclude otherwise would require more argument or a different argument than Estrada gives.<p>\n\nRobot rights cheap!  That's good.  I like cheap.  Discount knock-off rights!  If you want <i>luxury </i>rights, though, you'll have to look somewhere else (for now).<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT\">image source</a>]\n\nUpdate: I changed \"have rights\" to \"deserve rights\" in a few places above.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-social-role-defense-of-robot-rights.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-06-01T15:51:00-07:00\">3:51 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7390077429191586003\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, May 11, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"824306019035479016\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-sucky-and-awesome.html\">The Sucky and the Awesome</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Here are some things that \"suck\":<p>\n<blockquote><li>bad sports teams;</li>\n<li>bad popular music groups;</li>\n<li>getting a flat tire, which you try to change in the rain because you're late to catch a plane for that vacation trip you've been planning all year, but the replacement tire is also flat, and you get covered in mud, miss the plane, miss the vacation, and catch a cold;</li>\n<li>me, at playing Sonic the Hedgehog.</li></blockquote><p>\n\nIt's tempting to say that all bad things \"suck\".  There probably is a legitimate usage of the term on which you can say of anything bad that it sucks; and yet I'm inclined to think that this broad usage is an extension from a narrower range of cases that are more central to the term's meaning.<p>\n\nHere are some bad things that it doesn't seem quite as natural to describe as sucking:<p>\n<blockquote><li>a broken leg (though it might suck to break your leg and be laid up at home in pain);</li>\n<li>lying about important things (though it might suck to have a boyfriend/girlfriend who regularly lies);</li>\n<li>inferring not-Q from (i) P implies Q and (ii) not-P (though you might suck at logic problems);</li>\n<li>the Holocaust.</li></blockquote><p>\n\nThe most paradigmatic examples of suckiness <b>combine aesthetic failure with failure of skill or functioning</b>.  The sports team or the rock band, instead of showing awesome skill and thereby creating an awesome audience experience of musical or athletic splendor, can be counted on to drop the ball, hit the wrong note, make a jaw-droppingly stupid pass, choose a trite chord and tacky lyric.  Things that happen to you can suck in a similar way to the way it sucks to be stuck at a truly horrible concert: Instead of having the awesome experience you might have hoped for, you have a lousy experience (getting splashed while trying to fix your tire, then missing your plane).  There's a sense of waste, lost opportunity, distaste, displeasure, and things going badly.  You're forced to experience one stupid, rotten thing after the next.<p>\n<b>Something <i>sucks</i> if (and only if) it should deliver good, worthwhile experiences or results, but it doesn't, instead wasting people's time, effort, and resources in an unpleasant and aesthetically distasteful way.</b><p>\n\nThe opposite of sucking is being awesome.  Notice the etymological idea of \"awe\" in the \"awesome\": Something is awesome if it does or should produce awe and wonder at its greatness -- its great beauty, its great skill, the way everything fits elegantly together.  The most truly sucky of sucky things instead, produces wonder at its badness.  Wow, how could something be <i>that</i> pointless and awful!  It's amazing!<p>\n<b>That \"sucking\" focuses our attention on the aesthetic and experiential is what makes it sound not quite right to say that the Holocaust sucked.</b>  In a sense, of course, the Holocaust did suck.  But the phrasing trivializes it -- as though what is most worth comment is not the moral horror and the millions of deaths but rather the unpleasant <i>experiences</i> it produced.<p>\n\nSimilarly for other non-sucky bad things.  What's central to their badness isn't aesthetic or experiential.  To find nearby things that more paradigmatically suck, you have to shift to the experiential or to a lack of (awesome) skill or functioning.<p>\n\nAll of this is very important to understand as a philosopher, of course, because... because...<p>\n\nWell, look.  We wouldn't be using the word \"sucks\" so much if it wasn't important to us whether or not things suck, right?  <i>Why</i> is it so important?  What does it say about us, that we think so much in terms of what sucks and what is awesome?<p>\n\nHere's a Google Ngram of \"that sucks, this sucks, that's awesome\".  Notice the sharp rise that starts in the mid-1980s and appears to be continuing through the end of the available data.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VpryGHlbBKA/WRD6zMYD3MI/AAAAAAAAAKI/ZDeIRNgn4igKLxCFWQFr0f8lOjVYfB8IQCLcB/s1600/Sucks2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"201\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VpryGHlbBKA/WRD6zMYD3MI/AAAAAAAAAKI/ZDeIRNgn4igKLxCFWQFr0f8lOjVYfB8IQCLcB/s400/Sucks2.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></div><p>\n[click to enlarge]<p>\n\nWe seem to be more inclined than ever to divide the world into the sucky and the awesome.<p>\n<b>To see the world through the lens of sucking and awesomeness is to evaluate the world as one would evaluate a music video: in terms of its ability to entertain, and generate positive experiences,</b> and wow with its beauty, magnificence, and amazing displays of skill.<p>\n\nIt's to think like Beavis and Butthead, or like the characters in the Lego Movie.<p>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jyF-VleZXJQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cQgQIMlwWw\" width=\"560\"></iframe><p>\n\nThat sounds like a superficial perspective on the world, but there's also something glorious about it.

Times</i> op-ed <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-schwitzgebel-experts-dilemma-20170129-story.html\">What Happens to Democracy If the Experts Can't Be Both Factual and Balanced</a>.)<p>\n\nOur democracy requires substantial restraints on the power of the chief executive.  The president cannot simply do whatever he wants.  That's dictatorship.<p>\n\nDictatorship has arrived when other branches of government -- the legislature and the judiciary -- are unable to thwart the president.  This can happen either because the other branches are populated with stooges or because the other branches reliably fail in their attempts to resist the president.<p>\n\nPresident Trump appears to have expressed admiration for undemocratic chief executives who seize power away from judiciaries and legislatures.<p>\n\nHere's something that could occur.  President Trump might instruct the security apparatus of the United States -- the military, the border patrol, police departments -- to do something, for example to imprison or deport groups of people he describes as a threat.  And then a judge or a group of judges might decide that Trump's instructions should not be implemented.  And Trump might persist rather than deferring.  He might insist that the judge or judges who aim to block him are misinterpreting or misusing the law.  He might demand that his orders be implemented <i>despite the judicial outcome</i>.<p>\n\nHere's one reason to think that won't occur: In January, Trump issued an executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.  When judges decided to block the order, Trump backed down.  He insulted the judges and derided the decision, saying it left the nation less safe.  But he did not demand that the security apparatus of the United States ignore the decision.<p>\n\nSo that's good.<p>\n<i>Probably</i> Trump will continue to defer to the judiciary in that way.  He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/02/donald-trump-authoritarian-look-actions-not-words\">has not been as aggressive about seizing power</a> as he could have been, if he were set upon maximizing executive power.<p>\n\nBut if, improbably, Trump in the future decides to continue with an order that a judge is attempting to halt -- if, for some reason, Trump decides to insist that the executive branch disregard what he sees as an unwise and unjust judicial decision -- then quite suddenly our democracy would be comprised.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RXlZK0XVRjY/WQpr0ufRN5I/AAAAAAAAAJo/kjRvl2dsVOcFtBYkGrwKenpS2tso_PXewCLcB/s1600/Justice-Ruth-Bader-Ginsburg-Apologizes-for-Ill-Advised-Comments-on-Donald-Trump.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"134\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RXlZK0XVRjY/WQpr0ufRN5I/AAAAAAAAAJo/kjRvl2dsVOcFtBYkGrwKenpS2tso_PXewCLcB/s320/Justice-Ruth-Bader-Ginsburg-Apologizes-for-Ill-Advised-Comments-on-Donald-Trump.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n\nDemocracy depends on the improbable capacity of a few people who sit in courtrooms and study the law to convince large groups of people with guns to do things that those people with guns might not want to do, including things that the people with guns regard as contrary to the best interest of their country and the safety of their communities.  It's quite amazing.  A few people in black robes -- perhaps themselves with divided opinions -- versus the righteous desires of an army.<p>\n\nIf Trump says <i>do this</i>, and a judge in Hawaii says <i>no, stop</i>, and then Trump says <i>army of mine, ignore that judge</i>, what will the people with the guns do?<p>\n\nIt won\u2019t happen.  I don\u2019t <i>think </i>it will happen.<p>\n\nWe as a country have chosen to wager our democracy on Trump's restraint and good judgment.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2016/07/johannes-paulsen/justice-ginsburg-recuse-drop-gun-cases-notoriousrbg/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/05/on-trumps-restraint-and-good-judgment-i.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-05-03T16:52:00-07:00\">4:52 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5952966941657565363\" onclick=\"\">9\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/politics\" rel=\"tag\">politics</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Sunday, April 09, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"9000557451150892356\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/04/does-it-matter-if-passover-story-is.html\">Does It Matter If the Passover Story Is Literally True?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-schwitzgebel-passover-falsity-20170409-story.html\">My opinion piece</a> in today's LA Times.<p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-schwitzgebel-passover-falsity-20170409-story.html\"><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"180\" imageanchor=\"1\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SYdkRTzA0LM/WOp0yysAQFI/AAAAAAAAB0Q/B36X43m251MVIFGVGQFAFN6izpp6MpHzQCLcB/s320/la-1491588737-okao3f5b90-snap-image.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\" width=\"320\"/></div></a></p></p></p></div><p>\n\nYou probably already know the Passover story: How Moses asked Pharoah to let his enslaved people leave Egypt, and how Moses\u2019 god punished Pharaoh \u2014 bringing about the death of the Egyptians\u2019 firstborn sons even as he passed over Jewish households. You might even know the ancillary tale of the Passover orange. How much truth is there in these stories? At synagogues this time of year, myth collides with fact, tradition with changing values. Negotiating this collision is the puzzle of modern religion.<p>\n\nPassover is a holiday of debate, reflection, and conversation. Last Passover, as my family and I and the rest of the congregation waited for the feast at our Reform Jewish temple, our rabbi prompted us: \u201cDoes it matter if the story of Passover isn\u2019t literally true?\u201d<p>\n\nMost people seemed to shake their heads. No, it doesn\u2019t matter.<p>\n\nI was imagining the Egyptians\u2019 sons. I am an outsider to the temple. My wife and teenage son are Jewish, but I am not. My 10-year-old daughter, adopted from China at age 1, describes herself as \u201chalf Jewish.\u201d<p>\n\nI nodded my head. Yes, it does matter if the Passover story is literally true.<p>\n\n\u201cOkay, Eric, why does it matter?\u201d Rabbi Suzanne Singer handed me the microphone.<p>\n\nI hadn\u2019t planned to speak. \u201cIt matters,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause if the story is literally true, then a god who works miracles really exists. It matters if there is such a god or not. I don\u2019t think I would like the moral character of that god, who kills innocent Egyptians. I\u2019m glad there is no such god.\u201d<p>\n\n\u201cIt is odd,\u201d I added, \u201cthat we have this holiday that celebrates the death of children, so contrary to our values now.\u201d<p>\n\nThe microphone went around, others in the temple responding to me. Values change, they said. Ancient war sadly and necessarily involved the death of children. We\u2019re really celebrating the struggle for freedom for everyone....<p>\n\nRabbi Singer asked if I had more to say in response. My son leaned toward me. \u201cDad, you don\u2019t have anything more to say.\u201d I took his cue and shut my mouth.<p>\n\nThen the Seder plates arrived with the oranges on them.<p>\n\nSeder plates have six labeled spots: two bitter herbs, charoset (fruit and nuts), parsley, a lamb bone, a boiled egg, each with symbolic value. There is no labeled spot for an orange.<p>\n\nThe first time I saw an orange on a Seder plate, I was told this story about it: A woman was studying to be a rabbi. An orthodox rabbi told her that a woman belongs on the bimah (pulpit) like an orange belongs on the Seder plate. When she became a rabbi, she put an orange on the plate.<p>\n\nA wonderful story \u2014 a modern, liberal story. More comfortable than the original Passover story for a liberal Reform Judaism congregation like ours, proud of our woman rabbi. The orange is an act of defiance, a symbol of a new tradition that celebrates gender equality.<p>\n\nDoes it matter if it\u2019s true?<p>\n\nHere\u2019s what actually happened. Dartmouth Jewish Studies professor Susannah Heschel was speaking to a Jewish group at Oberlin College in Ohio. The students had written a story in which a girl asks a rabbi if there is room for lesbians in Judaism, and the rabbi rises in anger, shouting, \u201cThere\u2019s as much room for a lesbian in Judaism as there is for a <i>crust of bread</i> on the Seder plate!\u201d Heschel, inspired by the students but reluctant to put anything as unkosher as leavened bread on the Seder plate, used a tangerine instead.<p>\n\nThe orange, then, is not a wild act of defiance, but already a compromise and modification. The shouting rabbi is not an actual person but an imagined, simplified foe.<p>\n\nIt matters that it\u2019s not true. From the two stories of the orange, we learn the central lesson of Reform Judaism: that myths are cultural inventions built to suit the values of their day, idealizations and simplifications, changing as our values change \u2014 but also that only limited change is possible in a tradition-governed institution. An orange, but not a crust of bread.<p>\n\nIn a way, my daughter and I are also oranges: a new type of presence in a Jewish congregation, without a marked place, welcomed this year, unsure we belong, at risk of rolling off.<p>\n\nIn the car on the way home, my son scolded me: \u201cHow could you have said that, Dad? There are people in the congregation who take the Torah literally, very seriously! You should have seen how they were looking at you, with so much anger. If you\u2019d said more, they would practically have been ready to lynch you.\u201d<p>\n\nDue to the seating arrangement, I had been facing away from most of the congregation. I hadn\u2019t seen those faces. Were they really so outraged? Was my son telling me the truth on the way home that night? Or was he creating a simplified myth of me?<p>\n\nIn belonging to an old religion, we honor values that are no longer entirely ours. We celebrate events that no longer quite make sense. We can\u2019t change the basic tale of Passover. But we can add liberal commentary to better recognize Egyptian suffering, and we can add a new celebration of equality.<p>\n\nAlthough the new celebration, the orange, is an unstable thing atop an older structure that resists change, we can work to ensure that it remains. It will remain only if we can speak the story of it compellingly enough to give our new values too the power of myth.<p>\n\n-------------------------------------<p>\n\nRevised and condensed from my blogpost <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/orange-on-seder-plate.html\">Orange on the Seder Plate</a> (Apr 27, 2016).<p></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/04/does-it-matter-if-passover-story-is.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-04-09T10:59:00-07:00\">10:59 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=9000557451150892356\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/religion\" rel=\"tag\">religion</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, November 15, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7397941690930012990\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/11/three-ways-to-be-not-quite-free-of.html\">Three Ways to Be Not Quite Free of Racism</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Suppose that you can say, with a feeling of sincerity, \"All races and colors of people deserve equal respect\".  Suppose also that when you think about American Blacks or South Asians or Middle Eastern Muslims you don't detect any feelings of antipathy, or at least any feelings of antipathy that you believe arise merely from consideration of their race.  This is good!  <b>You are not an all-out racist in the 19th-century sense of that term.<p>\n\nStill, you might not be <i>entirely </i>free of racial prejudice</p></b>, if we took a close look at your choices, emotions, passing thoughts, and swift intuitive judgments about people.<p>\n\nImagine then the following ideal: Being free of <i>all </i>unjustified racial prejudice.  We can imagine similar ideals for classism, ableism, sexism, ethnicity, subculture, physical appearance, etc.<p>\n\nIt would be a rare person who met all of these ideals.  Yet not all falling short is the same.  The recent election has made vivid for me three importantly distinct ways in which one can fall short.  I use racism as my example, but other failures of egalitarianism can be analyzed similarly.<p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JWgSif7UrTY/WCpGQbj1pZI/AAAAAAAABoQ/bqC_upfTcRgnk_wUjPFIsBvKDNnQtDeUACLcB/s1600/Racism.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JWgSif7UrTY/WCpGQbj1pZI/AAAAAAAABoQ/bqC_upfTcRgnk_wUjPFIsBvKDNnQtDeUACLcB/s320/Racism.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n\nRacism is an <i>attitude</i>.  Attitudes can be thought of as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Postures-Mind-Essays-Morals/dp/0816613273\">postures of the mind</a>.  To have an attitude is to be <i>disposed to act and react</i> in attitude-typical ways.  (The nature of attitudes is a central part of my philosophical research. For a fuller account of my view, see <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">here</a>.)  Among the dispositions constitutive of all-out racism are: making racist claims, purposely avoiding people of that race, uttering racist epithets in inner speech, feeling negative emotions when interacting with that race, leaping quickly to negative conclusions about individual members of that race, preferring social policies that privilege your preferred race, etc.<p>\n\nAn all-out racist would have most or all of these dispositions (barring \"excusing conditions\").  Someone completely free of racism would have none of these dispositions.  <b>Likely, the majority of people in our culture inhabit the middle.<p>\n\nBut \"the middle\" isn't all the same.</p></b>  Here are three very different ways of occupying it.<p>\n\n(1.) <b>Implicit racism.</b>  Some of the relevant dispositions are <i>explicitly</i> or overtly racist -- for example, asserting that people of the target race are inherently inferior.  Other dispositions are only <i>implicitly </i>or covertly racist, for example, being prone without realizing it to evaluate job applications more negatively if the applicant is of the target race, or being likely to experience negative emotion upon being assigned a cooperative task with a person of the target race.  Recent psychological research suggests that many people in our culture, even if they reject explicitly racist statements, are disposed to have some implicitly racist reactions, at least occasionally or in some situations. <b> We can thus construct a portrait of the \"implicit racist\": Someone who sincerely disavows all racial prejudice, but who nonetheless has a wide-ranging and persistent tendency toward implicitly racist reactions and evaluations.</b>  Probably no one is a perfect exemplar of this portrait, with all and only implicitly racist reactions, but it is probably common for people to match it to a certain extent.  To that extent, whatever it is, that person is not quite free of implicit racism.<p>\n\nImplicit racism has received so much attention in the recent psychological and philosophical literature that one might think that it is the only way to be not quite free of racism while disavowing racism in the 19th-century sense of the term.  Not so!<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Situational racism.</b>  Dispositions manifest only under certain conditions.  Priscilla (name <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/11/names-in-philosophical-examples.html\">randomly chosen</a>) is disposed sincerely to say, if asked, that people of all races deserve equal respect.  Of course, she doesn't actually spend the entire day saying this.  She is disposed to say it only under certain conditions -- conditions, perhaps, that assume the continued social disapproval of racism.  It might also be the case that under <i>other </i>conditions she would say the opposite.  A person might be disposed sincerely to reject racist statements in some contexts and sincerely to endorse them in other contexts.  This is not the implicit/explicit division.  I am assuming both sides are explicit.  Nor am I imagining a change in opinion over time.  I am imagining a person like this: If situation X arose she would be explicitly racist, while if situation Y arose she would be explicitly anti-racist, maybe even passionately, self-sacrificingly so.  This is not as incoherent as it might seem.  Or if it is incoherent, it is a commonly human type of incoherence.  <b>The history of racism suggests that perfectly nice, non-racist-seeming people can change on a dime with a change in situation, and then change back when the situation shifts again.</b>  For some people, all it might take is the election of a racist politician.  For others, it might take a more toxically immersive racist environment, or a personal economic crisis, or a demanding authority, or a recent personal clash with someone of the target race.<p>\n\n(3.) <b>Racism of indifference.</b>  Part of what prompted this post was an interview I heard with someone who denied being racist on the grounds that he didn't care what happened to Black people.  This deprioritization of concern is in principle separable from both implicit racism and situational racism.  For example: I don't think much about Iceland.  My concerns, voting habits, thoughts, and interests instead mostly involve what I think will be good for me, my family, my community, my country, or the world in general.  But I'm probably not much <i>biased </i>against Iceland.  I have mostly positive associations with it (beautiful landscapes, high literacy, geothermal power).  Assuming (contra <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/\">Mozi</a>) that we have much greater obligations to family and compatriots than to people in far-off lands, my habit of not highly prioritizing the welfare of people in Iceland probably doesn't deserve to labeled pejoratively with an \"-ism\".  But a similar<b> disregard or deprioritization of people in your own community or country, on grounds of their race, does deserve a pejorative label, independent any implicit or explicit hostility</b>.<p>\n\nThese three ways of being not quite free of racism are conceptually separable.  Empirically, though, things are likely to be messy and cross-cutting.  Probably <b>the majority of people don't map neatly onto these categories, but have a complex set of mixed-up dispositions</b>.  Furthermore, this mixed-up set probably often includes <i>both </i>racist dispositions and, right alongside, dispositions to admire, love, and even make special sacrifices for people who are racialized in culturally disvalued ways.<p>\n\nIt's probably difficult to know the extent to which you yourself fail, in one or more of these three ways, to be entirely free of racism (sexism, ableism, etc.).  Implicitly racist dispositions are by their nature elusive.  So also is knowledge of how you would react to substantial changes in circumstance.  So also are the real grounds of our choices.  One of the great lessons of the past several decades of social and cognitive psychology is that we know far less than we think we know about what drives our preferences and about the situational influences on our behavior.<p>\n\nI am particularly struck by the potentially huge reach of the bigotry of indifference.  Action is always a package deal.  There are always pros and cons, which need to be weighed.  You can't act toward one goal without simultaneously deprioritizing many other possible goals.  <b>Since it's difficult to know the basis of your prioritization of one thing over another, it is possible that the bigotry of indifference permeates a surprising number of your personal and political choices</b>.  Though you don't realize it, it might be the case that you would have felt more call to action had the welfare of a different group of people been at stake.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/7znJsE\">image source</a> Prabhu B Doss, creative commons]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/11/three-ways-to-be-not-quite-free-of.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-11-15T08:41:00-08:00\">8:41 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7397941690930012990\" onclick=\"\">27\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/attitudes\" rel=\"tag\">attitudes</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, May 17, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5381344910351352420\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/05/whether-to-take-peter-singer-to.html\">Whether to Take Peter Singer to McDonalds</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CXxWgU5-IOY/VzvQ-GbEKMI/AAAAAAAABXQ/BceoDHebBUEWBZBXs4KvCMmo0y-i6irewCLcB/s1600/McDonalds%2BHong%2BKong.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CXxWgU5-IOY/VzvQ-GbEKMI/AAAAAAAABXQ/BceoDHebBUEWBZBXs4KvCMmo0y-i6irewCLcB/s200/McDonalds%2BHong%2BKong.jpg\"/></a></div><p>Greetings from Hong Kong!<p>\n\nI'm highly allergic to shellfish.  I'm allergic enough that cross-contamination is an issue: If I'm served something that has been fried on the same surface as shellfish or touched with an implement that has touched shellfish, I will have a minor allergic reaction.  Shellfish is so prevalent in the southern coastal Chinese diet that I have minor shellfish reactions at about half of my lunch or evening meals, even if I try to be careful.  I've learned that there are only two types of restaurants that are entirely safe: strict Buddhist vegetarian restaurants and McDonalds.<p>\n\nI was discussing this with my hosts at a university here in Hong Kong.  One of the hosts said, \"Well, we could go to that Buddhist restaurant that we took [the famous vegetarian philosopher] <a href=\"http://www.petersinger.info/\">Peter Singer</a> to\".  Sounds like a good idea to me!  Another host said, \"Yes, but that restaurant is so expensive!  Too bad there isn't another good Buddhist restaurant around.\"  I suggested that McDonalds would be fine, really.  I didn't want to force them to spend a lot of money hosting me.<p>\n\nIt occurred to me that they should have taken Peter Singer to McDonalds, too.  Singer is as famous for his argument against luxurious spending as he is for his argument in favor of vegetarianism, and one of his favorite examples of needless luxury spending is high-priced restaurant meals.  The idea is that the money you spend on a luxurious restaurant meal could be donated to charity and perhaps save the life of a child living in poverty somewhere.<p>\n\nSo here's my thought.  Suppose that the two options are (a) an expensive Buddhist restaurant, maybe $300 Hong Kong dollars per person for 10 people, $3000 Hong Kong dollars total ($400 US dollars), or (b) McDonalds for $500 HKD total ($65 US dollars).  The money saved by choosing option b, if donated to an effective charity, is within the ballpark of what could be expected to save one person's life [update: or maybe about a tenth of a life; estimates vary].  On the other hand, the flesh from a steer can generate about 2000 McDonald's hamburgers, so ten people would be eating only 1/200 of a steer.  Clearly one [or one tenth of a] human life is more valuable than 1/200 of a steer.  Therefore, the university should have taken Peter Singer to McDonalds and donated the savings to an effective charity.<p>\n\nOf course, there are other costs to McDonalds (other wasteful practices, environmental damage in meat production, etc.) and possibly other benefits to eating at the Buddhist restaurant (supporting good farming practices, possibly putting the profits to good use) -- but it seems unlikely that these differences would cumulatively outweigh the central tradeoff of the unsaved human life vs. 1/200 of a steer.<p>\n\nIf I ever have the chance to take Singer to dinner, I'd like to try this argument out on him and see what he thinks.  (I wouldn't be surprised if he has already thought all of this through.)<p>\n\nOur own dinner decision resolved in favor of the cheap student vegetarian cafeteria nearby, which I think maybe they had been hesitating about because it didn't seem fancy enough a venue for a visiting speaker.  But it was perfect for me -- a rather \"utilitarian\" place, I might say -- and probably where they <i>really</i> should have taken Singer.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/content/mcdonalds-meat-supplier-in-china-to-address-meat-scandal/1966313.html\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/05/whether-to-take-peter-singer-to.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-05-17T19:30:00-07:00\">7:30 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5381344910351352420\" onclick=\"\">12\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, April 27, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8402398390272525023\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/orange-on-seder-plate.html\">Orange on the Seder Plate</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_gip9RObp-8/VyDbcFV5fHI/AAAAAAAABV4/7afOw_NA8akTMbrPkU4VhscL7JcrajB2wCLcB/s1600/orange.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_gip9RObp-8/VyDbcFV5fHI/AAAAAAAABV4/7afOw_NA8akTMbrPkU4VhscL7JcrajB2wCLcB/s200/orange.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\n... and celebrating the death of children?<p> \n\n\"Does it matter if the story of the escape from Egypt is historically true?\" Rabbi Suzanne Singer asked us, her congregants, on Saturday, at the Passover Seder dinner at <a href=\"http://www.tberiv.org/\">Temple Beth El in Riverside</a>.<p>\n\nWe're a liberal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism\">Reform Judaism</a> congregation.  Everyone except me seemed to be shaking their heads, no, it doesn't matter.  I was nodding, however.  Yes, it does matter.<p>\n\nRabbi Singer walked over to me with the microphone, \"Okay, Eric, why does it matter?\"<p>\n\nI say \"we\" are a Reform Judaism congregation, but let me be clear: I am not Jewish.  My wife Pauline is.  My teenage son Davy is.  Davy even teaches at the religious school.  My nine-year-old daughter Kate, adopted from China at age one, recently described herself as \"half Jewish\".  We're members.  We volunteer, attend some of the services.  Sometimes I try to chant the chants, sometimes I don't.  I always feel a little... ambiguous.<p>\n\nI hadn't been expecting to speak.  I came out with some version of the following thought.  If the story of Passover is literally true, then there's a miracle-working God.  And it would matter if there were such a God.  I don't think I would like the moral character of that God, a God who kills so many innocent Egyptians.  I'm glad it's not literally true.  It matters.<p>\n\nI find it interesting, I added, that we (\"we\"?) have this celebratory holiday about the death of children, contrary to the values of most of us now.  It's interesting how we struggle to deal with that change in values while keeping the traditions of the holiday.<p>\n\nPassover, as you probably know, celebrates a story from Exodus.  The Jews are slaves in Egypt.  Moses and Aaron approach the Pharaoh and demand the release of their people.  The Pharaoh refuses and God sends disaster after disaster upon the Egyptians.  In the tenth and final plague, God sweeps through Egypt killing the firstborn son in every house, except the houses marked with the lamb's blood of the Jewish \"Passover\" sacrifice.  In the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/661624/jewish/English-Haggadah.htm\">traditional Haggadahs</a> (i.e. scripts of how the ceremony is to be conducted), God's destruction of the Egyptians seems to be enthusiastically relished, the general tone being one of overflowing celebration for all the good things God (or G-d) has bestowed upon us: He didn't need to plague and torment our enemies and kill their firstborns, but he did, hooray!<p>\n\n(One does remove a bit of wine from one's glass for each of the ten plagues, which has been explained to me as reducing one's joy to recognize the Egyptians' suffering; but not all traditional haggadahs offer that explanation and the overall tone is cheery about the plagues.)<p>\n\nTemple Beth El uses a Reconstructionist Haggadah which is more reflective about the Egyptians' suffering and emphasizes the plight of the enslaved and oppressed everywhere throughout world history.  The holiday is no longer understood as it once was.  But still, we sing the happy songs.<p>\n\nOthers in Temple Beth El spoke up in response to my comment: values change, ancient war sadly and necessarily involved the death of children too, we're really celebrating the struggle for freedom....  The rabbi asked if this answered my question, or if I had anything more to say.  Davy whispered, \"Dad, you don't have anything more to say.\"  I took his cue and shut my trap.<p>\n\nThe caterers arrived late.  I was pleased to see that they put oranges upon the Seder plates this year.  (It seems to be on and off in our congregation.)  The traditional Seder plate has no orange: two bitter herbs (for the bitterness of slavery), charoset (sweet fruit and nuts as mortar for the storehouses of Egypt), parsley (dipped into salt water representing the tears of slavery), a roasted lamb bone (for the Passover sacrifice), and a hard boiled egg.<p>\n\nThe first time I saw an orange on the Seder plate, I was told this story about it: A woman was studying to become a rabbi.  An orthodox rabbi told her that a woman belongs on the bima (pulpit) like an orange belongs on the Seder plate!  When she became a rabbi, she put an orange on the plate.<p>\n\nA wonderful story!  The orange on the Seder plate is wild, defiant, overturning the rules, the beginning of a new tradition to celebrate gender equality.<p>\n\nDoes it matter if it's true?<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.juf.org/news/world.aspx?id=414773\">The true story</a> is more complicated.  Dartmouth Jewish Studies professor <a href=\"http://dartmouth.edu/faculty-directory/susannah-heschel\">Susannah Heschel</a> was speaking to a Jewish group at Oberlin College.  The students had written a story in which a young girl asks a rabbi what room there is for lesbians in Judaism, and the rabbi rises in anger, shouting, \"There's as much room for a lesbian in Judaism as there is for a <i>crust of bread</i> on the Seder plate!\"  Heschel, inspired by the story, but not wanting to put anything as unkosher as leavened bread on the Seder plate, put an orange on her family's Seder plate the next year.<p>\n\nIn the second story, the orange is not a wild act of defiance but already a compromise.  The shouting rabbi is not an actual person but only an imagined, simplified foe.<p>\n\nIt matters that it's not true.  From the two stories of the orange, we learn what I regard as the central lesson of Reform Judiasm, that myths are cultural inventions built to suit the values of their day, idealizations and simplifications, that they change as our values change, but also that there's only so much change that is possible in a tradition-governed institution, which is necessarily a compromise between past and present.  An orange can be considered, but not a crust of bread.<p>\n\nMy daughter and I -- active in the temple but not quite Jewish, we too are oranges on the Seder plate, a new sort of thing in a congregation, without a marked place, welcomed this year, unsure how much we belong or want to belong, at risk of rolling off.<p>\n\nIn the car on the way home, my son scolded me: \"How could you have said that, Dad?  There are people in the congregation who take the Torah literally, very seriously.  You should have seen how they were looking at you, with so much anger.

The latter words, she suggests, should not be forbidden, although she acknowledges that in some contexts it might be inappropriate to use them.  Roache also suggests that it's silly to forbid \"fuck\" while allowing obvious replacements like \"f**k\" or \"the f-word\".  <b>Roache says, \"<a href=\"http://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/uehiro/HT15_STX_Roache.mp3\">We should swear more, and we shouldn't use asterisks, and that's fine.</a>\"</b> (31:20).<p>\n\nI disagree.  Overstating somewhat, I disagree because of <i>this:</i><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-7i2TIjzodeM/VZxd6XV05EI/AAAAAAAAA8Q/bPvmCT1Xo34/s1600/fuck.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-7i2TIjzodeM/VZxd6XV05EI/AAAAAAAAA8Q/bPvmCT1Xo34/s400/fuck.png\"/></a></div><p>\n\n\"Fuck\" is a treasure of the English language.  Speakers of other languages will sometimes even reach across the linguistic divide to relish its profanity.  <b>\"Fuck\" is a treasure precisely <i>because </i>it is forbidden.</b>  Its being forbidden is the source of its profane power and emotional vivacity.<p>\n\nWhen I was growing up in California in the 1970s, \"fuck\" was considered the worst of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyBH5oNQOS0\">the seven words you can't say on TV</a>.  You would never hear it in the media, or indeed -- in my posh little suburb -- from <i>any</i> adults, except maybe, very rarely, from some wild man from somewhere else.  I don't think I heard my parents or any of their friends say the word even once, <i>ever</i>.  It wasn't until fourth grade that I learned that the word existed.  What a powerful word, then, for a child to relish in the quiet of his room, or to suddenly drop on a friend!<p>\n\n\"Fuck\" is in danger.  Its power is subsiding from its increased usage in the public sphere.  Much as the overprinting of money devalues it, <b>profanity inflation risks turning \"fuck\" into another \"damn\".</b>  The hundred-dollar-bill of swear words doesn't buy as much shock as it used to.  (Yes, I sound like an old curmudgeon -- but it's <i>true!</i>)<p>\n\nOkay, a qualification: I'm pretty sure what I've just said is true for the suburban California dialect; but I'm also pretty sure \"fuck\" was never so powerful in some other dialects.  Some evidence of its increased usage overall, and its approach toward \"damn\", is this <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">Google NGram</a> of \"fuck\", \"shit\", and \"damn\" in \"lots of books\", 1960-2008:\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-9O5POaCV9KA/VZ1k0Le_4WI/AAAAAAAAA8o/_mTOGy098x8/s1600/DamnFuckShit.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-9O5POaCV9KA/VZ1k0Le_4WI/AAAAAAAAA8o/_mTOGy098x8/s400/DamnFuckShit.jpg\"/></a></div>\n[click to enlarge]<p>\n\nA further risk: As \"fuck\" loses its sting and emotional vivacity, people who wish to use more vividly offensive language will find themselves forced to other options.  The most offensive alternative options currently available in English are racial slurs.  But unlike \"fuck\", racial slurs are plausibly harmful in ordinary use.  <b>The cheapening of \"fuck\" thus risks forcing the migration of profanity to more harmful linguistic locations.</b><p>\n\nThe <i>paradox of prohibition</i>, then: <b>If the woman in the eCard above wishes to preserve the power of her favorite word, she should cheer for it to remain forbidden.</b>  She should celebrate, not bemoan, the existence of standards against the use of \"fuck\" on major networks, the awarding of demerits for its use in school, and its almost complete avoidance by responsible adults in public contexts.  Conversely, some preachers might wish to encourage the regular recitation of \"fuck\" in the preschool curriculum.  (Okay, that last remark was tongue in cheek.  But still, wouldn't it work?)<p>\n\nDespite the substantial public interest in retaining the forbidden deliciousness of our best swear word, I do think that since the word is in fact (pretty close to) harmless, severe restrictions would be unjust.  We must really only condemn it with the forgiving standards we usually apply to etiquette violations, even if this results in the term's not being quite as potent as it otherwise would be.<p>\n\nFinally, let me defend <b>usages like \"f**k\" and \"the f-word\"</b>.  Rather than being silly avoidances because we all know what we're talking about, such decipherable maskings <b>communicate and reinforce the forbiddenness of \"fuck\".  Thus, they help to sustain its power as an obscenity.</b><p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/inarticles/c89db13e7b2515fe4050609fcfce4239.png\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/profanity-inflation-profanity-migration.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-07-08T11:14:00-07:00\">11:14 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5514123734577662663\" onclick=\"\">34\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, June 25, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8015280245106294105\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/06/celebrate-nerd.html\">Celebrate the Nerd!</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Here's my definition of a nerd: <blockquote><b>A <i>nerd</i> is someone who loves an intellectual topic, for its own sake, to an unreasonable degree.</b></blockquote><p>\n\nThe nerd might be unreasonably passionate about Leibnizian metaphysics, for example -- she studies Latin, French, and German so she can master the original texts, she stays up late reading neglected passages, argues intensely about obscure details with anyone who has the patience to listen.  Or she loves twin primes in that same way, or the details of Napoleonic warfare, or the biology of squids.  How could anyone care <i>so much</i> about such things?<p>\n\nIt's not that the nerd sees some great practical potential in studying twin primes (though she might half-heartedly try to defend herself in that way), or is responding in the normal way to something that sensible people might study carefully because of its importance (such as a cure for leukemia).  Rather<b> the nerd is compelled by an intellectual topic and builds a substantial portion of her life around it, with no justification that would make sense to anyone who is not similarly consumed by that topic.</b>  All passions drift free of reasonable justification to some extent, but still there's a difference between moderate passions and passions so extreme and compelling that one is somewhat unbalanced as a result of them.  The nerd will sacrifice a lot -- time, money, opportunities -- to learn just a little bit more about her favored topic.\n<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cl8qlhoOLu8/VXYkA9otFNI/AAAAAAAAA58/UOcVifStmwA/s1600/nerd.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cl8qlhoOLu8/VXYkA9otFNI/AAAAAAAAA58/UOcVifStmwA/s400/nerd.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nThe secondary features of nerdiness are side effects: The nerd <b>might not care about dressing nicely</b>.  She's too busy worrying about the Leibniz <i>Nachlass</i>.  The nerd <b>might fail at being cool</b> -- she's not invested in developing the social skills that would be required.  The nerd might be <b>introverted</b>: Maybe she really was introverted all along and that's part of why she found herself with her nerdy passions; or maybe she's an introvert partly in reaction to other people's failure to care about squid.  Oh, but now squid have come up in the conversation?  Her knowledge is finally relevant!  The nerd becomes now too eager to deploy her vast knowledge.  She won't stop talking.  She'll correct all your minor errors.  <b>She'll <i>nerdsplain </i>tirelessly at you.</b><p>\n\nThe nerd needn't possess any of these secondary features: Caring intensely about the Leibniz <i>Nachlass </i>needn't consume one entirely, and so there can still be room for the nerd to care also, in a normal, non-intellectual way, about ordinary things.  But the tendency on average will be for nerdy passion to push away other interests and projects, with the result that uncool, shlumpy introverts will be overrepresented among nerds.<p>\n\nInnate genius might exist.  But I don't find the empirical evidence very compelling.  <b>What I think <i>passes </i>for innate genius is often just nerdy passion.</b>  Meeting the nerd on her own turf, she can appear to be a natural-born genius or talent because she has already thought the topic through so thoroughly that she operates two moves ahead of you and has a chess-master-like recognition of the patterns of intellectual back-and-forth in the area.  She has thought repetitively, and from many angles, of the various ways in which pieces of Leibniz might possibly connect, or about the wide range of techniques in prime-number mathematics, or about the four competing theories of squid neural architecture and their relative empirical weaknesses.  She dreams them at night.  How could you hope to keep up?  She will also master related domains so that she exceeds you there, too -- early modern philosophy generally and abstract metaphysics, say, for the Leibniz nerd.  Other aspects of her mind might not be so great -- just ask her to fix a faucet or find her way around downtown -- but meet her anywhere near her turf and she'll scorch right past you.  If she is good enough also at exuding an aura of intelligence (not all nerds are, but it's a social technique that pairs well with nerdiness), then you might attribute her overperformance on Leibniz to her innate brilliance, her underperformance in plumbing to her not giving a whit.<p>\n<b>Movies like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/\">Good Will Hunting</a> drive me nuts, because they feed the impression that intellectual accomplishment is the result of an innate gift, rather than the result of nerdy passion.</b>  In this way, they are antithetical to the vision of nerdiness that I want to celebrate.  A janitor who doesn't care (much?) about math but is innately great at it -- and somehow also knows better than history graduate students what's going on in obscure texts in their field?  Such innate-genius movies rely on the <a href=\"http://mindsetonline.com/\">fixed mindset</a> that <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/cgi-bin/drupalm/cdweck\">Carol Dweck</a> has criticized.  What I think I see in the nerdy eminences I have met is not so much innate genius as years of thought inspired by passion for stuff that no one sensible would care <i>so</i> much about.<p>\n\nSociety needs nerds.  If we want to know as much as a society ought to know about Leibniz and about squids, we benefit from having people around who are so unreasonably passionate about these things that they will master them to an amazing degree.  <b>There's also just something glorious about a world that contains people who care as passionately about obscure intellectual topics as the nerd does.</b><p>\n<b><div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n**** Celebrate the nerd! ****</div></b>\n<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-Sn4IeeoOf4Q/VXiyv9FnZ9I/AAAAAAAAA7M/LmnN9jU2ypg/s1600/nerd-i-prefer-the-term-intellectual-badass-female-model.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-Sn4IeeoOf4Q/VXiyv9FnZ9I/AAAAAAAAA7M/LmnN9jU2ypg/s400/nerd-i-prefer-the-term-intellectual-badass-female-model.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\n[<a href=\"http://technopaideia.blogspot.com/\">image source</a>, <a href=\"http://www.betterthanpants.com/nerd-i-prefer-the-term-intellectual-badass\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/06/celebrate-nerd.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-06-25T08:00:00-07:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=8015280245106294105\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, May 21, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7286911393647780276\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/05/leading-sf-novels-academic-library.html\">Leading SF Novels: Academic Library Holdings and Citation Rates</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Among the most culturally influential English-language fiction writers of the 20th century, a substantial portion wrote science fiction or fantasy -- \"speculative fiction\" (SF) broadly construed.  H.G. Wells, J.R.R. Tolkien, George Orwell, Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, and Ursula K. Le Guin, for starters.  In the 21st century so far, speculative fiction remains culturally important.  There's sometimes a feeling among speculative fiction writers that even the best recent work in the genre isn't taken seriously by academic scholars.  I thought I'd look at a couple possible (imperfect!) measures of this.<p>\n\n(I'm doing this partly just for fun, 'cause I'm a dork and I find this kind of thing relaxing, if you'll believe it.)<p>\n<i>Holdings of recent SF in academic libraries</i><p>\n\nI generated a <b>list of critically acclaimed SF novels</b> by considering <a href=\"http://www.thehugoawards.org/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sfwa.org/nebula-awards/\">Nebula</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/\">World Fantasy</a> award winners from 2009-2013 plus any non-winning novels that were among the 5-6 finalists for at least two of the three awards.  Nineteen novels met the criteria.<p>\n\nThen I looked at two of the largest <b>Anglophone academic library holdings databases</b>: <a href=\"http://copac.ac.uk/\">COPAC</a> and <a href=\"http://melvyl.worldcat.org/\">Melvyl</a>, and counted how many different campuses (max 30-ish) had a print copy of the book [see endnote for details].<p>\n\nH = Hugo finalist, N = Nebula finalist, W = World Fantasy finalist; stars indicate winners.<p>\n\nThe results, listed from most held to least:<p>\n\n16 campuses: Neil Gaiman, <i>The Graveyard Book</i> (H*W)</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n15: George R.R.

In the PEN group, just as in the SF group, there were nine books held by fewer than ten of the campuses (3, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9) -- so the lower part of the lists looks pretty similar.<p>\n<i>References in Google Scholar</i><p>\n\nCitation patterns in Google Scholar tell a similar story.  <b>Although citation rates are generally low by philosophy and psychology standards</b> (assuming as a comparison group the most-praised philosophy and psychology books of the period),<b> they are not very different between the SF and PEN lists</b>.\n\nThe SF books for which I could find five or more Google Scholar citations:<p>\n\n53 citations: Gaiman, <i>The Graveyard Book</i></p></p></p></p></p>\n52: Doctorow, <i>Little Brother</i>\n27: Martin, <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>\n26: Bacigalupi, <i>The Windup Girl</i>\n9: Priest, <i>Boneshaker</i>\n8: Robinson, <i>2312</i>\n5: Okorafor, <i>Who Fears Death</i><p>\n\nThe top-cited PEN books were at 70 (O'Neill, <i>Netherland</i>) and 59 (Egan, <i>A Visit from the Goon Squad</i>).  After those two, there's a gap down to 17, 15, 12, 11, 10.<p>\n\nI continue to suspect that there is a bit of a perception difference between \"highbrow\" literary fiction and \"middlebrow\" SF, disadvantaging SF studies in some quarters of the university; but if so, perhaps that is compensated by recognition of SF's broader visibility in popular culture, so that in terms of overall scholarly attention, it appears to be approximately a tie.<p>\n\n---------------------------------<p>\n<i>Bestsellers:</i><p>\n\nSo... hey!  That makes me wonder about bestsellers.  I've taken the four best selling fiction books each year from 2009-2013 (according to USA Today for 2009-2012, Nielsen Book Scan for 2013) and tried the same.  (The catalogs are a bit messier since these books tend to have multiple editions, so the numbers are a little rougher.)<p>\n\nTop five by citations (# of campuses in parens):<p>\n431: Suzanne Collins, <i>The Hunger Games</i> (23)</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n333: Stephanie Meyer, <i>Twilight</i> (26)\n162: Stephanie Meyer, <i>Breaking Dawn</i> (17)\n132: Stephanie Meyer, <i>New Moon</i> (15)\n130: Steig Larsson, <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i> (12)<p>\n\nOnly 4 of the 19 had fewer than 10 citations, and all were held by at least six campuses.<p>\n\nSo by both of these measures, <b>bestsellers are receiving more academic attention than either the top critically acclaimed SF or PEN. </b> Notable: By my count, 8 of the 19 bestsellers are SF, including all of the top-four most cited.<p>\n\nMaybe that's as is should be: <i>The Hunger Games</i> and <i>Twilight </i>are major cultural phenomena, worthy of serious discussion for that sake alone, in addition to whatever merits they might have as literature.<p>\n\n---------------------------------<p>\nEndnote:</p></p></p></p></p>\nCOPAC covers the major British and Irish academic libraries, Melvyl the ten University of California campuses.  I counted up the total number of campuses in the two systems with at least one holding of each book, limiting myself to print holdings (electronic and audio holdings were a bit disorganized in the databases, and spot checking suggested they didn't add much to the overall results since most campuses with electronic or audio also had print of the same work).<p>\n\nAs always, corrections welcome!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/05/leading-sf-novels-academic-library.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-05-21T14:25:00-07:00\">2:25 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7286911393647780276\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Sunday, December 28, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5835643110697050695\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-moral-world-of-dreidel.html\">The Moral World of Dreidel</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I used to think dreidel was a poorly designed game of luck.  Now I realize that its \"bugs\" are really features!  Dreidel is the moral world in minature.<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-JF1H9s1UIto/VKA8MzqcPmI/AAAAAAAAAtU/qUdOgoHlXaY/s1600/Dreidel_001.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-JF1H9s1UIto/VKA8MzqcPmI/AAAAAAAAAtU/qUdOgoHlXaY/s320/Dreidel_001.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nPrimer for goys: You sit in a circle with friends or relatives and take turns spinning a wobbly top (the dreidel).  In the center of the circle is a pot of several foil-wrapped chocolate coins.  If the four-sided top lands on the Hebrew letter <i>gimmel</i>, you take the whole pot and everyone needs to contribute to the pot again.  If it lands on <i>hey</i>, you take half the pot.  If it lands on <i>nun</i>, nothing happens.  If it lands on <i>shin</i>, you put a coin in.  Then the next player takes a turn.<p>\n<b>It all sounds very straightforward, until you actually start to play the game.</b><p>\n\nFirst off: Some coins are big, others little.  If the game were fair, all the coins would be the same size, or at least there would be clear rules about tradeoffs or about when you're supposed to contribute your big coins and little coins.  Also, there's never just one driedel, and the dreidels all seem to be uneven and biased.  (This past Hannukah, my daughter Kate and I spun a sample of dreidels 40 times each.  One in particular landed on shin an incredible 27/40 spins.  [Yes, p &lt; .001, highly significant, even with a Bonferroni correction.])  No one agrees whether you should round up or round down with hey; no one agrees when the game should end or how low the pot should be before you all have to contribute again.  (You could look at various alleged authorities on the internet, but people prefer to argue and employ varying house rules.)  No one agrees whether you should let someone borrow coins if they run out, or how many coins to start with.  Some people hoard their coins; others slowly unwrap and eat them while playing, then beg and borrow from their wealthy neighbors.<p>\n\nYou <i>can</i>, if you want, always push things to your advantage: Always contribute the smallest coins you can, always withdraw the biggest coins you can, insist on using what seems to be the \"best\" dreidel, always argue for rule-interpretations in your favor, eat your big coins and use that as a further excuse to only contribute little ones, etc.  You could do all this without ever once breaking the rules, and you'd probably end up with the most chocolate as a result.<p>\n<b>But here's the brilliant part: The chocolate isn't very good.</b>  After eating a few coins, the pleasure gained from further coins is pretty minimal.  <b>As a result, almost all the children learn that they would rather enjoy being kind and generous than they would enjoy hoarding up more coins.</b>  The pleasure of the chocolate doesn't outweigh the yucky feeling of being a stingy, argumentative jerk.  After a few turns of maybe pushing only small coins into the pot, you decide you should put a big coin in next time, even though the rules don't demand it -- just to be fair to others, and to be perceived as fair by them.<p>\n\nOf course, it also feels bad always to be the most generous one -- always to put in big, take out small, always to let others win the rules-arguments, etc., to play the sucker or self-sacrificing saint.  Dreidel is a practical lesson in discovering the value of fairness both to oneself and others, in a context where proper interpretation of the rules is unclear, and where there are norm violations that aren't rule violations, and where both norms and rules are negotiable, varying from occasion to occasion -- just like life itself, but with only mediocre chocolate at stake.<p>\n\n(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel\">image source</a>)</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-moral-world-of-dreidel.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2014-12-28T09:34:00-08:00\">9:34 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5835643110697050695\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20development\" rel=\"tag\">moral development</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, December 16, 2009</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8892652885388413355\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/12/professorial-product-placement.html\">Professorial Product Placement</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Viewing the latest <a href=\"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrO4YZeyl0I\">Lady Gaga video</a>, with its ten product placements, I'm inspired by the thought: Why don't <em>professors </em>do product placements, too?<br/><br/>Actually, this first occurred to me a couple years ago, when I noticed <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ed.ac.uk/people/clark/publications.html\">Andy Clark</a> sipping a <a href=\"http://www.monsterenergy.com/web/guest/home\">Monster energy drink</a> while speaking before a large audience at a plenary session of the biennial Tucscon <a href=\"http://www.consciousness.arizona.edu/\">Toward a Science of Consciousness</a> conference.  Naturally -- I dare say inevitably -- I thought to myself: \"Hey, Monster energy drinks must be cool if Andy Clark is drinking one.  I should go out and buy one now!  I wonder how much Monster would pay me to drink one at <em>my </em>plenary session?\"  (Admittedly, my experience at the moment was not sampled by a <a href=\"http://www.nevada.edu/~russ/beeper.html\">Hurlburt beeper</a>, so my recollection may be slightly erroneous.)<br/><br/>There are many product placement opportunities for professors: We could display products like drinks or high fashion during classes and public lectures -- with all the respect we command from the high socio-economic status young adult demographic!  We could mention products as examples in oral presentations and published articles.  (\"Suppose that a trolley is rolling out of control toward five people it will inevitably kill unless you push a heavy object over the tracks to stop it.  The only available heavy object is a late-model <a href=\"http://www.lexus.com/models/RX/\">Lexus RX10</a>....\")  We could even <a href=\"http://www.coca-cola.com/index.jsp\">link</a> <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/\">to</a> <a href=\"http://www.nike.com/nikeos/p/nike/en_US/\">them</a> <a href=\"http://www.budweiser.com/default.aspx#/index\">from</a> <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us\">our</a> <a href=\"http://www.tourismbrunei.com/\">blogs</a>.<br/><br/>However, the most dramatic impact would surely come from a tattoo on the face.  Thus, I make the following standing offer: For $2,000,000 U.S., I will give over three inches square of real estate on my check, for an appropriately tasteful tattoo by a company that's not too evil.  (Evil companies will have to pay a surcharge sufficient to bring the overall utilitarian considerations back into balance.)  To preserve what's left of my dignity, I will immediately donate half the amount to Oxfam -- which should, conservatively, save at least ten people's lives.  (That seems worth it, doesn't it?  Would you want to face the ten people who died because you weren't willing to tattoo your face?)<br/><br/>Now admittedly, the U.C. Riverside / Schwitzgebel brand is probably not realistically worth enough to command that kind of money for an advertisement, but maybe an eminent professor at Harvard or Princeton could do so -- especially given the free press that would no doubt accompany the first professorial facial tattoo advertisement.  <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~psinger/\">Peter Singer</a> seems like a natural choice given his high visibility, and with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer#World_poverty\">his attitudes toward famine and charity</a>, how could he refuse the offer?<br/><br/><a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/_sfH_hnTwg5s/SykbleWbEaI/AAAAAAAAAHo/4POuQ_UPPgs/s1600-h/SpaceAvailable1.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5415890357505954210\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/_sfH_hnTwg5s/SykbleWbEaI/AAAAAAAAAHo/4POuQ_UPPgs/s400/SpaceAvailable1.JPG\" style=\"display:block;

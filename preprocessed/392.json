had rented an Audi Q5 in Monsoon metallic, a luxury SUV, but smaller than it should have been, given the four of us and the camping stuff and the cooler, plus the costumes and the makeup and the snacks. After meeting the other passengers\u200a\u2014\u200aBrooklyn roommates Diane, a real estate agent from Japan, and Aliya, a pharmacist and part-time actress\u200a\u2014\u200aoutside a Williamsburg Starbucks, he settled into the driver\u2019s seat and studied the dashboard nav system with a boyish reverence for the tech.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"746e\" name=\"746e\">Trevor was from London. He was wearing shorts, a T-shirt, flip-flops, and a ball cap. He was given to phrases like, \u201cYou make your own luck in life,\u201d but he seemed like a guy for whom some of the luck had come baked in. A big fellow, maybe 6'4\", and handsome with a gym rat\u2019s physique, he resembled Superman, but a notch better, due to the accent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f82e\" name=\"f82e\">Our destination was, let\u2019s call it RISE, an exclusive three-day dance-music festival-cum-New Age spiritual retreat held on a 10-acre property in the wilds of New England, to which I\u2019d wrangled an extremely hard-to-get invitation. (The name of the event has been changed, as have the names of attendees and organizers.)</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"d832\" name=\"d832\">Successful young professionals\u200a\u2014\u200amany with a polyamorous bent, some bearing fanny packs stuffed with pharmaceuticals\u200a\u2014\u200awere heading to the woods to party, and I hoped to join\u00a0them.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"de8f\" name=\"de8f\">The guests were a tight-knit bunch; many had been showing up every year since attending a wedding together on the property in 2008. Beyond a few rumors, I had little idea what to expect. I knew only that a tribe of more than 250 attractive and successful young professionals\u200a\u2014\u200amany with a polyamorous bent, some bearing fanny packs stuffed with pharmaceuticals\u200a\u2014\u200awere heading to the woods to party their asses off for three days in August, and that I hoped to join them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9843\" name=\"9843\">The assignment would likely mean subjecting myself to nearly 50 hours, in aggregate, of deep house, tropical house, techno house, and drum \u2019n\u2019 bass, but I\u2019d manage.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"225f\" name=\"225f\">Introduced via email to the organizer, an entrepreneur I\u2019ll call Lev, I\u2019d concocted a powerful pitch affirming my mission to write about the creation of \u201cintentional community.\u201d I would show readers, I promised, that what seems like little more than a party can actually \u201cbe therapeutic and even liberating, especially at a time when so much seems to be going wrong in the world.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"13da\" name=\"13da\">I cringe a bit to reread that email now. I won\u2019t quote the entire thing, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s ingratiating and overeager and a even touch disingenuous\u200a\u2014\u200abecause although I would indeed have been perfectly happy to write about a radical utopian experiment and the seeds of a transformative social movement, what I actually expected to find was a privileged band of naive but endearing pleasure seekers spouting New Age banalities.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e0dc\" name=\"e0dc\">But there\u2019s another reason the letter makes me cringe.

The trick is that you \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d You \u201clet people hang themselves with their own rope.\u201d You lay it all out there and leave it to the reader to render judgment, knowing full well that, especially on Twitter, readers like nothing better.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5338\" name=\"5338\">There are techniques, of course, to help things along. You stay away from adjectives, which could be a giveaway of hostile intent. You layer on meaningless details, especially brand names, as a way of suggesting that such superficialities <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really matter </em>to your subject, thereby making him or her seem unserious, when in fact they probably couldn\u2019t care less. (For example: not a merely \u201ca silver SUV\u201d but \u201ca Audi Q5 luxury SUV in Monsoon metallic\u201d; not a coffee shop in Brooklyn, but a Starbucks in Williamsburg, etc.). And often, instead of quoting people directly, you paraphrase them, ideally in out-of-context run-on sentences that sound adorably silly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"811b\" name=\"811b\">I wouldn\u2019t be mean, but then again, I wouldn\u2019t have to. RISE was a soft target. A long weekend filled with mind-altering substances, flamboyant costumes, and neo-pagan spiritual jargon would provide an abundance of weird conversations and kooky little details.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4cbe\" name=\"4cbe\">If RISE is loosely aligned with a social movement, it\u2019s one that dates back arguably to the glorious moment in the mid-1980s when someone set fire to the first Burning Man effigy. Aspects of the so-called burner ethos\u200a\u2014\u200aradical inclusion, radical self-expression, and the emphasis on immediacy and lived experience, among others\u200a\u2014\u200ahave gradually made their way beyond \u201cthe playa,\u201d as the festival\u2019s site in the Black Rock Desert is known.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee4e\" name=\"ee4e\">Numerous \u201c<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://regionals.burningman.org/regionals/\" href=\"https://regionals.burningman.org/regionals/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">regional burns</a>\u201d take place around the world annually, and a number of events, social clubs, parties, and co-living spaces with names like the Lightning Society, I Feel, JunXion, the Assemblage, the Hacienda, and Emerald Village have emerged in recent years. While they vary widely in terms of style and intention, they share the common goal of creating what are often called \u201ctemporary autonomous zones\u201d in which certain rules governing social interactions in the everyday world are suspended or turned upside down.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7da1\" name=\"7da1\">Some of these groups are profit-making ventures; RISE aims merely to be self-sustaining. This year, attendees contributed $325 apiece, money that goes toward catered meals, a sound system so massive it would have cost $20,000 to rent for the weekend if a longtime participant hadn\u2019t furnished it at a steep discount, and a seemingly endless supply of cordwood.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5415\" name=\"5415\">It also helps fund transportation for some of the DJs (17 sets were planned) and a pair of guest lecturers: Alexandre Tannous, a Columbia University ethnomusicology professor turned sound researcher and sound therapist, would be speaking and leading a sound meditation; Matt O\u2019Dowd, a professor of astrophysics at Lehman College, would set up a telescope and talk about black holes and the tension between astrophysics and astrology. (Later, when people would tell me that \u201cthe universe brought you here for a reason,\u201d as many did, I would be tempted to cite O\u2019Dowd\u2019s talk as a counterpoint, but then I\u2019d just nod instead.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5dde\" name=\"5dde\">As for accommodations, some guests would crash in the main cabin, grabbing air mattresses or giant beanbags, but most would bring tents, setting them up near a lonesome Porta-John on the other side of the property.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c47\" name=\"1c47\">Attire would be an issue for me. My summer wardrobe consists of cutoff jorts, pocket tees, and \u201ccomfortable\u201d hiking shoes, a look that seems more or less appropriate for a fiftysomething father of teenagers, at least in Brooklyn.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"1dce\" name=\"1dce\">I think about my age a lot. Sometimes I imagine I can feel my cells decaying.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"0de7\" name=\"0de7\">But apparently, elaborate getups were de rigueur. As the Audi crept through a torrential downpour in western Massachusetts, Trevor listed off his various outfits. It was his fourth year, and he seemed well prepared. He\u2019d planned multiple costume changes, sometimes pegged to specific events on the schedule: serious rave wear like pearlescent onesies (I had no idea they made these in his size) or a whimsical animal-shaped rainbow hoodie with built-in paws.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"60ba\" name=\"60ba\">I\u2019d packed just two accessories: a leather cowboy hat a friend had liberated from the photo booth at a forgotten movie premiere (was it <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Wild Wild West</em>?) and a sterling-silver pendant shaped like a Cheez-It that I\u2019d given my wife, Emma, for her birthday back when I had money to blow on silver Cheez-Its. The fact that she\u2019d never worn it\u200a\u2014\u200anot even once\u200a\u2014\u200ahas irked me ever since. When I\u2019d purchased it (from a little shop in Williamsburg, naturally), I still entertained the notion that a midlife crisis was something the two of us might share, as a couple. Turns out she\u2019s okay with being in her fifties. Good for her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a882\" name=\"a882\">Personally, I think about my age a lot. Sometimes I imagine I can feel my cells decaying. One way I try to slow them down is by swimming at the Y three times a week\u200a\u2014\u200aironic, because swimming at the Y is a very old-person thing to do. Another way is by occasionally exploiting my work as a journalist in order to go on absurd adventures. Which is how I could manage to sell the idea of attending a three-day rave in the woods with a bunch of sex-positive burners as \u201cDad\u2019s job.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"7877\" name=\"7877\">When I asked about the Cheez-It, Emma gave it up readily, a little too readily I thought. \u201cYou should totally have it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was never really for me.\u201d We\u2019ve been together since high school. We know each other well, and our barbs rarely miss.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"0852\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"4936\" name=\"4936\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">R</span>ISE takes place<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>in a bucolic 10-acre meadow blanketed with lush grass, a babbling brook on one side and a country road on the other, all of it surrounded by low mountains.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7d70\" name=\"7d70\">The main building is a 5,000-square-foot wood-paneled cabin, which Lev usually rents out for an average of $563 a night. That seems like a bargain. Within an easy drive of several ski resorts, the house is spacious and well appointed and comfortably sleeps 25, though we nearly doubled that on the first rainy night. There\u2019s a large fire pit, a teepee, and a hot tub. It would make an ideal setting for a corporate off-site, better still for a family reunion or a wedding, which is sort of what RISE is\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201ca wedding where everyone is marrying everyone,\u201d as one participant put it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3352\" name=\"3352\">I heard several other descriptions, all of them pretty accurate:</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"da25\" name=\"da25\">\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like Thanksgiving, except you actually really like your family.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cd08\" name=\"cd08\">\u201cIt\u2019s like 250 X-Men in one place.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1378\" name=\"1378\">\u201cIt\u2019s an experiment in human consciousness.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3e3a\" name=\"3e3a\">\u201cIt\u2019s a clown car of awesomeness.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"96e3\" name=\"96e3\">The RISE crowd had a distinctly international flavor. I met people from Poland and Serbia, France, the UK, Italy, Lebanon, Japan, Israel, Brazil, Greece, and Iran, most of them in their late twenties and thirties. Many worked in marketing and product design. There were coders, entrepreneurs, lawyers, bartenders, a pediatric dentist. One guy said he was a creator and snowboarder.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"1b9c\" name=\"1b9c\">I\u2019d heard whispers about RISE well before pitching the story: that it was basically a sex\u00a0party.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"ea12\" name=\"ea12\">Lev and I had communicated only via email and phone, but as soon as I arrived, he strode across the field to greet me with a warm hug. At 46, he was older than most of the RISE members. He was about my height (5'5\") but seemed taller, with penetrating blue eyes, chiseled dimples, and gray hair trimmed close to his scalp. He was wearing harem pants, and over his well-muscled torso he\u2019d slung a leather holster with two pockets, in which he carried his phone and other necessities.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1d32\" name=\"1d32\">\u201cI feel like you\u2019re going to do something great,\u201d Lev told me as he led me toward the bonfire. \u201cI know we can trust you.\u201d Clearly he hadn\u2019t read a lot of trend pieces.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b153\" name=\"b153\">Lev looked a little like cult leader, but he didn\u2019t sound like one. Instead, for most of the weekend, he projected parental concern. The group\u2019s designated superego, he spent most of his time urging us to clean up after ourselves, marshalling troops to perform various tasks, and compulsively reminding us to remove our shoes before entering the cabin. \u201cHey, Lev, quick question!\u201d a RISEr shouted at one point. \u201cShould I take off my shoes before going in, or nah?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2adc\" name=\"2adc\">These efforts were critical. Somehow the entire site remained more or less clean for the entire weekend. On Sunday, when someone fired up a bubble machine over by the \u201cLove Matrix\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aa modular structure strung with hammocks, which would be dismantled a week later and driven to Burning Man\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone taunted him, \u201cHey, Lev, shouldn\u2019t somebody clean up these bubbles?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"9190\" name=\"9190\">Lev is also a stickler about smoking, and for good reason. He can\u2019t be around cigarettes, even unlit. Just the smell alone is enough to set off a migraine, he told one guest who\u2019d approached him with a fresh butt dangling from his lips.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"8fb5\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"26e2\" name=\"26e2\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> Friday afternoon,<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>I made my way to the big tent for the Welcome Circle. After a few preliminaries, we began a series of exercises.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5953\" name=\"5953\">First, the guy leading the ceremony asked us, one by one, to describe our mood on a scale from one to 10 and to share a word that described us. The average mood was a seven. People were feeling <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Blessed\u2026Grateful\u2026Excited\u2026Peaceful\u2026Open\u2026</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5ccb\" name=\"5ccb\">After each disclosure, the group would say \u201cAho!\u201d a phrase widely used in shamanic and Native American\u2013inspired spiritual rituals, that is often translated as amen.

Duplicitous? Enemy of the people? </em>Instead I went with the most generic thing I could think of: \u201cI\u2019m a seven,\u201d I said, \u201cand I\u2019m feeling <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">thoughtful</em>.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e1d0\" name=\"e1d0\">Kind of lame, but everyone said \u201cAho!\u201d This was not a judgy crowd.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5963\" name=\"5963\">The leader then invited everyone who\u2019d rated their mood as a three or less to step into the center of the circle and led the rest of us in a group chant (really more of a full-throated whoop) designed to direct positive energy and love their way.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"97b0\" name=\"97b0\">Since my arrival, I\u2019d been hugged by at least 50 people, some multiple\u00a0times.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"ba36\" name=\"ba36\">Next, he told us to find someone we didn\u2019t know and to sit facing one another. My partner was Nanette. She appeared to be in her thirties and had a friendly face and a big smile and bangs, and she wore her hair up in a high ponytail. We settled in opposite each other. Then, as instructed, we proceeded to gaze, silently, into one another\u2019s eyes. And keep gazing, long past the point of discomfort, past the giggles, past the careful study of one another\u2019s features (Nanette wears a lot of mascara), past the terrifying moment when we knew we\u2019d been <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">seen</em>, in all our innocence and childlike fear and deep existential sadness, past the next round of giggles, and even past the boredom and the moment when we silently agreed, \u201cWe got this. You and me. We\u2019re killing this bullshit exercise.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9318\" name=\"9318\">It was probably a minute, two minutes tops.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ae07\" name=\"ae07\">Finally, we were invited to whisper our intention for the weekend into each other\u2019s ear.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e7e3\" name=\"e7e3\">Nanette said something about bringing love and openness and community. I nodded. Thoughtfully.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1b61\" name=\"1b61\">Then I whispered that I was a journalist, that I was kind of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">working</em>, and that therefore my intention was twofold and compromised. I was there to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">be </em>and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">share</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">commune</em>, yes, but also to observe and evaluate and create a narrative and define the experience. I confessed that the idea was already making me queasy, and that I had no clue how I would manage to remain objective without betraying everyone\u2019s trust and goodwill.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"6021\" name=\"6021\">\u201cI think you\u2019ll do fine,\u201d she said.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"ff7d\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"c3de\" name=\"c3de\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">W</span>hat went on<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>in the teepee? On the second day, I became preoccupied with the question. I\u2019d heard whispers about RISE well before pitching the story: that it was basically a sex party, an orgy, a safe space for polyamory and other forms of erotic self-expression and radical openness. But Lev hadn\u2019t mentioned anything like that, and I hadn\u2019t asked. \u201cIt will be quite an experience\u2026,\u201d he\u2019d said, leaving it to me to fill that ellipsis with whatever my mind conjured up. What it conjured up was basically <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Eyes Wide Shut</em> meets season two of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Girls</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3020\" name=\"3020\">On my first night, I\u2019d gazed over at the cone of fabric, glowing there in the middle of the field, and decided: That\u2019s where it happens.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a21e\" name=\"a21e\">Participatory journalism was the point of the assignment, but just how participatory was a question I had left somewhat open. Drugs seemed somewhat essential, and over the course of the weekend, I would willingly ingest LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, ketamine, cannabis, Adderall, and booze. (The one thing I declined was cocaine, mostly because I\u2019m queasy about the human toll of the trade itself.) As for sex, that was a tougher question. Yes, I am married with three lovely children. But if something was going on in that teepee, I figured it was my job to find out what.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45d0\" name=\"45d0\">That said, I wasn\u2019t ready for an orgy, or even a cuddle puddle. In fact, though I\u2019d been at RISE less than a day, I already longed to escape, if only for an hour. It was the hugs. Hugging was the standard greeting at RISE: bear hugs and clinches, double-sided shoulder rubs, affectionate \u201cbring it in\u201d headlocks, and gentle embraces accompanied by little fingertip caresses. \u201cWhat I love about this community,\u201d one woman told me, \u201cis how much you see men hugging each other. I think more men need to do that, and a lot of things will change.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8739\" name=\"8739\">Since my arrival, I\u2019d been hugged by at least 50 people, some multiple times. It was getting to be a lot. A few hugs had been halfhearted, loose, seemingly obligatory, with a little bro-pat on the back. But the vast majority had been emphatic and genuine, stuffed with import. They were italicized, John Lassiter\u2013level hugs, hugs that aimed for a new transcendent level of meaning. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Yes, you\u2019re sweaty</em>, these hugs seemed to say. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sweaty, too. We\u2019re people. People sweat\u2026</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b792\" name=\"b792\">I couldn\u2019t help noting that all this hugging and positivity just so happens to be a well-documented mind control tactic practiced by all the big religious cults. They call it \u201clove bombing,\u201d and it involves, as one expert <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7cQAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=love+bombing\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7cQAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=love+bombing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">put it</a>, \u201cflooding recruits\u2026with flattery, verbal seduction, affectionate but usually nonsexual touching, and lots of attention to their every remark.\u201d Which isn\u2019t to say I was definitively being love-bombed, just that a break from affection seemed prudent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6971\" name=\"6971\">It was getting late.

He bypassed those, however, and handed me some trousers. \u201cThai fishermen\u2019s pants,\u201d he said. They were black, festooned with a swirl of white paisley, and ludicrously flared in the leg. The waist and laced ankle cuffs were colorfully embroidered. To say that they were baggy in the crotch would be a gross understatement. They were <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">billowy</em>. They were like harem pants on ya ba, the so-called Thai madness pill.

People wore glitter makeup, press-on gemstones, and temporary tattoos. Women layered diaphanous robe-like things over bikinis; men sported skintight pants in exuberant patterns. Professional lighting artists stood at a console controlling an array of lasers, projectors, and smoke machines, bouncing images off spherical paper lanterns hung from the ceiling. Big dispensers of ice water were constantly being refilled.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"d242\" name=\"d242\">A dance floor provides a sort of lab for examining what it means to be\u00a0human.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"0aa8\" name=\"0aa8\">As for alcohol, RISE was strictly BYOB. And interestingly, while drugs were freely shared, booze was preciously guarded and even afforded an odd respect. One night, I left half of a six-pack unattended for hours; nobody touched it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0216\" name=\"0216\">A dance floor provides a sort of lab for examining what it means to be human. If you\u2019re in a certain frame of mind (how many microdoses make a dose again?), you might find yourself noticing things\u200a\u2014\u200athe way people\u2019s bodies move, their gestures evolving over time; the way a particular mannerism can spread almost involuntarily from person to person; the way dancers connect for a moment, locking eyes, matching up their movements, often with a little ironic flourish, and then disconnect and move on so as not to send the wrong message. Or the way they sometimes keep right on dancing together, pressing closer, because in fact that\u2019s precisely the message they are trying to send.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8fbd\" name=\"8fbd\">I danced and tried to discern what I could: the humor, the carnality, the competition, the play, the coded identities taken on and flung aside, the fleeting sensations of dance-floor dominance and submission, the roundelay of connections and flirtations, the sensation of simultaneously objectifying and being objectified, and the precious seconds when you finally quit thinking altogether before slamming back into yourself and losing your rhythm and your mojo and finally your nerve and fleeing the dance floor for a drink.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0527\" name=\"0527\">By midnight, the room was sweltering. Then it got worse. In part, that was because it was rainy and there was nowhere else to go, so nearly 250 people crowded inside at once. Partly it was because the windows had been sealed tight. To enter, one had to go through a side door that led directly down a flight of stairs to the basement\u200a\u2014\u200ano shoes, please!\u200a\u2014\u200aand then ascend via the central staircase. The goal was soundproofing. In previous years, neighbors had called the cops. This year, Lev wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"1817\" name=\"1817\">Given the temperature, I soon found that my lack of costuming was less of an issue than I\u2019d feared. The problem was not that I was wearing a V-neck from Old Navy but that I was wearing a shirt at all. Most of the guys were bare-chested. By 2 a.m., many of the women were, too, though pasties were available in a variety of colors. Eventually, a thoughtful soul danced over and peeled off my top. It sat balled up in my equally superfluous cowboy hat till the party wound down at 9 a.m.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"1426\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"b145\" name=\"b145\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> Saturday afternoon, I was on the wood line, among a dozen or so of my fellow RISErs, passing the firewood, hand to hand, from the neatly stacked piles to the fire pit.

Maybe an orgy would be underway, I thought as I strode barefoot across the grass. I had taken some Molly. The tiki torches seemed to be sporting halos.

It happens, of course. But predatory intent is not tolerated. The community is tight-knit. The love is genuine. Members see themselves as bonded for life.

It\u2019s administered by blowing it deep into the nose with a special pipe called a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tepi.</em> Michal went around the circle, blasting a pinch into each waiting nostril in turn. A few people flinched. Some coughed. \u201cDon\u2019t inhale,\u201d he told me. Then, boom\u200a\u2014\u200ahe hit the right side.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"66d1\" name=\"66d1\">It hurt. I was well out of my comfort zone.

Then he hit the left.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b65\" name=\"5b65\">People say rap\u00e9 is mildly hallucinogenic. They say it can ground you, quiet the mind, provide focus and connection and realignment. It also burns the hell out of your nasal cavities. This will sound weird, but I think I had a vision. It lasted just split second, like when lightning flashes in a horror movie and you see the whole room and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the doll has disappeared</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f225\" name=\"f225\">What I saw, in that millisecond, was a face illuminated <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">inside</em> my own face. Like a skull, an interior face. And then it was gone, and I shrugged it off.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"d8fd\" name=\"d8fd\">Whatever control issues I have, for better and for worse, I got from my\u00a0dad.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"308d\" name=\"308d\">It was time to receive the second gift. Sananga is a kind of eye drops made from a root that is thought to enhance vision (native tribes in the Amazon reportedly use it to improve their hunting prowess), recharge one\u2019s energy fields, and so on. It\u2019s also said to hurt like a motherfucker. But Michal told us that was part of the point, to learn to \u201cignore the signal of the pain. Or just observe it. And breathe through it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a4f5\" name=\"a4f5\">We all lay on our backs like the petals of a great flower, our heads toward the fire, and closed our eyes. One at a time, Michal placed the drops in the creases of our eyelids, advising us to blink when we felt ready. I could hear the gasps of my fellow initiates as the sananga did its work. \u201cAnd eventually, as with any kind of plant medicine,\u201d Michal continued calmly, as my neighbor began squirming, \u201cthe love arrives\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d915\" name=\"d915\">The sananga hurt, but it was manageable, and I leaned into the pain, blinking and even rolling my eyes around a little to coat them more fully.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d64e\" name=\"d64e\">Meanwhile, I kept thinking about the face in the face, something about it\u2026Anyone who\u2019s ever watched old cartoons knows that when a cat\u2019s tail is plugged into an outlet and the cat gets zapped with electricity, you can see the bones inside its body. It was like that. But instead of bones, the face inside my face was actually deeply familiar. It belonged to my dad. Whatever control issues I have, for better and for worse, I got from him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"a9c4\" name=\"a9c4\">One by one, as we recovered and slowly rose, Michal offered some parting words. \u201cAs I always say during ayahuasca ceremonies, this is not the hard part,\u201d he told us. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be brave to drink one or two cups or even more. The real bravery starts on Monday, when you want to change. And I really believe that we are not coming back tomorrow the same way.\u201d</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"71e6\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"c1c1\" name=\"c1c1\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">W</span>riting a hit job<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>on RISE would not be difficult. Some of the spirituality\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cthe woo-woo stuff,\u201d as one attendee called it\u200a\u2014\u200astruck me as silly, and it would undoubtedly be fun to join the dismissive pile-on that has been underway since the New Age movement kicked off in earnest decades ago. The group was mostly white and privileged, and so they\u2019re a very ripe target, especially for a writer who\u2019s also white and privileged and might therefore be especially tempted to draw a clear line between myself and them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"167e\" name=\"167e\">The lack of political engagement could appear egregious, especially given the horrors that have recently been loosed upon the world outside. To contrast three days of drugged-out partying with, for instance, the wails of toddlers ripped from their parents\u2019 arms at the southern border, was admittedly a tempting approach.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5420\" name=\"5420\">But I already knew I was no longer the guy to do that story. Journalism can be factual and still be utterly false. The truth is it\u2019s not easy to build an intentional community. Or even a tribe. The truth is it\u2019s almost impossible. Just about every aspect of our culture mitigates against it. Even with our smartphones always charged and within easy reach, human beings are probably more isolated now than we have ever been. Releasing the kraken of Outrage Twitter would be a simple matter, but what good would it do anyone? If the internet has become a pool of bile, that bile is a sign that something is seriously wrong with us, deep in the gut. That stuff we\u2019ve been coughing up each day, repugnant as it is, is critical evidence of an chronic affliction that is no less agonizing for being shared by everyone we know.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c83e\" name=\"c83e\">So although it would be tempting to be snarky about a bunch of people in costumes dancing around in the mountains, at least they\u2019re trying to live.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"2250\" name=\"2250\">RISE is a bubble. So yes, it\u2019s exclusionary, as all bubbles must be; it\u2019s also very fragile.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\" name=\"c603\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"c9c9\" name=\"c9c9\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">We</span> spent Monday morning pitching in on cleanup, carting hay bales and loading sound gear. Eventually, we said our goodbyes and got our last hugs in. The cars departed one by one.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"befc\" name=\"befc\">The drive home flew by, as drives home so often do. I wrote some notes, but mostly I napped. By the time I looked up, we were in the Bronx. \u201cI had her up to 100 for a good stretch there,\u201d Trevor explained, offering me a Swedish Fish.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b173\" name=\"b173\">I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how the movie version of this story might end, the liberties Hollywood might be tempted to take. Like the horror version where the rap\u00e9 turns me and the other initiates into zombies, and the final scene finds us stumbling pigeon-toed through the fog toward the corner store where the shopkeeper\u2019s children are playing\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d1c6\" name=\"d1c6\">Or the shlock horror version where the Golden Teacher has triggered some sort of psychotic break, and I come home to my son, and he kisses me hello\u2026 shoving his tongue down my throat and right through the back of my skull, because of course he\u2019s a demon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5e1\" name=\"f5e1\">Or maybe best of all, the NC-17 supernatural erotic thriller, wherein I visit the teepee one last time and it\u2019s like a scene out of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Caligula</em>, and someone places a Donald Trump ecstasy tablet on my tongue and pulls me into the writhing mass of naked RISErs, and moments later, as we all approach a crescendo of passion, 44 volcanoes erupt at once, ushering in the End Times.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9335\" name=\"9335\">Cue dubstep track. Roll credits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b9ef\" name=\"b9ef\">The truth is a little more prosaic. As I unpacked my soggy clothes, my tent, and my crushed cowboy hat, I took a moment to press a hooded sweatshirt to my face and inhale the leftover smell of the bonfire. I folded my fisherman\u2019s pants and placed them a drawer. The silver Cheez-It was still dangling from my neck, and I resolved to keep it there for now.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1aee\" name=\"1aee\">Meanwhile, I promised myself to just be better. I belonged to a tribe now\u200a\u2014\u200aat least it seemed I might, if I could manage not to betray my new comrades. But why do any such thing? I\u2019d been shown love, or at least genuine kindness, freely and without reason. People with no sound basis for trusting me had opted to do so anyway.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3d97\" name=\"3d97\">So I resolved instead to embrace the burners\u2019 principles of radical participation and gift giving, and make my own unique offering, such as it is, just telling the story as honestly as I knew how.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8510\" name=\"8510\">I emerged from my room to find my son, home from school, blasting away at something on his computer. It can be hard to hug a teenage boy, but I had practice. I went right in without hesitation and held on tight for a few solid seconds. To my surprise, he didn\u2019t flinch. He may have hugged me back.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c3b\" name=\"7c3b\">I regaled him with a few details of the trip\u200a\u2014\u200acertainly not everything, but enough to let him know I\u2019d been changed by it and that triple rainbows actually exist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8cc0\" name=\"8cc0\">\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4989\" name=\"4989\">\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"748a\" name=\"748a\">It occurred to me to point out that, sometimes at least, we make our own luck.

The fact that she\u2019d never worn it\u200a\u2014\u200anot even once\u200a\u2014\u200ahas irked me ever since. When I\u2019d purchased it (from a little shop in Williamsburg, naturally), I still entertained the notion that a midlife crisis was something the two of us might share, as a couple.

Another way is by occasionally exploiting my work as a journalist in order to go on absurd adventures.

I met people from Poland and Serbia, France, the UK, Italy, Lebanon, Japan, Israel, Brazil, Greece, and Iran, most of them in their late twenties and thirties.

At 46, he was older than most of the RISE members. He was about my height (5&#39;5&quot;) but seemed taller, with penetrating blue eyes, chiseled dimples, and gray hair trimmed close to his scalp. He was wearing harem pants, and over his well-muscled torso he\u2019d slung a leather holster with two pockets, in which he carried his phone and other necessities.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1d32\\\" id=\\\"1d32\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cI feel like you\u2019re going to do something great,\u201d Lev told me as he led me toward the bonfire. \u201cI know we can trust you.\u201d Clearly he hadn\u2019t read a lot of trend pieces.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b153\\\" id=\\\"b153\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eLev looked a little like cult leader, but he didn\u2019t sound like one.

My partner was Nanette. She appeared to be in her thirties and had a friendly face and a big smile and bangs, and she wore her hair up in a high ponytail. We settled in opposite each other. Then, as instructed, we proceeded to gaze, silently, into one another\u2019s eyes. And keep gazing, long past the point of discomfort, past the giggles, past the careful study of one another\u2019s features (Nanette wears a lot of mascara), past the terrifying moment when we knew we\u2019d been \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eseen\\x3c/em\\x3e, in all our innocence and childlike fear and deep existential sadness, past the next round of giggles, and even past the boredom and the moment when we silently agreed, \u201cWe got this.

On the second day, I became preoccupied with the question. I\u2019d heard whispers about RISE well before pitching the story: that it was basically a sex party, an orgy, a safe space for polyamory and other forms of erotic self-expression and radical openness. But Lev hadn\u2019t mentioned anything like that, and I hadn\u2019t asked. \u201cIt will be quite an experience\u2026,\u201d he\u2019d said, leaving it to me to fill that ellipsis with whatever my mind conjured up. What it conjured up was basically \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eEyes Wide Shut\\x3c/em\\x3e meets season two of \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eGirls\\x3c/em\\x3e.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3020\\\" id=\\\"3020\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOn my first night, I\u2019d gazed over at the cone of fabric, glowing there in the middle of the field, and decided: That\u2019s where it happens.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a21e\\\" id=\\\"a21e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eParticipatory journalism was the point of the assignment, but just how participatory was a question I had left somewhat open. Drugs seemed somewhat essential, and over the course of the weekend, I would willingly ingest LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, ketamine, cannabis, Adderall, and booze. (The one thing I declined was cocaine, mostly because I\u2019m queasy about the human toll of the trade itself.) As for sex, that was a tougher question. Yes, I am married with three lovely children. But if something was going on in that teepee, I figured it was my job to find out what.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"45d0\\\" id=\\\"45d0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThat said, I wasn\u2019t ready for an orgy, or even a cuddle puddle. In fact, though I\u2019d been at RISE less than a day, I already longed to escape, if only for an hour. It was the hugs. Hugging was the standard greeting at RISE: bear hugs and clinches, double-sided shoulder rubs, affectionate \u201cbring it in\u201d headlocks, and gentle embraces accompanied by little fingertip caresses. \u201cWhat I love about this community,\u201d one woman told me, \u201cis how much you see men hugging each other.

It was getting to be a lot. A few hugs had been halfhearted, loose, seemingly obligatory, with a little bro-pat on the back. But the vast majority had been emphatic and genuine, stuffed with import. They were italicized, John Lassiter\u2013level hugs, hugs that aimed for a new transcendent level of meaning. \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eYes, you\u2019re sweaty\\x3c/em\\x3e, these hugs seemed to say. \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eIt\u2019s okay.

Or the way they sometimes keep right on dancing together, pressing closer, because in fact that\u2019s precisely the message they are trying to send.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8fbd\\\" id=\\\"8fbd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eI danced and tried to discern what I could: the humor, the carnality, the competition, the play, the coded identities taken on and flung aside, the fleeting sensations of dance-floor dominance and submission, the roundelay of connections and flirtations, the sensation of simultaneously objectifying and being objectified, and the precious seconds when you finally quit thinking altogether before slamming back into yourself and losing your rhythm and your mojo and finally your nerve and fleeing the dance floor for a drink.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0527\\\" id=\\\"0527\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBy midnight, the room was sweltering.

It happens, of course. But predatory intent is not tolerated. The community is tight-knit. The love is genuine. Members see themselves as bonded for life.

The fire was going. Michal Scheffler, a DJ-turned-shaman, had gifts to bestow. \u201cThese medicines take you out of your comfort zone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you never go out of your comfort zone, you\u2019re trying to go against one of the biggest laws of nature, which is the law of impermanence.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2830\\\" id=\\\"2830\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhile another member of the group plucked an \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3embira,\\x3c/em\\x3e or thumb harp, Michal led us in a brief guided meditation, inviting us to close our eyes, place our hands over our chests, and imagine our heart-soul glowing with sacred fire.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4b6e\\\" id=\\\"4b6e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cPlease project gratitude toward your heart-soul right now,\u201d he said. He was extremely handsome. He\u2019d been a model and a brand ambassador before moving to Panama and becoming an apprentice shaman. \u201cGratitude for this moment, for this time, for a gift of receiving. For being a community. For being patient. For learning from our mistakes and errors. You feel the flame is growing and your palms are getting warmer\u2026\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bd59\\\" id=\\\"bd59\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe first gift was rap\u00e9. A form of snuff used by indigenous groups in Brazil, rap\u00e9 is a fine powder made from special tobacco and other ingredients. It\u2019s administered by blowing it deep into the nose with a special pipe called a \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3etepi.\\x3c/em\\x3e Michal went around the circle, blasting a pinch into each waiting nostril in turn. A few people flinched. Some coughed. \u201cDon\u2019t inhale,\u201d he told me. Then, boom\u200a\u2014\u200ahe hit the right side.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"66d1\\\" id=\\\"66d1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt hurt. I was well out of my comfort zone. What felt like a river of tears poured from my eye and down my face. Then he hit the left.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5b65\\\" id=\\\"5b65\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3ePeople say rap\u00e9 is mildly hallucinogenic. They say it can ground you, quiet the mind, provide focus and connection and realignment. It also burns the hell out of your nasal cavities. This will sound weird, but I think I had a vision. It lasted just split second, like when lightning flashes in a horror movie and you see the whole room and \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ethe doll has disappeared\\x3c/em\\x3e.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f225\\\" id=\\\"f225\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhat I saw, in that millisecond, was a face illuminated \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3einside\\x3c/em\\x3e my own face. Like a skull, an interior face. And then it was gone, and I shrugged it off.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"d8fd\\\" id=\\\"d8fd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhatever control issues I have, for better and for worse, I got from my\u00a0dad.\\x3c/blockquote\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"308d\\\" id=\\\"308d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\\\"\\x3eIt was time to receive the second gift. Sananga is a kind of eye drops made from a root that is thought to enhance vision (native tribes in the Amazon reportedly use it to improve their hunting prowess), recharge one\u2019s energy fields, and so on. It\u2019s also said to hurt like a motherfucker. But Michal told us that was part of the point, to learn to \u201cignore the signal of the pain. Or just observe it. And breathe through it.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a4f5\\\" id=\\\"a4f5\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWe all lay on our backs like the petals of a great flower, our heads toward the fire, and closed our eyes. One at a time, Michal placed the drops in the creases of our eyelids, advising us to blink when we felt ready. I could hear the gasps of my fellow initiates as the sananga did its work. \u201cAnd eventually, as with any kind of plant medicine,\u201d Michal continued calmly, as my neighbor began squirming, \u201cthe love arrives\u2026\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d915\\\" id=\\\"d915\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe sananga hurt, but it was manageable, and I leaned into the pain, blinking and even rolling my eyes around a little to coat them more fully.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d64e\\\" id=\\\"d64e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMeanwhile, I kept thinking about the face in the face, something about it\u2026Anyone who\u2019s ever watched old cartoons knows that when a cat\u2019s tail is plugged into an outlet and the cat gets zapped with electricity, you can see the bones inside its body. It was like that. But instead of bones, the face inside my face was actually deeply familiar. It belonged to my dad. Whatever control issues I have, for better and for worse, I got from him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a9c4\\\" id=\\\"a9c4\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eOne by one, as we recovered and slowly rose, Michal offered some parting words. \u201cAs I always say during ayahuasca ceremonies, this is not the hard part,\u201d he told us. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be brave to drink one or two cups or even more. The real bravery starts on Monday, when you want to change. And I really believe that we are not coming back tomorrow the same way.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"71e6\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c1c1\\\" id=\\\"c1c1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eW\\x3c/span\\x3eriting a hit job\\x3cstrong class=\\\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\\\"\\x3e \\x3c/strong\\x3eon RISE would not be difficult.

The group was mostly white and privileged, and so they\u2019re a very ripe target, especially for a writer who\u2019s also white and privileged and might therefore be especially tempted to draw a clear line between myself and them.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"167e\\\" id=\\\"167e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe lack of political engagement could appear egregious, especially given the horrors that have recently been loosed upon the world outside.

Journalism can be factual and still be utterly false. The truth is it\u2019s not easy to build an intentional community. Or even a tribe. The truth is it\u2019s almost impossible. Just about every aspect of our culture mitigates against it. Even with our smartphones always charged and within easy reach, human beings are probably more isolated now than we have ever been. Releasing the kraken of Outrage Twitter would be a simple matter, but what good would it do anyone? If the internet has become a pool of bile, that bile is a sign that something is seriously wrong with us, deep in the gut. That stuff we\u2019ve been coughing up each day, repugnant as it is, is critical evidence of an chronic affliction that is no less agonizing for being shared by everyone we know.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c83e\\\" id=\\\"c83e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo although it would be tempting to be snarky about a bunch of people in costumes dancing around in the mountains, at least they\u2019re trying to live.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2250\\\" id=\\\"2250\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eRISE is a bubble.

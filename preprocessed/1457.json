{"content": "An example of what is currently wrong with chemistry culture, even though it is dated. Future chemistry faculty will have to be twice as smart, work with twice the efficiency, and reach the correct positions of influence if they want this type of unhealthy cultural attitudes to finally be put to rest. This is my goal at least. Update 1: Guido Koch now . Update 2: The underlying macroeconomic cause for why professors can get away with this behavior . Update 3: This story has really struck a cord, thank you for sharing this link and supplying our first 20,000 visitor day! Update 4: A transcribed letter from Robert Tjian From now on, I or someone designated by me will take attendance at group meetings starting at 9:10 am. If you are not there, I will not sign your salary sheets. Also, if you haven\u2019t noticed the number of people working on weekends and nights in the lab is the worst I\u2019ve seen in my 17 years. The frequency of vacation, time taken off and other non-lab activities is bordering on the ridiculous. In case you forgot, the standard amount of time you are supposed to take is 2 weeks a year total, including Christmas. If there isn\u2019t a substantial improvement in the next few months, I\u2019ll have to think of some draconian measures to \u201cmotivate\u201d you. I also want to say that the average lab citizenship and community spirit of keeping the lab in functioning order is at an all-time low. Few people seem to care about fixing broken equipment and making sure things in the lab run smoothly. If the lab were extremely productive and everyone was totally focused on their work, I might understand the slovenliness but productivity is abysmal and if we continue along this path we will surely reach mediocrity in no time. Finally, those of you who are \u201clame ducks\u201d because you have a job and are thinking of your own nibs, so long as you are here you are still full-fledged members of this lab, which means participating in all aspects of the lab (i.e. group meetings, Asilomar, postdoc seminars, etc.) I realize that this memo won\u2019t solve all the problems. so I am going to schedule a meeting with each one of you starting this Saturday and Sunday and continuing on weekends until I\u2019ve had a chance to speak with everyone and to give you a formal evaluation. Sign up for an appointment time on the sheet outside my door. This is the first time I\u2019ve had to actually write a memo of this type and I hope it\u2019s the last time. Robert Tjian Update 5: Erick Carreira responds in an interview with Christopher Shea from The Boston Globe, vaguely claims the letter may have been a joke (link: Chemist who ordered night and weekend work replies to critics ). Selected quote below: I wonder whether you would think it fair to be judged on the basis of a letter 14 years old, especially when the comments and rash judgments are made without knowledge of the context or the circumstances surrounding the individuals involved. Indeed how does anyone out who is so quick to pass judgement and who is coming to conclusions know that it is not part of a 14-year old joke (or satire as you state) that backfired? \u2026 Update 6: Comparatively tame letters from Paul Gassman and Albert Meyers , but they have some good information in them about standard expectations. If you have similar letters you would like to share send them in. Any identifying information can be removed upon request.

even though it is dated.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-4405\" height=\"772\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/a40kI.png\" title=\"Deeply Wrong Chemistry\" width=\"564\"/></p>\n<p>Future chemistry faculty will have to be twice as smart, work with twice the efficiency, and reach the correct positions of influence if they want this type of unhealthy cultural attitudes to finally be put to rest. This is my goal at least.</p>\n<p>Update 1: <a href=\"http://ch.linkedin.com/pub/guido-koch/7/58b/a79\">Guido Koch now</a>.</p>\n<p>Update 2: <a href=\"http://www.miller-mccune.com/science/the-real-science-gap-16191/?\">The underlying macroeconomic cause for why professors can get away with this behavior</a>.</p>\n<p>Update 3: This story has really struck a cord, thank you for sharing this link and supplying our first 20,000 visitor day!</p>\n<p>Update 4: A transcribed letter from Robert Tjian</p>\n<blockquote><p>From now on, I or someone designated by me will take attendance at group meetings starting at 9:10 am. If you are not there, I will not sign your salary sheets. Also, if you haven\u2019t noticed the number of people working on weekends and nights in the lab is the worst I\u2019ve seen in my 17 years. The frequency of vacation, time taken off and other non-lab activities is bordering on the ridiculous. In case you forgot, the standard amount of time you are supposed to take is 2 weeks a year total, including Christmas. If there isn\u2019t a substantial improvement in the next few months, I\u2019ll have to think of some draconian measures to \u201cmotivate\u201d you. I also want to say that the average lab citizenship and community spirit of keeping the lab in functioning order is at an all-time low. Few people seem to care about fixing broken equipment and making sure things in the lab run smoothly. If the lab were extremely productive and everyone was totally focused on their work, I might understand the slovenliness but productivity is abysmal and if we continue along this path we will surely reach mediocrity in no time.</p>\n<p>Finally, those of you who are \u201clame ducks\u201d because you have a job and are thinking of your own nibs, so long as you are here you are still full-fledged members of this lab, which means participating in all aspects of the lab (i.e. group meetings, Asilomar, postdoc seminars, etc.)</p>\n<p>I realize that this memo won\u2019t solve all the problems. so I am going to schedule a meeting with each one of you starting this Saturday and Sunday and continuing on weekends until I\u2019ve had a chance to speak with everyone and to give you a formal evaluation. Sign up for an appointment time on the sheet outside my door.</p>\n<p>This is the first time I\u2019ve had to actually write a memo of this type and I hope<br/>\nit\u2019s the last time.</p>\n<p>Robert Tjian</p></blockquote>\n<p>Update 5: Erick Carreira responds in an interview with Christopher Shea from The Boston Globe, vaguely claims the letter may have been a joke (link: <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2010/06/is_this_whats_w.html\">Chemist who ordered night and weekend work replies to critics</a>). Selected quote below:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I wonder whether you would think it fair to be judged on the basis of a letter 14 years old, especially when the comments and rash judgments are made without knowledge of the context or the circumstances surrounding the individuals involved. Indeed how does anyone out who is so quick to pass judgement and who is coming to conclusions know that it is not part of a 14-year old joke (or satire as you state) that backfired? \u2026</p></blockquote>\n<p>Update 6: <a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Gassman-and-Meyers.pdf\"> Comparatively tame letters from Paul Gassman and Albert Meyers</a>, but they have some good information in them about standard expectations.</p>\n<p>If you have similar letters you would like to share send them in.

(and if you have to TA because your boss is low on money, your income doesn\u2019t change but you lose out on 20 hours a week which should be spent in the lab).  When I started in 2000, the salary was $18,000. It has improved, but given that the expectations are 60-80 hours a week minimum \u2013 you do the math.  Of course, consideration has to be given to the cost of living in the area.  24K a year on Long Island or around SF gets you next to nothing.  However \u2013 the idea that you get paid to get your degree is nice \u2013 we do not end up with the massive school loans that MDs do.  </p>\n<p>Postdoc salaries are highly variable \u2013 the worst I heard was an offer for $28K a year at a major university in Texas (2006).  NIH has adopted a minimal salary level of about $37K for anyone on an NIH fellowship, and some professors do follow that standard of their free will.  At the upper extreme are a few competitive postdoc fellowships that pay close to $100K (many national labs offer these).  Postdoc pay in industry \u2013 I have no idea.</p>\n<p>As a postdoc, you also have to consider benefits, if there are any.  No such thing as vacation time, sick leave, etc \u2013 it is all up to your boss.  And health insurance?  At most universities, if you are paid through your adviser\u2019s grant, you are considered an employee and get coverage.  The second you get your own funding via a fellowship (which all advisers want you to do of course, and it is good for your career), you kiss that health insurance goodbye, as well as any other benefits you had through the university.  Some fellowship are now offering basic coverage \u2013 I was lucky in that regard \u2013 but not all. </p>\n<p>You have to be passionate about what you are doing or you are not going to put up with this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n</div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-5\" id=\"li-comment-12001\">\n<div id=\"comment-12001\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\"><a class=\"url\" href=\"http://www.thecarnivalnoir.com/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Haystack</a></cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12001\">\n                On June 27, 2010 @ 10:45 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I went to Cornell for Sociology.

Look into a regular lab and you will probably find more foreigners (mainly Asians and Europeans) doing the job that Americans don\u2019t want to do because tuitions are are high and the post-doc salary is not worth mentioning. Many of those foreigners earned their PhD degree in their home country and work in the US for cheap labor and the US government hasn\u2019t spent a penny on them. So if you want Americans doing the job, you should write NIH a letter suggesting to increase our salary to 100K, so it becomes more attractive for american students.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to sony\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=11898#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-11898\", \"11898\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"li-comment-11945\">\n<div id=\"comment-11945\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Mike</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-11945\">\n                On June 25, 2010 @ 2:28 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>US universities are using foreign grad students because there are so few domestic students going for PhDs in these fields.

And grad students are needed to do the work in the lab, and to teach the undergrads in the teaching labs.<br/>\nWhen I went to FAU in 2003, I got 16 grants a year as a teaching assistant, and I had to pay my own insurance mandated by the school (which did not cover anything -hence the increasing debt on my credit cards), and tuition fees. How many Americans do you think we had in the program? I only went, because I didn\u2019t know better; I was told it was plenty of money, and I believed it. (Moron, I know.) Maybe some people from India and China knew, but didn\u2019t mind (five of my Indian friends lived in a 2 bedroom apartment, and mostly ate rice\u2026 and they complained, too.) But one thing\u2019s certain: 16 grants for years is not enough to live on. I still have my credit cards to pay back -because, you know, as a non-American, I was not able to get a student loan.<br/>\nNot to mention the fact that American science was always depending on foreigners \u2013 starting from the nuclear power to the space race and beyond.<br/>\nSo don\u2019t be daft saying nationalistic crap like that. If all foreign-born scientist left the country, it would be a sorry place indeed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to andras\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=11973#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-11973\", \"11973\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even depth-2\" id=\"li-comment-11986\">\n<div id=\"comment-11986\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">sally</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-11986\">\n                On June 26, 2010 @ 4:33 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Where in the world do you get these figures?

I can\u2019t imagine Carriera didn\u2019t let him know at the interview what was expected.  I\u2019m willing to bet that passive/aggressive (or just plain aggressive) remarks were made to this postdoc as well from other members of the group or Carriera himself prior to the drafting of this letter.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to J-bone\" class=\"comment-reply-link\"

doctoral and post-doctoral positions are classified as \u201ceducation\u201d rather than \u201cemployment\u201d.  Even at prestigious universities such as Harvard, the school uses this loophole to avoid payment of benefits and employment taxes, leaving graduate students to pay the full burden themselves (or face the consequences). Health care is of course required even for students, at least in some places, but minimal \u201cstudent grade\u201d plans are provided at the students\u2019 expense.  Great care is taken never to treat the grad/postdoctoral staff as a legal employee, because that would require compliance with tax and work-environment implications they wish to avoid. </p>\n<p>Sadly, this kind of hazing remains a cultural \u201cbadge of honor\u201d among many older faculty, and it will I think be very difficult to uproot.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Michael\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=11894#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-11894\", \"11894\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-11896\">\n<div id=\"comment-11896\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">IdahoEv</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-11896\">\n                On June 23, 2010 @ 4:12 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>While I was in grad school at \u2018tech I had a friend who worked for Carreira.

This is not productivity, it is greed and lack of accountability.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Della Stevens\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=11897#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-11897\", \"11897\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-11900\">\n<div id=\"comment-11900\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Verpa</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-11900\">\n                On June 23, 2010 @ 7:19 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Just because it seems to be driving a bit of traffic:</p>\n<p>Reddit comment thread:<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/chzp2/something_deeply_wrong_with_chemistry_culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/chzp2/something_deeply_wrong_with_chemistry_culture/</a></p>\n<p>and HackerNews thread (loads of comments, ill informed they may be):<br/>\n<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1455037\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1455037</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Verpa\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=11900#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-11900\", \"11900\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-11901\">\n<div id=\"comment-11901\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">William Penrose</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-11901\">\n                On June 23, 2010 @ 7:32 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>For years before I retired, I believed that anyone who\u2019d go into academic chemistry as a career had to have rocks in their head.

Relax. It\u2019s OK. \ud83d\ude42 Your internet telepathy senses have deceived you this time, I\u2019m not bitter at all. <i>Zero percent</i>, if you can buy that. I knew what I was getting into, I was never sure I was going to stay till the end or get a science job afterwards, I never worked 80 hours a week, and I left when I wanted. Like Einstein said, <i>science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one\u2019s living at it</i>. I\u2019m happy I had my time to play around with chemicals and microbes, and I\u2019m happy I can play around with other things now.</p>\n<p>But if anyone here wants to know how I feel, I do get a little annoyed by people getting stuck on the emotional aspect, pigeonholing me, trying to read between the lines, jumping to conclusions, projecting their feelings onto me, or whatever the deal is. It\u2019s totally OK to assume whatever you want about me, my agenda or my emotions. As long as you can abstract from all that and move on to address the premises and the logic of the argument itself. Because these are the only things that have any bearing on its validity and the truth/falsity of its conclusions. I could be angry, happy, good, evil, insane or from another planet. So what, who cares? It would be nice to stay on topic and have a sensible discussion. We can always talk all about our feelings later. Just kidding, I\u2019ll probably pass. ))</p>\n<p>I might try switching my argumentative style to a less aggressive and \u201cranty\u201d one to see if that works better. Or not, because it could get really boring, even to myself. I\u2019m not joking though, and I am always interested in any real counter-arguments anyone might have. But it\u2019s fine either way.

I was in Physics, not Chemistry, and I worked in astrophysics with Tom Soifer.</p>\n<p>Grad school was at times very depressing, and I did work a lot, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as this.  I still played in an orchestra the entire time was there (except for the semester when I had a broken wrist).  About every year and a half I was in a play.  (I did stage direction for a musical revue, and I played Brutus in \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d.)  My advisor wasn\u2019t completely thrilled about everything else I did, I suspect, but he never criticized me for it.  (I didn\u2019t do plays constantly; they did take too much time and energy.)</p>\n<p>Most of the time I was probably working more than 40 hours a week, and certainly in my last year I easily topped 50 almost every week, but I didn\u2019t really keep track of it.  (What\u2019s more, when you spend a couple of hours one afternoon sitting around kibbitzing with other grad students about random things, you shouldn\u2019t count that as \u201cwork\u201d \u2014 so counting up the hours is tough.)  And, yes, I went through a couple of periods of questioning the meaning of my life, given that the grad student lifestyle (even though I *did* have a life) is a very tough one.  But I was not at all a slave or an indentured servant.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when I was a post-doc at LBNL in Berkeley, there were some weeks where I worked 80 hours.  (I was with the Supernova Cosmology project, and if it was the week of a supernova search, I lived and breathed my job.)  But most regular weeks were far closer to 40-50 hours a week.  I remained active in a local community theater, and had time to meet and marry my wife.</p>\n<p>Chemistry may be more killer cutthroat than astrophysics.

The gray-area abuse is using grant money to stay at fancy hotels for conferences and other luxury services. Is a professor who spends 10 grand on a new work computer with 5 monitors misappropriating funds if he also will do some minor computer modelling work on it too?

When you meet the people who are on academic career arcs one thing you will notice is that their research is their life.  It\u2019s what they are and what they do.

If you do not have the personality to make that committment, then you are going to hate academic research and you will probably fail at it.

People at my level of play don\u2019t make big bucks, don\u2019t (generally) take ourselves that seriously, and don\u2019t believe in burning people out.  I think this 80+ hr/week work schedule is very counter-productive.</p>\n<p>I ask my students to work 40-50 hrs/week, and they are more productive than any two individuals who work grueling hours \u2013 largely because they are well-rested and relatively happy.  I will ask my students to save some energy for a sprint before a grant deadline or conference.  That generally means an 80 hr week, but I watch my students for signs of fatigue.  If they are fatigued, they represent a safety liability and are likely to just screw things up.</p>\n<p>I get about 5 papers per year from two grad students and some undergrads.  Most 10-person groups are lucky to get that.  The key thing I ask for my students to do each day is to \u2018move the ball forward\u2019.  I would have to say that 9 out of 10 days in the lab result in a move forward in research for us.  I think being a bit more relaxed and staying focused is a lot better than a shotgun approach to projects.  Heck \u2013 it even saves money in reagents.</p>\n<p>Sometimes working in a smaller lab where the PI has the ability to pick good projects, place people, and publish regularly is a much better education than working in a sociopathic factory group.  I think that, as graduate students seek a higher quality of life, this may become a more favorable choice.  </p>\n<p>Think about it this way:  If a graduate student represents 25-50% of the PI\u2019s workforce, he or she has better leverage in attaining a better quality of life.  The key is to pick a PI who is on the upswing and runs a small group rather than on the downswing.  Graduate school doesn\u2019t have to be as punishing as the short-sighted tyrants want to make it.  I\u2019ve never understood this behavior, but it is somewhat pervasive.  If PIs can\u2019t keep chemistry fun, then why should anyone go to grad school in chemistry?  I think a few of us (actually, maybe the majority of us) are at least trying to keep it fun rather than grinding souls into dust.  Let\u2019s hope there\u2019s something like Karma, eh?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Matt\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12008#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12008\", \"12008\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"post pingback\">\n<p>Pingback: <a class=\"url\" href=\"http://mrtopp.com/2010/06/28/the-morning-coffee-with-methane-and-moonwalks/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Mr. Topp and the Big Bad Blog \u00bb The morning coffee with methane and moonwalks</a></p>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-12012\">\n<div id=\"comment-12012\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">David A.

They are, in no particular order, as follows: </p>\n<p>(1) I know Eric and can imagine he sets a pretty high bar. One must, however, keep in mind that although he was a tenured professor, he was still quite young at the time he penned this letter. Young professors are driven\u2013whether out of ambition, youthful enthusiasm, or tendencies to miss the shades of grey\u2013they are all pretty jacked up. I personally worked for an assistant professor as an undergrad and as a grad student and found the experiences remarkable in the most positive way. Working for young professors has its highs and lows, but I highly support it (and have publicly stated this to every entering class of our students since the dawn of time.)</p>\n<p>(2) Cal Tech is a truly wonderful environment to learn chemistry. There was (and still is) plenty of choice. If I had a do-over, it would be in my top three choices.</p>\n<p>(3) When picking an advisor, you have to ask the key questions and listen to the answers. As an advisor, I have essentially no insight into the personality of a prospective graduate student. The prospective graduate student, by contrast, has ample data on me, how I run my group, and what I really expect. The choice is largely in the hands of the students. </p>\n<p>(4) With that said, the system does leave an awful lot up to the individual whims of the advisors. I don\u2019t see a good alternative. There are people I would never in a million years work for. The good news is that nobody makes me work for them.</p>\n<p>(5) Take a look at other professions such as medicine and law. Those early years of training are a period of enormous demand. Why the medical community insists on 26 hr shifts is beyond me, but they do. Young lawyers often bust their chops. The new workers do a lot of heavy lifting. And, most importantly, it is a paid education. The comparison of graduate school to a job is way off the mark. Including tuition, the average student is arguably paid &gt;$60K per year.</p>\n<p>(6) Synthesis has a reputation for being particularly demanding. I guess the argument is that finishing a synthesis must be akin to taking Omaha Beach, but it is not clear why this is unique to synthesis.</p>\n<p>(7) I tell my students what I expect of them but then refuse to beat it out of them. Sometimes they achieve greatness and other times they squander opportunity altogether. </p>\n<p>(8) I happen to have also served as some form of coach in five sports, including two at the collegiate level. Show me a championship team, and I will show you coach who demanded enormous commitment of the players. Am I letting my students down by telling them what I expect and then letting them achieve less? I suspect the answer is yes in some cases. My management style is what I want; seems selfish in that context. Would I be more prominent if I leaned in on my students? Seems likely to me. Would I be happier? Probably not. I like what I do and how I do it.</p>\n<p>(9) I did a detailed analysis of how our students performed in graduate school and compared it to their admissions stats. The admission stats are all well known. Analysis of performance is subjective but carried out as follows: I gave each of my colleagues a decade\u2019s list of students (1995-2005) and asked them to rank them 1 (best) to 10 ((weakest). I asked them to imagine they were all outside their door waiting to join the group: What order would you take them into your group given what you now know about them. I ended up with kids listed according to decile. I then compared the performance in graduate school with gender, GREs, and GPA. Curiously, there as absolutely no correlation whatsoever. It was what noise across the decile. I think on a national scale there would be a correlation, but not within the slice that we take. The uplifting conclusion is that the students arrive and somehow, they spread out into a bell curve of performance irrespective of their backgrounds. I think performance in graduate school is a choice. Some chose to really make something special (possibly by choosing the correct advisor for their personal needs), and some chose to just put in their time. (The bottom deciles probably had taken the wrong fork in the road when they went to graduate school.) I believe you guys control your destinies. </p>\n<p>I guess I should stop there. It\u2019s late and I have papers and proposals to write!</p>\n<p>Best regards<br/>\nDave</p>\n<p>David B.

There is a lot demanded of scientists these days and everyone is grasping for funding. Our funding comes from a number of sources and my impression is that to fulfill the requirements that come with the funding, it usually means deviating from your main research (at least a little). There is a lot of work making what you\u2019re doing relevant to General Motors or Hasbro or Glaxo or whoever your funding may be coming from. </p>\n<p>Science also kind of breeds the type of person who logically knows that the work can be done and that you can work on nights and weekends but who fails to factor in a human element. Even if one professor understands it \u2013 it is competition fair and simple, and to stay on top, I think the profs get antsy about the amount of work they\u2019re putting out.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to N\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12027#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12027\", \"12027\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-12031\">\n<div id=\"comment-12031\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">J-bone</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12031\">\n                On June 29, 2010 @ 12:44 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Well, this has blown up into quite the issue, hasn\u2019t it?

Such is the consequence of the digital age I suppose, people can be as immature and stupid as they want behind the veil of anonymity the internet provides.</p>\n<p>I commented earlier on the Carreira letter so I won\u2019t re-hash that, but I do agree with him that context is important to really fully assess who was at fault (probably both of them).</p>\n<p>Tijan\u2019s letter might bother me if I hadn\u2019t been involved in exactly that situation.  My grad research group became inhabited by some individuals with toxic personalities and it dragged down lab morale, which then brought productivity down.

I too lived the evenings and weekends life of a graduate student, and from there moved to a tenure track appointment at a fine public university. As an assistant professor, guess what? I worked evenings and weekends to develop a research program and achieve promotion and tenure. That was followed by an offer to be a department chair where, you guessed it, I worked weekends and evenings. Following that I accepted a position as dean at an excellent public university, and you know the rest, I worked weekends and evenings (plus state and national holidays). The U.S. university system may be the only remaining sector where our country holds global primacy. Is there a high personal cost? Yes. Is it stresssful and competitive? Yes. Do some very talented people get lost in the shuffle? Yes. But that is our system, it produces the finest research in biological and physical sciences in the world and it isn\u2019t going to change. You want to join a law firm and try for partnership\u2026get used to weekends and evenings. You want to be a successful small business person\u2026.get used to weekends and evenings. You want to be a successful farmer\u2026get used to weekends and evenings. It isn\u2019t \u201cslavery\u201d if people know the expectations in advance and make an informed choice. Stuff the hyperbole about slavery and livestock in graduate science education. If you want a graduate program with tea and sympathy try art history, where you will be spared the prospect of a job working weekends and evenings. In fact, spared the prospect of any job at all.</p>\n<p>CJ here again. Say it with me, folks: USA! USA!

But the letters from Albert Meyers are nowhere near that level.  In fact I think they are quite reasonable.  I think it removes credibility from the criticism of Carreira\u2019s (admittedly insane) letter to lump Albert Meyer\u2019s letter in with it.  Not every letter criticizing students or telling them that they are not meeting expectations is bad.  Only those with unfair criticisms or crazy expectations are bad.  For instance, Carreira expects students to work nearly every night and weekend, which is crazy.  Meyers expects work on nights and weekends when \u201cthe position occasionally demands it\u201d, which is perfectly fine.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Dave\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12036#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12036\", \"12036\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n<ul class=\"children\">\n<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-mitch bypostauthor odd alt depth-2\" id=\"li-comment-12041\">\n<div id=\"comment-12041\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\"><a class=\"url\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\">mitch</a></cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12041\">\n                On June 30, 2010 @ 5:32 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I agree, the wording of the update has been changed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to mitch\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12041#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12041\", \"12041\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-12042\">\n<div id=\"comment-12042\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Larry</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12042\">\n                On June 30, 2010 @ 5:48 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I sent the Gassman and Meyers letter in to Mitch. I think that they both detail reasonable expectations in the lab. When I worked for Gassman as a postdoc, I knew what was expected. He was firm, but fair; when I was there he had already made his reputation, in fact I was told that he had mellowed somewhat. But, he always expected hard work from you, with minimal intervention from him, especially as a postdoc. Nothing wrong with that. As part of the deal, he backed you up when it was time to find a job. In my lab there was a grad student who I knew wouldn\u2019t make it..came in late, had coffee, went around socializing all day\u2026she was gone by the second year. </p>\n<p>Gassman really cared about doing things right, we had to write quarterly reports (by hand, this was before everyone had a computer) and he would hand correct all the spelling and grammatical mistakes we all made, including the proper way to write up experimental details.

Having graduated just last year, I can tell you at least that most professors are very up front with incoming students about the time commitment required of them.  It always shocked me to talk to 2nd year students who\u2019d say, \u201cWow, I never realized I\u2019d be working until midnight regularly.\u201d  That\u2019s how it goes!  Yes, it\u2019s hellish from time to time, and yes some advisors can be jerks, but for many of us who got through it, it was a rewarding experience that we wouldn\u2019t trade for anything.  You get out of it what you put into it.</p>\n<p>I am annoyed at Carriera for implying that this letter was a joke.  Many students who worked with him in the early years received letters like this, and the mean-spiritedness of \u201cyou are easily replaceable\u201d is unacceptable and unprofessional.  Perhaps he has changed in the last 14 years, although I hope for his students\u2019 sake that change is more than \u201cno longer putting incriminating comments in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p>And thank you, Prof. Collum, for taking the time to comment on this page and providing a reasonable perspective from the professors\u2019 side of the equation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Andrew\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12043#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12043\", \"12043\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-12052\">\n<div id=\"comment-12052\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Dave</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12052\">\n                On June 30, 2010 @ 6:09 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>BTW-There are two Dave\u2019s posting here.

I find myself in the lab working 4-5 hours most weekend days as well. I feel like I\u2019m becoming a crazy person who doesn\u2019t know how to have fun. I love research and time flies when I\u2019m in the lab, but I can\u2019t even take a 4 day vacation without receiving flak. My mentor asked me this friday if I was going work 30 hours over the weekend to make up for it even after I worked 12 hour days the previous week so as not to \u201cget behind\u201d. I said, probably not but i\u2019ll try. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just inexperienced, but when I stretch myself so thin, my productivity suffers. I\u2019m trying to decide whether or not I can live this life for 5 more years especially if I can\u2019t even have any fun this summer without feeling guilty.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to J.chem2010\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12068#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12068\", \"12068\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n<ul class=\"children\">\n<li class=\"comment even depth-2\" id=\"li-comment-12069\">\n<div id=\"comment-12069\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Verpa</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12069\">\n                On July 3, 2010 @ 11:50 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Just FYI, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way \u2026 there are plenty of good researchers out there who accept a reasonable work-life balance ( say 50 h/weeks ).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Verpa\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12069#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12069\", \"12069\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"li-comment-12070\">\n<div id=\"comment-12070\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\"><a class=\"url\" href=\"http://chemjobber.blogspot.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Chemjobber</a></cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12070\">\n                On July 3, 2010 @ 2:19 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but this seems a little excessive to expect out of a summer student.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Chemjobber\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12070#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12070\", \"12070\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even depth-2\" id=\"li-comment-12072\">\n<div id=\"comment-12072\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Earl Butz</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12072\">\n                On July 3, 2010 @ 6:59 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>wow, that is a *really* extreme way of treating an undergrad summer student.

Her poor management and time management skills meant that I was forced to attend an unnecessary two day workshop the same week I had back to back studies planned, etheric she wanted completed in a short time frame because she wanted to present my data at a conference. This resulted in me spending more than 40 hours in the lab in addition to the two days spent off campus. The experiments were such that I was not able to leave to lab during them. The next week I was told off for not calling another academic about a separate study. I was actually told to shorten or skip my non existent lunch breaks to make this phone call. I\u2019m still not sure how I was expected to call a stranger at 7 pm or from the lab \u2013 \u201cOh would you please excuse me while I attend to a urine sample?\u201d Btw, I\u2019m from a party of the world that someone else has labeled as \u201cLaid-back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Believe me,  the problem exists everywhere and has nothing to do with how much money an academic has but everything to do with how these pricks manage to wrap their superiors around their little fingers.

It\u2019s about the same for my postdoc actually. I feel very guilty about it all the time because there are others in the lab who work more and the prof never comes into the lab so he can\u2019t see me. </p>\n<p>But the thing is, my field lets me get away with it. I work a lot at the beginning until I get results that I know I can publish. And I\u2019m really good at it. Once I know I got something publish and I\u2019m told to write it up, it takes me a day to write a rough draft of a paper that will be in JACS or similar level. I\u2019m also really good at synthesis so I often don\u2019t have to repeat stuff, never break or spill things, and don\u2019t choose crazy routes that I know won\u2019t work but that are hyped by the PI to the poor grad student guinea pigs. Often I just take NMRs all day while drinking coffee and when I see something that I know is good, I know that I can take the rest of the day off. I get one high profile pub a year but I am pretty lazy. Maybe if I wasn\u2019t lazy I\u2019d get more high profile pubs, but I feel like taking it easy and going to the beach or to a cafe to read a book (not chemistry) pretty often. Maybe I\u2019d work more if I had a significant other, as the realization that I\u2019m wasting my life alone seems to drag me down a lot during the workday, but I\u2019m not sure about that. I just get a really good paper once in a while (in a timeframe where my field thinks I\u2019m awesome but not ridiculously so), and I\u2019m a really good speaker so my boss and people who listen to me at conferences think I\u2019m awesome.</p>\n<p>I hope no one ever finds out, otherwise I\u2019d be so screwed\u2026 Not even Dave Collum who I\u2019ve met at a conference and who is pretty easygoing\u2026  30 hours a week\u2026 I don\u2019t know anyone with my publishing record who can get away with saying that, but I\u2019m sure there must be others who are also scared to admit it in public.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to anon for this one\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12074#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12074\", \"12074\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n<ul class=\"children\">\n<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-mitch bypostauthor odd alt depth-2\" id=\"li-comment-12077\">\n<div id=\"comment-12077\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\"><a class=\"url\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com\" rel=\"external nofollow\">mitch</a></cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12077\">\n                On July 4, 2010 @ 7:53 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I\u2019m also a hyper efficient worker.

Lately I\u2019ve found that most papers just make me angry if I read them fully and not just look at the abstract and figures, and maybe the intro and conclusion, as the extra effort was a waste of time. There is a lot of useless filler in full papers that could go into the SI. The waning and waxing on the merits of your crystal structure and how it\u2019s 0.05 angstroms shorter than another literature example, then giving some bogus reason suggesting that this reflects greater pi-acidity of the metal (for example, which has nothing to do with the rest of the paper and is never mentioned again), just makes me curse the authors in the privacy of my office. It\u2019s better to read reviews\u2026 really. There are some good exceptions; especially from certain groups that I admire. Searching is still useful to see if you got scooped or not.</p>\n<p>With books I\u2019m going through my yearly phase where I don\u2019t give a shit about it anymore, to be honest. There are too many demands on my time and chemical books have gone from being up there, to below fictional literature. If I miss something at the bench I don\u2019t give a shit, because I\u2019ve got four projects going and one of them is going to give me publishable results for sure, just got to pick the right one to focus one when the boss gets paper cravings. I\u2019ll read some of it when I\u2019m writing up the next paper. I need to spend more time on online dating sites actually, and take some time off research. Also get a better tan.

Labor laws, my ass. Union? Give me a fucking break. You\u2019re here in my lab for one reason: you wanted to play in the big leagues and you fucking *chose* to come here. I didn\u2019t get down on bended knee for you.  I didn\u2019t ask you to come. YOU wrote me a letter about how passionate you were about organic chemistry, how much you loved my research, and how excited you\u2019d be to join my group at Big Swinging Dick University. After that written equivalent of a sloppy hand job, you got your supervisor to write letter to me and then even call me up late one Friday evening in my office, a.k.a. Fort DeepInTheShit. I was there, of course. I\u2019m always there.  \u201cI get 10 good postdoctoral applications a week\u201d, I told him. What\u2019s special about your guy? \u201cOh, he works 40 hours a week, plays violin in a string quartet and he has a fantastic collection of Eastern European stamps from the 1890-1930 period. But you should see how efficient he is in the lab!\u201d<br/>\nDo you think I said, \u201cHow exciting! As a philatelist myself, maybe he can help me fill in some of the gaps in my Bismarcks. I can\u2019t wait to spend leisurely Saturday afternoons drinking sherry and comparing our collections!\u201d<br/>\nFUCK NO.  He said, \u201cThis motherfucker is passionate about chemistry and he is 100% balls-in. He knows every named reaction forwards and backwards, he runs 3 reactions a day, and once recrystallized 3 mg of his key intermediate after his undergrad accidentally threw it into the waste solvent cannister. He is a superstar in the chemistry department here at Pudknocker U but his talent is wasted here.  He deserves a chance to play with the big boys\u201d. To which I said, \u201cThat is the kind of guy I want in my lab. I am sold.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not fucking with you: I will put you through hell. But it is a good kind of hell. [Of course if I actually wrote that in a letter, some snot-nosed whiny fuck would probably scan it and email it to his friends and they will complain about what a bastard I am.] Why? Because at Big Swinging Dick U, we don\u2019t give a shit about doing the same crap that other people are doing. If you want to do pudknocker chemistry, there\u2019s plenty of places for that. What we\u2019re doing at BSDU has to be special. It has to be amazing. It has to the the kind of chemistry that people read and then jizz in their pants, they\u2019re so excited about it. That\u2019s right: we only do jizz-worthy chemistry. And over the past year, not to be immodest, our chemistry has caused a fair amount of jizz to fly around the organic chemistry world. People are jizzing enough that I\u2019ve been invited to give talks at the Hyperphallus Institute, Massive Balls of Steel University, and numerous other smaller places, including Pudknocker. That\u2019s why you wrote me, isn\u2019t it? Deep down, you thought, \u201cI want to do chemistry that makes people jizz\u201d. Well, you\u2019re come to the right place. But it comes at a price. </p>\n<p>You think you can get as much done in 40 hours as a synthetic organic chemist versus someone who works 80? Bullshit. Don\u2019t believe me? I\u2019ll reassign my graduate student Suk Deep Lee to your molecule. He\u2019s going to work on an alternative route. Don\u2019t talk to me until you\u2019ve made the molecule. Let\u2019s see who makes the most progress, shall we? </p>\n<p>Exactly. You\u2019ll fall in line like everyone else. </p>\n<p> I will put you through hell because jizzworthy chemistry does not come from sitting around drinking coffee and singing in the choral society. It takes FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE, and then, maybe, if you keep failing, eventual success. Organic chemistry is all about trial and error, creating luck. That, and a lot of fucking columns.  I will push you to the limits of your capabilities, and then some. You will hate it at first. But over time, you will adjust. You will be forged into a hardened lethal weapon of organic chemistry effectiveness. You will become a chemistry navy seal. There will be nothing you can\u2019t do. You will surprise yourself with what you can accomplish. You will push through barriers you\u2019ve been struggling with your entire life and finally achieve your full potential.   That whiny voice you have in the back of your mind that says \u201cI can\u2019t do it!\u201d? You are going to stomp on its face with steel-spiked boots. Plus, you\u2019re going to be surrounded by other ninjas of chemistry. These will be your brothers in the trenches, and there will always be a bond between you, through the rest of your career.  You will be doing jizzworthy chemistry: your old friends from Pudknocker will see your papers and say, \u201cawesome work dude\u201d. You will tell your buddies how the other day at BSDU you were in the washroom and saw [Nobel laureate] walk right out of the crapper and he didn\u2019t even flush the toilet. Gross!  Then you will get emails from random strangers asking \u201cAnd by the way, does Prof. Hardass Slavedriver have any openings for a postdoc?\u201d</p>\n<p>Exactly. As much as people might be afraid of me, I\u2019m in demand. People want to work for me. Oh, they complain. But I give them something that is scarce: the opportunity to achieve greatness. Greatness is all I care about. Commitment to Excellence.  Deep down, you want to be great too, don\u2019t you? To play in the majors. To be taken seriously. To be in the brotherhood. To be on a winning team.  To be the best you can be at something you are passionate about.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t want to make the sacrifices? Well, there\u2019s always Pudknocker U. </p>\n<p>Behind my back, my students bitch about how I am a slavedriver. All I have to say is: Suck it up you fucking princesses. Nobody works harder than me. You think your life is fucking stressful? I\u2019m 3 years into my position and we\u2019re just at the point where we\u2019re getting out key results. EVERYTHING is riding on what happens in my lab over the next two years. That includes your fucking careers, bitches.  In 2 years I have to apply for tenure and an NIH grant which will decide the future of my life.   I do not sleep. I do not take days off.  I do not have time for my family. I do not have time for kids. I have eight people in my lab right now whose future completely depends on me, and I will be adding more in the fall. You think you are under pressure? You have no fucking clue what pressure is. Do you have any idea what the success rate on NIH and NSF grants are? You don\u2019t want to know. But you want to take weekends off, work 9 to 5, participate in extracurriculars, while I\u2019m working my ass off, and you\u2019re living off MY precious startup funds? What do you think [EJ/KC/Kishi] would have said to me if I told them I was going to do that during MY Ph.D? They would have torn me a new asshole! My head would have been ripped off and the senior postdocs would circle-jerk on my exposed brain stem. Metaphorically, of course. </p>\n<p>Do you think I\u2019m a slavedriver because I want to be? Are you really that cynical? I\u2019m a slavedriver because I HAVE to be.  All things being equal, I would prefer to be nice to my students. I would like to tell them to work at a time of their leisure and take weekends, and give them a big pink stuffed animal every time they run a column on 20 g of starting material that takes them six hours. All things being equal, I would love to take weekends myself. I would love to call up KC Nicolaou and say, </p>\n<p>ME: \u201cGee KC, I know you\u2019re also working on Jackoffamycin, but I was thinking\u2026 maybe we could agree to cut back the pace a bit. You know, take it easy, let our grad students and postdocs spend more time on extracurriculars. Plus, I would like to take July off and visit the vineyards of southern France.<br/>\nKC: Oh my! You\u2019re so right!  There is too much competition in our field. Our students and postdocs do suffer so. Starting today, I\u2019ll make 40 hour weeks mandatory, and I\u2019ll make sure the lab is locked on weekends so they aren\u2019t tempted to break the rule. Thank you, young man, for showing me the error of my ways!<br/>\nME: You\u2019re a great guy KC.<br/>\nKC: You took the words out of my mouth</p>\n<p>Three months later KC\u2019s synthesis of Jackoffamycin comes out in JACS and it has eight postdocs on it. </p>\n<p>ME: KC! What about our deal?<br/>\n KC: HAHAHAHAHAHAH BY ZEUS\u2019 ASS </p>\n<p>My friends, the fact is that people are out to eat our lunch.  If we want to avoid this fate we will work our goddamn asses off to ensure that this does not happen. That means that you give me your best effort and your complete devotion. I will keep your balls in a jar in my office. At the end of your military service here, if you work your ass off and do well, we will have a synthesis. I will salute you, return your balls \u2013 which have hardened into solid brass \u2013 and give you a firm handshake.  You will have become a forceful, deadly unstoppable chemistry ninja whom pharmaceutical companies salivate over,  and you will have my Letter. You can take my Letter to any of the companies I consult for and get a six-figure job with them. THEN you can do your 9 to 5, no weekends thing. You\u2019ll have a stimulating pharma job, a wife, a family, and great job security in an industry that is only going to grow once the insights from the Human Genome Project start making their mark. What a bright future the pharmaceutical industry has! You\u2019ll go far, young man.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile your old friends who did their Ph.D\u2019s at Pudknocker are finishing up their 7-year Ph.Ds in fields that maybe 20 people in the world give a shit about. Good thing you\u2019re not like them. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s the bargain. Take it or leave it. </p>\n<p>Yours Truly</p>\n<p>Prof. Hardass Slavedriver<br/>\nAssistant Profesor, Big Swinging Dick University</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to mitch\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=12115#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-12115\", \"12115\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n<ul class=\"children\">\n<li class=\"comment odd alt depth-3\" id=\"li-comment-12343\">\n<div id=\"comment-12343\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">dr.oaks</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-12343\">\n                On July 27, 2010 @ 10:45 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>The letter implies the phalocenticity and arrogance that is academic chemistry very very well.</p>\n<p>But I call the bluff, as I worked for and failed out of a hardasses lab and well \u2026 his job placement was ABYSMAL.

The problem was between me and the PI \u2013 I had a non-favorite instructor. During my PhD, I had to steal gloves and dirt-cheap chemicals, such as DMEM, from the animal facility, the shared cold room etc. The dry transfer apparatus that would shorten the blot from 2 hours to 7 minutes was in the lab, but not shared by the other instructor. Instead of pipeting 8 times with a multichannel, like the others, I had to do it 96 times. By my graduation, the others even got a robotic pippetor. </p>\n<p>Those people would hide or lock their goodies, and leave at 5 sharp. I\u2019d never leave before 9, and had to pull lots of all-nighters. At times, the other instructor would give something to do to his postdocs and to my instructor, and leave at 3. My instructor would do technician work, and still wasn\u2019t allowed to use their devices. Apparently, multichannel pipettes and SDS-PAGE buffers could be \u201ccontaminated\u201d.</p>\n<p>It took long nights of work, but also some brains. I and my instructor got two papers. At the same time, the other instructor, with 4-6 people, got one. There was a catch. The favorite instructor got discretionary funds from the PI, but never from the funding agencies. For example, all the department T32 grants were reserved to my PI, and paid workers for the other instructor. The only catch was they wanted prove some funny and wrong hypothesis. Their goal was to monetize some new drug combination, making them personally rich. The hypothesis was crap. Rats and mice did not respond to their combination. I saw it rejected in various grant shapes by NIH, NSF and pharma. My hypothesis was also crap, but not so crap.</p>\n<p>In the end, my PI stopped paying my stipend, on the grounds that he ran out of money. NIH Reporter shows him with more than a million a year for research, but he knew I couldn\u2019t leave at this point. At the committee meeting in my fifth year, I brought the provost, to make the PI account for the money. He had to agree on a budget. That covered 4 more months of bench work, and no stipend.</p>\n<p>Yes, I chose came to the PI. Even my PI tries this one on me. But I didn\u2019t chose knowing he\u2019ll have me steal.</p>\n<p>This sort of letter is not written by my PI. He\u2019d be too smart to leave traces. He\u2019d just nod, and pretend \u201cyou will find a way\u201d. But I can imagine a postdoc of the other instructor writing this self-aggrandizing nonsense.</p>\n<p>My PI never got anything in C-N-S. The other instructor never got an R01. Last year, they managed to pass as great pharma innovators, and moved as profs to an Ivy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Varg Vikernes\" class=\"comment-reply-link\"

If your postdocs do well, it reflects on you as a mentor as well. My supe was rather slack in comparison, but as a PhD student I worked regularly from 830 to 530 Mon-Fri in the chemistry lab, and often came in from 9-10 pm to run NMRs, then hopped off to the medical school to run my bioassays from midnight to 3am. I did it because I wanted to get the papers. In less than 3 years, I had five papers and submitted my PhD. And there was still enough results for 3 more papers. And I could honestly say it was all my work.  </p>\n<p>I do agree, however, that one should not be force to work, nor forced to give up weekends, and postdocs should be entitled to 15 days paid leave. </p>\n<p>One quick question: How many hours is Prof. Carreira in at the lab/office? I believe (from what my friends tell me)that he practices what he preaches. I only have a bone to pick with the assholes who make their students work hard, but don\u2019t work hard themselves.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Paul\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=13153#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-13153\", \"13153\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-13199\">\n<div id=\"comment-13199\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">new grad student</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-13199\">\n                On November 20, 2010 @ 12:55 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I am a new chemistry grad student this semester</p>\n<p>I\u2019m struggling right now with the thought of 65 hour work weeks.

I have always felt that I am being treated like a slave. When you move from your home country, you are an immigrant, so it will not be wrong to say you do not have any stake in the society/university/ where you moved. The so called \u2018equal opportunity\u2019 or \u2018affirmative action\u2019 letters are complete joke\u2026\u2026you are never treated in a similar way. What I feel is that this has nothing to do with chemistry or research. Theoretically, there may be a balance between advantages and drawbacks when you work in a \u2018reputed lab\u2019. However, I have consistently published 2 papers per year irrespective of the time, place and PI, and I am sure there are many people like me. Practically, of course this depends on many factors. I think this letter publicly expose the vulnerability of many Ph.D. or Post doc\u2019s. I am afraid, many of us will become mentor in future, and the nourishment we received during our childhood (M.S., Ph.D. or postdoc) is going to reflect in our behaviour when we begin to nourish budding scientists.

They failed to select (or, better, attract) people for whom the mantra \u2018what is worth doing, is worth overdoing\u2019 holds true (and then they put the outcome of their wrong choices in writing and in public). Human relationships (and \u201cwork ethic\u201d) apart, the Professors were fundamentally right : we do science not as job, but as a hobby. Even when we are not physically at the playground called \u2018lab\u2019, our minds still linger there. There is no time- or location-dependent separation between \u2018work\u2019 and \u2018play\u2019, because \u2018work\u2019 is play. I believe that this state of mind can not be taught (or enforced) : it is something like love or creativity -closer to biochemistry than to a conscious choice. In this respect, their letters were a waste of time : even if the recipients could put-in the hours, they couldn\u2019t put-in the love of it.</p>\n<p>My twocents,<br/>\nNicholas</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to NMG\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/?replytocom=20076#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-20076\", \"20076\", \"respond\", \"4404\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-31187\">\n<div id=\"comment-31187\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Ben</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply-wrong-with-chemistry/#comment-31187\">\n                On May 1, 2012 @ 9:11 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I was in a similarly abusive group in organic synthesis at a top tier school.

"content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>An example of what is currently wrong with chemistry culture, even though it is dated.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-4405\" height=\"772\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/a40kI.png\" title=\"Deeply Wrong Chemistry\" width=\"564\"/></p>\n<p>Future chemistry faculty will have to be twice as smart, work with twice the efficiency, and reach the correct positions of influence if they want this type of unhealthy cultural attitudes to finally be put to rest. This is my goal at least.</p>\n<p>Update 1: <a href=\"http://ch.linkedin.com/pub/guido-koch/7/58b/a79\">Guido Koch now</a>.</p>\n<p>Update 2: <a href=\"http://www.miller-mccune.com/science/the-real-science-gap-16191/?\">The underlying macroeconomic cause for why professors can get away with this behavior</a>.</p>\n<p>Update 3: This story has really struck a cord, thank you for sharing this link and supplying our first 20,000 visitor day!</p>\n<p>Update 4: A transcribed letter from Robert Tjian</p>\n<blockquote><p>From now on, I or someone designated by me will take attendance at group meetings starting at 9:10 am. If you are not there, I will not sign your salary sheets. Also, if you haven\u2019t noticed the number of people working on weekends and nights in the lab is the worst I\u2019ve seen in my 17 years. The frequency of vacation, time taken off and other non-lab activities is bordering on the ridiculous. In case you forgot, the standard amount of time you are supposed to take is 2 weeks a year total, including Christmas. If there isn\u2019t a substantial improvement in the next few months, I\u2019ll have to think of some draconian measures to \u201cmotivate\u201d you. I also want to say that the average lab citizenship and community spirit of keeping the lab in functioning order is at an all-time low. Few people seem to care about fixing broken equipment and making sure things in the lab run smoothly. If the lab were extremely productive and everyone was totally focused on their work, I might understand the slovenliness but productivity is abysmal and if we continue along this path we will surely reach mediocrity in no time.</p>\n<p>Finally, those of you who are \u201clame ducks\u201d because you have a job and are thinking of your own nibs, so long as you are here you are still full-fledged members of this lab, which means participating in all aspects of the lab (i.e. group meetings, Asilomar, postdoc seminars, etc.)</p>\n<p>I realize that this memo won\u2019t solve all the problems. so I am going to schedule a meeting with each one of you starting this Saturday and Sunday and continuing on weekends until I\u2019ve had a chance to speak with everyone and to give you a formal evaluation. Sign up for an appointment time on the sheet outside my door.</p>\n<p>This is the first time I\u2019ve had to actually write a memo of this type and I hope<br/>\nit\u2019s the last time.</p>\n<p>Robert Tjian</p></blockquote>\n<p>Update 5: Erick Carreira responds in an interview with Christopher Shea from The Boston Globe, vaguely claims the letter may have been a joke (link: <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2010/06/is_this_whats_w.html\">Chemist who ordered night and weekend work replies to critics</a>). Selected quote below:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I wonder whether you would think it fair to be judged on the basis of a letter 14 years old, especially when the comments and rash judgments are made without knowledge of the context or the circumstances surrounding the individuals involved. Indeed how does anyone out who is so quick to pass judgement and who is coming to conclusions know that it is not part of a 14-year old joke (or satire as you state) that backfired? \u2026</p></blockquote>\n<p>Update 6: <a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Gassman-and-Meyers.pdf\"> Comparatively tame letters from Paul Gassman and Albert Meyers</a>, but they have some good information in them about standard expectations.</p>\n<p>If you have similar letters you would like to share send them in. Any identifying information can be removed upon request.</p>\n<p>Mitch</p>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div> ", "website": "chemistry-blog"}

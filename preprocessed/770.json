{"content": "A ugust 1, 2018\u00a0\u2026 The age of the downloadable gun formally begins. \u201d So says the website of Defense Distributed, a nonprofit that creates and publishes blueprints for 3-D printed weapons. Cody Wilson\u200a\u2014\u200athe founder of Defense Distributed, a libertarian and one of the 15 most dangerous people in the world according to Wired magazine \u200a\u2014\u200aput up plans for a printable gun in 2013. Called \u201cthe Liberator,\u201d it was a single-shot pistol made mostly of plastic. Shortly after the blueprints were put online the State Department ordered them removed, citing a possible violation of firearm export rules. Wilson sued, and in June the State Department decided to settle his case, winning him the right to put the plans back online\u200a\u2014\u200awhile also recouping nearly $40,000 in legal fees from the U.S. government. Gun-rights advocates are celebrating the settlement as \u201cthe end of gun control,\u201d in the words of Fox News columnist John Lott Jr. That may seem hyperbolic, if only because a gun is one thing that is not hard to buy in America. While a printed, largely plastic gun may be able to slip past some metal detectors and won\u2019t carry a serial number, the designs are still inferior to conventional firearms, and 3-D printers are still expensive and rare. It\u2019s almost certain that the next mass shooting will be carried out the old-fashioned way. But while the Liberator may seem like little more than an after-school project for libertarians, it\u2019s the first sign of how 3-D printing\u200a\u2014\u200aand other rapidly developing tools like synthetic biology\u200a\u2014\u200acould empower individual rogue actors while eroding the ability of the government to maintain a monopoly on violence. As the technology continues to develop, it may not be long before far more devastating weapons could be manufactured at home by 3-D printers, or before DIY biohackers could create dangerous viruses in their garages. Push far enough into the future and we may reach a time when almost any individual could have the ability to unleash a weapon that could end the world. And if we reach that point, we\u2019re as good as done. T he Stanford political scientist James Fearon had a thought experiment he outlined in a 2003 talk , back when the global population was closer to 5 billion. He imagined a time where each person had the ability to destroy the world by pushing a button on their cell phone: \u201cHow long do you think the world would last if five billion individuals each had the capacity to blow the whole thing up? No one could plausibly defend an answer of anything more than a second. Expected lifespan would hardly be longer if only one million people had these cell-phones, and even if there were 10,000 you\u2019d have to think that an eventual global holocaust would be pretty likely. 10,000 is only two-millionths of five billion.\u201d Fearon\u2019s argument\u2014which I found in the 2015 book The Future of Violence \u2014 is that the conditions that have kept us un-blown-up so far are twofold. One, until the nuclear age, no weapon existed that could cause planetary catastrophe. And two, once those weapons existed, they were largely controlled by governments that, whatever else their faults, generally didn\u2019t want to see the world destroyed. Since the introduction of nuclear arms, we\u2019ve avoided annihilation because these weapons require rare elements and rare expertise, both of which constrain access. Almost 63 years after Hiroshima, fewer than 10 countries possess a nuclear arsenal, and after years of trying, no terror group has yet managed to build or steal a nuclear bomb and use it. That isn\u2019t because terrorists don\u2019t want nuclear weapons, any more than the relative success of nuclear non-proliferation suggests that world leaders are uniformly peace-loving. It\u2019s because nuclear weapons are something that, by their nature and their expense, can be controlled by the state. Their continued existence is an ongoing existential threat to the human race, one that may still get us in the end, but if nuclear weapons were as easy to obtain and use as an AR-15, we\u2019d have gone extinct years ago. It doesn\u2019t matter that the vast majority of people would never use them, just as the vast majority of 3-D printed gun enthusiasts wouldn\u2019t use their weapons to commit mass murder, just as the vast majority of biohackers wouldn\u2019t abuse CRISPR. There are enough omnicidal maniacs out there that one, sooner or later, would press that button. What Fearon highlighted is an extreme version of a collective action problem. If everyone eventually gains the power to potentially end the world, and governments are largely helpless to stop them, then the continued existence of the world depends on the collective action of all of us\u200a\u2014\u200aall 7.4 billion and counting\u200a\u2014\u200ato actively choose not to destroy the world. Of course, no such omnicidal button exists, and it\u2019s entirely possible that the technology that could create one will never be developed, or will be kept under tight control by governments. (Although given how difficult it is to prevent the spread of digital data\u200a\u2014\u200awitness the losing battle against malware\u200a\u2014\u200athat may eventually demand the kind of intrusive state surveillance that would make civil libertarians revolt.) But there\u2019s a less extreme collective action problem that poses an existential threat to humanity today. It\u2019s called climate change. Climate change is, essentially, the sum of all our decisions. Our decisions to use fossil fuels. Our decisions to travel by car or jet. Our decisions to support politicians who deny the reality of global warming and work to thwart action to address it. And most of all, our decisions to prioritize the comfort of the present at the cost of the future. It\u2019s not that any of us consciously want to screw over the generations to come with hotter temperatures and more extreme weather. It\u2019s that we\u2019re each pursuing what we perceive as our individual good, the good of our family and close circle\u200a\u2014\u200athe good of now. And through our collective actions, we create the catastrophe that is climate change, which will fall most heavily on the generations to come. You can\u2019t really blame us, according to Julian Savulescu. We are acting the way we evolved to act\u200a\u2014\u200abiased towards the near future and the nearby, reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of those we\u2019ll never meet and who have yet to exist. And that worked well enough for 10,000 years of civilization\u200a\u2014\u200auntil today, when this global village has the power to destroy itself through new weapons, through biotechnology, and through climate change. \u201cOur morality and our moral dispositions evolved to stop us from killing ourselves within our small group and to make sure that we cooperated with our small group,\u201d says Savulescu, the Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t evolve to provide benefits to strangers or to deal with large numbers of individuals at risk. All those features mean we\u2019re particularly badly placed to deal with large statistical threats like the use of biological weapons or global collective action problems like climate change.\u201d Essentially Savulescu believes that we \u201clack the moral capacities to deal with the sort of world we\u2019ve created for ourselves.\u201d Fortunately, he has a solution. I interviewed Julian Savulescu not long ago for my forthcoming book on existential risk. Savulescu is a bioethicist, originally from Australia\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can hear it in his twang. He\u2019s best known for the principle of \u201cprocreative beneficence\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe idea that parents have a putative moral obligation to use the best tools available, including genetic screening and other biotechnology innovations, to select children with traits like higher intelligence and better memories, on the grounds that this will give the child the best chance of having the best life. This is both very controversial and, I\u2019m willing to bet, exactly what will happen as our understanding of the genes underlying traits like intelligence and our ability to manipulate those genes improves. But I wanted to talk to Savulescu because of a book he wrote with Ingmar Persson of the University of Gothenburg called Unfit for the Future: The Need for Moral Enhancement . Savulescu and Persson argue that technological development has put us at risk of what they call \u201cUltimate Harm,\u201d otherwise known as the end of the world. To prevent Ultimate Harm, ultimate measures can be justified. And given that technology will increasingly give all of us the power to inflict Ultimate Harm\u200a\u2014\u200aeither quickly and individually in the case of bioterrorism or slowly and collectively in the case of climate change\u200a\u2014\u200awhat needs to change is us. If the world will blow up if just one of us pushes the self-destruct button\u200a\u2014\u200aor if all of us won\u2019t stop pushing the climate change button\u200a\u2014\u200athan what we need are human beings who can be trusted not to push that button. What we need are better people. \u201cI think that we\u2019re at this point where we need to look at every avenue,\u201d says Savulescu. \u201cAnd one of those avenues is not just looking to political reform\u200a\u2014\u200awhich we should be doing\u200a\u2014\u200abut also to be looking at ourselves. We\u2019re the ones who cause these problems. We\u2019re the ones who make these choices. We\u2019re the ones who create these political systems. No one wants to acknowledge the elephant in the room, and that is that human beings may be the problem, not the political system.\u201d Making people better people is what professors of practical ethics do, at the University of Oxford or elsewhere. It\u2019s what moral educators of both the spiritual and the secular variety have done for eons, and it\u2019s what parents try to do\u200a\u2014\u200awith more or less success\u200a\u2014\u200athrough the act of parenting. And judged over the span of history, we\u2019re doing a decent enough job. In books like The Better Angels of Our Nature , the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker has shown that rates of violence have plummeted over the centuries. In general, our circle of moral sympathy and the value we place on human rights has grown over time. You are almost certainly a more moral person than your great-great-great-grandparents. The problem, as Savulescu sees it, is that while we\u2019re getting better, we\u2019re not getting better fast enough. \u201cThere\u2019s this growing mismatch between our cognitive and technological powers and our moral capacity to use them,\u201d he says. As that gap grows, we leave ourselves increasingly vulnerable to Ultimate Harm at our own hands. So Savulescu believes that we should use that technological power to give our moral capacities a quick boost\u200a\u2014\u200aa moral bioenhancement. As Savulescu sees it, the same cutting-edge biotechnology that poses an existential risk could one day be used to engineer more ethical and more moral human beings. As we learn to identify the genes associated with altruism and a sense of justice, we could turn them up in the next generation, creating children who would innately possess the wisdom not to use that terrifying bioweapon, who would see the prudence in curbing their present-day consumption to ensure that future generations have a future. (They also might be more apt to do their chores.) The options for self-destruction would still exist, but our morally bioenhanced offspring would be too good to choose them. \u201cWe have to decide what kind of people we want,\u201d Savulescu says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ve begun to embrace because we have this sort of liberal neutrality, this relativism about morality that says, \u2018Wow, we can\u2019t really decide which moralities are better than the others.\u201d The objections to Savulescu\u2019s arguments come fast and furious. I can already see the Fox News chyrons: \u201cOxford academic wants to genetically engineer your children to be Al Gore.\u201d It\u2019s legitimate to ask who, exactly, would decide what is right and what isn\u2019t in this brave new world. As history has shown, what we think of as ethical and moral shifts over time. If the Elizabethans had possessed the power of engineering morality into their children, bear-baiting\u200a\u2014\u200atormenting bears to death in a pit\u200a\u2014\u200amight still be considered a wholesome pastime. So might torturing priests. Robert Sparrow, a bioethicist at Monash University in Australia, argues that Savulescu and Persson are simultaneously extremely pessimistic about our ability to use politics to solve the problems that technology has created, and extremely optimistic about the ability of genetic engineering and pharmaceuticals to form a more perfect citizen. He also notes the \u201cnot-inconsiderable problems involved in applying [moral bioenhancement] to \u2018hundreds of millions\u2019 of people without presuming or licensing an authoritarianism that would most likely render the project moot.\u201d We\u2019d be more moral and we\u2019d be more likely to survive\u200a\u2014\u200abut we wouldn\u2019t be free. Savulescu disagrees. He cites studies showing that criminal behavior drops markedly in adults with ADHD who are put on drugs like Ritalin. That\u2019s moral bioenhancement of a sort. \u201cIt enables them to exercise more control over their life and also promotes their own well-being,\u201d Savulescu argues. \u201cI don\u2019t think that undermines freedom. It enhances freedom. I think this kind of immediate conclusion that any sort of biological intervention undermines freedom is just silly. It\u2019s important also to recognize that our freedom is restricted all the time. We have laws that are coercive and if biological intervention meant that you weren\u2019t going to become a psychopath, well, that might be worth giving up that freedom.\u201d Savulescu\u2019s argument is tempting. Many American parents already put intensive effort into shaping the kind of person their child will be, from strict controls on diet among mothers-to-be to, yes, prescriptions for behavioral modification drugs like Ritalin. (Over 3 million American children are currently taking ADHD drugs.) Jennifer Doudna, who helped invent the gene editing technology CRISPR, told Medium in a recent interview that members of her team have already been approached about making designer babies. And of course when we choose a person to have a child with, we\u2019re making a decision that will irrevocably if indeterminately shape the product of that relationship. One thing many parents don\u2019t seem terribly worried about is the possibility that our children\u2019s freedom might somehow be impaired. Savulescu\u2019s moral bioenhancement would be a big next step\u200a\u2014\u200aand a step we don\u2019t currently have the ability to take, at least not as he fully envisions it\u200a\u2014\u200abut would it really be that out of line with what we\u2019re already doing? Maybe there\u2019s something about fiddling with how we make moral decisions that seems particularly problematic. To make a child taller, faster, smarter\u200a\u2014\u200anature does this already through the genetic lottery. We know that our genes will influence how tall we grow or how athletic we become. But whether or not we are a good person\u200a\u2014\u200asurely that should be our choice. It would be absurd to praise an adult for being tall, but if morals could be genetically influenced the way height is, would it be just as absurd to praise them for being good? Savulescu is a professor of practical ethics, and his practical interest here is saving the world, from the threat of climate change or bioterrorism or whatever abusable technology our rapidly developing cognitive powers might dream up next. The age of the downloadable gun is just the latest sign of the age of escalating existential risk. \u201cThe problem with technology is that you can\u2019t wind it back, and you can\u2019t just avoid it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt brings this enormous responsibility, but I don\u2019t think people realize that. They think they can avoid responsibility by deciding to do nothing or by trying to ban things, and I think that\u2019s the wrong choice.\u201d Robert Sparrow is right about one aspect of Savelscu\u2019s vision: he is profoundly pessimistic about our ability to enact the kind of political change that might save us from us. As my conversation with Savulescu ended, I realized what his argument reminded me of: the case for climate geoengineering. (Which makes sense, given that Savulescu is a co-director at an Oxford research program that examines the social issues around the subject.) Implicit in the idea that we may one day need to undertake large-scale, potentially irreversible engineering of the climate are two beliefs. One, climate change will present a clear existential threat to humanity. Two, despite that, human beings will be unable or unwilling to enact the political and personal changes needed to turn things around. It is a radical and second-best solution to human failure. So it is with Savulescu\u2019s moral bioenhancement. We are hurtling toward a future where new technologies will empower the individual as never before. As of August 1, we\u2019ll have the power to download and print a weapon that can kill\u2014and the government can do little to stop us. Soon enough, millions of people may have the power to use genetic engineering and editing to create virulent new pathogens that could threaten whole populations, even the entire human race. One day\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe around the same time\u200a\u2014\u200aparents will have the power to pick and choose the genetic makeup of their children, seizing control over what was once a random toss of the genetic dice. As we are, that power is a recipe for existential catastrophe. We will need to be better, or we will be gone.", "title_html": "<h1 class=\"elevate-h1 u-marginBottom12 u-md-marginBottom8\">The Case for Genetically Engineering Ethical Humans</h1> ", "url":

Called \u201cthe Liberator,\u201d it was a single-shot pistol made mostly of plastic. Shortly after the blueprints were put online the State Department ordered them removed, citing a possible violation of firearm export rules. Wilson sued, and in June the State Department decided to settle his case, winning him the right to put the plans back online\u200a\u2014\u200awhile also recouping nearly $40,000 in legal fees from the U.S. government.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ce15\" name=\"ce15\">Gun-rights advocates are celebrating the settlement as \u201cthe end of gun control,\u201d in the<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/20/making-guns-on-3d-printers-is-blow-against-gun-control.html\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/20/making-guns-on-3d-printers-is-blow-against-gun-control.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> words</a> of Fox News columnist John Lott Jr.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d049\" name=\"d049\">That may seem hyperbolic, if only because a gun is one thing that is not hard to buy in America. While a printed, largely plastic gun may be able to slip past some metal detectors and won\u2019t carry a serial number, the designs are still inferior to conventional firearms, and 3-D printers are still expensive and rare. It\u2019s almost certain that the next mass shooting will be carried out the old-fashioned way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9699\" name=\"9699\">But while the Liberator may seem like little more than an after-school project for libertarians, it\u2019s the first sign of how 3-D printing\u200a\u2014\u200aand other rapidly developing tools like synthetic biology\u200a\u2014\u200acould empower individual rogue actors while eroding the ability of the government to maintain a monopoly on violence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"0d02\" name=\"0d02\">As the technology continues to develop, it may not be long before far more devastating weapons could be manufactured at home by 3-D printers, or before DIY biohackers could create dangerous viruses in their garages. Push far enough into the future and we may reach a time when almost any individual could have the ability to unleash a weapon that could end the world. And if we reach that point, we\u2019re as good as done.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"6e64\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"e07c\" name=\"e07c\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he Stanford political scientist James Fearon had a thought experiment he outlined in a<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Catastrophic-terrorism-and-civil-liberties-in-the-short-and-long-run.pdf\" href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Catastrophic-terrorism-and-civil-liberties-in-the-short-and-long-run.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2003 talk</a>, back when the global population was closer to 5 billion. He imagined a time where each person had the ability to destroy the world by pushing a button on their cell phone:</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e022\" name=\"e022\">\u201cHow long do you think the world would last if five billion individuals each had the capacity to blow the whole thing up? No one could plausibly defend an answer of anything more than a second. Expected lifespan would hardly be longer if only one million people had these cell-phones, and even if there were 10,000 you\u2019d have to think that an eventual global holocaust would be pretty likely. 10,000 is only two-millionths of five billion.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\" id=\"f90b\" name=\"f90b\">Fearon\u2019s argument\u2014which I found in the 2015 book <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PWX7SB4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PWX7SB4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Future of Violence</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u2014</em>is that the conditions that have kept us un-blown-up so far are twofold. One, until the nuclear age, no weapon existed that could cause planetary catastrophe. And two, once those weapons existed, they were largely controlled by governments that, whatever else their faults, generally didn\u2019t want to see the world destroyed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c414\" name=\"c414\">Since the introduction of nuclear arms, we\u2019ve avoided annihilation because these weapons require rare elements and rare expertise, both of which constrain access. Almost 63 years after Hiroshima, fewer than 10 countries possess a nuclear arsenal, and after years of trying, no terror group has yet managed to build or steal a nuclear bomb and use it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"698a\" name=\"698a\">That isn\u2019t because terrorists don\u2019t want nuclear weapons, any more than the relative success of nuclear non-proliferation suggests that world leaders are uniformly peace-loving. It\u2019s because nuclear weapons are something that, by their nature and their expense, can be controlled by the state. Their continued existence is an ongoing existential threat to the human race, one that may still get us in the end, but if nuclear weapons were as easy to obtain and use as an AR-15, we\u2019d have gone extinct years ago. It doesn\u2019t matter that the vast majority of people would never use them, just as the vast majority of 3-D printed gun enthusiasts wouldn\u2019t use their weapons to commit mass murder, just as the vast majority of biohackers wouldn\u2019t abuse CRISPR. There are enough omnicidal maniacs out there that one, sooner or later, would press that button.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d4e2\" name=\"d4e2\">What Fearon highlighted is an extreme version of a collective action problem. If everyone eventually gains the power to potentially end the world, and governments are largely helpless to stop them, then the continued existence of the world depends on the collective action of all of us\u200a\u2014\u200aall 7.4 billion and counting\u200a\u2014\u200ato actively choose not to destroy the world.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"531d\" name=\"531d\">Of course, no such omnicidal button exists, and it\u2019s entirely possible that the technology that could create one will never be developed, or will be kept under tight control by governments. (Although given how difficult it is to prevent the spread of digital data\u200a\u2014\u200awitness the losing battle against malware\u200a\u2014\u200athat may eventually demand the kind of intrusive state surveillance that would make civil libertarians revolt.) But there\u2019s a less extreme collective action problem that poses an existential threat to humanity today. It\u2019s called climate change.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6f8\" name=\"b6f8\">Climate change is, essentially, the sum of all our decisions. Our decisions to use fossil fuels. Our decisions to travel by car or jet. Our decisions to support politicians who deny the reality of global warming and work to thwart action to address it. And most of all, our decisions to prioritize the comfort of the present at the cost of the future.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05ec\" name=\"05ec\">It\u2019s not that any of us consciously want to screw over the generations to come with hotter temperatures and more extreme weather. It\u2019s that we\u2019re each pursuing what we perceive as our individual good, the good of our family and close circle\u200a\u2014\u200athe good of now. And through our collective actions, we create the catastrophe that is climate change, which will fall most heavily on the generations to come.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f06\" name=\"9f06\">You can\u2019t really blame us, according to Julian Savulescu. We are acting the way we evolved to act\u200a\u2014\u200abiased towards the near future and the nearby, reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of those we\u2019ll never meet and who have yet to exist. And that worked well enough for 10,000 years of civilization\u200a\u2014\u200auntil today, when this global village has the power to destroy itself through new weapons, through biotechnology, and through climate change.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1f9f\" name=\"1f9f\">\u201cOur morality and our moral dispositions evolved to stop us from killing ourselves within our small group and to make sure that we cooperated with our small group,\u201d says Savulescu, the Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t evolve to provide benefits to strangers or to deal with large numbers of individuals at risk. All those features mean we\u2019re particularly badly placed to deal with large statistical threats like the use of biological weapons or global collective action problems like climate change.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"8a63\" name=\"8a63\">Essentially Savulescu believes that we \u201clack the moral capacities to deal with the sort of world we\u2019ve created for ourselves.\u201d Fortunately, he has a solution.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\" name=\"7b0f\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"843d\" name=\"843d\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">I</span> interviewed Julian Savulescu not long ago for my forthcoming book on existential risk. Savulescu is a bioethicist, originally from Australia\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can hear it in his twang. He\u2019s best known for the principle of \u201cprocreative beneficence\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe idea that parents have a putative moral obligation to use the best tools available, including genetic screening and other biotechnology innovations, to select children with traits like higher intelligence and better memories, on the grounds that this will give the child the best chance of having the best life. This is both very controversial and, I\u2019m willing to bet, exactly what will happen as our understanding of the genes underlying traits like intelligence and our ability to manipulate those genes improves.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f11c\" name=\"f11c\">But I wanted to talk to Savulescu because of a book he wrote with Ingmar Persson of the University of Gothenburg called<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/unfit-for-the-future-9780199653645?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\" href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/unfit-for-the-future-9780199653645?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Unfit for the Future: The Need for Moral Enhancement</em>.</a> Savulescu and Persson argue that technological development has put us at risk of what they call \u201cUltimate Harm,\u201d otherwise known as the end of the world. To prevent Ultimate Harm, ultimate measures can be justified. And given that technology will increasingly give all of us the power to inflict Ultimate Harm\u200a\u2014\u200aeither quickly and individually in the case of bioterrorism or slowly and collectively in the case of climate change\u200a\u2014\u200awhat needs to change is us. If the world will blow up if just one of us pushes the self-destruct button\u200a\u2014\u200aor if all of us won\u2019t stop pushing the climate change button\u200a\u2014\u200athan what we need are human beings who can be trusted not to push that button. What we need are better people.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"74ca\" name=\"74ca\">\u201cI think that we\u2019re at this point where we need to look at every avenue,\u201d says Savulescu. \u201cAnd one of those avenues is not just looking to political reform\u200a\u2014\u200awhich we should be doing\u200a\u2014\u200abut also to be looking at ourselves. We\u2019re the ones who cause these problems. We\u2019re the ones who make these choices. We\u2019re the ones who create these political systems. No one wants to acknowledge the elephant in the room, and that is that human beings may be the problem, not the political system.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"be46\" name=\"be46\">Making people better people is what professors of practical ethics do, at the University of Oxford or elsewhere. It\u2019s what moral educators of both the spiritual and the secular variety have done for eons, and it\u2019s what parents try to do\u200a\u2014\u200awith more or less success\u200a\u2014\u200athrough the act of parenting. And judged over the span of history, we\u2019re doing a decent enough job. In books like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Better Angels of Our Nature</em>, the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker has shown that <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://slides.ourworldindata.org/war-and-violence/#/3\" href=\"https://slides.ourworldindata.org/war-and-violence/#/3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rates of violence have plummeted</a> over the centuries. In general, our circle of moral sympathy and the value we place on human rights has grown over time. You are almost certainly a more moral person than your great-great-great-grandparents.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f452\" name=\"f452\">The problem, as Savulescu sees it, is that while we\u2019re getting better, we\u2019re not getting better fast enough. \u201cThere\u2019s this growing mismatch between our cognitive and technological powers and our moral capacity to use them,\u201d he says. As that gap grows, we leave ourselves increasingly vulnerable to Ultimate Harm at our own hands. So Savulescu believes that we should use that technological power to give our moral capacities a quick boost\u200a\u2014\u200aa moral bioenhancement.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b72b\" name=\"b72b\">As Savulescu sees it, the same cutting-edge biotechnology that poses an existential risk could one day be used to engineer more ethical and more moral human beings. As we learn to identify the genes associated with altruism and a sense of justice, we could turn them up in the next generation, creating children who would innately possess the wisdom not to use that terrifying bioweapon, who would see the prudence in curbing their present-day consumption to ensure that future generations have a future. (They also might be more apt to do their chores.) The options for self-destruction would still exist, but our morally bioenhanced offspring would be too good to choose them. \u201cWe have to decide what kind of people we want,\u201d Savulescu says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ve begun to embrace because we have this sort of liberal neutrality, this relativism about morality that says, \u2018Wow, we can\u2019t really decide which moralities are better than the others.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0843\" name=\"0843\">The objections to Savulescu\u2019s arguments come fast and furious. I can already see the Fox News chyrons: \u201cOxford academic wants to genetically engineer your children to be Al Gore.\u201d It\u2019s legitimate to ask who, exactly, would decide what is right and what isn\u2019t in this brave new world. As history has shown, what we think of as ethical and moral shifts over time. If the Elizabethans had possessed the power of engineering morality into their children, bear-baiting\u200a\u2014\u200atormenting bears to death in a pit\u200a\u2014\u200amight still be considered a wholesome pastime. So might torturing priests.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dc3\" name=\"3dc3\">Robert Sparrow, a bioethicist at Monash University in Australia,<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/03/09/4194110.htm\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/03/09/4194110.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> argues</a> that Savulescu and Persson are simultaneously extremely pessimistic about our ability to use politics to solve the problems that technology has created, and extremely optimistic about the ability of genetic engineering and pharmaceuticals to form a more perfect citizen. He also notes the \u201cnot-inconsiderable problems involved in applying [moral bioenhancement] to \u2018hundreds of millions\u2019 of people without presuming or licensing an authoritarianism that would most likely render the project moot.\u201d We\u2019d be more moral and we\u2019d be more likely to survive\u200a\u2014\u200abut we wouldn\u2019t be free.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7139\" name=\"7139\">Savulescu disagrees. He cites <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adhd-crime/medication-cuts-crime-rate-among-adhd-sufferers-idUSBRE8AK1FH20121121\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adhd-crime/medication-cuts-crime-rate-among-adhd-sufferers-idUSBRE8AK1FH20121121\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a> showing that criminal behavior drops markedly in adults with ADHD who are put on drugs like Ritalin. That\u2019s moral bioenhancement of a sort. \u201cIt enables them to exercise more control over their life and also promotes their own well-being,\u201d Savulescu argues. \u201cI don\u2019t think that undermines freedom. It enhances freedom. I think this kind of immediate conclusion that any sort of biological intervention undermines freedom is just silly. It\u2019s important also to recognize that our freedom is restricted all the time. We have laws that are coercive and if biological intervention meant that you weren\u2019t going to become a psychopath, well, that might be worth giving up that freedom.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd68\" name=\"fd68\">Savulescu\u2019s argument is tempting. Many American parents already put intensive effort into shaping the kind of person their child will be, from strict controls on diet among mothers-to-be to, yes, prescriptions for behavioral modification drugs like Ritalin. (Over 3 million American children<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2017.1417860\" href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2017.1417860\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> are currently taking</a> ADHD drugs.) Jennifer Doudna, who helped invent the gene editing technology CRISPR, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/rewriting-dna-for-fun-and-profit-5ac122fe27\" href=\"https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/rewriting-dna-for-fun-and-profit-5ac122fe27\" target=\"_blank\">told Medium</a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>in a recent interview that members of her team have already been approached about making designer babies. And of course when we choose a person to have a child with, we\u2019re making a decision that will irrevocably if indeterminately shape the product of that relationship. One thing many parents don\u2019t seem terribly worried about is the possibility that our children\u2019s freedom might somehow be impaired. Savulescu\u2019s moral bioenhancement would be a big next step\u200a\u2014\u200aand a step we don\u2019t currently have the ability to take, at least not as he fully envisions it\u200a\u2014\u200abut would it really be that out of line with what we\u2019re already doing?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b01a\" name=\"b01a\">Maybe there\u2019s something about fiddling with how we make moral decisions that seems particularly problematic. To make a child taller, faster, smarter\u200a\u2014\u200anature does this already through the genetic lottery. We know that our genes will influence how tall we grow or how athletic we become. But whether or not we are a good person\u200a\u2014\u200asurely that should be our choice. It would be absurd to praise an adult for being tall, but if morals could be genetically influenced the way height is, would it be just as absurd to praise them for being good?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2850\" name=\"2850\">Savulescu is a professor of practical ethics, and his practical interest here is saving the world, from the threat of climate change or bioterrorism or whatever abusable technology our rapidly developing cognitive powers might dream up next. The age of the downloadable gun is just the latest sign of the age of escalating existential risk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1303\" name=\"1303\">\u201cThe problem with technology is that you can\u2019t wind it back, and you can\u2019t just avoid it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt brings this enormous responsibility, but I don\u2019t think people realize that. They think they can avoid responsibility by deciding to do nothing or by trying to ban things, and I think that\u2019s the wrong choice.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c902\" name=\"c902\">Robert Sparrow is right about one aspect of Savelscu\u2019s vision: he is profoundly pessimistic about our ability to enact the kind of political change that might save us from us. As my conversation with Savulescu ended, I realized what his argument reminded me of: the case for climate geoengineering. (Which makes sense, given that Savulescu is a co-director at an Oxford research program that examines the social issues around the subject.) Implicit in the idea that we may one day need to undertake large-scale, potentially irreversible engineering of the climate are two beliefs. One, climate change will present a clear existential threat to humanity. Two, despite that, human beings will be unable or unwilling to enact the political and personal changes needed to turn things around. It is a radical and second-best solution to human failure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"8094\" name=\"8094\">So it is with Savulescu\u2019s moral bioenhancement. We are hurtling toward a future where new technologies will empower the individual as never before. As of August 1, we\u2019ll have the power to download and print a weapon that can kill\u2014and the government can do little to stop us. Soon enough, millions of people may have the power to use genetic engineering and editing to create virulent new pathogens that could threaten whole populations, even the entire human race. One day\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe around the same time\u200a\u2014\u200aparents will have the power to pick and choose the genetic makeup of their children, seizing control over what was once a random toss of the genetic dice. As we are, that power is a recipe for existential catastrophe. We will need to be better, or we will be gone.</p></div></div></section></div></main></div><section class=\"u-maxWidth700 u-paddingHorizontal20 u-marginAuto\"><div class=\"u-marginTop60

One, until the nuclear age, no weapon existed that could cause planetary catastrophe. And two, once those weapons existed, they were largely controlled by governments that, whatever else their faults, generally didn\u2019t want to see the world destroyed.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c414\\\" id=\\\"c414\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSince the introduction of nuclear arms, we\u2019ve avoided annihilation because these weapons require rare elements and rare expertise, both of which constrain access. Almost 63 years after Hiroshima, fewer than 10 countries possess a nuclear arsenal, and after years of trying, no terror group has yet managed to build or steal a nuclear bomb and use it.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"698a\\\" id=\\\"698a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThat isn\u2019t because terrorists don\u2019t want nuclear weapons, any more than the relative success of nuclear non-proliferation suggests that world leaders are uniformly peace-loving. It\u2019s because nuclear weapons are something that, by their nature and their expense, can be controlled by the state. Their continued existence is an ongoing existential threat to the human race, one that may still get us in the end, but if nuclear weapons were as easy to obtain and use as an AR-15, we\u2019d have gone extinct years ago. It doesn\u2019t matter that the vast majority of people would never use them, just as the vast majority of 3-D printed gun enthusiasts wouldn\u2019t use their weapons to commit mass murder, just as the vast majority of biohackers wouldn\u2019t abuse CRISPR.

If everyone eventually gains the power to potentially end the world, and governments are largely helpless to stop them, then the continued existence of the world depends on the collective action of all of us\u200a\u2014\u200aall 7.4 billion and counting\u200a\u2014\u200ato actively choose not to destroy the world.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"531d\\\" id=\\\"531d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOf course, no such omnicidal button exists, and it\u2019s entirely possible that the technology that could create one will never be developed, or will be kept under tight control by governments. (Although given how difficult it is to prevent the spread of digital data\u200a\u2014\u200awitness the losing battle against malware\u200a\u2014\u200athat may eventually demand the kind of intrusive state surveillance that would make civil libertarians revolt.)

You are almost certainly a more moral person than your great-great-great-grandparents.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f452\\\" id=\\\"f452\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe problem, as Savulescu sees it, is that while we\u2019re getting better, we\u2019re not getting better fast enough. \u201cThere\u2019s this growing mismatch between our cognitive and technological powers and our moral capacity to use them,\u201d he says. As that gap grows, we leave ourselves increasingly vulnerable to Ultimate Harm at our own hands. So Savulescu believes that we should use that technological power to give our moral capacities a quick boost\u200a\u2014\u200aa moral bioenhancement.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b72b\\\" id=\\\"b72b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAs Savulescu sees it, the same cutting-edge biotechnology that poses an existential risk could one day be used to engineer more ethical and more moral human beings. As we learn to identify the genes associated with altruism and a sense of justice, we could turn them up in the next generation, creating children who would innately possess the wisdom not to use that terrifying bioweapon, who would see the prudence in curbing their present-day consumption to ensure that future generations have a future. (They also might be more apt to do their chores.) The options for self-destruction would still exist, but our morally bioenhanced offspring would be too good to choose them. \u201cWe have to decide what kind of people we want,\u201d Savulescu says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ve begun to embrace because we have this sort of liberal neutrality, this relativism about morality that says, \u2018Wow, we can\u2019t really decide which moralities are better than the others.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0843\\\" id=\\\"0843\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe objections to Savulescu\u2019s arguments come fast and furious. I can already see the Fox News chyrons: \u201cOxford academic wants to genetically engineer your children to be Al Gore.\u201d It\u2019s legitimate to ask who, exactly, would decide what is right and what isn\u2019t in this brave new world. As history has shown, what we think of as ethical and moral shifts over time. If the Elizabethans had possessed the power of engineering morality into their children, bear-baiting\u200a\u2014\u200atormenting bears to death in a pit\u200a\u2014\u200amight still be considered a wholesome pastime.

That\u2019s moral bioenhancement of a sort. \u201cIt enables them to exercise more control over their life and also promotes their own well-being,\u201d Savulescu argues. \u201cI don\u2019t think that undermines freedom. It enhances freedom. I think this kind of immediate conclusion that any sort of biological intervention undermines freedom is just silly. It\u2019s important also to recognize that our freedom is restricted all the time. We have laws that are coercive and if biological intervention meant that you weren\u2019t going to become a psychopath, well, that might be worth giving up that freedom.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fd68\\\" id=\\\"fd68\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSavulescu\u2019s argument is tempting. Many American parents already put intensive effort into shaping the kind of person their child will be, from strict controls on diet among mothers-to-be to, yes, prescriptions for behavioral modification drugs like Ritalin. (Over 3 million American children\\x3ca href=\\\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2017.1417860\\\" data-href=\\\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2017.1417860\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3e are currently taking\\x3c/a\\x3e ADHD drugs.)

And of course when we choose a person to have a child with, we\u2019re making a decision that will irrevocably if indeterminately shape the product of that relationship. One thing many parents don\u2019t seem terribly worried about is the possibility that our children\u2019s freedom might somehow be impaired. Savulescu\u2019s moral bioenhancement would be a big next step\u200a\u2014\u200aand a step we don\u2019t currently have the ability to take, at least not as he fully envisions it\u200a\u2014\u200abut would it really be that out of line with what we\u2019re already doing?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b01a\\\" id=\\\"b01a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMaybe there\u2019s something about fiddling with how we make moral decisions that seems particularly problematic. To make a child taller, faster, smarter\u200a\u2014\u200anature does this already through the genetic lottery. We know that our genes will influence how tall we grow or how athletic we become. But whether or not we are a good person\u200a\u2014\u200asurely that should be our choice. It would be absurd to praise an adult for being tall, but if morals could be genetically influenced the way height is, would it be just as absurd to praise them for being good?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2850\\\" id=\\\"2850\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSavulescu is a professor of practical ethics, and his practical interest here is saving the world, from the threat of climate change or bioterrorism or whatever abusable technology our rapidly developing cognitive powers might dream up next.

They think they can avoid responsibility by deciding to do nothing or by trying to ban things, and I think that\u2019s the wrong choice.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c902\\\" id=\\\"c902\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRobert Sparrow is right about one aspect of Savelscu\u2019s vision: he is profoundly pessimistic about our ability to enact the kind of political change that might save us from us. As my conversation with Savulescu ended, I realized what his argument reminded me of: the case for climate geoengineering. (Which makes sense, given that Savulescu is a co-director at an Oxford research program that examines the social issues around the subject.) Implicit in the idea that we may one day need to undertake large-scale, potentially irreversible engineering of the climate are two beliefs. One, climate change will present a clear existential threat to humanity. Two, despite that, human beings will be unable or unwilling to enact the political and personal changes needed to turn things around. It is a radical and second-best solution to human failure.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8094\\\" id=\\\"8094\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eSo it is with Savulescu\u2019s moral bioenhancement. We are hurtling toward a future where new technologies will empower the individual as never before. As of August 1, we\u2019ll have the power to download and print a weapon that can kill\u2014and the government can do little to stop us. Soon enough, millions of people may have the power to use genetic engineering and editing to create virulent new pathogens that could threaten whole populations, even the entire human race. One day\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe around the same time\u200a\u2014\u200aparents will have the power to pick and choose the genetic makeup of their children, seizing control over what was once a random toss of the genetic dice. As we are, that power is a recipe for existential catastrophe. We will need to be better, or we will be gone.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\"},\"socialTitle\":\"The Case for Genetically Engineering Ethical

Called \u201cthe Liberator,\u201d it was a single-shot pistol made mostly of plastic. Shortly after the blueprints were put online the State Department ordered them removed, citing a possible violation of firearm export rules. Wilson sued, and in June the State Department decided to settle his case, winning him the right to put the plans back online\u200a\u2014\u200awhile also recouping nearly $40,000 in legal fees from the U.S. government.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ce15\" name=\"ce15\">Gun-rights advocates are celebrating the settlement as \u201cthe end of gun control,\u201d in the<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/20/making-guns-on-3d-printers-is-blow-against-gun-control.html\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/20/making-guns-on-3d-printers-is-blow-against-gun-control.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> words</a> of Fox News columnist John Lott Jr.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d049\" name=\"d049\">That may seem hyperbolic, if only because a gun is one thing that is not hard to buy in America. While a printed, largely plastic gun may be able to slip past some metal detectors and won\u2019t carry a serial number, the designs are still inferior to conventional firearms, and 3-D printers are still expensive and rare. It\u2019s almost certain that the next mass shooting will be carried out the old-fashioned way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9699\" name=\"9699\">But while the Liberator may seem like little more than an after-school project for libertarians, it\u2019s the first sign of how 3-D printing\u200a\u2014\u200aand other rapidly developing tools like synthetic biology\u200a\u2014\u200acould empower individual rogue actors while eroding the ability of the government to maintain a monopoly on violence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"0d02\" name=\"0d02\">As the technology continues to develop, it may not be long before far more devastating weapons could be manufactured at home by 3-D printers, or before DIY biohackers could create dangerous viruses in their garages. Push far enough into the future and we may reach a time when almost any individual could have the ability to unleash a weapon that could end the world. And if we reach that point, we\u2019re as good as done.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"e07c\" name=\"e07c\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he Stanford political scientist James Fearon had a thought experiment he outlined in a<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Catastrophic-terrorism-and-civil-liberties-in-the-short-and-long-run.pdf\" href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Catastrophic-terrorism-and-civil-liberties-in-the-short-and-long-run.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> 2003 talk</a>, back when the global population was closer to 5 billion. He imagined a time where each person had the ability to destroy the world by pushing a button on their cell phone:</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e022\" name=\"e022\">\u201cHow long do you think the world would last if five billion individuals each had the capacity to blow the whole thing up? No one could plausibly defend an answer of anything more than a second. Expected lifespan would hardly be longer if only one million people had these cell-phones, and even if there were 10,000 you\u2019d have to think that an eventual global holocaust would be pretty likely. 10,000 is only two-millionths of five billion.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\" id=\"f90b\" name=\"f90b\">Fearon\u2019s argument\u2014which I found in the 2015 book <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PWX7SB4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PWX7SB4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Future of Violence</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u2014</em>is that the conditions that have kept us un-blown-up so far are twofold. One, until the nuclear age, no weapon existed that could cause planetary catastrophe. And two, once those weapons existed, they were largely controlled by governments that, whatever else their faults, generally didn\u2019t want to see the world destroyed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c414\" name=\"c414\">Since the introduction of nuclear arms, we\u2019ve avoided annihilation because these weapons require rare elements and rare expertise, both of which constrain access. Almost 63 years after Hiroshima, fewer than 10 countries possess a nuclear arsenal, and after years of trying, no terror group has yet managed to build or steal a nuclear bomb and use it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"698a\" name=\"698a\">That isn\u2019t because terrorists don\u2019t want nuclear weapons, any more than the relative success of nuclear non-proliferation suggests that world leaders are uniformly peace-loving. It\u2019s because nuclear weapons are something that, by their nature and their expense, can be controlled by the state. Their continued existence is an ongoing existential threat to the human race, one that may still get us in the end, but if nuclear weapons were as easy to obtain and use as an AR-15, we\u2019d have gone extinct years ago. It doesn\u2019t matter that the vast majority of people would never use them, just as the vast majority of 3-D printed gun enthusiasts wouldn\u2019t use their weapons to commit mass murder, just as the vast majority of biohackers wouldn\u2019t abuse CRISPR. There are enough omnicidal maniacs out there that one, sooner or later, would press that button.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d4e2\" name=\"d4e2\">What Fearon highlighted is an extreme version of a collective action problem. If everyone eventually gains the power to potentially end the world, and governments are largely helpless to stop them, then the continued existence of the world depends on the collective action of all of us\u200a\u2014\u200aall 7.4 billion and counting\u200a\u2014\u200ato actively choose not to destroy the world.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"531d\" name=\"531d\">Of course, no such omnicidal button exists, and it\u2019s entirely possible that the technology that could create one will never be developed, or will be kept under tight control by governments. (Although given how difficult it is to prevent the spread of digital data\u200a\u2014\u200awitness the losing battle against malware\u200a\u2014\u200athat may eventually demand the kind of intrusive state surveillance that would make civil libertarians revolt.) But there\u2019s a less extreme collective action problem that poses an existential threat to humanity today. It\u2019s called climate change.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6f8\" name=\"b6f8\">Climate change is, essentially, the sum of all our decisions. Our decisions to use fossil fuels. Our decisions to travel by car or jet. Our decisions to support politicians who deny the reality of global warming and work to thwart action to address it. And most of all, our decisions to prioritize the comfort of the present at the cost of the future.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05ec\" name=\"05ec\">It\u2019s not that any of us consciously want to screw over the generations to come with hotter temperatures and more extreme weather. It\u2019s that we\u2019re each pursuing what we perceive as our individual good, the good of our family and close circle\u200a\u2014\u200athe good of now. And through our collective actions, we create the catastrophe that is climate change, which will fall most heavily on the generations to come.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f06\" name=\"9f06\">You can\u2019t really blame us, according to Julian Savulescu. We are acting the way we evolved to act\u200a\u2014\u200abiased towards the near future and the nearby, reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of those we\u2019ll never meet and who have yet to exist. And that worked well enough for 10,000 years of civilization\u200a\u2014\u200auntil today, when this global village has the power to destroy itself through new weapons, through biotechnology, and through climate change.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1f9f\" name=\"1f9f\">\u201cOur morality and our moral dispositions evolved to stop us from killing ourselves within our small group and to make sure that we cooperated with our small group,\u201d says Savulescu, the Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t evolve to provide benefits to strangers or to deal with large numbers of individuals at risk. All those features mean we\u2019re particularly badly placed to deal with large statistical threats like the use of biological weapons or global collective action problems like climate change.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"8a63\" name=\"8a63\">Essentially Savulescu believes that we \u201clack the moral capacities to deal with the sort of world we\u2019ve created for ourselves.\u201d Fortunately, he has a solution.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"843d\" name=\"843d\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">I</span> interviewed Julian Savulescu not long ago for my forthcoming book on existential risk. Savulescu is a bioethicist, originally from Australia\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can hear it in his twang. He\u2019s best known for the principle of \u201cprocreative beneficence\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athe idea that parents have a putative moral obligation to use the best tools available, including genetic screening and other biotechnology innovations, to select children with traits like higher intelligence and better memories, on the grounds that this will give the child the best chance of having the best life. This is both very controversial and, I\u2019m willing to bet, exactly what will happen as our understanding of the genes underlying traits like intelligence and our ability to manipulate those genes improves.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f11c\" name=\"f11c\">But I wanted to talk to Savulescu because of a book he wrote with Ingmar Persson of the University of Gothenburg called<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/unfit-for-the-future-9780199653645?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\" href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/unfit-for-the-future-9780199653645?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Unfit for the Future: The Need for Moral Enhancement</em>.</a> Savulescu and Persson argue that technological development has put us at risk of what they call \u201cUltimate Harm,\u201d otherwise known as the end of the world. To prevent Ultimate Harm, ultimate measures can be justified. And given that technology will increasingly give all of us the power to inflict Ultimate Harm\u200a\u2014\u200aeither quickly and individually in the case of bioterrorism or slowly and collectively in the case of climate change\u200a\u2014\u200awhat needs to change is us. If the world will blow up if just one of us pushes the self-destruct button\u200a\u2014\u200aor if all of us won\u2019t stop pushing the climate change button\u200a\u2014\u200athan what we need are human beings who can be trusted not to push that button. What we need are better people.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"74ca\" name=\"74ca\">\u201cI think that we\u2019re at this point where we need to look at every avenue,\u201d says Savulescu. \u201cAnd one of those avenues is not just looking to political reform\u200a\u2014\u200awhich we should be doing\u200a\u2014\u200abut also to be looking at ourselves. We\u2019re the ones who cause these problems. We\u2019re the ones who make these choices. We\u2019re the ones who create these political systems. No one wants to acknowledge the elephant in the room, and that is that human beings may be the problem, not the political system.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"be46\" name=\"be46\">Making people better people is what professors of practical ethics do, at the University of Oxford or elsewhere. It\u2019s what moral educators of both the spiritual and the secular variety have done for eons, and it\u2019s what parents try to do\u200a\u2014\u200awith more or less success\u200a\u2014\u200athrough the act of parenting. And judged over the span of history, we\u2019re doing a decent enough job. In books like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Better Angels of Our Nature</em>, the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker has shown that <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://slides.ourworldindata.org/war-and-violence/#/3\" href=\"https://slides.ourworldindata.org/war-and-violence/#/3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rates of violence have plummeted</a> over the centuries. In general, our circle of moral sympathy and the value we place on human rights has grown over time. You are almost certainly a more moral person than your great-great-great-grandparents.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f452\" name=\"f452\">The problem, as Savulescu sees it, is that while we\u2019re getting better, we\u2019re not getting better fast enough. \u201cThere\u2019s this growing mismatch between our cognitive and technological powers and our moral capacity to use them,\u201d he says. As that gap grows, we leave ourselves increasingly vulnerable to Ultimate Harm at our own hands. So Savulescu believes that we should use that technological power to give our moral capacities a quick boost\u200a\u2014\u200aa moral bioenhancement.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b72b\" name=\"b72b\">As Savulescu sees it, the same cutting-edge biotechnology that poses an existential risk could one day be used to engineer more ethical and more moral human beings. As we learn to identify the genes associated with altruism and a sense of justice, we could turn them up in the next generation, creating children who would innately possess the wisdom not to use that terrifying bioweapon, who would see the prudence in curbing their present-day consumption to ensure that future generations have a future. (They also might be more apt to do their chores.) The options for self-destruction would still exist, but our morally bioenhanced offspring would be too good to choose them. \u201cWe have to decide what kind of people we want,\u201d Savulescu says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ve begun to embrace because we have this sort of liberal neutrality, this relativism about morality that says, \u2018Wow, we can\u2019t really decide which moralities are better than the others.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0843\" name=\"0843\">The objections to Savulescu\u2019s arguments come fast and furious. I can already see the Fox News chyrons: \u201cOxford academic wants to genetically engineer your children to be Al Gore.\u201d It\u2019s legitimate to ask who, exactly, would decide what is right and what isn\u2019t in this brave new world. As history has shown, what we think of as ethical and moral shifts over time. If the Elizabethans had possessed the power of engineering morality into their children, bear-baiting\u200a\u2014\u200atormenting bears to death in a pit\u200a\u2014\u200amight still be considered a wholesome pastime. So might torturing priests.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dc3\" name=\"3dc3\">Robert Sparrow, a bioethicist at Monash University in Australia,<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/03/09/4194110.htm\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2015/03/09/4194110.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> argues</a> that Savulescu and Persson are simultaneously extremely pessimistic about our ability to use politics to solve the problems that technology has created, and extremely optimistic about the ability of genetic engineering and pharmaceuticals to form a more perfect citizen. He also notes the \u201cnot-inconsiderable problems involved in applying [moral bioenhancement] to \u2018hundreds of millions\u2019 of people without presuming or licensing an authoritarianism that would most likely render the project moot.\u201d We\u2019d be more moral and we\u2019d be more likely to survive\u200a\u2014\u200abut we wouldn\u2019t be free.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7139\" name=\"7139\">Savulescu disagrees. He cites <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adhd-crime/medication-cuts-crime-rate-among-adhd-sufferers-idUSBRE8AK1FH20121121\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adhd-crime/medication-cuts-crime-rate-among-adhd-sufferers-idUSBRE8AK1FH20121121\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a> showing that criminal behavior drops markedly in adults with ADHD who are put on drugs like Ritalin. That\u2019s moral bioenhancement of a sort. \u201cIt enables them to exercise more control over their life and also promotes their own well-being,\u201d Savulescu argues. \u201cI don\u2019t think that undermines freedom. It enhances freedom. I think this kind of immediate conclusion that any sort of biological intervention undermines freedom is just silly. It\u2019s important also to recognize that our freedom is restricted all the time. We have laws that are coercive and if biological intervention meant that you weren\u2019t going to become a psychopath, well, that might be worth giving up that freedom.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd68\" name=\"fd68\">Savulescu\u2019s argument is tempting. Many American parents already put intensive effort into shaping the kind of person their child will be, from strict controls on diet among mothers-to-be to, yes, prescriptions for behavioral modification drugs like Ritalin. (Over 3 million American children<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2017.1417860\" href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2017.1417860\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> are currently taking</a> ADHD drugs.) Jennifer Doudna, who helped invent the gene editing technology CRISPR, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/rewriting-dna-for-fun-and-profit-5ac122fe27\" href=\"https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/rewriting-dna-for-fun-and-profit-5ac122fe27\" target=\"_blank\">told Medium</a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>in a recent interview that members of her team have already been approached about making designer babies. And of course when we choose a person to have a child with, we\u2019re making a decision that will irrevocably if indeterminately shape the product of that relationship. One thing many parents don\u2019t seem terribly worried about is the possibility that our children\u2019s freedom might somehow be impaired. Savulescu\u2019s moral bioenhancement would be a big next step\u200a\u2014\u200aand a step we don\u2019t currently have the ability to take, at least not as he fully envisions it\u200a\u2014\u200abut would it really be that out of line with what we\u2019re already doing?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b01a\" name=\"b01a\">Maybe there\u2019s something about fiddling with how we make moral decisions that seems particularly problematic. To make a child taller, faster, smarter\u200a\u2014\u200anature does this already through the genetic lottery. We know that our genes will influence how tall we grow or how athletic we become. But whether or not we are a good person\u200a\u2014\u200asurely that should be our choice. It would be absurd to praise an adult for being tall, but if morals could be genetically influenced the way height is, would it be just as absurd to praise them for being good?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2850\" name=\"2850\">Savulescu is a professor of practical ethics, and his practical interest here is saving the world, from the threat of climate change or bioterrorism or whatever abusable technology our rapidly developing cognitive powers might dream up next. The age of the downloadable gun is just the latest sign of the age of escalating existential risk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1303\" name=\"1303\">\u201cThe problem with technology is that you can\u2019t wind it back, and you can\u2019t just avoid it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt brings this enormous responsibility, but I don\u2019t think people realize that. They think they can avoid responsibility by deciding to do nothing or by trying to ban things, and I think that\u2019s the wrong choice.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c902\" name=\"c902\">Robert Sparrow is right about one aspect of Savelscu\u2019s vision: he is profoundly pessimistic about our ability to enact the kind of political change that might save us from us. As my conversation with Savulescu ended, I realized what his argument reminded me of: the case for climate geoengineering. (Which makes sense, given that Savulescu is a co-director at an Oxford research program that examines the social issues around the subject.) Implicit in the idea that we may one day need to undertake large-scale, potentially irreversible engineering of the climate are two beliefs. One, climate change will present a clear existential threat to humanity. Two, despite that, human beings will be unable or unwilling to enact the political and personal changes needed to turn things around. It is a radical and second-best solution to human failure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"8094\" name=\"8094\">So it is with Savulescu\u2019s moral bioenhancement. We are hurtling toward a future where new technologies will empower the individual as never before. As of August 1, we\u2019ll have the power to download and print a weapon that can kill\u2014and the government can do little to stop us. Soon enough, millions of people may have the power to use genetic engineering and editing to create virulent new pathogens that could threaten whole populations, even the entire human race. One day\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe around the same time\u200a\u2014\u200aparents will have the power to pick and choose the genetic makeup of their children, seizing control over what was once a random toss of the genetic dice. As we are, that power is a recipe for existential catastrophe. We will need to be better, or we will be gone.</p></div></div> ", "website": "medium"}

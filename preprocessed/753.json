It has taken a French and Cambodian restoration team 15 years to pick up where the 1960-1970 restoration was forced to leave off by the advancing Khmer Rouge forces and solve the greatest 3D puzzle in the world.</p>\n<p>The three-tier pyramidical temple was built by King Udayadityavarman II in around 1060. Dedicated to Siva, it was the largest temple in the country until Angkor Wat was built in the next century, and it was famed for its dramatic central tower. With the tower, it was 164 feet (50 meters) high, and 426 by 340 feet (130 x 104 meters) wide. It was built around a sand core, however, and its massive size, hasty construction and thin walls led to structural problems almost from the beginning.</p>\n<p>By the 15th century, large portions of it had collapsed, so when it was converted from a Hindu temple to a Buddhist one, builders had no qualms about removing large chunks of rock from the tower to create an abstract outline of a massive reclining Buddha (30 feet high and 230 feet long) on the second tier, endangering the structure even further.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/dismantled-numbered-stones.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Numbered blocks in the vast stone field\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11843\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/dismantled-numbered-stones-300x225.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/dismantled-numbered-stones-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/dismantled-numbered-stones-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/dismantled-numbered-stones-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Numbered blocks in the vast stone field\" width=\"200\"/></a>Come the 20th century, the temple was in ruins. The Ecole Francaise d\u2019Extreme-Orient (EFEO), the French organization that was in charge of Angkor conservation since 1908, started an ambitious program of restoration in 1960. Based on successful use of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastylosis\" target=\"blank\">anastylosis</a> by Dutch restorers in Java, the restoration of the Baphuon temple called for the ruins to be completely dismantled, the structure shored up, then the temple rebuilt. Each of the 300,000 sandstone blocks were numbered and spread out over 10 hectares of the surrounding area. Careful records were kept so that they could all be put back together again. This was a dry stone construction \u2014 no mortar was used to glue stones together \u2014 so every stone was individually shaped to fit together.</p>\n<p>Soon after the temple was dismantled, the Cambodian civil war broke out. They were working on the second tier when the EFEO restorers were expelled from the country and many of the Cambodian restorers and builders were killed. When the KR took Phnom Penh in 1975, the EFEO offices were ransacked and all the records lost.</p>\n<p>In 1995, after the civil war of the 1980s and the political turmoil of the early 1990s settled down, the EFEO restorers were allowed back into the country under the leadership of Pascal Royere. Without the original plans, however, the undertaking was daunting to the point of impossibility.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt has been said, probably rightly so, that it is the largest-ever 3D puzzle,\u201d Royere told AFP.</p>\n<p>The team carefully measured and weighed each block and then relied on archive photos stored in Paris, drawings and the recollections of Cambodian workers to figure out where each part fits.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were facing a three-dimensional puzzle, a 300,000-piece puzzle to which we had lost the picture. And that was the main difficulty of this project,\u201d Royere said.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Baphuon-temple-restoration-2008.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Baphuon temple in 2008\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11844\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Baphuon-temple-restoration-2008-300x179.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Baphuon-temple-restoration-2008-300x179.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Baphuon-temple-restoration-2008-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Baphuon-temple-restoration-2008-1024x614.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Baphuon temple in 2008\" width=\"200\"/></a>Thankfully the EFEO offices in Paris had photographs of the site stretching back to 1910, so the team was able to track certain blocks and figure out where they went based on where they had been. Sometimes they would find the block they were looking for in 10 minutes, sometimes in three weeks. Royere was also fortunate to have the spry mind of Jacques Dumarcay, the architect who had supervised the dismantling in the 1960s, on his side, and about 30 Cambodian workers who had worked on Angkor projects in the 60s and 70s and had survived the genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge. One of them, Mith Priem, is now a team supervisor at Baphuon. He was able to recognize patterns on the stones based on his decades-old experience and train new workers to do the same.</p>\n<p>They attempted computer modelling but it wasn\u2019t as helpful as the experience and knowledge of the people who had been involved in the original project. Ultimately this immense 3D puzzle would be solved by dedicated people with good memories working hard for a decade and a half.</p>\n<p>The rebuilding has taken a good seven years longer than the earliest overly optimistic projections, but partial access was allowed to visitors starting in May 2006.

The <a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-barbeque-aurochs-110627.html\" target=\"blank\">leftovers of this 7,700-year-old BBQ</a> were discovered in the Tjonger River valley in the Netherlands. Archaeologists from the University of Groningen found the bones and a discarded flint blade.</p>\n<p>The valley\u2019s waterlogged, peaty soil is an excellent preserver of bone, antler and plant remains, and many prehistoric hunting sites, particularly from the Late Mesolithic (ca. 8000\u20135500 B.C.), have been found in the area. This site is unusual, however, because it preserves a single hunting and butchering instance rather than a collection of them spread out over time. The remains of a single hunt aren\u2019t often discovered because they\u2019re so small and hard to find. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/aurochsskeleton.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11837\" height=\"194\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/aurochsskeleton-300x194.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/aurochsskeleton-300x194.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/aurochsskeleton-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/aurochsskeleton-1024x664.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/aurochsskeleton.jpg 1152w\" title=\"Aurochs skeleton in the National Museum of Denmark\" width=\"300\"/></a>What the bones tell us about this hunting event is that the quarry was a small female aurochs, only 134 centimeters (approximately 4 feet 5 inches) tall at the withers. They killed her either by trapping her in a pit and clubbing her on the head, or by shooting her with a flint arrow. There\u2019s a well-preserved Mesolithic aurochs skeleton in the <a href=\"http://www.natmus.dk/sw33830.asp\" target=\"blank\">National Museum of Denmark</a> from around that time which was killed by arrows (yellow circle marks a healed arrow wound, red circles mark later fatal arrow wounds), and it was a larger specimen than this comparatively small cow. (Look at them ribs!)</p>\n<p>Marks on the bones indicate that after she was brought down, the hunters cut off her legs and ate the marrow. Then they skinned her and carefully removed large sections of meat from the bone.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Burn marks reveal that the hunters cooked the meaty ribs, and probably other smaller parts, over an open fire. They ate them right at the site, \u201ctheir reward for the successful kill,\u201d Prummel said.</p>\n<p>The blade, perhaps worn down from so much cutting, was left behind and wound up slightly scorched in the cooking fire.</p>\n<p>Niekus told Discovery News, \u201cThe people who killed the animal lived during the Late Mesolithic (the latter part of the middle Stone Age). They were hunter-gatherers and hunting game was an important part of their subsistence activities.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is evidence of Mesolithic hunters cooking meat over ground-level fires and in pits. Thousands of these pits, known as hearth-pits, have been found in the Netherlands. Since these communities of hunter-gatherers moved regularly to follow the food sources, they roasted or maybe smoked the meat from their kills to carry with them. Cooked food is easier to preserve and carry, and could be stored for lean times when the hunt was not successful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/4119\" target=\"blank\">The aurochs</a>, a popular albeit challenging target for these peoples due to their delectable size and bad temper, would not survive the habitat loss ushered in by farming and domesticated cattle.

Although they were dropped into a mass grave, they weren\u2019t treated disrespectfully. The bodies were all clothed in tunics, hats and heavy socks, some of them wrapped in shrouds, some of them placed in bags. Their heads were wrapped so the jaws wouldn\u2019t gape open, their clothes tied between their legs so their genitals wouldn\u2019t be exposed for all eternity, and their hands folded together as in prayer. Some of them still landed kinda funny, including one fellow who was found doing a headstand with his legs open.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/praying-mummy.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Mummy with hands clasped in prayer\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-11821\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/praying-mummy-150x112.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/praying-mummy-150x112.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/praying-mummy-300x225.png 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/praying-mummy.png 545w\" title=\"Mummy with hands clasped in prayer\" width=\"150\"/></a>Mass graves don\u2019t usually survive complete with mummified human remains, clothes, and artifacts like lockets and crosses, even a letter; this discovery will allow archaeologists to trace 300 years of social history in the tiny burg.

The pre-sale estimate was $300,000 \u2013 $400,000, but Florida billionaire, alternative energy investor and America\u2019s Cup winner William Koch finally <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/26/us-auction-billykid-photo-idUSTRE75O1HX20110626\" target=\"blank\">took it home for eight times that amount</a>.</p>\n<p>According to one of Billy\u2019s old girlfriends, the tintype was taken by a traveling photographer on the street outside Beaver Smith\u2019s saloon in Fort Sumner, New Mexico in 1879 or 1880. One of the things that makes it such an iconic image of Billy and the old West is that it\u2019s not a posed and polished studio portrait, but rather captures the Kid wearing his crumpled hat, thick sweater, thoroughly lived-in boots and baggy pants, with his 1873 Winchester carbine rifle in his left hand and his Colt .45 single action revolver in a holster on his right hip. (This picture is the reason Billy the Kid was widely thought to have been left-handed during much of the 20th century, when in fact tintypes are mirror images so really he was holding the Winchester in his right hand.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Dan_Dedrick_Tintype.gif\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Tintype of Dan Dedrick, ca. 1880, included in the auction lot\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11810\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Dan_Dedrick_Tintype-s.gif\" title=\"Tintype of Dan Dedrick, ca. 1880, included in the auction lot\" width=\"200\"/></a>The camera used to take the photo was multilense, so four identical pictures were made at the same time. This is the only one known to have survived. Billy gave it to his cattle rustling colleague Dan Dedrick, who claimed he was present when the photo was taken, and who in turn gave it to his nephew Frank L. Upham in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>The image was already famous by then. It was first printed in the Boston Illustrated Police News, January 8, 1881, when the Kid was still alive and in the Santa Fe jail that he would break out of, killing two deputies. The year after that Pat Garrett, the sheriff who had shot the Kid dead three months after that jailbreak, published the picture in his biography <a href=\"http://arthursclassicnovels.com/western3/billyk10.html\" target=\"blank\"><em>The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid</em></a>.</p>\n<p>As famous as it was, within a few decades the original tintype appeared to be lost. It wasn\u2019t until 1986 that the Upham family announced that they had lovingly kept their tintype of Billy the Kid and that they were donating it to the Lincoln County Heritage Trust in New Mexico. That is the only time the tintype was ever on public display.</p>\n<p>There was a stipulation, however, that if the Trust ever dissolved, then ownership of the picture would revert to the Upham family. The Trust ceased to exist in 1998 and the tintype went back to the Uphams. They put it up for auction Saturday along with an 1880 tintype of Dan Dedrick, six other pictures of Dedrick and his family, plus letters and documentation, all included in the lot.</p>\n<p>Koch intends to loan the iconic picture to several small museums before taking it home to \u201cjust enjoy.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Only authenticated pic of Billy the Kid sells for $2.3 million\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11800\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11800#comments\">57 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-11781\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11781\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Civil War sub H.

Hunley upright, starboard side showing\" width=\"200\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/10381\" target=\"blank\">After more than a decade</a> spent trussed in a cradle on her starboard side, the Civil War submarine <em>H.L. Hunley</em> is upright for the first time since she sank under mysterious circumstances off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina on February 17, 1864. She was raised in 2000 from the Atlantic floor at a 45-degree angle, the position in which she was found, and kept in 30 slings at that same angle in a conservation tank ever since.</p>\n<p>Engineers were concerned that moving the 7-ton, 40-foot vessel upright would put unbearable stress on the rusted iron keel. They weren\u2019t sure what they\u2019d find on the starboard side which had been buried in the sand for 136 years and then obscured from view by the angle. In order to properly conserve the ship, however, they had to have access to that starboard side. The conservation team thus spent two years planning and testing how best to rotate the vessel without harming it, using 3D computer modelling to simulate the procedure.</p>\n<p>The straps that were holding the Hunley in place were replaced one at a time with slings that had hand controls allowing for tiny movement so the team could lower the port side gradually until the sub was upright. On Wednesday, June 22, engineers and conservators began rotating the submarine, adjusting the slings by two millimeter increments to shift it gradually upright.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The process to rotate the sub was at times slow and tedious and others nerve-racking. The painstaking project took three days, with scientists rotating the submarine mere millimeters at a time. After each incremental move, a series of computer monitors were checked to ensure even weight distribution with no major stresses on the submarine. </p>\n<p>Two technical issues added hours, and a little tension, to the project. At one point, the bow started to dip too much toward the ground and scientists had to make modifications to get the submarine level again. They had anticipated the potential of this occurring though had hoped it would not affect the rotation.</p>\n<p>Also, a laser monitoring system \u2013 critical to detecting any potential warping or damage that scientists were desperately trying to avoid \u2013 had to be adjusted one morning, causing a delay of a few hours for rotation work to start.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even with the technical glitches, the laser never strayed more than a millimeter out of its target range, which is a remarkably successful result even for automation, never mind for a rotation process that relied entirely on humans winching 30 slings for three days.</p>\n<p>Behold the raising of the <em>Hunley</em> in neat-o time-lapse video:</p>\n<p><code>[kml_flashembed movie=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/5v2cBAkCHHU\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\" wmode=\"transparent\" /]</code></p>\n<p>For the first time scientists are now able to examine the starboard side for indications of why and how the submarine sank right after successfully torpedoing the <em>USS Housatonic</em>, a Union warship enforcing the blockade of Charleston harbor, making the <em>Hunley</em> the first sub to sink an enemy ship in combat. There are large hull breaches on the starboard fin, as expected, and it is smooth-sided and shiny instead of encased in concretions like the port side. We don\u2019t know yet if the breaches are man-made or the result of ocean and sand erosion or a combination of both.</p>\n<p>Next week the team will lower the <em>Hunley</em> onto keel blocks on the way to eventual removal of the slings and truss that have kept the sub suspended for 11 years. Once the slings are gone, conservators will be able to remove all the concretions that coat the hull in preparation for a chemical bath that will restore the vessel\u2019s iron hull.</p>\n<p>The <em>H.L. Hunley</em> was a hand-powered submarine designed by Horace Lawson Hunley, James R. McClintock and Baxter Watson. Mr. Hunley sponsored her construction in 1863. She sank while moored to a steamer on August 29, 1863, killing five members of her crew, but was salvaged and put back to work on diving trials. This time Horace Lawson Hunley was on board and when she failed to surface after a trial on October 15, 1863, he died along with the rest of the crew.</p>\n<p>The tragedies did not deter the Confederate navy. They fished her up again and repaired her, this time ordering the crew to remain on the surface instead of diving. It actually worked, and the <em>Hunley</em> made her historic hit, sinking the <em>USS Housatonic</em> with a spar torpedo.  Then something went wrong and the submarine went down for her big sleep. The remains of her crew were recovered and buried in 2004.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Cutaway-drawings-based-on-sketches-by-William-A.-Alexander-who-directed-her-construction..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Cutaway drawings based on sketches by William A.

The bell was commissioned from Revere\u2019s foundry by the Westborough town fathers for the town\u2019s first meeting house. It was later moved to the Congregational meeting house, and then to the First Baptist Church when the new Congregational church was built with too small a belfry to fit the bell. The Baptists rented the bell from the Congregationalists for $2.60 a year before eventually buying it outright.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Westborough-First-Baptist-Church-belfry.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Westborough First Baptist Church belfry, crane in place to remove bell\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-11771\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Westborough-First-Baptist-Church-belfry-150x150.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Westborough-First-Baptist-Church-belfry-150x150.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Westborough-First-Baptist-Church-belfry-298x300.png 298w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Westborough-First-Baptist-Church-belfry.png 401w\" title=\"Westborough First Baptist Church belfry, crane in place to remove bell\" width=\"150\"/></a>The First Baptist Church of Westborough closed its doors in 2007 due to declining attendance and increasing costs. The town tried to scrape up enough money to buy the bell and keep it in town, but were not able to raise sufficient funds. The bell was appraised by Skinners auction house at one million dollars. We don\u2019t know how much the Old South Meeting House paid for it, but the museum\u2019s executive director Emily Curran says it was considerably less than that.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Old-South-Meeting-House.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Old South Meeting House\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-11772\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Old-South-Meeting-House-99x150.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Old-South-Meeting-House-99x150.png 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Old-South-Meeting-House-198x300.png 198w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Old-South-Meeting-House.png 470w\" title=\"Old South Meeting House\" width=\"99\"/></a>But the 876-pound iron bell, which Westborough town fathers purchased for $2.69 in 1801 from Revere\u2019s foundry, might acquire even more historical significance in its new home.</p>\n<p>It is one of the oldest Revere bells in existence \u2014 older than the bell at the Paul Revere House.

The steeple was restored in 2009, including a thorough restoration of the clock, made in 1766 by renowned clock and watchmaker Gawen Brown. The historic clock, which after its completion was on display at Faneuil Hall until it was installed at the Old South Meeting House in 1770, was dismantled gear by gear, then taken offsite in painter\u2019s buckets to be cleaned and fixed. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Restored-clock-gears.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Restored clock\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-11773\" height=\"139\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Restored-clock-gears-150x139.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Restored-clock-gears-150x139.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Restored-clock-gears-300x278.png 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Restored-clock-gears.png 507w\" title=\"Restored clock\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was put back together in the steeple and is now back to its former glory. It\u2019s New England\u2019s oldest tower clock in continuing operation in its original location.</p>\n<p>The bell will be polished and its original yoke, wheel and frame restored. Once the bell is mounted in its new home this fall, it will become the third Revere bell on the <a href=\"http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/\" target=\"blank\">Freedom Trail</a>, and most delightfully for Bostonians, it will ring again every hour on the hour. It has a lovely tone, too, which you can hear a muted version of in this video:</p>\n<p><code>[kml_flashembed movie=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Ans3zC_j7XQ\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\" wmode=\"transparent\" /]</code></p>\n<p>What you see there are Westborough residents Mallory Shane and her mother Mary Batties ringing the 1801 bell by striking the clapper against the side. The bell was on the back of the truck that brought it to Boston, so the video captures the last time the Paul Revere bell rang in Westborough.</p>\n<p>The next time it\u2019s heard again will be in the historic center of Boston.

Although archaeologists have known the tomb was there since 1999, they haven\u2019t been able to explore it because a later pyramid (called Temple XX) built on top was structurally unsound so any routing around under the foundations could have resulted in cave-ins or worse.\n<p>The team ran a two-inch camcorder through a 6-inch square hole on the roof of the vaulted tomb. It dropped 16.4 feet into the funerary chamber and immediately captured a vivid crimson paint on the walls. Further inside the camera revealed murals of nine human figures outlined in black against the blood-red background. The tomb also holds eleven vessels, probably once containing funerary offerings, and fragments of jade and shell that were probably part of the elaborate funeral attire.</p>\n<p>There was no sarcophagus. Archaeologists think the body may have been placed directly on the floor.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Features of the funerary chamber, as declared by Dra Martha Cuevas, indicate that the osseous rests could correspond to a sacred ruler of Palenque, probably one of the beginners of the dynasty.  </p>\n<p>According to the temporality determined by INAH specialists for the mortuary precinct, the osseous remains could correspond to one of these ajau or lords: K\u2019uk\u2019 Bahlam I, first ruler of the city; a lord who\u2019s name has not been translated but some authors call him Ch\u2019away; Butz\u2019 Aj Sak Chiik; Ahkal Mo\u2019 Naab\u2019 I; K\u2019an Joy Chitam I, or Ahkal Mo\u2019 Naab\u2019 II, who was enthroned in 565 AD.</p>\n<p>Archaeologist Martha Cuevas mentioned that although the precinct has not been excavated, it can be deduced parting from the type of ceramic and mural painting of the mortuary chamber that Temple 20 was built near 400-550 of the Common Era, at the Early Classic period.</p></blockquote>\n<p>University of Texas at Austin Mayan epigraphy expert David Stuart thinks the date and ancestral figures painted on the wall may be evidence that the tomb belonged to a famous female ruler of Palenque, Ix Yohl Ik\u2019nal.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the videocamera footage taken inside the tomb.

The archaeological survey of the area had been completed months earlier when archaeologist Giles Emery of <a href=\"http://www.norvicarchaeology.com/\" target=\"blank\">Norvic Archaeology</a> got a call from one of the backhoe operators saying he\u2019d seen a skull in a foundation hole over 16 feet below ground level, far deeper than normal burials even from the ancient layers. Emery returned to the site and when the machine pushed aside a clump of dirt, they saw a tight mass of human skeletons which had been dumped into the well. They were shoved in so close together that at first Emery thought there were three or four bodies. It was only after further excavation that he realized there were so many more.</p>\n<p>Eleven of the 17 bodies were children between the ages of two and 15, five of them below the age of five. The positions in which they were found indicated many of them had been dropped into the well from their ankles, the adults first. There was no obvious cause of death detected in the initial osteological examination, although some of the bones did show signs of malnutrition and non-fatal trauma like healed minor fractures and arthritis. Radiocarbon testing and some pottery sherds found in the well dated the bodies to the 12th or 13th centuries.</p>\n<p>It was a mysterious, unique find. No other pile of bodies shoved into a well has ever been found in the UK. There was a consecrated cemetery within view of the well and the Jewish neighborhood a few steps away, so why had these people been thrown away like trash instead of buried according to religious custom? Even common graves and plague pits are at least holes in the ground.</p>\n<p>Recently the BBC program <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf\" target=\"blank\">History Cold Case</a> became involved, bringing the University of Dundee team on board to perform cutting edge forensic examinations of the bones. They were able to eliminate disease as a cause of death. Bubonic plague was still a hundred years away at the time of death, and there was no evidence of any other fatal illness like leprosy or tuberculosis in the bones.</p>\n<p>It was DNA expert Dr. Ian Barnes who found the smoking gun: five of the individuals had retrievable, testable DNA and it indicated that they were Jewish. The mitochondrial DNA \u2014 DNA that remains the same transmitted down the female line \u2014 of all five people matched, so they were family members. Stable isotope analysis, which uses the trace elements found in the bones to determine diet and migration patterns during their lifetime, indicated that the skeletons were from the Norwich area.</p>\n<p>Norwich had a well-established Jewish community from 1135 until King Edward I expelled all the Jews from England in 1290. That\u2019s not to say they were embraced as fellow men and brothers. When 150 Jews were killed in York in 1190, Norwich followed suit with a massacre of its own. Only the Jews who had fled to the castle survived. In the 1230s, there were a number of Jews executed because of a rumored child abduction, your classic blood libel.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a striking view of how Jews were seen not just by the population of Norwich but by the government, which had no problem at all borrowing money from Jews while also taxing them at sky-high rates and stealing/confiscating their property. It\u2019s a drawing found on an Exchequer Roll, a document that lists tax payments made by the Jews of Norwich in 1233, during the reign of King Henry III.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Anti-semitic-cartoon-from-Norwich-tax-record.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Anti-Semitic cartoon from Norwich tax record\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11733\" height=\"177\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Anti-semitic-cartoon-from-Norwich-tax-record-1024x409.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Anti-semitic-cartoon-from-Norwich-tax-record-1024x409.png 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Anti-semitic-cartoon-from-Norwich-tax-record-150x60.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Anti-semitic-cartoon-from-Norwich-tax-record-300x120.png 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Anti-semitic-cartoon-from-Norwich-tax-record.png 1257w\" title=\"Anti-Semitic cartoon from Norwich tax record\" width=\"440\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>That three-headed monster with the crown towering over the center of the drawing is Isaac fil Jurnet, a wealthy Jewish moneylender from Norwich who was banker to King Henry, the Abbot and monks of Westminster, the Bishop of Norwich and many, many other movers and shakers. The man and woman facing each other beneath him with Satan between them are Mosse Mokke and his wife Abigail both of whom were employed as debt collectors by Isaac. On the left there\u2019s a poor Christian monk, his scales full of coin that Isaac is trying to wrest from him using one of the many devils at his command.

There are all kinds of ancient depictions of mastodons and mammoths on cave walls and engraved on bones in Europe, but even though we know from the fossil record that proboscideans (trunked animals) existed in the Americas, this is the first human representation of one found.</p>\n<p>Fossil aficionado James Kennedy discovered the bone in 2006 or 2007 (he can\u2019t quite recall) and put it in a cabinet under his sink where it remained until 2009 when he fished it out and dusted it off. It was only after cleaning it that he saw the engraving and contacted scientists at the University of Florida, the Smithsonian\u2019s Museum Conservation Institute and National Museum of Natural History who took custody of the object and began to study. Kennedy told <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090610-oldest-art-mammoth-picture.html\" target=\"blank\">National Geographic</a> in 2009:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI had no idea it was this big of a fuss. [When I heard] there was nothing else like it in the Western Hemisphere, that\u2019s when my heart kind of stopped.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Initial analysis performed by the researchers consistently pointed to both fossil and engraving being genuine and ancient, but it has taken a full two years for the team to complete the study and publish the final results. Their initial departure point was skepticism because nothing of its kind had been found before, and even if the fossil was genuine, the engraving could well have been a modern hoax modeled after similar ones in Europe.</p>\n<p>Kennedy found the bone near the Old Vero site, the spot where geologist Elias Howard Sellards found human bones lying side-by-side with the bones of extinct Ice Age animals in an excavation between 1913 and 1916. He concluded that humans had hunted animals at Vero Beach during the last Ice Age, but his claims have been disputed ever since.</p>\n<p>The team compared the elemental composition of the engraved bone to other comparable fossils discovered at the Old Vero site. Rare earth element analysis indicated the fossil was ancient and originated at or around the Old Vero site. Since mammoths, mastodons and giant sloths died out in the area about 13,000 years ago, the bone must be older than that. Forensic examination of the engraving indicated that it was not recent, but rather aged and mineralized along with the bone.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Optical microscopy results show no discontinuity in coloration between the carved grooves and the surrounding material indicating that both surfaces aged simultaneously. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the edges of the inscription are worn and show no signs of being incised recently or that the grooves were made with metal tools. In addition, the backscattered SEM images suggest there is no discontinuity in the distribution of light and heavy elements between the scribed region and the surrounding bone indicating that both surfaces aged in the same environment. This is very different from an intentional mark made on the bone for comparison. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) shows that the surface contains significant amounts of calcium, phosphorus, oxygen, and carbon typical of a mineralized bone surface. Examination of a cast and mold of the incised bone by Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) also provided no evidence that the engraving was made recently.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The data are thus conclusive enough for the researchers to announce that this is indeed the first mastodon/mammoth representation ever found in the Americas.</p>\n<p>The bone is still squirreled away in the lab for now, but you can see a cast of it at the <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/\" target=\"blank\">Florida Museum of Natural History</a> in Gainesville. Its future is in question. In 2009, Kennedy said he was undecided about whether to sell it or donate it to the Florida Museum of Natural History. Here\u2019s hoping he\u2019s made up his mind to do the right thing and give it (or sell it, for that matter) to a museum.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/full-bone-with-blowup.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Mastodon bone with inscription detail blow out\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11713\" height=\"229\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/full-bone-with-blowup-1024x544.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/full-bone-with-blowup-1024x544.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/full-bone-with-blowup-150x79.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/full-bone-with-blowup-300x159.jpg 300w\" title=\"Mastodon bone with inscription detail blow out\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"First Ice Age engraving of trunked animal found in US\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11709\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11709#comments\">21 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-11685\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11685\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Celebrate Solstice with Druids, the Welsh and LIFE\">Celebrate Solstice with Druids, the Welsh and LIFE</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, June 21st, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_3268852.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Druid with a monocle at Stonehenge\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11691\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_3268852-197x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_3268852-197x300.jpg 197w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_3268852-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_3268852.jpg 673w\" title=\"Druid with a monocle at Stonehenge\" width=\"197\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.life.com\" target=\"blank\">LIFE.com</a> has collated yet another excellent gallery dedicated to the celebration of the summer solstice in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.life.com/gallery/50231/druids-mystery-faith-myth#index/0\" target=\"blank\">Druids: Mystery, Faith, Myth</a> stars some nattily attired modern druids celebrating the solstice at Stonehenge, including one gentleman with a monocle whom I absolutely adore. If anyone can tell me who he is, I\u2019d love to know. He must be a prominent figure in the Neo-Druid movement of the 1950s, because the LIFE gallery has another shot of him shaking hands with a second Druid on the Isle of Mull in Scotland in September of 1954 during what was considered the first gathering of Druids in Scotland since antiquity.</p>\n<p>We know very little about actual ancient Druids. They didn\u2019t leave written texts behind, so all we have to go on in terms of contemporary sources are Roman and they are uniformly disparaging. Julius Caesar <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/gallic.6.6.html\" target=\"blank\">describes the Druids in his <em>Gallic Wars</em></a> thus:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The nation of all the Gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious rites; and on that account they who are troubled with unusually severe diseases, and they who are engaged in battles and dangers, either sacrifice men as victims, or vow that they will sacrifice them, and employ the Druids as the performers of those sacrifices; because they think that unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man, the mind of the immortal gods can not be rendered propitious, and they have sacrifices of that kind ordained for national purposes. Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the oblation of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offense, is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The Roman sources all indicate that the Druids performed human sacrifices. Again, we have little to no evidence of this, and even if it were true that the invading Romans saw Druidic ritual human sacrifice, they could have been performed in response to the destructive trauma of invasion rather than as a regular part of Druidic practice. Certainly the Druids today reject this characterization as an aspersion cast by ancient enemies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_50501885.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Princess Elizabeth led into the Sacred Circle of Bards, 1946\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11693\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_50501885-252x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_50501885-252x300.jpg 252w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_50501885-126x150.jpg 126w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_50501885.jpg 863w\" title=\"Princess Elizabeth led into the Sacred Circle of Bards, 1946\" width=\"252\"/></a>Modern Druid rituals and beliefs spring from a more recent tradition, the late 18th, early 19th century Romantic fascination with ancient Britain and its mystery religions. It is that tradition we see then-Princess Elizabeth celebrating in the LIFE picture from August 6, 1946 where she is being led into the Sacred Circle of Bards at the national Eisteddfod at Mountain Ash, Glamorgan, Wales. We owe the fantastic spectacle of the future Queen of England and Defender of the Faith donning the green robes of the novitiate and being invested a bard in a Druidic ceremony to one man: Edward Williams, a.k.a. <a href=\"http://iolomorganwg.wales.ac.uk/\" target=\"blank\">Iolo Morganwg</a>, stonemason, poet, Welsh nationalist, manuscript collector and most able forger.</p>\n<p>Born in 1747 in Llancarfan in Glamorgan, southern Wales, Williams was a political radical, religious dissenter and pacifist Jacobin who believed Wales should have its own national institutions celebrating its unique culture and heritage. As a young man working as a stonemason in London, he had seen Welsh culture widely disparaged. He believed the Welsh poets were the direct descendants of the Celtic druids, and he set about writing so glorious a history it would put the English to shame, even if he had to forge it, by gum.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Iolo-Morganwg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Iolo Morganwg\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11696\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Iolo-Morganwg-190x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Iolo-Morganwg-190x300.jpg 190w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Iolo-Morganwg-95x150.jpg 95w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Iolo-Morganwg.jpg 353w\" title=\"Iolo Morganwg\" width=\"190\"/></a>In support of that vision, in 1789 he published a collection of poems by 14th-century Welsh bard Dafydd ap Gwilym. Included were many newly-discovered poems Morganwg had \u201cfound,\u201d i.e., written himself. The book was popular and inspired him to return to London to take the next step in promoting Welsh culture.</p>\n<p>On the 21st of June, Summer Solstice, 1792, Iolo Morganwg held a ceremony on Primrose Hill in London founding the <a href=\"http://www.gorsedd.org/\" target=\"blank\">Gorsedd of Bards</a> (in Welsh the <em>Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain</em>), a community of Welsh bards dedicated to preserving Welsh language, poetry and music. He developed the ritual for the ceremony from druidic rites described in ancient manuscripts from his collection that were later found to have been the product of his own very fertile, laudanum-addicted imagination.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t just the English disdain that he was combating with his founding of the Gorsedd. There was intra-Welsh snobbery too, courtesy of northern Wales (Gwynedd), which saw itself as the purest expression of the Welsh poetic tradition. Morganwg\u2019s manuscripts were evidence that only in southern Wales, in his own region of Glamorgan, was druidic lore preserved intact from ancient times, through centuries of oppression from Rome, the Christian Church and England.</p>\n<p>He kind of pulled it off, too, especially by linking the Gorsedd with what would become the national festival of Wales, the Eisteddfod. The Eisteddfod is a folk festival celebrating Welsh language, music, poetry and literature that traces its lineage back to a grand gathering of musicians and poets held by Lord Rhys of Cardigan in 1176. From that early progenitor, a vast number of provincial gatherings proliferated over the centuries, sponsored by local lords all over Wales.</p>\n<p>In 1819 the eisteddfod festivals and the Gorsedd of Bards came together, thanks again to Iolo Morgannwg, now 72 years old and still with a keen eye towards promoting Welsh civilization. He traveled to the eisteddfod being held at the Ivy Bush Inn in Carmarthen and drew a Gorsedd circle \u2014 meant to be a sacred circle of standing stones a la Stonehenge \u2014 on the lawn using a handful of pebbles. In the circle, he invested the notables present as bards and druids, including the local bishop and festival patron, Bishop Thomas Burgess of St. David\u2019s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Archdruid-crown-designed-by-Hubert-von-Herkomer-for-Newport-Proclamation-Ceremony-1896.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Archdruid crown designed by Hubert von Herkomer for Newport Proclamation Ceremony 1896\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11701\" height=\"146\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Archdruid-crown-designed-by-Hubert-von-Herkomer-for-Newport-Proclamation-Ceremony-1896-300x219.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Archdruid-crown-designed-by-Hubert-von-Herkomer-for-Newport-Proclamation-Ceremony-1896-300x219.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Archdruid-crown-designed-by-Hubert-von-Herkomer-for-Newport-Proclamation-Ceremony-1896-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Archdruid-crown-designed-by-Hubert-von-Herkomer-for-Newport-Proclamation-Ceremony-1896.jpg 500w\" title=\"Archdruid crown designed by Hubert von Herkomer for Newport Proclamation Ceremony 1896\" width=\"200\"/></a>From then on, the Gorsedd and the eisteddfod continued to develop their relationship, and when the <a href=\"http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/\">National Eisteddfod</a> was established in 1861, the Gorsedd\u2019s Druidic rituals, now considerably more elaborate than they had been at that first Primrose Hill ceremony of 1792, played a central role, providing high drama and pageantry in the medal ceremonies and in the investiture of important political, religious and cultural figures into the Gorsedd in recognition of their contributions to the nation, language and culture of Wales.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a remarkable feat of cultural transformation Iolo Morganwg accomplished, going from naked English contempt for the Welsh to the future Queen herself donning green robes and joining the Gorsedd Circle in a celebration of Welsh language, culture and civilization.

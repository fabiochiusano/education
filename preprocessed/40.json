{"content": "comments By Michael Galarnyk , Data Scientist A portfolio is one way to show people you are that data science unicorn. How do you get a job in data science?\u00a0 Knowing enough statistics, machine learning, programming, etc to be able to get a job is difficult. One thing I have found lately is quite a few people\u00a0 may \u00a0 have the required skills to get a job, but no portfolio . While a resume matters, having a portfolio of public evidence of your data science skills can do wonders for your job prospects. Even if you have a referral,\u00a0 the ability to show potential employers what you can do instead of just telling them you can do something is important . This post will include links to where various data science professionals (data science managers, data scientists, social media icons, or some combination thereof) and others talk about what to have in a portfolio and how to get noticed. With that, let\u2019s get started! \u00a0 The Importance of a Portfolio \u00a0 Besides the benefit of learning by making a portfolio, a portfolio is important as it can help get you employment. For the purpose of this article, let\u2019s define a portfolio as public evidence of your data science skills. I got this definition from\u00a0 David Robinson \u00a0Chief Data Scientist at DataCamp when he was interviewed by\u00a0 Marissa Gemma \u00a0on\u00a0 Mode Analytics blog . He was asked about landing his first job in industry and said, The most effective strategy for me was doing public work. I blogged and did a lot of open source development late in my PhD, and these helped give public evidence of my data science skills. But the way I landed my first industry job was a particularly noteworthy example of the public work. During my PhD I was an active answerer on the programming site Stack Overflow, and an engineer at the company came across one of my answers (one explaining the intuition behind the beta distribution). He was so impressed with the answer that he got in touch with me [through Twitter], and a few interviews later\u00a0 I was hired . You may think of this as a freak occurrence, but you will often find that the more active you are, the greater chance you have of something like this occuring. From\u00a0 David\u2019s blog post , The more public work you do, the higher the chance of a freak accident like that: of someone noticing your work and pointing you towards a job opportunity, or of someone who\u2019s interviewing you having heard of work you\u2019ve done. People often forget that software engineers and data scientists also Google their issues. If these same people have their problems solved by reading your public work, they might think better of you and reach out to you. \u00a0 Portfolio to get around an Experience Requirement \u00a0 Even for an entry level role, most companies want to have people with at least a little bit of real life experience. You may have seen memes like the one below. The question is how do you get experience if you need experience to get your first job? If there is an answer, the answer is\u00a0 projects . Projects are perhaps the best substitutes for work experience or as\u00a0 Will Stanton \u00a0said, If you don\u2019t have any experience as a data scientist, then you absolutely\u00a0 have to do independent projects. In fact, when\u00a0 Jonathan Nolis \u00a0 interviews candidates , he wants to hear about a description of a recent problem/project that you have faced. I want to hear about a project they\u2019ve worked on recently. I ask them about how the project started, how they determined it was worth time and effort, their process, and their results. I also ask them about what they learned from the project. I gain a lot from answers to this question: if they can tell a narrative, how the problem related to the bigger picture, and how they tackled the hard work of doing something. If you don\u2019t have some data science related work experience, the best option here is to talk about a data science project that you have worked on. \u00a0 Types of Projects to Include in a Portfolio \u00a0 Data science is such a broad field that it is hard to know what kind of projects hiring managers want to see.\u00a0 William Chen , a Data Science Manager at Quora, shared his thoughts on the subject at Kaggle\u2019s CareerCon 2018 ( video ). I love projects where people show that they are interested in data in a way that goes beyond homework assignments. Any sort of class final project where you explore an interesting dataset and find interesting results\u2026 Put effort into the writeup\u2026 I really like seeing really good writeups where people find interesting and novel things\u2026have some visualizations and share their work. A lot of people recognize the value of creating projects, but one issue a lot of people wonder is where do you get that interesting dataset and what do you do with it.\u00a0 Jason Goodman , Data Scientist at Airbnb, has a post\u00a0 Advice on Building Data Portfolio Projects \u00a0where he talks about many different project ideas and has good advice on what kind of datasets you should use. He also echos one of William\u2019s points about working with interesting data. I find that the best portfolio projects are less about doing fancy modeling and more about working with interesting data. A lot of people do things with financial information or Twitter data; those can work, but the data isn\u2019t inherently that interesting, so you\u2019re working uphill. One of his other points in the article is that webscraping is a great way to get interesting data. If you are interested in learning how to build your own dataset by webscraping in Python, you can see my post\u00a0 here . If you are coming from academia, it is important to note that your thesis can count as a project (a very large project). You can hear\u00a0 William Chen \u00a0talk about it\u00a0 here . Traffic Cruising Data Science for Social Good Project ( /uwescience/TrafficCruising-DSSG2017 ). This is an example of a project I personally find interesting, but there are so many interesting projects out there. Credit ( Orysya Stus ,\u00a0 Brett Bejcek ,\u00a0 Michael Vlah ,\u00a0 Anamol\u00a0Pundle ) \u00a0 Types of Projects NOT to Include in a Portfolio \u00a0 One thing I have found very common (to the point of it appearing multiple times in this blog post) in a lot of portfolio/resume advice is not to have common projects in your portfolio. Jeremie Harris \u00a0in\u00a0 The 4 fastest ways not to get hired as a data scientist \u00a0said, It\u2019s hard to think of a faster way to have your resume thrown into the \u2018definite no\u2019 pile than featuring work you did on trivial proof-of-concept datasets among your highlighted personal projects. When in doubt, here are some projects that hurt you more than they help you: * Survival classification on the\u00a0 Titanic dataset . * Hand-written digit classification on the\u00a0 MNIST dataset . * Flower species classification using the\u00a0 iris dataset . The image below shows partial examples of classification of Titanic (A), MNIST (B), and iris (C) datasets. There aren\u2019t a lot of ways to use these datasets to distinguish yourself from other applicants. Make sure to list novel projects. Titanic (A), MNIST (B), and iris (C) classification \u00a0 Portfolios are Iterative \u00a0 Favio Vazquez \u00a0has an\u00a0 excellent article \u00a0where he talked about how he got his job as a data scientist. Of course, one of his tips is to have a portfolio. Have a portfolio. If you are looking for a serious paid job in data science do some projects with real data. If you can post them on GitHub. Apart from Kaggle competitions, find something that you love or a problem you want to solve and use your knowledge to do it. One of the other interesting findings was that you always have to keep on improving as you go through the job hunt. I applied to almost 125 jobs (for real, maybe you applied for much more), I got only like 25\u201330 replies. Some of them were just: Thanks but nope. And I got almost 15 interviews. I learned from each one. Got better. I had to deal with a lot of rejection. Something I was actually not prepared to. But I loved the process of getting interviewed (not all of them to be honest). I studied a lot, programmed everyday, read a lot of articles and posts. They helped a lot. As you learn more and improve yourself, your portfolio should also be updated. This same sentiment is echoed in many other advice articles. As\u00a0 Jason Goodman \u00a0said, The project isn\u2019t done when you post it publicly. Don\u2019t be afraid to keep adding on to or editing your projects after they\u2019re published! This advice is especially true when you are looking for a job. There are many stories of successful people like\u00a0 Kelly Peng , Data Scientist at Airbnb, who really persevered and kept on working and improving. In\u00a0 one of her blog posts , she went over how many places she applied for and interviewed with. Applications: 475 Phone interviews: 50 Finished data science take-home challenges: 9 Onsite interviews: 8 Offers: 2 Time spent: 6 months She clearly applied to a lot of jobs and kept on persisting. In her article, she even mentions how you need to keep on learning from your interviewing experiences. Take note of all the interview questions you got asked, especially those questions you failed to answer. You can fail again, but don\u2019t fail at the same spot. You should always be learning and improving. *If you aren\u2019t getting interviews yet, apply for more jobs and keep on finding ways to learn and\u00a0improve. \u00a0 Incorporating Portfolio into 1 Page\u00a0Resume \u00a0 One of the ways someone finds your portfolio is often through your resume so it is worth a mention. A data science resume is a place to focus on your technical skills. Your resume is a chance to succinctly represent your qualifications and fit for that particular role. Recruiters and hiring managers skim resumes very quickly, and you only have a short time to make an impression. Improving your resume can increase your chance of getting an interview. You have to make sure every single line and every single section of your resume counts. William Chen , a Data Science Manager from Quora has\u00a0 9 Tips for making your data science resume .\u00a0 Notice in the brief summary of his points below, that projects and portfolio are points 6, 7, 8, and arguably 9 . \u00a0 1. Length : Keep it simple and one page max. This gives you the most impact for a quick skim. Recommends a simple one column resume as it is easy to skim. Sample Resume used in Video (latex:\u00a0 /sb2nov/resume ) \u00a0 2. Objective : Don\u2019t include one. They don\u2019t help you distinguish yourself from other people. They take away space from the more important things (skills, projects, experience etc). Cover letters are extremely optional unless you really personalize it. Objectives don\u2019t help you distinguish yourself from other people. A lot of them say very similar\u00a0things. \u00a0 3. Coursework : Do list\u00a0 relevant coursework \u00a0that is applicable for the job description. Examples of relevant coursework displayed on various\u00a0resumes. \u00a0 4. Skills : Don\u2019t give numerical ratings for your skills. If you want to rate yourself on your skills, use words like proficient or familiar or things like that. You can even exclude assessments altogether. Don\u2019t give numerical ratings for your\u00a0skills \u00a0 5. Skills : Do list technical skills that the job description mentions. The order you list your skills in can suggest what you are best at. Examples of how you can list your skills on your\u00a0resume \u00a0 6. Projects : Don\u2019t list common projects or homework. They aren\u2019t that helpful in distinguishing you from other applicants. List projects that are novel. \u00a0 7. Projects : \u00a0 Show results and include links. If you participated in Kaggle competition, put percentile rank as it helps the person reading your resume understand where you are in the competition. In projects sections, there is always room for links to writeups and papers as they let the hiring manager or recruiter dig in deeper (bias to real world messy problems where you learn something new). Good example project\u00a0sections Notice that in one of the projects sections above, a person has an additional link to a blog that lets the recruiter or hiring manager find out more. This is one way to link to various parts of your portfolio from your resume. \u00a0 8. Portfolio:\u00a0 Fill our your online presence. The most basic is a LinkedIn profile. It is kind of like an extended resume. Github and Kaggle profiles can help show off your work. Fill out each profile and include links to other sites. Fill out descriptions for your GitHub repositories. Include links to your knowledge sharing profiles/blog (Medium, Quora). Data science specifically is about knowledge sharing and communicating what the data means to other people. You don\u2019t have to do all of them, but pick a few and do it (More on this later). \u00a0 9. Experience : Tailor your experience towards the job. Experience is the core of your resume, but if you don\u2019t have work experience what do you do? Focus your resume on independent projects, like capstone projects, independent research, thesis work, or Kaggle competitions. These are substitutes for work experience if you don\u2019t have work experience to put on your resume. Avoid putting irrelevant experience on your resume. If you want to know hear data science managers go over portfolios and resumes, here are links to Kaggle\u2019s CareerCon 2018 ( video ,\u00a0 resumes reviewed ). \u00a0 Importance of Social\u00a0Media \u00a0 This is very similar to the Importance of a Portfolio section, just divided into subsections. Having a Github page, a Kaggle profile, a Stack Overflow, etc can provide support for your resume. Having online profiles filled out can be a good signal for hiring managers. As\u00a0 David Robinson \u00a0phrases it, Generally, when I\u2019m evaluating a candidate, I\u2019m excited to see what they\u2019ve shared publicly, even if it\u2019s not polished or finished. And sharing anything is almost always better than sharing nothing. The reason why data scientists like seeing public work is as Will Stanton said, Data scientists use these tools to share their own work and find answers to questions. If you use these tools, then you are signaling to data scientists that you are one of them, even if you haven\u2019t ever worked as a data scientist. A lot of Data science is about communication and presenting data so it is good to have these online profiles. Besides from the fact that these platforms help provide valuable experience, they can also help you get noticed and lead people to your resume. People can and do find your resume online through various sources (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Kaggle, Medium, Stack Overflow, Tableau Public, Quora, Youtube, etc). You will even find that different types of social media feed into eachother. \u00a0 Github \u00a0 Github profiles of\u00a0 Jennifer Bryan \u00a0and\u00a0 Yuan (Terry)\u00a0Tang A Github profile is a powerful signal that you are a competent data scientist. In the projects section of a resume, people often leave links to their GitHub where the code is stored for their projects. You can also have writeups and markdown there. GitHub lets people see what you have built and how you have built it. At some companies, hiring managers look at an applicants GitHub. It is another way to show employers you aren\u2019t a false positive. If you take the time to develop your GitHub profile, you can be better evaluated than others. It is worth mentioning that you need to have some sort of README.md with a description of your project as a lot of\u00a0 data science is about communicating results . Make sure the README.md file clearly describes what your project is, what it does, and how to run your code. \u00a0 Kaggle \u00a0 Participating in Kaggle competitions, creating a kernel, and contributing to discussions are ways to show some competency as a data scientist. It is important to emphasize that Kaggle is not like an industry project as\u00a0 Colleen Farrelly , mentions in this\u00a0 quora question . Kaggle competitions take care of coming up with a task, acquire data for you, and clean it into some usable form. What it does is give you practice analyzing data and coming up with a model.\u00a0 Reshama Shaikh \u00a0has a post\u00a0 To Kaggle Or Not \u00a0where she talked about the value of Kaggle competitions. From her post, It is true, doing one Kaggle competition does not qualify someone to be a data scientist. Neither does taking one class or attending one conference tutorial or analyzing one dataset or reading one book in data science. Working on  adds to your experience and augments your portfolio. It is a complement to your other projects, not the sole litmus test of one\u2019s data science skillset. It is also true that there is a good reason why\u00a0 Kaggle Grandmasters continue to participate in Kaggle competitions . \u00a0 Linkedin \u00a0 Unlike a resume, which is confined by length, a LinkedIn profile allows you to describe your projects and work experience in more depth. Udacity has a\u00a0 guide on making a good LinkedIn profile . An important part of LinkedIn is their search tool and for you to show up, you must have\u00a0 relevant keywords \u00a0 inyour profile. Recruiters often search for people on LinkedIn. LinkedIn allows you to see which companies have searched for you and who has viewed your profile. Checking where your searchers work and how many times people have viewed your\u00a0profile. Besides companies finding you and sending you messages on your availability, LinkedIn also has many features like\u00a0 Ask for a Referral .\u00a0 Jason Goodman \u00a0in his article\u00a0 Advice on Applying to Data Science Jobs \u00a0uses LinkedIn to\u00a0 indirectly ask for referrals. I never, never, never applied to any companies without an introduction to someone who worked at the company\u2026once I was interested in a company, I would use LinkedIn to find a first- or second- degree connection at the company. I would write to that connection, asking to talk to them about their experience at the company and, if possible, whether they\u2019d be able to connect me to someone on the Data Science team. Whenever I could, I did in-person meetings (coffee or lunch) instead of phone calls. As an aside, Trey Causey recently wrote\u00a0 a great post on how to ask for just these kinds of meetings. I would never ask for a job directly, but they would usually ask for my resume and offer to submit me as an internal referral, or put me in touch with a hiring manager. If they didn\u2019t seem comfortable doing so...I\u2019d just thank them for their time and move on. Notice that he doesn\u2019t right away ask for a referral. While common job advice when applying to a company is to get a referral, it is VERY IMPORTANT to note that you still need a portfolio, experience, or some sort of proof you can do a job. Jason even mentions the importance of a portfolio in that and\u00a0 other articles he has written . Aman Dalmia \u00a0learned something similar by\u00a0 Interviewing at Multiple AI Companies and Startups . Networking is\u00a0 NOT\u00a0 messaging people to place a referral for you .\u00a0 When I was starting off, I did this mistake way too often until I stumbled upon\u00a0 this \u00a0excellent article by\u00a0 Mark Meloon ,\u00a0 where he talks about the importance of building a\u00a0 real connection with people by offering our help first. One other point he had is that LinkedIn is great for getting your content/portfolio out. Another important step in networking is to get your content out. For example, if you\u2019re good at something, blog about it and share that blog on Facebook and LinkedIn .\u00a0 Not only does this help others,\u00a0 it helps you as well. \u00a0 Medium and/or Other Blogging Platforms \u00a0 Having some form of blog can be highly beneficial. A lot of data science is about communication and presenting data. Blogging is a way of practicing this and showing you can do this. Writing about a project or a data science topic allows you to share with the community as well as encourages you to write out your work process and thoughts. This is a useful skill when interviewing. As\u00a0 David Robinson \u00a0said, A blog is your chance to practice the relevant skills. Data cleaning : One of the benefits of working with a variety of datasets is that you learn to take data \u201cas it comes\u201d, whether it\u2019s in the form of a\u00a0 supplementary file from a journal article \u00a0or a\u00a0 movie script Statistics : Working with unfamiliar data lets you put statistical methods into practice, and writing posts that communicate and teach concepts helps build your own understanding Machine learning : There\u2019s a big difference between having used a predictive algorithm once and having used it on a variety of problems, while understanding why you\u2019d choose one over another Visualization : Having an audience for your graphs encourages you to start polishing them and building your personal style Communication : You gain experience writing and get practice structuring a data-driven argument. This is probably the most relevant skill that blogging develops since it\u2019s hard to practice elsewhere, and it\u2019s an essential part of any data science career By writing a blog, you are can practice communicate findings to others. It also is another form of advertising yourself. Blogs about\u00a0 Using Scrapy to Build your Own Dataset , and ironically\u00a0 Python Environment Management with Conda \u00a0have taught me a lot and have gotten me a lot of opportunities I would normally not have gotten. One of the major benefits I have found is that throughout the process of people critiquing my projects and suggesting improvements (though the comments section of the blog) makes it so interviewers aren\u2019t the first ones pointing out these same flaws. The more obvious benefit is that by making a blog you tend to read a lot more data science/machine learning blog posts and hence learn more. As for what platform to blog on, I recommend using Medium.\u00a0 Manali Shinde in her blog post\u00a0 How to Construct a Data Science Portfolio from Scratch \u00a0had a really good point on why she choose Medium for her blog. I thought of creating my own website on a platform such as WordPress or Squarespace. While those platforms are amazing to host your own portfolio, I wanted a place where I would get some visibility, and a pretty good tagging system to reach greater audiences. Luckily Medium, as we know, has those options (and it\u2019s also free). If you don\u2019t know what to write about, I suggest you look at\u00a0 David Robinson\u2019s advice . /drob \u00a0 Twitter \u00a0 Being active on Twitter is a great way to identify and interact with people in your field. You can also promote your blog on Twitter so that your portfolio can be that much more visible. There are so many opportunities to interact with people on twitter. One of them as\u00a0 Reshama Shaikh \u00a0said in her famous blog post \u201c How Do I Get My First Data Science Job? \u201d was, David Robinson \u00a0generously offers to retweet your first data science post. With 20K+ followers, that\u2019s an offer that can\u2019t be refused. Twitter can be used for other things than self promotion.\u00a0 Data Science Renee has a post \u201c How to use Twitter to Learn Data Science (or Anything) \u201d that is quite insightful about taking Twitter to learn skills. One other takeaway from her article was how much her Twitter presence helped her network and get opportunities. I have been asked to be interviewed on podcasts and blogs (some of those should be coming up soon), offered contract work, and offered free admission to a conference I unfortunately couldn\u2019t go to, but was excited to be considered for. \u201cFamous\u201d people in the industry are now coming to me to work with them in some way. \u00a0 Tableau Public \u00a0 Not every data science job uses Tableau or other BI tools. However, if you are applying to jobs where these tools are used, it is important to note that there are websites where you can put dashboards for public consumption. For example, if you say you are learning or know Tableau, put a couple dashboards on\u00a0 Tableau Public . While a lot of companies might be okay with you learning Tableau on the job, having public evidence of your Tableau skill can help. If you want to see good examples of Tableau Public profiles, please see\u00a0 Orysya Stus\u2019 \u00a0and\u00a0 Brit Cava\u2019s \u00a0profiles. \u00a0 Conclusion \u00a0 Remember a portfolio is a process. Keep on improving. Having a strong resume has long been the primary tool for job seekers to relay their skills to potential employers. These days, there is more than one way to showoff your skills and get a job. A portfolio of public evidence is a way to get opportunities that you normally wouldn\u2019t get. It is important to emphasize that a portfolio is an iterative process. As your knowledge grows, your portfolio should be updated over time. Never stop learning or growing. Even this blog post will be updated with feedback and with increasing knowledge.

to be able to get a job is difficult. One thing I have found lately is quite a few people\u00a0<strong>may</strong>\u00a0<strong>have the required skills to get a job, but no portfolio</strong>. While a resume matters, having a portfolio of public evidence of your data science skills can do wonders for your job prospects. Even if you have a referral,\u00a0<strong>the ability to show potential employers what you can do instead of just telling them you can do something is important</strong>. This post will include links to where various data science professionals (data science managers, data scientists, social media icons, or some combination thereof) and others talk about what to have in a portfolio and how to get noticed. With that, let\u2019s get started!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>The Importance of a Portfolio</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\nBesides the benefit of learning by making a portfolio, a portfolio is important as it can help get you employment. For the purpose of this article, let\u2019s define a portfolio as public evidence of your data science skills. I got this definition from\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/drob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson</a>\u00a0Chief Data Scientist at DataCamp when he was interviewed by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/marissagemma\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marissa Gemma</a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https://blog.modeanalytics.com/data-scientists-making-the-leap-academia-to-industry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mode Analytics blog</a>. He was asked about landing his first job in industry and said,</br></p>\n<blockquote><p>The most effective strategy for me was doing public work. I blogged and did a lot of open source development late in my PhD, and these helped give public evidence of my data science skills. But the way I landed my first industry job was a particularly noteworthy example of the public work. During my PhD I was an active answerer on the programming site Stack Overflow, and an engineer at the company came across one of my answers (one explaining the intuition behind the beta distribution). He was so impressed with the answer that he got in touch with me [through Twitter], and a few interviews later\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/year_data_scientist/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">I was hired</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You may think of this as a freak occurrence, but you will often find that the more active you are, the greater chance you have of something like this occuring. From\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David\u2019s blog post</a>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>The more public work you do, the higher the chance of a freak accident like that: of someone noticing your work and pointing you towards a job opportunity, or of someone who\u2019s interviewing you having heard of work you\u2019ve done.</p></blockquote>\n<p>People often forget that software engineers and data scientists also Google their issues. If these same people have their problems solved by reading your public work, they might think better of you and reach out to you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Portfolio to get around an Experience Requirement</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\nEven for an entry level role, most companies want to have people with at least a little bit of real life experience. You may have seen memes like the one below.</br></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bE_-mX24sM-t5E8N9oc9DA.png\" width=\"60%\"/></p>\n<p>The question is how do you get experience if you need experience to get your first job? If there is an answer, the answer is\u00a0<strong>projects</strong>. Projects are perhaps the best substitutes for work experience or as\u00a0<a href=\"https://will-stanton.com/2015/07/15/creating-a-great-data-science-resume/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Will Stanton</a>\u00a0said,</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you don\u2019t have any experience as a data scientist, then you absolutely\u00a0<em>have to</em>do independent projects.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In fact, when\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@skyetetra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Nolis</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@skyetetra/hiring-data-scientists-my-interview-questions-56d5ae3fc621\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interviews candidates</a>, he wants to hear about a description of a recent problem/project that you have faced.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to hear about a project they\u2019ve worked on recently. I ask them about how the project started, how they determined it was worth time and effort, their process, and their results. I also ask them about what they learned from the project. I gain a lot from answers to this question: if they can tell a narrative, how the problem related to the bigger picture, and how they tackled the hard work of doing something.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have some data science related work experience, the best option here is to talk about a data science project that you have worked on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Types of Projects to Include in a Portfolio</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\nData science is such a broad field that it is hard to know what kind of projects hiring managers want to see.\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wzchen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">William Chen</a>, a Data Science Manager at Quora, shared his thoughts on the subject at Kaggle\u2019s CareerCon 2018 (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xrhPjE7wHas?t=30m9s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>).</br></p>\n<blockquote><p>I love projects where people show that they are interested in data in a way that goes beyond homework assignments. Any sort of class final project where you explore an interesting dataset and find interesting results\u2026 Put effort into the writeup\u2026 I really like seeing really good writeups where people find interesting and novel things\u2026have some visualizations and share their work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people recognize the value of creating projects, but one issue a lot of people wonder is where do you get that interesting dataset and what do you do with it.\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Goodman</a>, Data Scientist at Airbnb, has a post\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman/advice-on-building-data-portfolio-projects-c5f96d8a0627\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advice on Building Data Portfolio Projects</a>\u00a0where he talks about many different project ideas and has good advice on what kind of datasets you should use. He also echos one of William\u2019s points about working with interesting data.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I find that the best portfolio projects are less about doing fancy modeling and more about working with interesting data. A lot of people do things with financial information or Twitter data; those can work, but the data isn\u2019t inherently that interesting, so you\u2019re working uphill.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of his other points in the article is that webscraping is a great way to get interesting data. If you are interested in learning how to build your own dataset by webscraping in Python, you can see my post\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/using-scrapy-to-build-your-own-dataset-64ea2d7d4673\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

There aren\u2019t a lot of ways to use these datasets to distinguish yourself from other applicants. Make sure to list novel projects.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2zvdLfbBwzvYQqiO3ruf0Q.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Titanic (A), MNIST (B), and iris (C) classification</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Portfolios are Iterative</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/@faviovazquez\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Favio Vazquez</a>\u00a0has an\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-a-job-as-a-data-scientist-f417078fe13e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">excellent article</a>\u00a0where he talked about how he got his job as a data scientist. Of course, one of his tips is to have a portfolio.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Have a portfolio. If you are looking for a serious paid job in data science do some projects with real data. If you can post them on GitHub. Apart from Kaggle competitions, find something that you love or a problem you want to solve and use your knowledge to do it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the other interesting findings was that you always have to keep on improving as you go through the job hunt.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I applied to almost 125 jobs (for real, maybe you applied for much more), I got only like 25\u201330 replies. Some of them were just: Thanks but nope. And I got almost 15 interviews. I learned from each one. Got better. I had to deal with a lot of rejection. Something I was actually not prepared to. But I loved the process of getting interviewed (not all of them to be honest). I studied a lot, programmed everyday, read a lot of articles and posts. They helped a lot.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As you learn more and improve yourself, your portfolio should also be updated. This same sentiment is echoed in many other advice articles. As\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Goodman</a>\u00a0said,</p>\n<blockquote><p>The project isn\u2019t done when you post it publicly. Don\u2019t be afraid to keep adding on to or editing your projects after they\u2019re published!</p></blockquote>\n<p>This advice is especially true when you are looking for a job. There are many stories of successful people like\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/@kellypeng17\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Peng</a>, Data Scientist at Airbnb, who really persevered and kept on working and improving.

In her article, she even mentions how you need to keep on learning from your interviewing experiences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Take note of all the interview questions you got asked, especially those questions you failed to answer. You can fail again, but don\u2019t fail at the same spot. You should always be learning and improving.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WwMBOf3sv2p6FaU4rsaA7g.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">*If you aren\u2019t getting interviews yet, apply for more jobs and keep on finding ways to learn and\u00a0improve.</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Incorporating Portfolio into 1 Page\u00a0Resume</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nOne of the ways someone finds your portfolio is often through your resume so it is worth a mention. A data science resume is a place to focus on your technical skills. Your resume is a chance to succinctly represent your qualifications and fit for that particular role. Recruiters and hiring managers skim resumes very quickly, and you only have a short time to make an impression. Improving your resume can increase your chance of getting an interview. You have to make sure every single line and every single section of your resume counts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wzchen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">William Chen</a>, a Data Science Manager from Quora has\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xrhPjE7wHas?t=2m43s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9 Tips for making your data science resume</a>.\u00a0<strong>Notice in the brief summary of his points below, that projects and portfolio are points 6, 7, 8, and arguably 9</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>1. Length</strong>: Keep it simple and one page max. This gives you the most impact for a quick skim. Recommends a simple one column resume as it is easy to skim.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WfOBVYnlXkWo3ErwSPEKDA.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Sample Resume used in Video (latex:\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sb2nov/resume\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/sb2nov/resume</a>)</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>2. Objective</strong>: Don\u2019t include one. They don\u2019t help you distinguish yourself from other people. They take away space from the more important things (skills, projects, experience etc). Cover letters are extremely optional unless you really personalize it.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_8Rl-iM4b7HgzFHVHZPixQ.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Objectives don\u2019t help you distinguish yourself from other people. A lot of them say very similar\u00a0things.</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>3. Coursework</strong>: Do list\u00a0<strong>relevant coursework</strong>\u00a0that is applicable for the job description.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z3i5kctcvAg-il6Ag1KUnA.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Examples of relevant coursework displayed on various\u00a0resumes.</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>4. Skills</strong>: Don\u2019t give numerical ratings for your skills. If you want to rate yourself on your skills, use words like proficient or familiar or things like that. You can even exclude assessments altogether.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MD8-twz41dKQxc6YjwOW9g.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Don\u2019t give numerical ratings for your\u00a0skills</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>5. Skills</strong>: Do list technical skills that the job description mentions. The order you list your skills in can suggest what you are best at.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3LlV0hPnpDzrOlgKfA_zHg.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Examples of how you can list your skills on your\u00a0resume</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>6. Projects</strong>: Don\u2019t list common projects or homework. They aren\u2019t that helpful in distinguishing you from other applicants. List projects that are novel.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ra2YpLbYxov2U0LCpEJXmA.png\" width=\"99%\"/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>7. Projects</strong>:<strong>\u00a0</strong>Show results and include links. If you participated in Kaggle competition, put percentile rank as it helps the person reading your resume understand where you are in the competition. In projects sections, there is always room for links to writeups and papers as they let the hiring manager or recruiter dig in deeper (bias to real world messy problems where you learn something new).</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uj7XOQtNN0AGImLUitnmAQ.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Good example project\u00a0sections</font></center></p>\n<p>Notice that in one of the projects sections above, a person has an additional link to a blog that lets the recruiter or hiring manager find out more. This is one way to link to various parts of your portfolio from your resume.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>8. Portfolio:\u00a0</strong>Fill our your online presence. The most basic is a LinkedIn profile. It is kind of like an extended resume. Github and Kaggle profiles can help show off your work. Fill out each profile and include links to other sites. Fill out descriptions for your GitHub repositories. Include links to your knowledge sharing profiles/blog (Medium, Quora). Data science specifically is about knowledge sharing and communicating what the data means to other people. You don\u2019t have to do all of them, but pick a few and do it (More on this later).</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>9. Experience</strong>: Tailor your experience towards the job. Experience is the core of your resume, but if you don\u2019t have work experience what do you do? Focus your resume on independent projects, like capstone projects, independent research, thesis work, or Kaggle competitions. These are substitutes for work experience if you don\u2019t have work experience to put on your resume. Avoid putting irrelevant experience on your resume.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3R9PsSTHEyLc8SZpx9yGNA.png\" width=\"99%\"/></p>\n<p>If you want to know hear data science managers go over portfolios and resumes, here are links to Kaggle\u2019s CareerCon 2018 (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBR0EtGOkzc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hqrBBZAxnhckto-gU1EKtXeesmtQqX9i\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">resumes reviewed</a>).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Importance of Social\u00a0Media</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nThis is very similar to the Importance of a Portfolio section, just divided into subsections. Having a Github page, a Kaggle profile, a Stack Overflow, etc can provide support for your resume. Having online profiles filled out can be a good signal for hiring managers.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson</a>\u00a0phrases it,</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nGenerally, when I\u2019m evaluating a candidate, I\u2019m excited to see what they\u2019ve shared publicly, even if it\u2019s not polished or finished. And sharing anything is almost always better than sharing nothing.</p>\n<p>The reason why data scientists like seeing public work is as Will Stanton said,</p>\n<p>Data scientists use these tools to share their own work and find answers to questions. If you use these tools, then you are signaling to data scientists that you are one of them, even if you haven\u2019t ever worked as a data scientist.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>A lot of Data science is about communication and presenting data so it is good to have these online profiles. Besides from the fact that these platforms help provide valuable experience, they can also help you get noticed and lead people to your resume. People can and do find your resume online through various sources (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Kaggle, Medium, Stack Overflow, Tableau Public, Quora, Youtube, etc). You will even find that different types of social media feed into eachother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b><strong>Github</strong></b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LZ97bXvmHqXrhh6UOp0osw.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Github profiles of\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/jennybc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Bryan</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yuan (Terry)\u00a0Tang</a></font></center></p>\n<p>A Github profile is a powerful signal that you are a competent data scientist. In the projects section of a resume, people often leave links to their GitHub where the code is stored for their projects. You can also have writeups and markdown there. GitHub lets people see what you have built and how you have built it. At some companies, hiring managers look at an applicants GitHub. It is another way to show employers you aren\u2019t a false positive. If you take the time to develop your GitHub profile, you can be better evaluated than others.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that you need to have some sort of README.md with a description of your project as a lot of\u00a0<strong>data science is about communicating results</strong>. Make sure the README.md file clearly describes what your project is, what it does, and how to run your code.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b><strong>Kaggle</strong></b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nParticipating in Kaggle competitions, creating a kernel, and contributing to discussions are ways to show some competency as a data scientist. It is important to emphasize that Kaggle is not like an industry project as\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Colleen-Farrelly-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Colleen Farrelly</a>, mentions in this\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-well-do-you-have-to-do-on-Kaggle-in-order-to-become-a-professional-data-scientist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">quora question</a>. Kaggle competitions take care of coming up with a task, acquire data for you, and clean it into some usable form. What it does is give you practice analyzing data and coming up with a model.\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reshamas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reshama Shaikh</a>\u00a0has a post\u00a0<a href=\"https://reshamas.github.io/to-kaggle-or-not/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">To Kaggle Or Not</a>\u00a0where she talked about the value of Kaggle competitions. From her post,</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is true, doing one Kaggle competition does not qualify someone to be a data scientist. Neither does taking one class or attending one conference tutorial or analyzing one dataset or reading one book in data science. Working on competition(s) adds to your experience and augments your portfolio. It is a complement to your other projects, not the sole litmus test of one\u2019s data science skillset.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is also true that there is a good reason why\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-motivates-Kaggle-Grandmasters-with-many-competitions-under-their-belt-to-continue-actively-participating-in-competitions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kaggle Grandmasters continue to participate in Kaggle competitions</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b><strong>Linkedin</strong></b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nUnlike a resume, which is confined by length, a LinkedIn profile allows you to describe your projects and work experience in more depth. Udacity has a\u00a0<a href=\"https://career-resource-center.udacity.com/linkedin-github-profiles/how-to-stand-out-on-linkedin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">guide on making a good LinkedIn profile</a>. An important part of LinkedIn is their search tool and for you to show up, you must have\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.job-hunt.org/linkedin-job-search/linkedin-keywords.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>relevant keywords</em></a><em>\u00a0</em>inyour profile. Recruiters often search for people on LinkedIn. LinkedIn allows you to see which companies have searched for you and who has viewed your profile.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*svn-7WoZd2K8HYs0kEYvCg.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Checking where your searchers work and how many times people have viewed your\u00a0profile.</font></center></p>\n<p>Besides companies finding you and sending you messages on your availability, LinkedIn also has many features like\u00a0<a href=\"https://blog.linkedin.com/2018/march/19/introducing-ask-for-a-referral-making-it-easier-to-find-your-way-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ask for a Referral</a>.\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Goodman</a>\u00a0in his article\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman/advice-on-applying-to-data-science-jobs-6e62b25518e5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advice on Applying to Data Science Jobs</a>\u00a0uses LinkedIn to\u00a0<strong>indirectly</strong>ask for referrals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I never, never, never applied to any companies without an introduction to someone who worked at the company\u2026once I was interested in a company, I would use LinkedIn to find a first- or second- degree connection at the company. I would write to that connection, asking to talk to them about their experience at the company and, if possible, whether they\u2019d be able to connect me to someone on the Data Science team. Whenever I could, I did in-person meetings (coffee or lunch) instead of phone calls. As an aside, Trey Causey recently wrote\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a great post</a>on how to ask for just these kinds of meetings. I would never ask for a job directly, but they would usually ask for my resume and offer to submit me as an internal referral, or put me in touch with a hiring manager. If they didn\u2019t seem comfortable doing so...I\u2019d just thank them for their time and move on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Notice that he doesn\u2019t right away ask for a referral. While common job advice when applying to a company is to get a referral, it is VERY IMPORTANT to note that you still need a portfolio, experience, or some sort of proof you can do a job. Jason even mentions the importance of a portfolio in that and\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman/advice-on-building-data-portfolio-projects-c5f96d8a0627\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">other articles he has written</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.usejournal.com/@amandalmia18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aman Dalmia</a>\u00a0learned something similar by\u00a0<a href=\"https://blog.usejournal.com/what-i-learned-from-interviewing-at-multiple-ai-companies-and-start-ups-a9620415e4cc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Interviewing at Multiple AI Companies and Startups</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Networking is\u00a0<em>NOT\u00a0</em>messaging people to place a referral for you<em>.\u00a0</em>When I was starting off, I did this mistake way too often until I stumbled upon\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>this</em></a>\u00a0excellent article by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmeloon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mark Meloon</em></a><em>,\u00a0</em>where he talks about the importance of building a\u00a0<em>real</em>connection with people by offering our help first.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One other point he had is that LinkedIn is great for getting your content/portfolio out.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Another important step in networking is to get your content out. For example, if you\u2019re good at something, blog about it and share that blog on Facebook and LinkedIn<em>.\u00a0</em>Not only does this help others,\u00a0<em>it helps you as well.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b><strong>Medium and/or Other Blogging Platforms</strong></b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nHaving some form of blog can be highly beneficial. A lot of data science is about communication and presenting data. Blogging is a way of practicing this and showing you can do this. Writing about a project or a data science topic allows you to share with the community as well as encourages you to write out your work process and thoughts. This is a useful skill when interviewing.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson</a>\u00a0said,</p>\n<p><em>A blog is your chance to practice the relevant skills.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Data cleaning</em></strong><em>: One of the benefits of working with a variety of datasets is that you learn to take data \u201cas it comes\u201d, whether it\u2019s in the form of a\u00a0</em><a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>supplementary file from a journal article</em></a><em>\u00a0or a\u00a0</em><a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/love-actually-network/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>movie script</em></a>\n<li><strong><em>Statistics</em></strong><em>: Working with unfamiliar data lets you put statistical methods into practice, and writing posts that communicate and teach concepts helps build your own understanding</em>\n<li><strong><em>Machine learning</em></strong><em>: There\u2019s a big difference between having used a predictive algorithm once and having used it on a variety of problems, while understanding why you\u2019d choose one over another</em>\n<li><strong><em>Visualization</em></strong><em>: Having an audience for your graphs encourages you to start polishing them and building your personal style</em>\n<li><strong><em>Communication</em></strong><em>: You gain experience writing and get practice structuring a data-driven argument. This is probably the most relevant skill that blogging develops since it\u2019s hard to practice elsewhere, and it\u2019s an essential part of any data science career</em>\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>By writing a blog, you are can practice communicate findings to others. It also is another form of advertising yourself. Blogs about\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/using-scrapy-to-build-your-own-dataset-64ea2d7d4673\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Using Scrapy to Build your Own Dataset</a>, and ironically\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/environment-management-with-conda-python-2-3-b9961a8a5097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Python Environment Management with Conda</a>\u00a0have taught me a lot and have gotten me a lot of opportunities I would normally not have gotten. One of the major benefits I have found is that throughout the process of people critiquing my projects and suggesting improvements (though the comments section of the blog) makes it so interviewers aren\u2019t the first ones pointing out these same flaws. The more obvious benefit is that by making a blog you tend to read a lot more data science/machine learning blog posts and hence learn more.</p>\n<p>As for what platform to blog on, I recommend using Medium.\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@emessence1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Manali Shinde</a>in her blog post\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/one-datum-at-a-time/how-to-construct-a-data-science-portfolio-from-scratch-de0b70e58bc1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Construct a Data Science Portfolio from Scratch</a>\u00a0had a really good point on why she choose Medium for her blog.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought of creating my own website on a platform such as WordPress or Squarespace. While those platforms are amazing to host your own portfolio, I wanted a place where I would get some visibility, and a pretty good tagging system to reach greater audiences. Luckily Medium, as we know, has those options (and it\u2019s also free).</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know what to write about, I suggest you look at\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson\u2019s advice</a>.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hn78aN4xQAaBLTBX1nm__A.png\" width=\"80%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/drob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/drob</a></font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Twitter</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nBeing active on Twitter is a great way to identify and interact with people in your field. You can also promote your blog on Twitter so that your portfolio can be that much more visible. There are so many opportunities to interact with people on twitter. One of them as\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reshamas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reshama Shaikh</a>\u00a0said in her famous blog post \u201c<a href=\"https://reshamas.github.io/first-data-science-job/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How Do I Get My First Data Science Job?</a>\u201d was,</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/drob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson</a>\u00a0generously offers to retweet your first data science post. With 20K+ followers, that\u2019s an offer that can\u2019t be refused.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Twitter can be used for other things than self promotion.\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Data Science Renee</a>has a post \u201c<a href=\"https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/10/04/how-to-use-twitter-to-learn-data-science-or-anything/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to use Twitter to Learn Data Science (or Anything)</a>\u201d that is quite insightful about taking Twitter to learn skills. One other takeaway from her article was how much her Twitter presence helped her network and get opportunities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have been asked to be interviewed on podcasts and blogs (some of those should be coming up soon), offered contract work, and offered free admission to a conference I unfortunately couldn\u2019t go to, but was excited to be considered for. \u201cFamous\u201d people in the industry are now coming to me to work with them in some way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Tableau Public</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nNot every data science job uses Tableau or other BI tools. However, if you are applying to jobs where these tools are used, it is important to note that there are websites where you can put dashboards for public consumption. For example, if you say you are learning or know Tableau, put a couple dashboards on\u00a0<a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tableau Public</a>. While a lot of companies might be okay with you learning Tableau on the job, having public evidence of your Tableau skill can help. If you want to see good examples of Tableau Public profiles, please see\u00a0<a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/orysya.stus#!/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Orysya Stus\u2019</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/brit4337#!/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Brit Cava\u2019s</a>\u00a0profiles.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Y3qCv1h3JJecFXZcVnweeQ.png\" width=\"99%\"/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Conclusion</b><br/>\n</h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wK9vKXEm6h1YVnpXBvaF4Q.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Remember a portfolio is a process. Keep on improving.</font></center></p>\n<p>Having a strong resume has long been the primary tool for job seekers to relay their skills to potential employers. These days, there is more than one way to showoff your skills and get a job. A portfolio of public evidence is a way to get opportunities that you normally wouldn\u2019t get. It is important to emphasize that a portfolio is an iterative process. As your knowledge grows, your portfolio should be updated over time. Never stop learning or growing.

people you are that data science unicorn.</font></br></img></center></p>\n<p><strong>How do you get a job in data science?\u00a0</strong>Knowing enough statistics, machine learning, programming, etc to be able to get a job is difficult. One thing I have found lately is quite a few people\u00a0<strong>may</strong>\u00a0<strong>have the required skills to get a job, but no portfolio</strong>. While a resume matters, having a portfolio of public evidence of your data science skills can do wonders for your job prospects. Even if you have a referral,\u00a0<strong>the ability to show potential employers what you can do instead of just telling them you can do something is important</strong>. This post will include links to where various data science professionals (data science managers, data scientists, social media icons, or some combination thereof) and others talk about what to have in a portfolio and how to get noticed. With that, let\u2019s get started!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>The Importance of a Portfolio</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\nBesides the benefit of learning by making a portfolio, a portfolio is important as it can help get you employment. For the purpose of this article, let\u2019s define a portfolio as public evidence of your data science skills. I got this definition from\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/drob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson</a>\u00a0Chief Data Scientist at DataCamp when he was interviewed by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/marissagemma\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marissa Gemma</a>\u00a0on\u00a0<a href=\"https://blog.modeanalytics.com/data-scientists-making-the-leap-academia-to-industry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mode Analytics blog</a>. He was asked about landing his first job in industry and said,</br></p>\n<blockquote><p>The most effective strategy for me was doing public work. I blogged and did a lot of open source development late in my PhD, and these helped give public evidence of my data science skills. But the way I landed my first industry job was a particularly noteworthy example of the public work. During my PhD I was an active answerer on the programming site Stack Overflow, and an engineer at the company came across one of my answers (one explaining the intuition behind the beta distribution). He was so impressed with the answer that he got in touch with me [through Twitter], and a few interviews later\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/year_data_scientist/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">I was hired</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You may think of this as a freak occurrence, but you will often find that the more active you are, the greater chance you have of something like this occuring. From\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David\u2019s blog post</a>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>The more public work you do, the higher the chance of a freak accident like that: of someone noticing your work and pointing you towards a job opportunity, or of someone who\u2019s interviewing you having heard of work you\u2019ve done.</p></blockquote>\n<p>People often forget that software engineers and data scientists also Google their issues. If these same people have their problems solved by reading your public work, they might think better of you and reach out to you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Portfolio to get around an Experience Requirement</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\nEven for an entry level role, most companies want to have people with at least a little bit of real life experience. You may have seen memes like the one below.</br></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bE_-mX24sM-t5E8N9oc9DA.png\" width=\"60%\"/></p>\n<p>The question is how do you get experience if you need experience to get your first job? If there is an answer, the answer is\u00a0<strong>projects</strong>. Projects are perhaps the best substitutes for work experience or as\u00a0<a href=\"https://will-stanton.com/2015/07/15/creating-a-great-data-science-resume/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Will Stanton</a>\u00a0said,</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you don\u2019t have any experience as a data scientist, then you absolutely\u00a0<em>have to</em>do independent projects.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In fact, when\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@skyetetra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Nolis</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@skyetetra/hiring-data-scientists-my-interview-questions-56d5ae3fc621\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interviews candidates</a>, he wants to hear about a description of a recent problem/project that you have faced.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to hear about a project they\u2019ve worked on recently. I ask them about how the project started, how they determined it was worth time and effort, their process, and their results. I also ask them about what they learned from the project. I gain a lot from answers to this question: if they can tell a narrative, how the problem related to the bigger picture, and how they tackled the hard work of doing something.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have some data science related work experience, the best option here is to talk about a data science project that you have worked on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Types of Projects to Include in a Portfolio</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\nData science is such a broad field that it is hard to know what kind of projects hiring managers want to see.\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wzchen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">William Chen</a>, a Data Science Manager at Quora, shared his thoughts on the subject at Kaggle\u2019s CareerCon 2018 (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xrhPjE7wHas?t=30m9s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>).</br></p>\n<blockquote><p>I love projects where people show that they are interested in data in a way that goes beyond homework assignments. Any sort of class final project where you explore an interesting dataset and find interesting results\u2026 Put effort into the writeup\u2026 I really like seeing really good writeups where people find interesting and novel things\u2026have some visualizations and share their work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A lot of people recognize the value of creating projects, but one issue a lot of people wonder is where do you get that interesting dataset and what do you do with it.\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Goodman</a>, Data Scientist at Airbnb, has a post\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman/advice-on-building-data-portfolio-projects-c5f96d8a0627\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advice on Building Data Portfolio Projects</a>\u00a0where he talks about many different project ideas and has good advice on what kind of datasets you should use. He also echos one of William\u2019s points about working with interesting data.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I find that the best portfolio projects are less about doing fancy modeling and more about working with interesting data. A lot of people do things with financial information or Twitter data; those can work, but the data isn\u2019t inherently that interesting, so you\u2019re working uphill.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of his other points in the article is that webscraping is a great way to get interesting data. If you are interested in learning how to build your own dataset by webscraping in Python, you can see my post\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/using-scrapy-to-build-your-own-dataset-64ea2d7d4673\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. If you are coming from academia, it is important to note that your thesis can count as a project (a very large project). You can hear\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wzchen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">William Chen</a>\u00a0talk about it\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xrhPjE7wHas?t=31m15s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*i_lszGwbAXlaD_FJ7Fijcg.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Traffic Cruising Data Science for Social Good Project (<a href=\"https://github.com/uwescience/TrafficCruising-DSSG2017\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/uwescience/TrafficCruising-DSSG2017</a>).

Apart from Kaggle competitions, find something that you love or a problem you want to solve and use your knowledge to do it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the other interesting findings was that you always have to keep on improving as you go through the job hunt.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I applied to almost 125 jobs (for real, maybe you applied for much more), I got only like 25\u201330 replies. Some of them were just: Thanks but nope. And I got almost 15 interviews. I learned from each one. Got better. I had to deal with a lot of rejection. Something I was actually not prepared to. But I loved the process of getting interviewed (not all of them to be honest). I studied a lot, programmed everyday, read a lot of articles and posts. They helped a lot.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As you learn more and improve yourself, your portfolio should also be updated. This same sentiment is echoed in many other advice articles. As\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Goodman</a>\u00a0said,</p>\n<blockquote><p>The project isn\u2019t done when you post it publicly. Don\u2019t be afraid to keep adding on to or editing your projects after they\u2019re published!</p></blockquote>\n<p>This advice is especially true when you are looking for a job. There are many stories of successful people like\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/@kellypeng17\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Peng</a>, Data Scientist at Airbnb, who really persevered and kept on working and improving. In\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-land-a-data-scientist-job-at-your-dream-company-my-journey-to-airbnb-f6a1e99892e8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">one of her blog posts</a>, she went over how many places she applied for and interviewed with.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Applications: 475</p>\n<p>Phone interviews: 50</p>\n<p>Finished data science take-home challenges: 9</p>\n<p>Onsite interviews: 8</p>\n<p>Offers: 2</p>\n<p>Time spent: 6 months</p></blockquote>\n<p>She clearly applied to a lot of jobs and kept on persisting. In her article, she even mentions how you need to keep on learning from your interviewing experiences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Take note of all the interview questions you got asked, especially those questions you failed to answer. You can fail again, but don\u2019t fail at the same spot. You should always be learning and improving.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WwMBOf3sv2p6FaU4rsaA7g.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">*If you aren\u2019t getting interviews yet, apply for more jobs and keep on finding ways to learn and\u00a0improve.</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Incorporating Portfolio into 1 Page\u00a0Resume</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nOne of the ways someone finds your portfolio is often through your resume so it is worth a mention. A data science resume is a place to focus on your technical skills. Your resume is a chance to succinctly represent your qualifications and fit for that particular role. Recruiters and hiring managers skim resumes very quickly, and you only have a short time to make an impression. Improving your resume can increase your chance of getting an interview. You have to make sure every single line and every single section of your resume counts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wzchen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">William Chen</a>, a Data Science Manager from Quora has\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xrhPjE7wHas?t=2m43s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9 Tips for making your data science resume</a>.\u00a0<strong>Notice in the brief summary of his points below, that projects and portfolio are points 6, 7, 8, and arguably 9</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>1. Length</strong>: Keep it simple and one page max. This gives you the most impact for a quick skim. Recommends a simple one column resume as it is easy to skim.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WfOBVYnlXkWo3ErwSPEKDA.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Sample Resume used in Video (latex:\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/sb2nov/resume\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/sb2nov/resume</a>)</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>2. Objective</strong>: Don\u2019t include one. They don\u2019t help you distinguish yourself from other people. They take away space from the more important things (skills, projects, experience etc). Cover letters are extremely optional unless you really personalize it.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_8Rl-iM4b7HgzFHVHZPixQ.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Objectives don\u2019t help you distinguish yourself from other people. A lot of them say very similar\u00a0things.</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>3. Coursework</strong>: Do list\u00a0<strong>relevant coursework</strong>\u00a0that is applicable for the job description.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z3i5kctcvAg-il6Ag1KUnA.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Examples of relevant coursework displayed on various\u00a0resumes.</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>4. Skills</strong>: Don\u2019t give numerical ratings for your skills. If you want to rate yourself on your skills, use words like proficient or familiar or things like that. You can even exclude assessments altogether.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MD8-twz41dKQxc6YjwOW9g.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Don\u2019t give numerical ratings for your\u00a0skills</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>5. Skills</strong>: Do list technical skills that the job description mentions. The order you list your skills in can suggest what you are best at.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3LlV0hPnpDzrOlgKfA_zHg.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Examples of how you can list your skills on your\u00a0resume</font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>6. Projects</strong>: Don\u2019t list common projects or homework. They aren\u2019t that helpful in distinguishing you from other applicants. List projects that are novel.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ra2YpLbYxov2U0LCpEJXmA.png\" width=\"99%\"/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>7. Projects</strong>:<strong>\u00a0</strong>Show results and include links. If you participated in Kaggle competition, put percentile rank as it helps the person reading your resume understand where you are in the competition. In projects sections, there is always room for links to writeups and papers as they let the hiring manager or recruiter dig in deeper (bias to real world messy problems where you learn something new).</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uj7XOQtNN0AGImLUitnmAQ.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Good example project\u00a0sections</font></center></p>\n<p>Notice that in one of the projects sections above, a person has an additional link to a blog that lets the recruiter or hiring manager find out more. This is one way to link to various parts of your portfolio from your resume.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>8. Portfolio:\u00a0</strong>Fill our your online presence. The most basic is a LinkedIn profile. It is kind of like an extended resume. Github and Kaggle profiles can help show off your work. Fill out each profile and include links to other sites. Fill out descriptions for your GitHub repositories. Include links to your knowledge sharing profiles/blog (Medium, Quora). Data science specifically is about knowledge sharing and communicating what the data means to other people. You don\u2019t have to do all of them, but pick a few and do it (More on this later).</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>9. Experience</strong>: Tailor your experience towards the job. Experience is the core of your resume, but if you don\u2019t have work experience what do you do? Focus your resume on independent projects, like capstone projects, independent research, thesis work, or Kaggle competitions. These are substitutes for work experience if you don\u2019t have work experience to put on your resume. Avoid putting irrelevant experience on your resume.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3R9PsSTHEyLc8SZpx9yGNA.png\" width=\"99%\"/></p>\n<p>If you want to know hear data science managers go over portfolios and resumes, here are links to Kaggle\u2019s CareerCon 2018 (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBR0EtGOkzc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hqrBBZAxnhckto-gU1EKtXeesmtQqX9i\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">resumes reviewed</a>).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Importance of Social\u00a0Media</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nThis is very similar to the Importance of a Portfolio section, just divided into subsections. Having a Github page, a Kaggle profile, a Stack Overflow, etc can provide support for your resume. Having online profiles filled out can be a good signal for hiring managers.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson</a>\u00a0phrases it,</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nGenerally, when I\u2019m evaluating a candidate, I\u2019m excited to see what they\u2019ve shared publicly, even if it\u2019s not polished or finished. And sharing anything is almost always better than sharing nothing.</p>\n<p>The reason why data scientists like seeing public work is as Will Stanton said,</p>\n<p>Data scientists use these tools to share their own work and find answers to questions. If you use these tools, then you are signaling to data scientists that you are one of them, even if you haven\u2019t ever worked as a data scientist.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>A lot of Data science is about communication and presenting data so it is good to have these online profiles. Besides from the fact that these platforms help provide valuable experience, they can also help you get noticed and lead people to your resume. People can and do find your resume online through various sources (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Kaggle, Medium, Stack Overflow, Tableau Public, Quora, Youtube, etc). You will even find that different types of social media feed into eachother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b><strong>Github</strong></b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LZ97bXvmHqXrhh6UOp0osw.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Github profiles of\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/jennybc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Bryan</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yuan (Terry)\u00a0Tang</a></font></center></p>\n<p>A Github profile is a powerful signal that you are a competent data scientist. In the projects section of a resume, people often leave links to their GitHub where the code is stored for their projects. You can also have writeups and markdown there. GitHub lets people see what you have built and how you have built it. At some companies, hiring managers look at an applicants GitHub. It is another way to show employers you aren\u2019t a false positive. If you take the time to develop your GitHub profile, you can be better evaluated than others.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that you need to have some sort of README.md with a description of your project as a lot of\u00a0<strong>data science is about communicating results</strong>. Make sure the README.md file clearly describes what your project is, what it does, and how to run your code.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b><strong>Kaggle</strong></b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nParticipating in Kaggle competitions, creating a kernel, and contributing to discussions are ways to show some competency as a data scientist. It is important to emphasize that Kaggle is not like an industry project as\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Colleen-Farrelly-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Colleen Farrelly</a>, mentions in this\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-well-do-you-have-to-do-on-Kaggle-in-order-to-become-a-professional-data-scientist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">quora question</a>. Kaggle competitions take care of coming up with a task, acquire data for you, and clean it into some usable form. What it does is give you practice analyzing data and coming up with a model.\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reshamas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reshama Shaikh</a>\u00a0has a post\u00a0<a href=\"https://reshamas.github.io/to-kaggle-or-not/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">To Kaggle Or Not</a>\u00a0where she talked about the value of Kaggle competitions. From her post,</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is true, doing one Kaggle competition does not qualify someone to be a data scientist. Neither does taking one class or attending one conference tutorial or analyzing one dataset or reading one book in data science. Working on competition(s) adds to your experience and augments your portfolio. It is a complement to your other projects, not the sole litmus test of one\u2019s data science skillset.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is also true that there is a good reason why\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-motivates-Kaggle-Grandmasters-with-many-competitions-under-their-belt-to-continue-actively-participating-in-competitions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kaggle Grandmasters continue to participate in Kaggle competitions</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b><strong>Linkedin</strong></b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nUnlike a resume, which is confined by length, a LinkedIn profile allows you to describe your projects and work experience in more depth. Udacity has a\u00a0<a href=\"https://career-resource-center.udacity.com/linkedin-github-profiles/how-to-stand-out-on-linkedin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">guide on making a good LinkedIn profile</a>. An important part of LinkedIn is their search tool and for you to show up, you must have\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.job-hunt.org/linkedin-job-search/linkedin-keywords.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>relevant keywords</em></a><em>\u00a0</em>inyour profile. Recruiters often search for people on LinkedIn. LinkedIn allows you to see which companies have searched for you and who has viewed your profile.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*svn-7WoZd2K8HYs0kEYvCg.png\" width=\"99%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\">Checking where your searchers work and how many times people have viewed your\u00a0profile.</font></center></p>\n<p>Besides companies finding you and sending you messages on your availability, LinkedIn also has many features like\u00a0<a href=\"https://blog.linkedin.com/2018/march/19/introducing-ask-for-a-referral-making-it-easier-to-find-your-way-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ask for a Referral</a>.\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Goodman</a>\u00a0in his article\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman/advice-on-applying-to-data-science-jobs-6e62b25518e5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advice on Applying to Data Science Jobs</a>\u00a0uses LinkedIn to\u00a0<strong>indirectly</strong>ask for referrals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I never, never, never applied to any companies without an introduction to someone who worked at the company\u2026once I was interested in a company, I would use LinkedIn to find a first- or second- degree connection at the company. I would write to that connection, asking to talk to them about their experience at the company and, if possible, whether they\u2019d be able to connect me to someone on the Data Science team. Whenever I could, I did in-person meetings (coffee or lunch) instead of phone calls. As an aside, Trey Causey recently wrote\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@treycausey/do-you-have-time-for-a-quick-chat-c3f7e46de89d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a great post</a>on how to ask for just these kinds of meetings. I would never ask for a job directly, but they would usually ask for my resume and offer to submit me as an internal referral, or put me in touch with a hiring manager. If they didn\u2019t seem comfortable doing so...I\u2019d just thank them for their time and move on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Notice that he doesn\u2019t right away ask for a referral. While common job advice when applying to a company is to get a referral, it is VERY IMPORTANT to note that you still need a portfolio, experience, or some sort of proof you can do a job. Jason even mentions the importance of a portfolio in that and\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman/advice-on-building-data-portfolio-projects-c5f96d8a0627\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">other articles he has written</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.usejournal.com/@amandalmia18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aman Dalmia</a>\u00a0learned something similar by\u00a0<a href=\"https://blog.usejournal.com/what-i-learned-from-interviewing-at-multiple-ai-companies-and-start-ups-a9620415e4cc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Interviewing at Multiple AI Companies and Startups</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Networking is\u00a0<em>NOT\u00a0</em>messaging people to place a referral for you<em>.\u00a0</em>When I was starting off, I did this mistake way too often until I stumbled upon\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.markmeloon.com/climbing-relationship-ladder-get-data-science-job/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>this</em></a>\u00a0excellent article by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmeloon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mark Meloon</em></a><em>,\u00a0</em>where he talks about the importance of building a\u00a0<em>real</em>connection with people by offering our help first.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One other point he had is that LinkedIn is great for getting your content/portfolio out.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Another important step in networking is to get your content out. For example, if you\u2019re good at something, blog about it and share that blog on Facebook and LinkedIn<em>.\u00a0</em>Not only does this help others,\u00a0<em>it helps you as well.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b><strong>Medium and/or Other Blogging Platforms</strong></b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nHaving some form of blog can be highly beneficial. A lot of data science is about communication and presenting data. Blogging is a way of practicing this and showing you can do this. Writing about a project or a data science topic allows you to share with the community as well as encourages you to write out your work process and thoughts. This is a useful skill when interviewing.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson</a>\u00a0said,</p>\n<p><em>A blog is your chance to practice the relevant skills.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Data cleaning</em></strong><em>: One of the benefits of working with a variety of datasets is that you learn to take data \u201cas it comes\u201d, whether it\u2019s in the form of a\u00a0</em><a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/tidy-genomics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>supplementary file from a journal article</em></a><em>\u00a0or a\u00a0</em><a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/love-actually-network/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>movie script</em></a>\n<li><strong><em>Statistics</em></strong><em>: Working with unfamiliar data lets you put statistical methods into practice, and writing posts that communicate and teach concepts helps build your own understanding</em>\n<li><strong><em>Machine learning</em></strong><em>: There\u2019s a big difference between having used a predictive algorithm once and having used it on a variety of problems, while understanding why you\u2019d choose one over another</em>\n<li><strong><em>Visualization</em></strong><em>: Having an audience for your graphs encourages you to start polishing them and building your personal style</em>\n<li><strong><em>Communication</em></strong><em>: You gain experience writing and get practice structuring a data-driven argument. This is probably the most relevant skill that blogging develops since it\u2019s hard to practice elsewhere, and it\u2019s an essential part of any data science career</em>\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>By writing a blog, you are can practice communicate findings to others. It also is another form of advertising yourself. Blogs about\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/using-scrapy-to-build-your-own-dataset-64ea2d7d4673\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Using Scrapy to Build your Own Dataset</a>, and ironically\u00a0<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/environment-management-with-conda-python-2-3-b9961a8a5097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Python Environment Management with Conda</a>\u00a0have taught me a lot and have gotten me a lot of opportunities I would normally not have gotten. One of the major benefits I have found is that throughout the process of people critiquing my projects and suggesting improvements (though the comments section of the blog) makes it so interviewers aren\u2019t the first ones pointing out these same flaws. The more obvious benefit is that by making a blog you tend to read a lot more data science/machine learning blog posts and hence learn more.</p>\n<p>As for what platform to blog on, I recommend using Medium.\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@emessence1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Manali Shinde</a>in her blog post\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/one-datum-at-a-time/how-to-construct-a-data-science-portfolio-from-scratch-de0b70e58bc1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to Construct a Data Science Portfolio from Scratch</a>\u00a0had a really good point on why she choose Medium for her blog.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought of creating my own website on a platform such as WordPress or Squarespace. While those platforms are amazing to host your own portfolio, I wanted a place where I would get some visibility, and a pretty good tagging system to reach greater audiences. Luckily Medium, as we know, has those options (and it\u2019s also free).</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know what to write about, I suggest you look at\u00a0<a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson\u2019s advice</a>.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hn78aN4xQAaBLTBX1nm__A.png\" width=\"80%\"/><br/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/drob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/drob</a></font></center></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Twitter</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nBeing active on Twitter is a great way to identify and interact with people in your field. You can also promote your blog on Twitter so that your portfolio can be that much more visible. There are so many opportunities to interact with people on twitter. One of them as\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reshamas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reshama Shaikh</a>\u00a0said in her famous blog post \u201c<a href=\"https://reshamas.github.io/first-data-science-job/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How Do I Get My First Data Science Job?</a>\u201d was,</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/drob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Robinson</a>\u00a0generously offers to retweet your first data science post. With 20K+ followers, that\u2019s an offer that can\u2019t be refused.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Twitter can be used for other things than self promotion.\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Data Science Renee</a>has a post \u201c<a href=\"https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/10/04/how-to-use-twitter-to-learn-data-science-or-anything/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to use Twitter to Learn Data Science (or Anything)</a>\u201d that is quite insightful about taking Twitter to learn skills. One other takeaway from her article was how much her Twitter presence helped her network and get opportunities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have been asked to be interviewed on podcasts and blogs (some of those should be coming up soon), offered contract work, and offered free admission to a conference I unfortunately couldn\u2019t go to, but was excited to be considered for. \u201cFamous\u201d people in the industry are now coming to me to work with them in some way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><b>Tableau Public</b></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\nNot every data science job uses Tableau or other BI tools. However, if you are applying to jobs where these tools are used, it is important to note that there are websites where you can put dashboards for public consumption. For example, if you say you are learning or know Tableau, put a couple dashboards on\u00a0<a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tableau Public</a>. While a lot of companies might be okay with you learning Tableau on the job, having public evidence of your Tableau skill can help.

Keep on improving.</font></center></p>\n<p>Having a strong resume has long been the primary tool for job seekers to relay their skills to potential employers. These days, there is more than one way to showoff your skills and get a job. A portfolio of public evidence is a way to get opportunities that you normally wouldn\u2019t get.

Born Jean Fran\u00e7ois Gravelet in 1824, Blondin began his career as performer of acrobatic stunts when he was five years old. Orphaned at age nine, he continued in his chosen career, constantly challenging himself to develop new stunts until he grew from child prodigy into one of the greatest funambulist in France.

Always popular, the Ravel Troupe got rave reviews and had their booking extended, ultimately performing more than 300 shows from 1857 to 1859. Blondin, however, didn\u2019t stay put. He formed a splinter troupe (this happened all the time with the Ravel groups; it wasn\u2019t rancorous; everyone got more work that way) with one of Ravel\u2019s lead acrobats, Julian Martinetti, and they toured the country as the Martinetti-Blondin troupe. Blondin was reviewed glowingly in the press as \u201cthe bold and fearless Mons. Blondin.\u201d In a six degrees of separation coincidence, at Crisp\u2019s Gaiety in New Orleans in November 1857, the Martinetti-Blondin troupe shared billing with \u201cthe popular young native tragedian, Mr. Edwin Booth.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37288\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 102px) 100vw, 102px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act-102x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act-200x292.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act-430x627.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Charles Blondin carrying Mrs. Blondin in theatrical tightrope act \" width=\"102\"/></a>After almost eight years on the road with the Ravels, Blondin\u2019s troupe disbanded in late 1858 in Cincinnati.

Never one to shy away from a seemingly insane proposition, Blondin went to Niagara to see if he could make his dream come true.

He and his manager Harry Colcord struggled to get the permits to string the rope. Blondin wanted it strung across Horseshoe Falls where all the drama is, but landowners protested that the mist would soak the hemp rope and make it too slick. In the end Blondin strung his cable from the trunk of an oak tree in White\u2019s Pleasure Grounds on the American side across Niagara Gorge to a rock in front of the Clifton House on the Canadian side, near to where the Rainbow Bridge is today. The rope was 1,100 feet long and just 3.25 inches in diameter. It was poised 160 feet above the Niagara River with a slight sag in the middle 50 feet where it was impossible to attach the guy lines that kept the rest of the cable from swaying too vigorously. It took Blondin and Colcord almost five months to get the cable and lines strung.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37283\" height=\"75\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894-150x75.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894-200x101.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894-430x217.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blondin's rope ascension over Niagara River, stereoscophic photograph by George Barker, 1859\" width=\"150\"/></a>At 5:00 PM on June 30th, Charles Blondin gripped his 26-feet-long ash balancing pole and walked across the tightrope from the United States to Canada. He sat down in the middle, looked around like he hadn\u2019t a care in the world, then stood back up and kept walking. He stopped again to lay down on his back, did a back somersault and then traipsed with a gait described by one spectator as akin to that of a \u201cbarnyard cock\u201d to the other side. The whole crossing had taken him five minutes.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, Blondin started the return trip. This time he had a Daguerreotype apparatus strapped to his back which he duly deployed 200 feet into his crossing. He tied his balancing pole to the rope, set up the camera and took a picture of the crowd waiting for him on the American side. Then he strapped the camera back onto his back and finished the crossing. That one took 23 minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37289\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859-145x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859-145x150.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859-200x206.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859-430x443.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blondin carrying Harry Colcord on his back across the Niagara River Gorge, August 19th, 1859\" width=\"145\"/></a>As soon as he was done, still basking in the acclaim of the stupefied audience of 25,000, Blondin announced he\u2019d attempt another Niagara tightrope walk on the Fourth of July. He accomplished that one too, without a balancing pole, doing flips and tricks and the return crossing wearing a bag over his head. Blondin would make many more crossings, each with different and increasingly daring stunts. He walked it backwards, did flips all the way across, crossed at night, pushed a wheelbarrow across the rope and strapped a stove to his back so he could make an omelette midway through the crossing which he didn\u2019t even eat himself. He lowered it on a rope to the passengers on the <em>Maid of the Mist</em>. He carried Henry Colcord on his back several times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37285\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860-101x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860-101x150.jpg 101w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860-200x295.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860-430x636.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860.jpg 811w\" title=\"&quot;The Coming Man's Presidential Career, a la Blondin.&quot; Harper's Weekly, August 25th, 1860\" width=\"101\"/></a>His Niagara Falls exploits made him internationally famous and quite wealthy. His name became synonymous with walking a tightrope, a metaphor that became painfully apt for a divided country soon after his first crossing. Abraham Lincoln was repeatedly depicted in editorial cartoons as Blondin.

Mike and Mary Hudd (right).\" width=\"123\"/></a>In June of 2014, Mike and Mary Hudd of Bincknoll Cottage, Bincknoll, Wiltshire, were doing some landscaping in their garden, employing a machine to pull out the roots of a fallen tree, when they unearthed stonework remains. Mary, an avid amateur archaeologist, stopped the landscaping and started excavating, carefully exposing enough of the upper layer of chalk block walls to indicate there might be the remains of a larger structure under the Hudd\u2019s yard. They called in the Wiltshire County Archaeologist to determine how to proceed.</p>\n<p>They had good reason to believe the stonework might be of archaeological significance. Bincknoll is a tiny hamlet with a few houses and a farm  that is part of the civil parish of Broad Town today, but it first appears in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=5TZVAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA94\" target=\"_blank\">Domesday Book as <em>Bechenhalle</em></a>, a manor of Norman lord Gilbert de Breteuil. Just south of the garden is an escarpment overlooking Bincknoll Cottage where the remains of an early motte and bailey castle stand as an earthwork ridge. Other archaeological features in the hamlet include enclosure boundaries, ridge and furrow plough patterns visible in earthworks when surviving and in the path of lanes and hedgerows when not and a ridge thought to be the remnant of a medieval fish pond. There has been very little in the way of archaeological exploration of these features, so all that\u2019s known is what\u2019s visible to the naked eye from the ground and air.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lost-chapel-bincknoll.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37265\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lost-chapel-bincknoll-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lost-chapel-bincknoll-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lost-chapel-bincknoll-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lost-chapel-bincknoll-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Trench revealing walls and foundations under Bincknoll Cottage yard\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Wiltshire County Archaeologist and the Hudds decided on a plan to excavate the yard further with the goal of determining the full measurements of the structure, finding datable artifacts and architectural remains that would help them identify what kind of building it was. The planned called for four trenches (later increased to six to further investigate features found during the excavation), to be dug across the stonework Mary Hudd had partially exposed. Because the chalk block walls were visible at ground level, all the trenches would have to be dug by hand.</p>\n<p>Events kicked off in late July with a geophysical survey of the front and back yards of Bincknoll Cottage. The front yard was found to have underground features that were likely to be more buried walls. In August the excavation began in earnest, and what a glorious team was there, my friends. Because the trenches had to be dug by hand, many hands were needed. <a href=\"http://broadtownhistory.moonfruit.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">Broad Town Archaeology</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to community archaeology in the Broad Town area, got involved and ultimately more than 60 volunteers worked the site supervised by professional archaeologists from, among others, the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group, English Heritage, the Wiltshire Museum and Wessex Archaeology. Volunteers ranged from organized amateurs like the North Wiltshire Young Archaeologists Club to members of the community who were excited to get their hands dirty in the history of their town.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-excavation-late-2014.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37271\" height=\"137\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-excavation-late-2014-150x137.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-excavation-late-2014-150x137.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-excavation-late-2014-200x182.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-excavation-late-2014-430x393.jpg 430w\" title=\"Aerial view of Bincknoll Cottage excavation, late 2014\" width=\"150\"/></a>Excavations ran from through August through September 2014 and were remarkably productive. They revealed three sides of a chalk block and rubble structure 20 feet wide with walls three feet thick. The walls were in generally good condition except for the very tops which have been exposed to the elements for a very long time. The building is aligned perfectly along the east-west axis.</p>\n<p>Artifacts found include roof tiles, mortar, nails, carved chalk from the 14th century and a range of pottery types dating from the 11th century through the 17th. The team found chunks of whitewashed plaster, some decorated with red lines painted across them, some plain white, some small pieces with residue of other colors that could be green and black. The excavation of the south wall in trench four unearthed ten voussoirs, a wedge-shaped stone used in arches, that were probably part of a doorway or window.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-cow-burial.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37270\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-cow-burial-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-cow-burial-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-cow-burial-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bincknoll-Cottage-cow-burial-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bincknoll Cottage's cow burial\" width=\"150\"/></a>Excavations also revealed some organic remains, oyster shells and animal bones. The articulated skeletal remains of a large animal were found in trench four. In order to excavate the skeleton fully, the team opened a new trench, trench six, and found a cattle burial. The beast was interred in a pit with some difficulty as the head is bent back and the left foreleg twisted up above its body. The burial postdates the ruin of the medieval structure. A clay pipe unearthed in the same layer was identified as the work of John Greenland of Marlborough which dates it and the burial to the late 17th, early 18th century at the earliest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Lowe-at-east-end-of-site.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37264\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Lowe-at-east-end-of-site-150x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Lowe-at-east-end-of-site-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Lowe-at-east-end-of-site-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Lowe-at-east-end-of-site-430x279.jpg 430w\" title=\"Rob Lowe excavates the east end of structure\" width=\"150\"/></a>Four more trenches were dug during this season\u2019s excavations from April through June, exploring the east side of the structure.

A 1291 document refers to a chapel at Bincknoll Manor whose tithes were granted to the Priory of St. Denis in Southampton. The chapel comes up a couple of more times in church records from the 13th and 14th century.

We found fragments of painted plaster from the building\u2019s interior, painted red lines depicting borders, pinks and green and black possibly from wall paintings.

(By good I mean super gross.) Teratomas, for those of you not as repulsed/fascinated by them as I am, are benign tumors in which germ cells gone awry grow random body parts like teeth, hair, bone and soft tissue like muscle, thyroid and skin. They usually set up shop in ovaries or, more rarely, testicles because that\u2019s where germ cells are supposed to be going about the business of making sperm and eggs during embryonic development, and often go undetected for their host\u2019s entire life. While not uncommon, teratomas make the news because of how creepy they are \u2014 they\u2019re not absorbed \u201cevil\u201d twins, no matter what the headlines might say \u2014 and how infrequently they\u2019re found.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Burial-of-CNS-U2-60-Colonial-era-Eten-Peru.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37208\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Burial-of-CNS-U2-60-Colonial-era-Eten-Peru-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Burial-of-CNS-U2-60-Colonial-era-Eten-Peru-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Burial-of-CNS-U2-60-Colonial-era-Eten-Peru-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Burial-of-CNS-U2-60-Colonial-era-Eten-Peru-430x647.jpg 430w\" title=\"Burial CNS U2-60 from Colonial-era Eten, Peru.

The skeleton of the young woman was found in the cemetery of the Chapel of the Divino Ni\u00f1o Serranito de Eten, one of 500 Colonial Period burials in the chapel cemetery. Eten had been a small fishing village before the Spanish came. It was expanded into a colonial settlement called a reducci\u00f3n in the 1560s. Reducci\u00f3nes were forced labour/Christianization resettlement towns, designed to break the cultural structure of small kin-based, self-sustaining villages scattered in the area, corral the work force in larger urbs for more efficient exploitation in the Andean silver mines and two-birds-with-a-stone conversion to Christianity. Eventually reducci\u00f3nes spread throughout Spanish holdings in Central and South America, but they began in Peru, the brainchild of 5th viceroy Francisco de Toledo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tooth-like-remains-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37205\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 134px) 100vw, 134px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tooth-like-remains-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1-134x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tooth-like-remains-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1-134x150.jpg 134w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tooth-like-remains-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1-200x222.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tooth-like-remains-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1-430x478.jpg 430w\" title=\"Baby teeth-like pieces from CNS U2-60 teratoma.

It\u2019s not clear what killed her, but her teratoma is so extreme that it might have been a factor. The Spain teratoma had four small, malformed teeth and bone formation inside the calcified capsule. The one found in Rome had five malformed teeth inside a fragmented spherical bony structure. The Andean teratoma has 83 pieces of bone and 37 malformed baby teeth. And that\u2019s all that\u2019s left now. Who knows what kind of random organ bits were in there before decomposition. It was such a large assortment of bones and teeth that at first researchers thought it might be a sacrificed animal, but its location in the abdominal cavity meant that it had to have been inside of her at the time of death, and besides, none of those bones and teeth looked like regular bones and teeth of any kind of animal.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Skeletal-tissue-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37206\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Skeletal-tissue-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Skeletal-tissue-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Skeletal-tissue-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1-200x160.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Skeletal-tissue-from-CNS-U2-60-teratoma-1-430x345.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bone-like tissue from CNS U2-60 teratoma.

[\u2026]</p>\n<p>In the case of CNS U2-60, Klaus and Ericksen note that \u201cit is not possible to determine if the lesion was benign or malignant, but a teratoma of this complexity and size likely impacted morbidity via impeded circulation.\u201d  She may not have died from the teratoma directly, but the large tumor probably made her appear pregnant and may have factored into her early death.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Spanish woman was 30 to 40 years old when she died; the Roman woman (who was originally from the near East) was in a slightly wider age range, 25 to 45, at time of death.

It\u2019s a funnel beaker, a pot with a flat base and a funnel-shaped neck that was so ubiquitous among the earliest farmers in Denmark that the period in which they were in use, the Funnel Beaker Culture (4,000 \u2013 2,800 B.C.), was named after them. The funnel beakers from the early part of the period are simply decorated, but as potters gained experience in the technology, ornamentation got more elaborate. The beaker found on Lolland is from the late Funnel Beaker period and is decorated with an extensive pattern of small wedged dashes. A variety of tools were used to create the decorations, sometimes even fingers, but this is the first time a fingerprint has been found on a funnel beaker.</p>\n<p>The beaker was found in large pieces, one of three funnel beakers unearthed at the site which were probably deliberately left as votive offerings. The axe was embedded in the seashore in a vertical position \u2014 not a likely posture had it just been discarded without a care \u2014 along with dozens of other artifacts from wooden candlesticks to spears and hundreds of animal bones. The vessels were likely deposited whole with food or drink inside.

Fought on the banks of Lake \u00c4geri near the Morgarten Pass in the central Switzerland Canton of Schwyz, it was the first battle of the Confederation and their victory helped cement the cantons\u2019 unity to form the kernel of what would become Switzerland.</p>\n<p>The three cantons of Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden first joined in the Eternal Alliance in 1291, just 24 years before the Battle of Morgarten. The Federal Charter of 1291 united the rural valley communities of the central Alps for the purposes of trade and defense of their property and trade routes. This was necessary because the Hapsburgs, newly risen to princely power in what is today Germany, were putting increasing pressure on the territories of the Forest Cantons. The cantons had been granted Imperial immediacy, technically the right to be ruled directly by the Holy Roman Emperor rather than by a long line of feudal lords but in practice a form of political autonomy within the empire, by the Hohenstaufen emperors and in 1308 by Henry VII of Luxembourg, King of the Germans, but the Habsburgs wanted to annex the cantons with their valuable lands and Alpine passes outright.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Illustration-of-Battle-of-Morgarten-in-chronicle-of-Diebold-Schilling.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37238\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Illustration-of-Battle-of-Morgarten-in-chronicle-of-Diebold-Schilling-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Illustration-of-Battle-of-Morgarten-in-chronicle-of-Diebold-Schilling-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Illustration-of-Battle-of-Morgarten-in-chronicle-of-Diebold-Schilling-200x275.jpg 200w\" title='Illumination of Battle of Morgarten from the \"Luzerner Schilling\", a chronicle written by Diebold Schilling in 1513' width=\"108\"/></a>Territorial conflicts with the Habsburgs generated constant skirmishes and raids in the area from the 12th century until the mid-14th. One of those raids \u2014 Schwyz militia attacked Einsiedeln Abbey, a Habsburg ally, in a dispute over pasture and forest land \u2014 gave the Habsburgs the pretext to attack the cantons they coveted with a force of thousands (estimates vary from 3,000 to 22,000) including armoured cavalry. The cantons only had from 1,000 to 3,000 men in their combined militias, farmers and tradesmen who while likely experienced in fisticuffs hardly seemed a match for the mounted knights of Duke Leopold of Austria. The cantons had the advantage of intimate familiarity with the terrain, so when they found out which direction the Habsburg forces were taking, they blocked the Morgarten Pass and ambushed the Austrians from the surrounding hillside, raining rocks, boulders, tree trunks and assorted projectiles on the army trapped between a steep wooded slope on one side and the marshy lake shore on the other. The Swiss then swarmed down upon them and fought hand to hand, felling knights with halberds and taking no quarter.</p>\n<p>One month after the Battle of Morgarten, the cantons signed the Pact of Brunnen, expanding the defensive alliance into a broader confederacy by adopting a common foreign policy. The treaty ushered in the era of the Old Swiss Confederacy as more cantons joined the Pact over the next few decades. Until the late 19th century, the Pact of Brunnen was widely considered by historians the foundation of the Swiss Confederation. It wasn\u2019t until the 20th century that the Federal Charter became seen as Switzerland\u2019s founding document.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Artifacts-found-on-Morgarten-battlefield.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37231\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Artifacts-found-on-Morgarten-battlefield-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Artifacts-found-on-Morgarten-battlefield-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Artifacts-found-on-Morgarten-battlefield-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Artifacts-found-on-Morgarten-battlefield-430x318.jpg 430w\" title=\"Artifacts found on possible site of Morgarten battlefield.

The <a href=\"http://www.wiltshiremuseum.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Wiltshire Museum</a> in Devizes celebrated the Summer Solstice by adding the gold circle about the size of a penny that represents the sun to its permanent exhibition of prehistoric artifacts.</p>\n<p>The sun disc is one of only six of its kind ever found in Britain. It was unearthed from a burial mound at Monkton Farleigh in 1947 along with some flint arrowheads, a pottery beaker and pieces of the skeletal remains of an adult male. The grave was discovered by dowser and author Guy Underwood who believed dowsing could be used to locate archaeologically significant sites and whose studies of the alignment of prehistoric British sites evolved into theories about earth energy patterns that would be published after his death in <em>The Pattern of the Past</em>. </p>\n<p>Monkton Farleigh is 24 miles or so northwest of Stonehenge and the sun disc dates to around 2,400 B.C. which is about the time when the great sarsen stones were arranged in a circle at Stonehenge (between 2,600-2,400 B.C.). Both the stone circle and the sun disc are connected to ancient solar worship.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The sun-disk is a thin embossed sheet of gold with a cross at the centre, surrounded by a circle. Between the lines of both the cross and the circle are fine dots which glint in sunlight. The disc is pierced by two holes that may have been used to sew the disc to a piece of clothing or a head-dress, and may have been used in pairs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After its discovery in the 1940s, the sun disc was kept by the property owner (that sort of thing wouldn\u2019t fly today because ancient precious metals would be considered treasure and by law property of the Crown) Dr. Denis Whitehead. After almost 70 years squirreled away \u2014 it wasn\u2019t shown to an actual archaeologist until 2013 \u2014 the sun disc was donated to the Wiltshire Museum in memory of Dr. Whitehead. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gold-lozenge-from-Bush-Barrow.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37213\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gold-lozenge-from-Bush-Barrow-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gold-lozenge-from-Bush-Barrow-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gold-lozenge-from-Bush-Barrow-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gold-lozenge-from-Bush-Barrow-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Large gold lozenge from Bush Barrow on display at Wiltshire Museum\" width=\"112\"/></a>The Wiltshire Museum has a new Prehistoric Wiltshire gallery that includes the gold artifacts unearthed in 1808 from a grave at Bush Barrow one kilometer (.6 miles) south of Stonehenge, most famously a lozenge-shaped sheet of gold about seven inches long incised with geometric decorations that was found on the breastbone of the deceased. The Bush Barrow artifacts \u2014 a gold belt buckle, a second much smaller gold lozenge, three copper daggers, a bronze ax, a bronze spearhead, a stone mace with bronze fittings, the remains of a shield, a bone scepter \u2014 were on display before at the Wiltshire Museum in the 19th century but security concerns spurred the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society to lend the Bush Barrow gold to the British Museum. After a disastrous restoration in 1985 that irreversibly altered the large lozenge\u2019s shape, the society took the pieces back.

(They were Lutheran bishops, not Catholics, obviously.) The young Peder followed in his father\u2019s footsteps, studying theology at university. After graduating from the University of Copenhagen in 1633, Peder quickly rose through the clerical ranks. He was appointed royal chaplain to King Christian IV in 1635; three years later he was appointed Bishop of Lund. He remained in the position after the transfer of the province Scania from the Denmark\u2013Norway empire to Sweden in 1658, even though there were doubts as to his loyalty to his new monarch King Charles X Gustav. He repeatedly encouraged the king to found a university at Lund which was finally done in 1666, eight years after Winstrup\u2019s first letter to King Charles suggesting he establish a university. Winstrup presided over the university\u2019s inaugural ceremonies and was appointed its chancellor in 1671.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_01.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37197\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_01-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_01-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_01-200x178.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_01-430x384.jpg 430w\" title=\"Peder Winstrup's tomb in Lund Cathedral.

During an extensive program of restoration under architect Axel Nystr\u00f6m in 1833, the Winstrup tombs had to be moved. The exceptional condition of Peder Winstrup\u2019s remains was noted at the time and documented by an artist. They were moved again several times during the 19th century until in 1875 all of the Winstrup family coffins were buried together in the cemetery with the exception of Bishop Peder Winstrup\u2019s. The fine condition of his remains and the fact that he had no other marker in the cathedral inspired officials to keep his tomb in the church crypt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_08.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37196\" height=\"94\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_08-150x94.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_08-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_08-200x126.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_08-430x271.jpg 430w\" title=\"Researchers remove lid of Peder Winstrup's casket.

At the same time, researchers at the Lund University Historical Museum found an old photograph of the bishop\u2019s remains taken when the coffin was opened in 1923. His clothes, including a velvet cape and leather gloves, were perfectly intact and his body was in such good condition that his face, while shrunken, was still entirely recognizable from portraits. Since his rest was to be disturbed anyway, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from Lund University was assembled to study the bishop\u2019s mummified remains. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_ct_sc.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37189\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_ct_sc-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_ct_sc-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_ct_sc-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_ct_sc-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mummy of Peder Winstrup CT scanned.

His internal organs are still in place and identifiable in CT scans. The preservation of his remains was a natural process, the result of copious quantities of plant materials occupying fully half of the space in the casket, constant air flow, his death in December and burial in January and centuries passed inside the dry, cool family crypt. Another factor in his unusual preservation may have been his long final decline which left him very thin, a key step in the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34978\" target=\"_blank\">self-mummification process</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_3d_mo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37200\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 107px) 100vw, 107px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_3d_mo-107x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_3d_mo-107x150.jpg 107w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_3d_mo-200x279.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_3d_mo-430x601.jpg 430w\" title=\"3D model from CT scan data of Peder Winstrup's skull.

He had osteoarthritis in his knee and hip joints and was missing several teeth. Cavities found in his remaining teeth suggest he enjoyed sugary foods, an indication of high status since most people couldn\u2019t afford much sugar in their diets.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first results show dried fluid and mucus in the sinuses, indicating that Winstrup had been bedridden for a long period before he died.

Plaque was also found in the left coronary artery of the heart, the aorta and the carotid artery, indicating that the bishop suffered from atherosclerosis.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe gall bladder also has several gallstones, which could indicate a high consumption of fatty food\u201d, says Caroline Ahlstr\u00f6m Arcini, an osteologist working on the project.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Researchers also found he had an injured tendon in his right shoulder that likely limited his mobility to the point that common tasks like putting on a shirt or combing his hair would have been painful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scan-of-fetal-remains.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37199\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scan-of-fetal-remains-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scan-of-fetal-remains-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scan-of-fetal-remains-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scan-of-fetal-remains-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scan of fetal remains in Peder Winstrup's coffin. Photo: Gunnar Menander\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was the CT scan of the bishop\u2019s coffin that revealed the biggest surprise of the study: the tiny baby tucked under his feet. Nobody knew it was there because it\u2019s hidden by the plant matter in the casket and by Peder Winstrup\u2019s voluminous robes. Researchers believe that it was miscarried or prematurely delivered and hidden in the bishop\u2019s coffin by a member of his family or staff, or perhaps someone involved in the preparation of his body for entombment. </p>\n<p>According to Dr. Per Karsten, director of the Historical Museum at Lund University, there was a tradition in 17th century Scandinavia of mothers bribing cemetery workers to inter babies who had died before they could be baptized in the coffins of other people so that the little ones would be laid to rest in consecrated ground. There are instances of babies being buried in the very church walls for this same reason. As Winstrup died on December 7th, 1679, and wasn\u2019t buried until January 27th, 1680, there would have been plenty of time for someone with access to hide the baby in the bishop\u2019s coffin without the family\u2019s or his staff\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_02.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37195\" height=\"123\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_02-150x123.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_02-150x123.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_02-200x164.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/peder_winstrup_02-430x353.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of Peder Winstrup's mummy.

But we hope to be able to clarify any kinship through a DNA test\u201d, says Per Karsten.</p>\n<p>The next step will be investigations into the textiles in the coffin, as well as further study of the body. Tissue samples from the internal organs are to be removed, among other things.

The pistols remained behind as Napoleon\u2019s empire fell completely apart in a matter of weeks and he was compelled to abdicate under pressure from the Allies, first in favor of his son, and then in favor of nobody. Technically the King of Rome\u2019s pistols were now the property of the newly restored Bourbon King of France Louis XVIII, but the new king wasn\u2019t all that keen to keep a tight grip on the previous throne-holder\u2019s stuff. People who wanted to buy a piece of Napoleon, and there were many such people, could do so easily on the streets of Paris. One of those people was William Bullock.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-interior-1810.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37177\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-interior-1810-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-interior-1810-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-interior-1810-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-interior-1810-430x318.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bullock's first Museum on Piccadilly, colored aquatint by Thomas Hosmer, 1810.

Conveniently located in a port city that was a trade capital of the empire, Bullock was able to acquire specimens and artifacts from sailors who had traveled all over the world. He opened his first museum of curiosities in Liverpool in 1795. He was a dedicated naturalist, an elected member of several exclusive natural history societies, an interest reflected in his collection and which gave its display an educational purpose as well. Bullock was the first in England to arrange exhibits in habitat groups, displaying specimens in some semblance of their natural surroundings.</p>\n<p>In 1809 he moved to London and opened the Liverpool Museum at 22 Piccadilly. It was an immediate hit, welcoming more than 22,000 visitors its first month, and 80,000 in its first six. In April of 1811, one of the visitors was the 35-year-old Jane Austen who <a href=\"http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/brablt10.html#letter55\" target=\"_blank\">wrote to her sister Cassandra</a> that she and her cousin Mary Cooke \u201cafter disposing of her father and mother, went to the Liverpool Museum and the British Gallery, and I had some amusement at each, though my preference for men and women always inclines me to attend more to the company than the sight.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-1815.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37178\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-1815-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-1815-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-1815-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bullocks-Museum-1815-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bullock's Museum, aka Egyptian Hall, aka London Museum, Piccadilly.

Wellcome Images.\" width=\"150\"/></a>By then Bullock had already begun construction of a new building to house his museum at the south end of Piccadilly (today street numbers 170-173). Designed by architect Peter Frederick Robinson who was inspired by the engravings in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_de_l'%C3%89gypte\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Description de l\u2019Egypte</em></a>, the building was the first building in England constructed entirely in Egyptian style, interior and exterior, since Egyptomania had swept Europe after Napoleon\u2019s 1798 campaign in Egypt. The new building had a vast grand hall modeled after the Temple of Dendera that allowed exhibitions of large scale art and artifacts.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/companiontomrbul00bull#page/n7/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Companion to Mr. Bullock\u2019s London Museum and Pantherion</em></a>, a brochure with descriptions of many of the thousands of specimens in the museum, makes it clear that when it opened in 1812, Bullock\u2019s museum on Piccadilly was almost entirely focused on natural history. Animals dominate, with more than 100 pages dedicated to specimens from stuffed giraffes to porpoise jaws. Artifacts were mainly garments, jewelry and use objects from the South Seas, Africa, North and South America, although there is a 16-page chapter dedicated to the museum\u2019s armoury most of which had been acquired from the estate of Dr. Richard Greene\u2019s, a surgeon who a few decades earlier had exhibited his own museum of curiosities in two rooms of his Lichfield home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Capture-of-Bonapartes-carriage.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37181\" height=\"114\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Capture-of-Bonapartes-carriage-150x114.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Capture-of-Bonapartes-carriage-150x114.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Capture-of-Bonapartes-carriage-200x152.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Capture-of-Bonapartes-carriage-430x328.jpg 430w\" title=\"Capture of Bonaparte's carriage after Waterloo, 1815.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Egyptian Hall\u2019s capacity was put to test in 1816 when Bullock exhibited Napoleonic artifacts while Waterloo was still fresh in the public mind. The centerpiece of the show was Napoleon\u2019s bullet-proof travelling carriage which he had used as a home away from home during his campaigns all over Europe and which had been captured by the Prussian army after the Battle of Waterloo. In October of 1815, General Bl\u00fccher arranged for the carriage to be presented to the Prince Regent who, terminally in need of money, turned around and sold it to William Bullock for around \u00a32,500. That price won bought the carriage, its contents \u2014 Napoleon\u2019s personal belongings including his folding camp bed and his travelling kit with 100 solid gold pieces and a million francs in diamonds stashed inside \u2014 and two of the deposed emperor\u2019s horses. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/A-swarm-of-English-bees-hiving-in-the-Imperial-carriage-by-George-Cruikshank-Jan-1816\u00a9-City-of-London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37180\" height=\"105\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/A-swarm-of-English-bees-hiving-in-the-Imperial-carriage-by-George-Cruikshank-Jan-1816\u00a9-City-of-London-150x105.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/A-swarm-of-English-bees-hiving-in-the-Imperial-carriage-by-George-Cruikshank-Jan-1816\u00a9-City-of-London-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/A-swarm-of-English-bees-hiving-in-the-Imperial-carriage-by-George-Cruikshank-Jan-1816\u00a9-City-of-London-200x140.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/A-swarm-of-English-bees-hiving-in-the-Imperial-carriage-by-George-Cruikshank-Jan-1816\u00a9-City-of-London-430x301.jpg 430w\" title='\"A swarm of English bees hiving in the Imperial carriage\" by George Cruikshank, January 1816. \u00a9 City of London' width=\"150\"/></a>The Napoleon exhibition ran from January to August 1816 and drew massive crowds of up to 10,000 visitors a day. They crowded the Egyptian Hall, climbing all over Napoleon\u2019s carriage and pawing through his stuff. In the final tally, about 220,000 visitors saw the Napoleon show in London and more than 800,000 people saw the carriage and associated exhibition on its traveling tour of England, Scotland and Ireland. From his initial outlay of \u00a32,500 for the carriage, Bullock made \u00a335,000.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Exhibition-at-Bullocks-Museum-of-Bonapartes-Carriage-taken-at-Waterloo.-10-Jan-1816.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37179\" height=\"108\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Exhibition-at-Bullocks-Museum-of-Bonapartes-Carriage-taken-at-Waterloo.-10-Jan-1816-150x108.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Exhibition-at-Bullocks-Museum-of-Bonapartes-Carriage-taken-at-Waterloo.-10-Jan-1816-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Exhibition-at-Bullocks-Museum-of-Bonapartes-Carriage-taken-at-Waterloo.-10-Jan-1816-200x144.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Exhibition-at-Bullocks-Museum-of-Bonapartes-Carriage-taken-at-Waterloo.-10-Jan-1816-430x310.jpg 430w\" title=\"&quot;Exhibition at Bullock's Museum of Bonaparte's Carriage taken at Waterloo.&quot; by  Thomas Rowlandson, Jan 10th, 1816. \" width=\"150\"/></a>With visions of even sugarier plums dancing in his head, Bullock decided to open the Museum Napoleon to make even more money from the public fascination with the fallen foe. To add to the exhibition, he went to Paris in January of 1816 and purchased a myriad Napoleonic knick-knacks from the Emperor\u2019s servants, friends and his imperial residences of Malmaison and St. Cloud. It was probably at one of the palaces where Bullock acquired the Roi de Rome\u2019s dueling pistols.</p>\n<p>The fever for all things Napoleon couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t last. By 1818, Bullock was actively looking for buyers, universities and museums, to acquire his entire collection. When the University of Edinburgh and the British Museum turned him down, he took matters into his own hands. In 1819, Bullock sold his collection, by then composed of more than 32,000 objects, in an auction that lasted 26 days and netted him \u00a39,974. Napoleon\u2019s carriage was sold to a coachmaker for \u00a3168.

Waud, printed in Harper's Weekly, July 25th, 1868\" width=\"200\"/></a>When African Americans research their genealogy, they often hit what is known as the wall: no records to be found before the 1870 United States Federal Census which was the first to enumerate former slaves. Before that number of slaves he owned was noted under the master\u2019s entry, but it was purely statistical. There were no individual names listed. The first federal census since emancipation recorded the name, location, age, birthplace, familial relationships, marital status, occupation, ability to read and write, the total value of a person\u2019s estate and more. That\u2019s rich information, but it doesn\u2019t link former slaves to their past so it\u2019s usually a dead end for genealogists.</p>\n<p>There is one other federal source for precious information on formerly enslaved Americans that predates 1870: the records of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau. The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands was a federal agency created in March of 1865 with the end of the Civil War in sight to help the freed slaves in the 11 states of the Confederacy (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia), border states Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and the District of Columbia. With four million people free but destitute, the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau ran a relief operation providing food, clothing, medical care and temporary housing in camps. Over the course of its seven years of operation, the Bureau helped freedmen locate family members separated by war and the sale of human beings, founded and supported schools, performed marriages (slave marriages were illegal so the Bureau often solemnized and legalized couples who had been de facto married for years), provided jobs and banking, oversaw labor contracts between former slave owners and former slaves, resettled freedmen on abandoned lands, represented former slaves in court, helped soldiers and sailors secure their back pay and future pensions. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marriage-of-a-colored-soldier-at-Vicksburg-by-Chaplain-Warren-of-the-Freedmens-Bureau-by-Alfred-R-Waud-Harpers-Weekly-June-30-1866.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37164\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marriage-of-a-colored-soldier-at-Vicksburg-by-Chaplain-Warren-of-the-Freedmens-Bureau-by-Alfred-R-Waud-Harpers-Weekly-June-30-1866-200x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marriage-of-a-colored-soldier-at-Vicksburg-by-Chaplain-Warren-of-the-Freedmens-Bureau-by-Alfred-R-Waud-Harpers-Weekly-June-30-1866-200x128.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marriage-of-a-colored-soldier-at-Vicksburg-by-Chaplain-Warren-of-the-Freedmens-Bureau-by-Alfred-R-Waud-Harpers-Weekly-June-30-1866-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marriage-of-a-colored-soldier-at-Vicksburg-by-Chaplain-Warren-of-the-Freedmens-Bureau-by-Alfred-R-Waud-Harpers-Weekly-June-30-1866-430x276.jpg 430w\" title=\"&quot;Marriage of a colored soldier at Vicksburg by Chaplain Warren of the Freedmen's Bureau&quot; by Alfred R.

The <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/freedmens-bureau/\" target=\"_blank\">National Archives has preserved FB records on microfilm</a> and made them available to researchers at the National Archives building in Washington, DC, and at regional archives in California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington State.

In collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.nmaahc.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.aahgs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.caamuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">California African American Museum</a>, the project seeks to mine raw records for names of freedmen and refugees and make the searchable database available for free online.</p>\n<p>In order to complete so vast project, FamilySearch is enlisting the power of the crowd. There\u2019s a dedicated website, <a href=\"http://www.discoverfreedmen.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Discover Freedmen</a>, where volunteers can learn more about the digitization project. If you would like to help digitize the Freedman\u2019s Bureau records, you must first <a href=\"https://familysearch.org/indexing/get-started-indexer\" target=\"_blank\">download FamilySearch\u2019s dedicated indexing program</a> and then register an account. A quick introductory video explains how to use the program, but it\u2019s fairly intuitive and user friendly. Once you\u2019re registered and the software is up and running, click the Download Batch button, click Show All Projects and scroll down to US \u2013 Freedmen\u2019s Bureau projects. <a href=\"https://familysearch.org/indexing/projects#/list-view?query=US%E2%80%94Freedmen's%20Bureau\" target=\"_blank\">Here\u2019s a list</a> of all the FB batches. There are labor contracts, education records, court records, hospital records, land records, records of complaints, employment, military service claims and rations issued. Only the indexing of the medical records is close to completion; most of the batches have barely been touched.</p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve selected a batch, the image of a record will appear in your software. Your job is to scour it for name of anyone who is not a Bureau official and enter any names you find in the appropriate data entry fields. If you have any difficulty reading handwriting, you can view the next and previous documents which might have associated information written more legibly. You can also use the Share Batch feature to enlist the aid of other indexers. If you just can\u2019t make heads or tails of it, you can Return Batch to give it to other indexers. </p>\n<p>To get started, <a href=\"https://familysearch.org/indexing/get-started-indexer\" target=\"_blank\">download the indexing program here</a>. When you open it up after installation, it will prompt you to register. After that, wade into the records of your choice. If all goes well, the project is expected to take a year after which the records will be exhibited at the opening of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture in late 2016.

Born Jean Fran\u00e7ois Gravelet in 1824, Blondin began his career as performer of acrobatic stunts when he was five years old. Orphaned at age nine, he continued in his chosen career, constantly challenging himself to develop new stunts until he grew from child prodigy into one of the greatest funambulist in France. In 1851 he was invited to join the Ravel Troupe, a sort of acrobatic-ballet-pantomime Menudo with a revolving door of members drawn from some of the most prominent French and Italian performing families, on their tour of the United States. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/View-of-the-interior-of-the-Opera-House-at-Niblos-Garden-1853.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37286\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/View-of-the-interior-of-the-Opera-House-at-Niblos-Garden-1853-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/View-of-the-interior-of-the-Opera-House-at-Niblos-Garden-1853-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/View-of-the-interior-of-the-Opera-House-at-Niblos-Garden-1853-200x122.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/View-of-the-interior-of-the-Opera-House-at-Niblos-Garden-1853-430x263.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/View-of-the-interior-of-the-Opera-House-at-Niblos-Garden-1853.jpg 1532w\" title=\"View of the interior of the Opera House at Niblo's Garden, 1853\" width=\"150\"/></a>In 1855 the Ravel Troupe was booked by caf\u00e9 owner, caterer and theatrical impresario William Niblo to play Niblo\u2019s Garden theater on Broadway in New York City. Always popular, the Ravel Troupe got rave reviews and had their booking extended, ultimately performing more than 300 shows from 1857 to 1859. Blondin, however, didn\u2019t stay put. He formed a splinter troupe (this happened all the time with the Ravel groups; it wasn\u2019t rancorous; everyone got more work that way) with one of Ravel\u2019s lead acrobats, Julian Martinetti, and they toured the country as the Martinetti-Blondin troupe. Blondin was reviewed glowingly in the press as \u201cthe bold and fearless Mons. Blondin.\u201d In a six degrees of separation coincidence, at Crisp\u2019s Gaiety in New Orleans in November 1857, the Martinetti-Blondin troupe shared billing with \u201cthe popular young native tragedian, Mr. Edwin Booth.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37288\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 102px) 100vw, 102px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act-102x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act-200x292.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act-430x627.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Charles-Blondin-carrying-Mrs.-Blondin-theater-act.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Charles Blondin carrying Mrs. Blondin in theatrical tightrope act \" width=\"102\"/></a>After almost eight years on the road with the Ravels, Blondin\u2019s troupe disbanded in late 1858 in Cincinnati.

He and his manager Harry Colcord struggled to get the permits to string the rope. Blondin wanted it strung across Horseshoe Falls where all the drama is, but landowners protested that the mist would soak the hemp rope and make it too slick. In the end Blondin strung his cable from the trunk of an oak tree in White\u2019s Pleasure Grounds on the American side across Niagara Gorge to a rock in front of the Clifton House on the Canadian side, near to where the Rainbow Bridge is today. The rope was 1,100 feet long and just 3.25 inches in diameter. It was poised 160 feet above the Niagara River with a slight sag in the middle 50 feet where it was impossible to attach the guy lines that kept the rest of the cable from swaying too vigorously. It took Blondin and Colcord almost five months to get the cable and lines strung.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37283\" height=\"75\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894-150x75.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894-200x101.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondins_rope_ascension_over_Niagara_River_by_Barker_George_1844-1894-430x217.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blondin's rope ascension over Niagara River, stereoscophic photograph by George Barker, 1859\" width=\"150\"/></a>At 5:00 PM on June 30th, Charles Blondin gripped his 26-feet-long ash balancing pole and walked across the tightrope from the United States to Canada. He sat down in the middle, looked around like he hadn\u2019t a care in the world, then stood back up and kept walking. He stopped again to lay down on his back, did a back somersault and then traipsed with a gait described by one spectator as akin to that of a \u201cbarnyard cock\u201d to the other side. The whole crossing had taken him five minutes.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, Blondin started the return trip. This time he had a Daguerreotype apparatus strapped to his back which he duly deployed 200 feet into his crossing. He tied his balancing pole to the rope, set up the camera and took a picture of the crowd waiting for him on the American side. Then he strapped the camera back onto his back and finished the crossing. That one took 23 minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37289\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859-145x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859-145x150.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859-200x206.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Blondin-carries-manager-Harry-Colcord-on-back-August-14th-1859-430x443.jpg 430w\" title=\"Blondin carrying Harry Colcord on his back across the Niagara River Gorge, August 19th, 1859\" width=\"145\"/></a>As soon as he was done, still basking in the acclaim of the stupefied audience of 25,000, Blondin announced he\u2019d attempt another Niagara tightrope walk on the Fourth of July. He accomplished that one too, without a balancing pole, doing flips and tricks and the return crossing wearing a bag over his head. Blondin would make many more crossings, each with different and increasingly daring stunts. He walked it backwards, did flips all the way across, crossed at night, pushed a wheelbarrow across the rope and strapped a stove to his back so he could make an omelette midway through the crossing which he didn\u2019t even eat himself. He lowered it on a rope to the passengers on the <em>Maid of the Mist</em>. He carried Henry Colcord on his back several times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37285\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860-101x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860-101x150.jpg 101w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860-200x295.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860-430x636.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Coming-Mans-Presidential-Career-a-la-Blondin-Harpers-Weekly-August-25-1860.jpg 811w\" title=\"&quot;The Coming Man's Presidential Career, a la Blondin.&quot; Harper's Weekly, August 25th, 1860\" width=\"101\"/></a>His Niagara Falls exploits made him internationally famous and quite wealthy. His name became synonymous with walking a tightrope, a metaphor that became painfully apt for a divided country soon after his first crossing. Abraham Lincoln was repeatedly depicted in editorial cartoons as Blondin. In 1860, when Lincoln was running for president, Vanity Fair put <a href=\"http://www.abrahamlincolncartoons.info/SubPages/Cartoon.php?UniqueID=322\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cMr. Abraham Blondin De Lave Lincoln\u201d</a> in pantaloons and tights crossing a breaking rail with a black baby in a carpetbag. <a href=\"http://elections.harpweek.com/1860/cartoon-1860-large.asp?UniqueID=12&amp;Year=1860\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Harper\u2019s Weekly</em> cartoon</a> depicted him carrying a slave \u2014 the Republican party\u2019s position on slavery \u2014 across a tightrope with the Constitution as his balancing pole. </p>\n<p>Lincoln embraced the comparison himself, utilizing it in response to his critics during the 1864 election.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gentlemen, suppose all the property you were worth was in gold, and you had put it in the hands of Blondin to carry across the Niagara River on a rope, would you shake the cable, or keep shouting out to him \u2014 \u201cBlondin, stand up a little straighter\u2013Blondin, stoop a little more\u2013go a little faster\u2013lean a little more to the north\u2013lean a little more to the south?\u201d No, you would hold your breath as well as your tongue, and keep your hands off until he was safe over.

It was poised 160 feet above the Niagara River with a slight sag in the middle 50 feet where it was impossible to attach the guy lines that kept the rest of the cable from swaying too vigorously. It took Blondin and Colcord almost five months to get the cable and lines strung. At 5:00 PM on June 30th, Charles Blondin gripped his 26-feet-long ash balancing pole and walked across the tightrope from the United States to Canada. He sat down in the middle, looked around like he hadn\u2019t a care in the world, then stood back up and kept walking. He stopped again to lay down on his back, did a back somersault and then traipsed with a gait described by one spectator as akin to that of a \u201cbarnyard cock\u201d to the other side. The whole crossing had taken him five minutes. Twenty minutes later, Blondin started the return trip. This time he had a Daguerreotype apparatus strapped to his back which he duly deployed 200 feet into his crossing. He tied his balancing pole to the rope, set up the camera and took a picture of the crowd waiting for him on the American side. Then he strapped the camera back onto his back and finished the crossing. That one took 23 minutes. As soon as he was done, still basking in the acclaim of the stupefied audience of 25,000, Blondin announced he\u2019d attempt another Niagara tightrope walk on the Fourth of July. He accomplished that one too, without a balancing pole, doing flips and tricks and the return crossing wearing a bag over his head. Blondin would make many more crossings, each with different and increasingly daring stunts. He walked it backwards, did flips all the way across, crossed at night, pushed a wheelbarrow across the rope and strapped a stove to his back so he could make an omelette midway through the crossing which he didn\u2019t even eat himself. He lowered it on a rope to the passengers on the Maid of the Mist. He carried Henry Colcord on his back several times. His Niagara Falls exploits made him internationally famous and quite wealthy. His name became synonymous with walking a tightrope, a metaphor that became painfully apt for a divided country soon after his first crossing. Abraham Lincoln was repeatedly depicted in editorial cartoons as Blondin. In 1860, when Lincoln was running for president, Vanity Fair put \u201cMr. Abraham Blondin De Lave Lincoln\u201d in pantaloons and tights crossing a breaking rail with a black baby in a carpetbag. Harper\u2019s Weekly cartoon depicted him carrying a slave \u2014 the Republican party\u2019s position on slavery \u2014 across a tightrope with the Constitution as his balancing pole. Lincoln embraced the comparison himself, utilizing it in response to his critics during the 1864 election. Gentlemen, suppose all the property you were worth was in gold, and you had put it in the hands of Blondin to carry across the Niagara River on a rope, would you shake the cable, or keep shouting out to him \u2014 \u201cBlondin, stand up a little straighter\u2013Blondin, stoop a little more\u2013go a little faster\u2013lean a little more to the north\u2013lean a little more to the south?\u201d No, you would hold your breath as well as your tongue, and keep your hands off until he was safe over. The Government are carrying an immense weight. Untold treasures are in their hands. They are doing the very best they can. Don\u2019t badger them. Keep silence, and we\u2019ll get you safe across. Frank Leslie\u2019s Budget of Fun of September 1st, 1864, published a cartoon of the scene, with Lincoln carrying two men on his back this time (Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles on Lincoln\u2019s shoulders and War Secretary Edwin Stanton on Welles\u2019s shoulders), pushing a wheelbarrow filled with money, Columbia and the American flag while all around him people talk smack. As for Blondin, he would go on to perform all over the world, drawing amazed and horrified crowds everywhere he went. He retired briefly in the late 1870s, but went back on the stage in 1880 and continued to walk, cycle, push lions in wheelbarrows over the tightrope until his final performance in 1896. He died just a few months later in February of 1897 at the age of 72 from diabetes.", "read_time": 358.5, "title_html": "<h3 id=\"post-37279\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37279\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 156 years ago today, the first man crossed Niagara Falls on a tightrope\">156 years ago today, the first man crossed Niagara Falls on a tightrope</a></h3>"}

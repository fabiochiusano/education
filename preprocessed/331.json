{"content": "By James Le , Machine Learning Engineer. comments Editor's note: This article is a shorter version of James Le's original, which you can find here in its entirety . Why is data science sexy? It has something to do with so many new applications and entire new industries come into being from the judicious use of copious amounts of data. Examples include speech recognition, object recognition in computer vision, robots and self-driving cars, bioinformatics, neuroscience, the discovery of exoplanets and an understanding of the origins of the universe, and the assembling of inexpensive but winning baseball teams. In each of these instances, the data scientist is central to the whole enterprise. He/she must combine knowledge of the application area with statistical expertise and implement it all using the latest in computer science ideas. In the end, sexiness comes down to being effective. I recently read\u00a0 Sebastian Gutierrez\u2019s \u201cData Scientists at Work\u201d , in which he interviewed 16 data scientists across 16 different industries to understand both how they think about it theoretically and also very practically what problems they\u2019re solving, how data\u2019s helping, and what it takes to be successful. All 16 interviewees are at the forefront of understanding and extracting value from data across an array of public and private organizational types \u2014 from startups and mature corporations to primary research groups and humanitarian nonprofits \u2014 and across a diverse range of industries \u2014 advertising, e-commerce, email marketing, enterprise cloud computing, fashion, industrial internet, internet television and entertainment, music, nonprofit, neurobiology, newspapers and media, professional and social networks, retail, sales intelligence, and venture capital. In particular, Sebastian asked open-ended questions so that the personalities and spontaneous thought processes of each interviewee would shine through clearly and accurately. The practitioners in this book share their thoughts on what data science means to them and how they think about it, their suggestions on how to join the field, and their wisdom won through experience on what a data scientist must understand deeply to be successful within the field. In this post, I want to share the best answers that these data scientists gave for the question: \u201cWhat advice would you give to someone starting out in data science?\u201d \u00a0 1\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Caitlin Smallwood , \u00a0 Vice President of Science and Algorithms at \u00a0 Netflix \u00a0 \u201cI would say to always bite the bullet with regard to understanding the basics of the data first before you do anything else, even though it\u2019s not sexy and not as fun. In other words,\u00a0put effort into understanding how the data is captured, understand exactly how each data field is defined, and understand when data is missing. If the data is missing, does that mean something in and of itself? Is it missing only in certain situations? These little, teeny nuanced data gotchas will really get you. They really will. You can use the most sophisticated algorithm under the sun, but it\u2019s the same old junk-in\u2013junk-out thing. You cannot turn a blind eye to the raw data, no matter how excited you are to get to the fun part of the modeling. Dot your i\u2019s, cross your t\u2019s, and check everything you can about the underlying data before you go down the path of developing a model. Another thing I\u2019ve learned over time is that\u00a0a mix of algorithms is almost always better than one single algorithm in the context of a system, because different techniques exploit different aspects of the patterns in the data, especially in complex large data sets.\u00a0So while you can take one particular algorithm and iterate and iterate to make it better, I have almost always seen that a combination of algorithms tends to do better than just one algorithm.\u201d \u00a0 2\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Yann LeCun , \u00a0 Director of AI Research at Facebook and Professor of Data Science/Computer Science/Neuroscience at\u00a0NYU \u00a0 \u201cI always give the same advice, as I get asked this question often. My take on it is that if you\u2019re an undergrad, study a specialty where you can take as many math and physics courses as you can. And it has to be the right courses, unfortunately. What I\u2019m going to say is going to sound paradoxical, but majors in engineering or physics are probably more appropriate than say math, computer science, or economics. Of course, you need to learn to program, so you need to take a large number of classes in computer science to learn the mechanics of how to program. Then, later, do a graduate program in data science. Take undergrad machine learning, AI, or computer vision courses, because you need to get exposed to those techniques. Then, after that, take all the math and physics courses you can take. Especially the continuous applied mathematics courses like optimization, because they prepare you for what\u2019s really challenging. It depends where you want to go because there are a lot of different jobs in the context of data science or AI. People should really think about what they want to do and then study those subjects. Right now the hot topic is deep learning, and what that means is learning and understanding classic work on neural nets, learning about optimization, learning about linear algebra, and similar topics. This helps you learn the underlying mathematical techniques and general concepts we confront every day.\u201d \u00a0 3\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Daniel Tunkelang , \u00a0 Chief Search Evangelist at Twiggle, Ex-Head of Search Quality at \u00a0 LinkedIn \u00a0 \u201cTo someone coming from math or the physical sciences, I\u2019d suggest investing in learning software skills \u2014 especially Hadoop and R, which are the most widely used tools. Someone coming from software engineering should take a class in machine learning and work on a project with real data, lots of which is available for free. As many people have said, the best way to become a data scientist is to do data science. The data is out there and the science isn\u2019t that hard to learn, especially for someone trained in math, science, or engineering. Read \u201c The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data \u201d \u2014 a classic essay by Google researchers Alon Halevy, Peter Norvig, and Fernando Pereira. The essay is usually summarized as \u201cmore data beats better algorithms.\u201d It is worth reading the whole essay, as it gives a survey of recent successes in using web-scale data to improve speech recognition and machine translation. Then for good measure, listen to what\u00a0 Monica Rogati \u00a0has to say about how better data beats more data. Understand and internalize these two insights, and you\u2019re well on your way to becoming a data scientist.\u201d \u00a0 4\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Claudia Perlich , \u00a0 Chief Scientist at Dstillery \u00a0 \u201cI think, ultimately, learning how to do data science is like learning to ski. You have to do it. You can only listen to so many videos and watch it happen. At the end of the day, you have to get on your damn skis and go down that hill. You will crash a few times on the way and that is fine. That is the learning experience you need. I actually much prefer to ask interviewees about things that did not go well rather than what did work, because that tells me what they learned in the process. Whenever people come to me and ask, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I say, \u201cYeah, sure, take online courses on machine learning techniques. There is no doubt that this is useful. You clearly have to be able to program, at least somewhat. You do not have to be a Java programmer, but you must get something done somehow. I do not care how.\u201d Ultimately, whether it is volunteering at DataKind to spend your time at NGOs to help them, or going to the Kaggle website and participating in some of their data mining competitions \u2014 just get your hands and feet wet. Especially on Kaggle, read the discussion forums of what other people tell you about the problem, because that is where you learn what people do, what worked for them, and what did not work for them. So anything that gets you actually involved in doing something with data, even if you are not paid being for it, is a great thing. Remember, you have to ski down that hill. There is no way around it. You cannot learn any other way. So volunteer your time, get your hands dirty in any which way you can think, and if you have a chance to do internships \u2014 perfect. Otherwise, there are many opportunities where you can just get started. So just do it.\u201d \u00a0 5\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Anna Smith , \u00a0 Senior Data Engineer at Spotify, Ex-Analytics Engineer at Rent the\u00a0Runway \u00a0 \u201cIf someone is just starting out in data science, the most important thing to understand is that it\u2019s okay to ask people questions. I also think humility is very important. You\u2019ve got to make sure that you\u2019re not tied up in what you\u2019re doing. You can always make changes and start over. Being able to scrap code, I think, is really hard when you\u2019re starting out, but the most important thing is to just do something. Even if you don\u2019t have a job in data science, you can still explore data sets in your downtime and can come up with questions to ask the data. In my personal time, I\u2019ve played around with Reddit data. I asked myself, \u201cWhat can I explore about Reddit with the tools that I have or don\u2019t have?\u201d This is great because once you\u2019ve started, you can see how other people have approached the same problem. Just use your gut and start reading other people\u2019s articles and be like, \u201cI can use this technique in my approach.\u201d Start out very slowly and move slowly. I tried reading a lot when I started, but I think that\u2019s not as helpful until you\u2019ve actually played around with code and with data to understand how it actually works, how it moves. When people present it in books, it\u2019s all nice and pretty. In real life, it\u2019s really not. I think trying a lot of different things is also very important. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever thought that I would be here. I also have no idea where I\u2019ll be in five years. But maybe that\u2019s how I learn, by doing a bit of everything across many different disciplines to try to understand what fits me best.\u201d \u00a0 6\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Amy Heineike , \u00a0 Vice President of Technology at PrimerAI, Ex-Director of Mathematics at\u00a0Quid \u00a0 \u201cI think perhaps they would need to start by looking at themselves and figuring out what it is they really care about. What is it they want to do? Right now, data science is a bit of a hot topic, and so I think there are a lot of people who think that if they can have the \u201cdata science\u201d label, then magic, happiness, and money will come to them. So I really suggest figuring out what bits of data science you actually care about. That is the first question you should ask yourself. And then you want to figure out how to get good at that. You also want to start thinking about what kinds of jobs are out there that really play to what you are interested in. One strategy is to go really deep into one part of what you need to know. We have people on our team who have done PhDs in natural language processing or who got PhDs in physics, where they\u2019ve used a lot of different analytical methods. So you can go really deep into an area and then find people for whom that kind of problem is important or similar problems that you can use the same kind of thinking to solve. So that\u2019s one approach. Another approach is to just try stuff out. There are a lot of data sets out there. If you\u2019re in one job and you\u2019re trying to change jobs, try to think whether there\u2019s data you could use in your current role that you could go and get and crunch in interesting ways. Find an excuse to get to try something out and see if that\u2019s really what you want to do. Or just from home there\u2019s open data you can pull. Just poke around and see what you can find and then start playing with that. I think that\u2019s a great way to start. There are a lot of different roles that are going under the name \u201cdata science\u201d right now, and there are also a lot of roles that are probably what you would think of data science but don\u2019t have a label yet because people aren\u2019t necessarily using it. Think about what it is that you really want.\u201d \u00a0 7\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Kira Radinsky , \u00a0 Chief Scientist and Director of Data Science at eBay, Ex-CTO and Co-Founder of SalesPredict \u00a0 \u201cFind a problem you\u2019re excited about. For me, every time I started something new, it\u2019s really boring to just study without a having a problem I\u2019m trying to solve. Start reading material and as soon as you can, start working with it and your problem. You\u2019ll start to see problems as you go. This will lead you to other learning resources, whether they are books, papers, or people. So spend time with the problem and people, and you\u2019ll be fine. Understand the basics really deeply. Understand some basic data structures and computer science. Understand the basis of the tools you use and understand the math behind them, not just how to use them. Understand the inputs and the outputs and what is actually going on inside, because otherwise you won\u2019t know when to apply it. Also, it depends on the problem you\u2019re tackling. There are many different tools for so many different problems. You\u2019ve got to know what each tool can do and you\u2019ve got to know the problem that you\u2019re doing really well to know which tools and techniques to apply.\u201d \u00a0 8\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Jake Porway , \u00a0 Founder and Executive Director of\u00a0DataKind \u00a0 \u201cI think a strong statistical background is a prerequisite, because you need to know what you\u2019re doing, and understand the guts of the model you build. Additionally, my statistics program also taught a lot about ethics, which is something that we think a lot about at DataKind. You always want to think about how your work is going to be applied. You can give anybody an algorithm. You can give someone a model for using stop-and-frisk data, where the police are going to make arrests, but why and to what end? It\u2019s really like building any new technology. You\u2019ve got to think about the risks as well as the benefits and really weigh that because you are responsible for what you create. No matter where you come from, as long as you understand the tools that you\u2019re using to draw conclusions, that is the best thing you can do. We are all scientists now, and I\u2019m not just talking about designing products. We are all drawing conclusions about the world we live in. That\u2019s what statistics is \u2014 collecting data to prove a hypothesis or to create a model of the way the world works. If you just trust the results of that model blindly, that\u2019s dangerous because that\u2019s your interpretation of the world, and as flawed as it is, your understanding is how flawed the result is going to be. In short, learn statistics and be thoughtful.\u201d \u00a0 Data Scientists at Work \u00a0 displays how some of the world\u2019s top data scientists work across a dizzyingly wide variety of industries and applications \u2014 each leveraging her own blend of domain expertise, statistics, and computer science to create tremendous value and impact. Data is being generated exponentially and those who can understand that data and extract value from it are needed now more than ever. The hard-earned lessons and joy about data and models from these thoughtful practitioners would be tremendously useful if you aspire to join the next generation of data scientists. \u00a0 Bio: James Le is currently applying for Master of Science Computer Science programs in the US for the Fall 2018 admission.

It has something to do with so many new applications and entire new industries come into being from the judicious use of copious amounts of data. Examples include speech recognition, object recognition in computer vision, robots and self-driving cars, bioinformatics, neuroscience, the discovery of exoplanets and an understanding of the origins of the universe, and the assembling of inexpensive but winning baseball teams. In each of these instances, the data scientist is central to the whole enterprise. He/she must combine knowledge of the application area with statistical expertise and implement it all using the latest in computer science ideas.</p>\n<p>In the end, sexiness comes down to being effective. I recently read\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Data-Scientists-Work-Sebastian-Gutierrez/dp/1430265981\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Sebastian Gutierrez\u2019s \u201cData Scientists at Work\u201d</em></strong></a>, in which he interviewed 16 data scientists across 16 different industries to understand both how they think about it theoretically and also very practically what problems they\u2019re solving, how data\u2019s helping, and what it takes to be successful. All 16 interviewees are at the forefront of understanding and extracting value from data across an array of public and private organizational types \u2014 from startups and mature corporations to primary research groups and humanitarian nonprofits \u2014 and across a diverse range of industries \u2014 advertising, e-commerce, email marketing, enterprise cloud computing, fashion, industrial internet, internet television and entertainment, music, nonprofit, neurobiology, newspapers and media, professional and social networks, retail, sales intelligence, and venture capital.</p>\n<p>In particular, Sebastian asked open-ended questions so that the personalities and spontaneous thought processes of each interviewee would shine through clearly and accurately. The practitioners in this book share their thoughts on what data science means to them and how they think about it, their suggestions on how to join the field, and their wisdom won through experience on what a data scientist must understand deeply to be successful within the field.</p>\n<p>In this post, I want to share the best answers that these data scientists gave for the question:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cWhat advice would you give to someone starting out in data science?\u201d</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>1\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlinsmallwood/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Caitlin Smallwood</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Vice President of Science and Algorithms at</em><strong><em>\u00a0</em></strong><em>Netflix</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI would say to always bite the bullet with regard to understanding the basics of the data first before you do anything else, even though it\u2019s not sexy and not as fun. In other words,\u00a0put effort into understanding how the data is captured, understand exactly how each data field is defined, and understand when data is missing. If the data is missing, does that mean something in and of itself? Is it missing only in certain situations? These little, teeny nuanced data gotchas will really get you. They really will.</br></p>\n<p>You can use the most sophisticated algorithm under the sun, but it\u2019s the same old junk-in\u2013junk-out thing. You cannot turn a blind eye to the raw data, no matter how excited you are to get to the fun part of the modeling. Dot your i\u2019s, cross your t\u2019s, and check everything you can about the underlying data before you go down the path of developing a model.</p>\n<p>Another thing I\u2019ve learned over time is that\u00a0a mix of algorithms is almost always better than one single algorithm in the context of a system, because different techniques exploit different aspects of the patterns in the data, especially in complex large data sets.\u00a0So while you can take one particular algorithm and iterate and iterate to make it better, I have almost always seen that a combination of algorithms tends to do better than just one algorithm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>2\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yann-lecun-0b999/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Yann LeCun</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Director of AI Research at Facebook and Professor of Data Science/Computer Science/Neuroscience at\u00a0NYU</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI always give the same advice, as I get asked this question often. My take on it is that if you\u2019re an undergrad, study a specialty where you can take as many math and physics courses as you can. And it has to be the right courses, unfortunately. What I\u2019m going to say is going to sound paradoxical, but majors in engineering or physics are probably more appropriate than say math, computer science, or economics. Of course, you need to learn to program, so you need to take a large number of classes in computer science to learn the mechanics of how to program. Then, later, do a graduate program in data science. Take undergrad machine learning, AI, or computer vision courses, because you need to get exposed to those techniques. Then, after that, take all the math and physics courses you can take. Especially the continuous applied mathematics courses like optimization, because they prepare you for what\u2019s really challenging.</br></p>\n<p>It depends where you want to go because there are a lot of different jobs in the context of data science or AI. People should really think about what they want to do and then study those subjects. Right now the hot topic is deep learning, and what that means is learning and understanding classic work on neural nets, learning about optimization, learning about linear algebra, and similar topics. This helps you learn the underlying mathematical techniques and general concepts we confront every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>3\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtunkelang/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Daniel Tunkelang</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Chief Search Evangelist at Twiggle, Ex-Head of Search Quality at</em><strong>\u00a0</strong><em>LinkedIn</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u201cTo someone coming from math or the physical sciences, I\u2019d suggest investing in learning software skills \u2014 especially Hadoop and R, which are the most widely used tools. Someone coming from software engineering should take a class in machine learning and work on a project with real data, lots of which is available for free. As many people have said, the best way to become a data scientist is to do data science. The data is out there and the science isn\u2019t that hard to learn, especially for someone trained in math, science, or engineering.</br></p>\n<p>Read \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/igert/courses/E6898/Norvig.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data</a>\u201d \u2014 a classic essay by Google researchers Alon Halevy, Peter Norvig, and Fernando Pereira. The essay is usually summarized as \u201cmore data beats better algorithms.\u201d It is worth reading the whole essay, as it gives a survey of recent successes in using web-scale data to improve speech recognition and machine translation. Then for good measure, listen to what\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7iopLnhDik\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Monica Rogati</a>\u00a0has to say about how better data beats more data. Understand and internalize these two insights, and you\u2019re well on your way to becoming a data scientist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>4\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cperlich/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Claudia Perlich</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Chief Scientist at Dstillery</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI think, ultimately, learning how to do data science is like learning to ski. You have to do it. You can only listen to so many videos and watch it happen. At the end of the day, you have to get on your damn skis and go down that hill. You will crash a few times on the way and that is fine. That is the learning experience you need. I actually much prefer to ask interviewees about things that did not go well rather than what did work, because that tells me what they learned in the process.</br></p>\n<p>Whenever people come to me and ask, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I say, \u201cYeah, sure, take online courses on machine learning techniques. There is no doubt that this is useful. You clearly have to be able to program, at least somewhat. You do not have to be a Java programmer, but you must get something done somehow. I do not care how.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ultimately, whether it is volunteering at DataKind to spend your time at NGOs to help them, or going to the Kaggle website and participating in some of their data mining competitions \u2014 just get your hands and feet wet. Especially on Kaggle, read the discussion forums of what other people tell you about the problem, because that is where you learn what people do, what worked for them, and what did not work for them. So anything that gets you actually involved in doing something with data, even if you are not paid being for it, is a great thing.</p>\n<p>Remember, you have to ski down that hill. There is no way around it. You cannot learn any other way. So volunteer your time, get your hands dirty in any which way you can think, and if you have a chance to do internships \u2014 perfect. Otherwise, there are many opportunities where you can just get started. So just do it.\u201d<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C4E12AQGWZP8gdEFwsw\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGWZP8gdEFwsw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=2124662400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=qqWRa1JQo3n5NSZ7DlXb3KG31aUa6rHH3x1zZWpT8NQ\" width=\"99%\"/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>5\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-smith-338996b/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Anna Smith</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Senior Data Engineer at Spotify, Ex-Analytics Engineer at Rent the\u00a0Runway</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cIf someone is just starting out in data science, the most important thing to understand is that it\u2019s okay to ask people questions. I also think humility is very important. You\u2019ve got to make sure that you\u2019re not tied up in what you\u2019re doing. You can always make changes and start over. Being able to scrap code, I think, is really hard when you\u2019re starting out, but the most important thing is to just do something.</p>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t have a job in data science, you can still explore data sets in your downtime and can come up with questions to ask the data. In my personal time, I\u2019ve played around with Reddit data. I asked myself, \u201cWhat can I explore about Reddit with the tools that I have or don\u2019t have?\u201d This is great because once you\u2019ve started, you can see how other people have approached the same problem. Just use your gut and start reading other people\u2019s articles and be like, \u201cI can use this technique in my approach.\u201d Start out very slowly and move slowly. I tried reading a lot when I started, but I think that\u2019s not as helpful until you\u2019ve actually played around with code and with data to understand how it actually works, how it moves. When people present it in books, it\u2019s all nice and pretty. In real life, it\u2019s really not.</p>\n<p>I think trying a lot of different things is also very important. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever thought that I would be here. I also have no idea where I\u2019ll be in five years. But maybe that\u2019s how I learn, by doing a bit of everything across many different disciplines to try to understand what fits me best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>6\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-heineike-b877062/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Amy Heineike</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Vice President of Technology at PrimerAI, Ex-Director of Mathematics at\u00a0Quid</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cI think perhaps they would need to start by looking at themselves and figuring out what it is they really care about. What is it they want to do? Right now, data science is a bit of a hot topic, and so I think there are a lot of people who think that if they can have the \u201cdata science\u201d label, then magic, happiness, and money will come to them. So I really suggest figuring out what bits of data science you actually care about. That is the first question you should ask yourself. And then you want to figure out how to get good at that. You also want to start thinking about what kinds of jobs are out there that really play to what you are interested in.</p>\n<p>One strategy is to go really deep into one part of what you need to know. We have people on our team who have done PhDs in natural language processing or who got PhDs in physics, where they\u2019ve used a lot of different analytical methods. So you can go really deep into an area and then find people for whom that kind of problem is important or similar problems that you can use the same kind of thinking to solve. So that\u2019s one approach.</p>\n<p>Another approach is to just try stuff out. There are a lot of data sets out there. If you\u2019re in one job and you\u2019re trying to change jobs, try to think whether there\u2019s data you could use in your current role that you could go and get and crunch in interesting ways. Find an excuse to get to try something out and see if that\u2019s really what you want to do. Or just from home there\u2019s open data you can pull. Just poke around and see what you can find and then start playing with that. I think that\u2019s a great way to start. There are a lot of different roles that are going under the name \u201cdata science\u201d right now, and there are also a lot of roles that are probably what you would think of data science but don\u2019t have a label yet because people aren\u2019t necessarily using it. Think about what it is that you really want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>7\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-radinsky-6b68601/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kira Radinsky</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Chief Scientist and Director of Data Science at eBay, Ex-CTO and Co-Founder of SalesPredict</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cFind a problem you\u2019re excited about. For me, every time I started something new, it\u2019s really boring to just study without a having a problem I\u2019m trying to solve. Start reading material and as soon as you can, start working with it and your problem. You\u2019ll start to see problems as you go. This will lead you to other learning resources, whether they are books, papers, or people. So spend time with the problem and people, and you\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>Understand the basics really deeply. Understand some basic data structures and computer science. Understand the basis of the tools you use and understand the math behind them, not just how to use them. Understand the inputs and the outputs and what is actually going on inside, because otherwise you won\u2019t know when to apply it. Also, it depends on the problem you\u2019re tackling. There are many different tools for so many different problems. You\u2019ve got to know what each tool can do and you\u2019ve got to know the problem that you\u2019re doing really well to know which tools and techniques to apply.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>8\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakeporway/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jake Porway</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Founder and Executive Director of\u00a0DataKind</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cI think a strong statistical background is a prerequisite, because you need to know what you\u2019re doing, and understand the guts of the model you build. Additionally, my statistics program also taught a lot about ethics, which is something that we think a lot about at DataKind. You always want to think about how your work is going to be applied. You can give anybody an algorithm. You can give someone a model for using stop-and-frisk data, where the police are going to make arrests, but why and to what end? It\u2019s really like building any new technology. You\u2019ve got to think about the risks as well as the benefits and really weigh that because you are responsible for what you create.</p>\n<p>No matter where you come from, as long as you understand the tools that you\u2019re using to draw conclusions, that is the best thing you can do. We are all scientists now, and I\u2019m not just talking about designing products. We are all drawing conclusions about the world we live in. That\u2019s what statistics is \u2014 collecting data to prove a hypothesis or to create a model of the way the world works. If you just trust the results of that model blindly, that\u2019s dangerous because that\u2019s your interpretation of the world, and as flawed as it is, your understanding is how flawed the result is going to be.</p>\n<p>In short, learn statistics and be thoughtful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22945255-data-scientists-at-work\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Data Scientists at Work</strong></a><strong>\u00a0</strong>displays how some of the world\u2019s top data scientists work across a dizzyingly wide variety of industries and applications \u2014 each leveraging her own blend of domain expertise, statistics, and computer science to create tremendous value and impact.</p>\n<p>Data is being generated exponentially and those who can understand that data and extract value from it are needed now more than ever.

It has something to do with so many new applications and entire new industries come into being from the judicious use of copious amounts of data. Examples include speech recognition, object recognition in computer vision, robots and self-driving cars, bioinformatics, neuroscience, the discovery of exoplanets and an understanding of the origins of the universe, and the assembling of inexpensive but winning baseball teams. In each of these instances, the data scientist is central to the whole enterprise. He/she must combine knowledge of the application area with statistical expertise and implement it all using the latest in computer science ideas.</p>\n<p>In the end, sexiness comes down to being effective. I recently read\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Data-Scientists-Work-Sebastian-Gutierrez/dp/1430265981\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Sebastian Gutierrez\u2019s \u201cData Scientists at Work\u201d</em></strong></a>, in which he interviewed 16 data scientists across 16 different industries to understand both how they think about it theoretically and also very practically what problems they\u2019re solving, how data\u2019s helping, and what it takes to be successful. All 16 interviewees are at the forefront of understanding and extracting value from data across an array of public and private organizational types \u2014 from startups and mature corporations to primary research groups and humanitarian nonprofits \u2014 and across a diverse range of industries \u2014 advertising, e-commerce, email marketing, enterprise cloud computing, fashion, industrial internet, internet television and entertainment, music, nonprofit, neurobiology, newspapers and media, professional and social networks, retail, sales intelligence, and venture capital.</p>\n<p>In particular, Sebastian asked open-ended questions so that the personalities and spontaneous thought processes of each interviewee would shine through clearly and accurately. The practitioners in this book share their thoughts on what data science means to them and how they think about it, their suggestions on how to join the field, and their wisdom won through experience on what a data scientist must understand deeply to be successful within the field.</p>\n<p>In this post, I want to share the best answers that these data scientists gave for the question:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cWhat advice would you give to someone starting out in data science?\u201d</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>1\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlinsmallwood/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Caitlin Smallwood</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Vice President of Science and Algorithms at</em><strong><em>\u00a0</em></strong><em>Netflix</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI would say to always bite the bullet with regard to understanding the basics of the data first before you do anything else, even though it\u2019s not sexy and not as fun. In other words,\u00a0put effort into understanding how the data is captured, understand exactly how each data field is defined, and understand when data is missing. If the data is missing, does that mean something in and of itself? Is it missing only in certain situations? These little, teeny nuanced data gotchas will really get you. They really will.</br></p>\n<p>You can use the most sophisticated algorithm under the sun, but it\u2019s the same old junk-in\u2013junk-out thing. You cannot turn a blind eye to the raw data, no matter how excited you are to get to the fun part of the modeling. Dot your i\u2019s, cross your t\u2019s, and check everything you can about the underlying data before you go down the path of developing a model.</p>\n<p>Another thing I\u2019ve learned over time is that\u00a0a mix of algorithms is almost always better than one single algorithm in the context of a system, because different techniques exploit different aspects of the patterns in the data, especially in complex large data sets.\u00a0So while you can take one particular algorithm and iterate and iterate to make it better, I have almost always seen that a combination of algorithms tends to do better than just one algorithm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>2\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yann-lecun-0b999/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Yann LeCun</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Director of AI Research at Facebook and Professor of Data Science/Computer Science/Neuroscience at\u00a0NYU</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI always give the same advice, as I get asked this question often. My take on it is that if you\u2019re an undergrad, study a specialty where you can take as many math and physics courses as you can. And it has to be the right courses, unfortunately. What I\u2019m going to say is going to sound paradoxical, but majors in engineering or physics are probably more appropriate than say math, computer science, or economics. Of course, you need to learn to program, so you need to take a large number of classes in computer science to learn the mechanics of how to program. Then, later, do a graduate program in data science. Take undergrad machine learning, AI, or computer vision courses, because you need to get exposed to those techniques. Then, after that, take all the math and physics courses you can take. Especially the continuous applied mathematics courses like optimization, because they prepare you for what\u2019s really challenging.</br></p>\n<p>It depends where you want to go because there are a lot of different jobs in the context of data science or AI. People should really think about what they want to do and then study those subjects. Right now the hot topic is deep learning, and what that means is learning and understanding classic work on neural nets, learning about optimization, learning about linear algebra, and similar topics. This helps you learn the underlying mathematical techniques and general concepts we confront every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>3\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtunkelang/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Daniel Tunkelang</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Chief Search Evangelist at Twiggle, Ex-Head of Search Quality at</em><strong>\u00a0</strong><em>LinkedIn</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u201cTo someone coming from math or the physical sciences, I\u2019d suggest investing in learning software skills \u2014 especially Hadoop and R, which are the most widely used tools. Someone coming from software engineering should take a class in machine learning and work on a project with real data, lots of which is available for free. As many people have said, the best way to become a data scientist is to do data science. The data is out there and the science isn\u2019t that hard to learn, especially for someone trained in math, science, or engineering.</br></p>\n<p>Read \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/igert/courses/E6898/Norvig.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data</a>\u201d \u2014 a classic essay by Google researchers Alon Halevy, Peter Norvig, and Fernando Pereira. The essay is usually summarized as \u201cmore data beats better algorithms.\u201d It is worth reading the whole essay, as it gives a survey of recent successes in using web-scale data to improve speech recognition and machine translation. Then for good measure, listen to what\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7iopLnhDik\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Monica Rogati</a>\u00a0has to say about how better data beats more data. Understand and internalize these two insights, and you\u2019re well on your way to becoming a data scientist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>4\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cperlich/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Claudia Perlich</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Chief Scientist at Dstillery</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI think, ultimately, learning how to do data science is like learning to ski. You have to do it. You can only listen to so many videos and watch it happen. At the end of the day, you have to get on your damn skis and go down that hill. You will crash a few times on the way and that is fine. That is the learning experience you need. I actually much prefer to ask interviewees about things that did not go well rather than what did work, because that tells me what they learned in the process.</br></p>\n<p>Whenever people come to me and ask, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I say, \u201cYeah, sure, take online courses on machine learning techniques. There is no doubt that this is useful. You clearly have to be able to program, at least somewhat. You do not have to be a Java programmer, but you must get something done somehow. I do not care how.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ultimately, whether it is volunteering at DataKind to spend your time at NGOs to help them, or going to the Kaggle website and participating in some of their data mining competitions \u2014 just get your hands and feet wet. Especially on Kaggle, read the discussion forums of what other people tell you about the problem, because that is where you learn what people do, what worked for them, and what did not work for them. So anything that gets you actually involved in doing something with data, even if you are not paid being for it, is a great thing.</p>\n<p>Remember, you have to ski down that hill. There is no way around it. You cannot learn any other way. So volunteer your time, get your hands dirty in any which way you can think, and if you have a chance to do internships \u2014 perfect. Otherwise, there are many opportunities where you can just get started. So just do it.\u201d<br/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" data-media-urn=\"urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:C4E12AQGWZP8gdEFwsw\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGWZP8gdEFwsw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=2124662400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=qqWRa1JQo3n5NSZ7DlXb3KG31aUa6rHH3x1zZWpT8NQ\" width=\"99%\"/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>5\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-smith-338996b/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Anna Smith</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Senior Data Engineer at Spotify, Ex-Analytics Engineer at Rent the\u00a0Runway</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cIf someone is just starting out in data science, the most important thing to understand is that it\u2019s okay to ask people questions. I also think humility is very important. You\u2019ve got to make sure that you\u2019re not tied up in what you\u2019re doing. You can always make changes and start over. Being able to scrap code, I think, is really hard when you\u2019re starting out, but the most important thing is to just do something.</p>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t have a job in data science, you can still explore data sets in your downtime and can come up with questions to ask the data. In my personal time, I\u2019ve played around with Reddit data. I asked myself, \u201cWhat can I explore about Reddit with the tools that I have or don\u2019t have?\u201d This is great because once you\u2019ve started, you can see how other people have approached the same problem. Just use your gut and start reading other people\u2019s articles and be like, \u201cI can use this technique in my approach.\u201d Start out very slowly and move slowly. I tried reading a lot when I started, but I think that\u2019s not as helpful until you\u2019ve actually played around with code and with data to understand how it actually works, how it moves. When people present it in books, it\u2019s all nice and pretty. In real life, it\u2019s really not.</p>\n<p>I think trying a lot of different things is also very important. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever thought that I would be here. I also have no idea where I\u2019ll be in five years. But maybe that\u2019s how I learn, by doing a bit of everything across many different disciplines to try to understand what fits me best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>6\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-heineike-b877062/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Amy Heineike</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Vice President of Technology at PrimerAI, Ex-Director of Mathematics at\u00a0Quid</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cI think perhaps they would need to start by looking at themselves and figuring out what it is they really care about. What is it they want to do? Right now, data science is a bit of a hot topic, and so I think there are a lot of people who think that if they can have the \u201cdata science\u201d label, then magic, happiness, and money will come to them. So I really suggest figuring out what bits of data science you actually care about. That is the first question you should ask yourself. And then you want to figure out how to get good at that. You also want to start thinking about what kinds of jobs are out there that really play to what you are interested in.</p>\n<p>One strategy is to go really deep into one part of what you need to know. We have people on our team who have done PhDs in natural language processing or who got PhDs in physics, where they\u2019ve used a lot of different analytical methods. So you can go really deep into an area and then find people for whom that kind of problem is important or similar problems that you can use the same kind of thinking to solve. So that\u2019s one approach.</p>\n<p>Another approach is to just try stuff out. There are a lot of data sets out there. If you\u2019re in one job and you\u2019re trying to change jobs, try to think whether there\u2019s data you could use in your current role that you could go and get and crunch in interesting ways. Find an excuse to get to try something out and see if that\u2019s really what you want to do. Or just from home there\u2019s open data you can pull. Just poke around and see what you can find and then start playing with that. I think that\u2019s a great way to start. There are a lot of different roles that are going under the name \u201cdata science\u201d right now, and there are also a lot of roles that are probably what you would think of data science but don\u2019t have a label yet because people aren\u2019t necessarily using it. Think about what it is that you really want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>7\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-radinsky-6b68601/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kira Radinsky</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Chief Scientist and Director of Data Science at eBay, Ex-CTO and Co-Founder of SalesPredict</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cFind a problem you\u2019re excited about. For me, every time I started something new, it\u2019s really boring to just study without a having a problem I\u2019m trying to solve. Start reading material and as soon as you can, start working with it and your problem. You\u2019ll start to see problems as you go. This will lead you to other learning resources, whether they are books, papers, or people. So spend time with the problem and people, and you\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>Understand the basics really deeply. Understand some basic data structures and computer science. Understand the basis of the tools you use and understand the math behind them, not just how to use them. Understand the inputs and the outputs and what is actually going on inside, because otherwise you won\u2019t know when to apply it. Also, it depends on the problem you\u2019re tackling. There are many different tools for so many different problems. You\u2019ve got to know what each tool can do and you\u2019ve got to know the problem that you\u2019re doing really well to know which tools and techniques to apply.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><strong>8\u00a0</strong>\u2014\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakeporway/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jake Porway</strong></a><strong>,</strong>\u00a0<em>Founder and Executive Director of\u00a0DataKind</em></h3>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cI think a strong statistical background is a prerequisite, because you need to know what you\u2019re doing, and understand the guts of the model you build. Additionally, my statistics program also taught a lot about ethics, which is something that we think a lot about at DataKind. You always want to think about how your work is going to be applied. You can give anybody an algorithm. You can give someone a model for using stop-and-frisk data, where the police are going to make arrests, but why and to what end? It\u2019s really like building any new technology. You\u2019ve got to think about the risks as well as the benefits and really weigh that because you are responsible for what you create.</p>\n<p>No matter where you come from, as long as you understand the tools that you\u2019re using to draw conclusions, that is the best thing you can do. We are all scientists now, and I\u2019m not just talking about designing products. We are all drawing conclusions about the world we live in. That\u2019s what statistics is \u2014 collecting data to prove a hypothesis or to create a model of the way the world works. If you just trust the results of that model blindly, that\u2019s dangerous because that\u2019s your interpretation of the world, and as flawed as it is, your understanding is how flawed the result is going to be.</p>\n<p>In short, learn statistics and be thoughtful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22945255-data-scientists-at-work\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Data Scientists at Work</strong></a><strong>\u00a0</strong>displays how some of the world\u2019s top data scientists work across a dizzyingly wide variety of industries and applications \u2014 each leveraging her own blend of domain expertise, statistics, and computer science to create tremendous value and impact.</p>\n<p>Data is being generated exponentially and those who can understand that data and extract value from it are needed now more than ever.

He was employed as chamberlain to William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, and when his boss became King William III of England, Scotland, and Ireland in the Glorious Revoultion of 1688, the Briennes went with him to England. As a trusted confidant, Simon was given a plum position as Keeper of the Wardrobe at Kensington Palace in 1689.

Intrigued, Ahrendt tracked down the collection at the <a href=\"http://www.muscom.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum voor Communicatie</a> in The Hague where it had lain undisturbed and unremarked since 1926. She found a trunk waterproofed with sealskin and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/undelivered-letters-17th-century-dutch-society\" target=\"_blank\">filled with 2,600 letters</a> sent from France, Spain and the Spanish Netherlands between 1689 and 1707. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wax-seal-red.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39673\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wax-seal-red-125x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wax-seal-red-125x150.jpg 125w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wax-seal-red-200x238.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wax-seal-red-430x513.jpg 430w\" title=\"Wax seal red. \u00a9Signed, Sealed &amp; Undelivered Team, 2015.

Any letters that could not be delivered because the recipients could not be found, or if found they refused receipt or could not or would not pay the postage due, the couple kept. (At the time the recipient paid postage, not the sender.) Most postmasters destroyed such letters, but the de Briennes hoped someone might someday take delivery and pay the postage so they put them in the trunk as a kind of fingers-crossed savings account. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Papered-seal3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39680\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Papered-seal3-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Papered-seal3-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Papered-seal3-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Papered-seal3-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Papered seal of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. \u00a9Signed, Sealed &amp; Undelivered Team, 2015.

Born in France, he was a servant of Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the younger son of German prince Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and maternal nephew of King Charles I of England. He was arrived in The Hague in 1669 and was appointed Postmaster seven years later. His wife was appointed postmistress in 1686. His new job didn\u2019t stop Simon from working his royal connections. He was employed as chamberlain to William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, and when his boss became King William III of England, Scotland, and Ireland in the Glorious Revoultion of 1688, the Briennes went with him to England. As a trusted confidant, Simon was given a plum position as Keeper of the Wardrobe at Kensington Palace in 1689. Ten years later, he sold the office for \u00a31550 and a cask of the best Burgundy wine. They returned to The Hague shortly thereafter. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Diamond-shaped-folded-letter.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39672\" height=\"140\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Diamond-shaped-folded-letter-150x140.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Diamond-shaped-folded-letter-150x140.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Diamond-shaped-folded-letter-200x187.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Diamond-shaped-folded-letter-430x402.jpg 430w\" title=\"Letter DB-1876.

Out of the 2,600 letters in the trunk, 2,000 are opened and 600 are sealed. They include missives from people from all walks of life \u2014 noblemen, merchants, singers, actors, spies, peasants, Hugenot exiles, women, men \u2014 and are written in French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Latin. Most of the correspondence that has survived from this period was written by the elite. To have such a wide range of society represented in their own voice (many of the letters were written phonetically with little punctuation in the dialect of the writer rather than in the formal, educated hand of the highly literate) is unique.</p>\n<p>One open letter from the collection has been transcribed and translated manages to delicately suggest a pregnancy scandal without actually coming out and saying it. It was sent to a wealthy Jewish merchant in The Hague.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI am writing on behalf of your friend and mine and she realized as soon as she left the opera company in The Hague to go to Paris that she had made a terrible mistake. Now she needs your help to come back to The Hague. You can divine without difficulty the true cause of her despair. I cannot put it into so many words; what I ought to say to you is so excessive. Content yourself with thinking on it, and returning her to life by procuring her return.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Refused-love-letter.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39678\" height=\"142\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Refused-love-letter-150x142.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Refused-love-letter-150x142.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Refused-love-letter-200x190.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Refused-love-letter-430x408.jpg 430w\" title=\"Refused letter.  \u00a9Signed, Sealed &amp; Undelivered Team, 2015.

Scholars who study paper, postal systems, economics, linguistics and seals will find in this collection a unique source of information from the late 17th and early 18th century. It will be an invaluable resource for the nascent study of letterlocking, the practice of folding a letter in complex ways to convert it into its own envelope.</p>\n<p>Ahrendt has already made <a href=\"http://news.yale.edu/2015/11/05/postal-piggybank-17th-century-sheds-light-culture-time\" target=\"_blank\">significant historical discoveries</a> in her own specialty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As a music historian, Ahrendt found the correspondence between musicians especially interesting and says the information these missives contain casts a different light on the development of the musical labor industry: \u201cThis archive is truly a cultural history of musicians. I was surprised to learn that musicians traveled so much during that time period. We have so few witnesses to describe what daily life was like for your average musician, and these letters tell of large networks of these musicians traveling frequently. This is completely different from what we previously believed about the history of musicians.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Accounting-notes-on-locked-letter.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39676\" height=\"95\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Accounting-notes-on-locked-letter-150x95.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Accounting-notes-on-locked-letter-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Accounting-notes-on-locked-letter-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Accounting-notes-on-locked-letter-430x273.jpg 430w\" title=\"Letter DB-0633.

The bundle was then scanned with high contrast TDI CT (Time Delay Integration, computed tomography) and the contents were revealed without damaging the folds and seals.

They have identified a fire hearth (the Tudor equivalent of an oven) and a cold pit (the fridge) and a brew house where the playwright\u2019s staff would have made beer and preserved food by pickling and salting. They also found fragments of dishes and cups. The latest archaeological finds have made it possible to create accurate drawings of what New Place looked like in Shakespeare\u2019s time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-illustration-based-on-latest-archaeology.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39656\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-illustration-based-on-latest-archaeology-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-illustration-based-on-latest-archaeology-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-illustration-based-on-latest-archaeology-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-illustration-based-on-latest-archaeology-430x303.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-illustration-based-on-latest-archaeology.jpg 1191w\" title=\"New Place during Shakespeare's time.

He was a proud native son and benefactor of Stratford-upon-Avon, rebuilding a guild chapel, replacing a rickety wooden bridge with a beautiful <a href=\"http://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1204167\" target=\"_blank\">stone arch bridge</a> and leaving provisions in his will for further improvements to the city along with funds to help support maidens, scholars and apprentice mercers. Even as he held important guild and municipal offices in London, in about 1483 Clopton had a new house built for himself in his hometown on Chapel Street. It was the second largest house in town.</p>\n<p>The property stayed in the Clopton family until the mid-16th century when it passed to the recusant Catholic Underhill family. Shakespeare purchased the house and property including gardens, two barns and an orchard, from William Underhill on May 4th, 1597, for \u00a3120 in silver. It was a grand home, with impressively wide frontage, 20 rooms and 10 fireplaces, but by the time Shakespeare bought it, the house, which had been described by antiquary John Leland sixty years earlier as a \u201cpraty house of bricke and tymbre\u201d was in \u201cgreat ruyne and decay and unrepayred.\u201d Renovations began immediately. Shakespeare\u2019s wife Anne seems to have moved in full-time right away; William split his time between Statford and London for a while before moving permanently into New Place in 1610. There he planted the first mulberry tree in Stratford, according to legend with his own two hands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nashs-House-facade-c.-1600.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39663\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nashs-House-facade-c.-1600-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nashs-House-facade-c.-1600-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nashs-House-facade-c.-1600-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nashs-House-facade-c.-1600-430x321.jpg 430w\" title=\"Nash's House, ca. 1600.

He bequeathed the property to his daughter Susanna Hall who lived there until her death in 1649. It then went to her daughter Elizabeth. Elizabeth died in 1670. After her husband\u2019s Thomas\u2019 death in 1674, New Place was sold to Sir Edward Walker who in turn left it to his daughter, wife of Sir John Clopton. Thus by 1700, New Place once again belonged to the Clopton family. Sir John had it almost entirely rebuilt before 1702 for his son Hugh.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sir-Hugh-Clopton-by-Thomas-Murray-1724.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39661\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sir-Hugh-Clopton-by-Thomas-Murray-1724-122x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sir-Hugh-Clopton-by-Thomas-Murray-1724-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sir-Hugh-Clopton-by-Thomas-Murray-1724-200x244.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sir-Hugh-Clopton-by-Thomas-Murray-1724-430x526.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sir-Hugh-Clopton-by-Thomas-Murray-1724.jpg 771w\" title=\"Sir Hugh Clopton by Thomas Murray, 1724\" width=\"122\"/></a>Sir Hugh Clopton took pride in the association of his family home with William Shakespeare. He opened New Place to visitors and told stories of questionable likelihood about finding epigrams scratched onto the windows by Shakespeare and his daughters (his only son, Hamnet, had died the year before they bought the house). The next owner would not be so genial. </p>\n<p>Reverend Francis Gastrell, a canon of Lichfield Cathedral, bought the property from the Clopton estate in 1753. He had no interest in opening his home to literary pilgrims and was sick to death of people showing up at his house expecting to get a show the way they had in Sir Hugh\u2019s day. In 1756, he chopped down the mulberry tree that was the focus of many a literary pilgrim\u2019s attention thanks to the story that it had been planted by the Bard himself. In 1759, he got into a dispute with the city on whether he should pay the full tax rate or get a reduced rate because he lived part of the time in Lichfield. Vowing New Place would never be assessed again, he razed it to the ground.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-sketch-by-George-Vertue-1737.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39651\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-sketch-by-George-Vertue-1737-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-sketch-by-George-Vertue-1737-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-sketch-by-George-Vertue-1737-200x257.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-Place-sketch-by-George-Vertue-1737-430x552.jpg 430w\" title=\"New Place sketch and description by George Vertue from 1737 visit.

He sketched New Place and took notes describing the property as a two storey, half-timbered building with an attic, five gabled bays and a central gateway facing onto Chapel Street. Scholars now believe the Vertue sketch is not of the home itself, but of a gatehouse with servants\u2019 quarters and a long gallery. There\u2019s also an extant print of a drawing by Samuel Winter of the main house ca. 1759. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sketch-by-Samuel-Winter-showing-New-Place-c.1759.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39649\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sketch-by-Samuel-Winter-showing-New-Place-c.1759-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sketch-by-Samuel-Winter-showing-New-Place-c.1759-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sketch-by-Samuel-Winter-showing-New-Place-c.1759-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sketch-by-Samuel-Winter-showing-New-Place-c.1759-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sketch by Samuel Winter showing New Place c.1759\" width=\"150\"/></a>The New Place property was sold multiple times in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Parts of it were sold piecemeal and became detached from the original property. What had once been the Great Garden became the Royal Shakespearean Theatre in 1829, but it didn\u2019t even survive 50 years. Shakespeare enthusiast J.O. Halliwell launched a fundraising campaign in 1861 to acquire the full grounds of New Place. He cleared some parts of the property of its later construction and excavated the site in 1862 and 1863, finding parts of the original 15th century home and the 18th century rebuild. In 1872 the former Royal Shakespearean Theatre was demolished. The grounds were redesigned as a pleasure garden and in 1884, the entire New Place property was transferred the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Model-of-Shakespeares-New-Place-pic-credit-Stewart-Writtle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39655\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Model-of-Shakespeares-New-Place-pic-credit-Stewart-Writtle-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Model-of-Shakespeares-New-Place-pic-credit-Stewart-Writtle-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Model-of-Shakespeares-New-Place-pic-credit-Stewart-Writtle-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Model-of-Shakespeares-New-Place-pic-credit-Stewart-Writtle-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Model of Shakespeare's New Place.

Instead, they\u2019ve designed an imaginative way to convey the important areas of the structure within the parameters of the garden. Brass lines in the ground will mark the footprint and key areas of the previous structures. Halliwell\u2019s excavations will be of aid in this because he never had them backfilled which has helped archaeologists determine which part of the buildings were in which location and where else to dig to find undisturbed archaeological features. The garden will be re-landscaped with themes evoking Shakespeare. </p>\n<p>The redesign was originally scheduled to be complete in time to commemorate the anniversary of William Shakespeare death in April of 2016, but the archaeological discoveries have pushed back the opening date to the summer.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/I3R1v1sPU64&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Kitchen of Shakespeare\u2019s last home found\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39647\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39647#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-39640\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39640\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Pre-Inca mummy remains found in Lima temple\">Pre-Inca mummy remains found in Lima temple</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, November 28th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ychsma-burial.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-39643\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ychsma-burial-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ychsma-burial-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ychsma-burial-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ychsma-burial-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ychsma burial atop the Great Pyramid, Miraflores, Lima, Peru, ca. 1000-1450 A.D.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The remains of <a href=\"http://perureports.com/2015/11/27/peru-centuries-old-tombs-found-at-lima-archaeological-site/\" target=\"_blank\">four mummies of the pre-Inca Ychsma people</a> have been unearthed in the Huaca Pucllana temple in the Miraflores neighborhood of Lima, Peru. All of the mummies are of adults, three women, one man, buried in a seated posture. They were originally mummy bundles, wrapped in layers of textiles, straw and ropes then covered with mats. Today they are very decomposed, almost entirely skeletonized, with few of their organic grave goods extant. Next to them were found ceramic pots, mate\u2019 drinking vessels and objects related to textile production (needles, yarn, woven fabric and more).</p>\n<p>They were found at the top of the Great Pyramid, an impressive structure made of adobe and clay brick by the Lima culture between 200 and 650 A.D. as a religious and administrative center. Its bookshelf style construction in which bricks were placed side by side like books on a shelf with the outer ones leaning in made it earthquake resistant and when the Wari Empire took over the area in around 650 A.D., <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27633\" target=\"_blank\">they continued to use the pyramid</a>, burying their important dignitaries within its walls. Now it appears the Ychsma did the same.</p>\n<p>Earlier evidence of Ychsma activity at the Great Pyramid was discovered in 1967 when offerings of anthropomorphic figurines were found at the foot of the western slop of the pyramid. A follow-up excavation revealed that the spot was used by the Ychsma to dry their crops. As farmers and weavers, they would leave offerings of their most significant products: packets of cotton and food jars filled with beans and maize. The discovery of burials at the top of the pyramid suggests stronger presence of the Ychsma in the area that would become Miraflores.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOur hypothesis is that they were involved in politics, religion or of high status,\u201d said archaeologist Mirella Ganoza. \u201cThis site was not chosen at random.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Isabel Flores, director of the Museum of Site of Huaca Pucllana, notes that we may discover more about the remains and burial practices of the Ychsma when the remains are analyzed. The exact date of the burials will also hopefully be revealed by radiocarbon dating. The only date range we have now is 1000 to 1450 A.D., the known range of Ychsma presence in the area.</p>\n<p>Before the city of Lima was founded by conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1535, it was a river valley populated by the Ychsma people who were one of two cultures who came to dominate central coastal Peru after the collapse of the Wari Empire around 1000 A.D. The Ychsma developed the R\u00edmac and Lur\u00edn river valleys, modifying old Wari temples and building new ones of their own. When the area was conquered by the Inca under Emperor T\u00fapac Inca Yupanqui in 1470, the Ychsma were absorbed into the Inca Empire and ceased to exist as a separate political and cultural group.</p>\n<p><script src=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?embedCode=xrZDc1eTotUUsG9FhKJkKwxiQXEbwCQ2&amp;width=430&amp;height=242&amp;deepLinkEmbedCode=xrZDc1eTotUUsG9FhKJkKwxiQXEbwCQ2&amp;video_pcode=RvbGU6Z74XE_a3bj4QwRGByhq9h2&amp;playerBrandingId=ZTIxYmJjZDM2NWYzZDViZGRiOWJjYzc5&amp;thruParam_tmgui[relatedVideo]=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.api.ooyala.com%2Fv2%2Fassets%3Fwhere%3Dembed_code%2Bin%2B%2528%2527JvZ3l0dzrvyZZWmiKAgv-MnKUaO4DoMm%2527%252C%2527JpNTcwdjrnKEfI5EqIFFXVKF5kVCschI%2527%252C%2527Z4ZXJodTrFk1NnE4GCdjEYWwvx2ryzQg%2527%2529%26api_key%3DRvbGU6Z74XE_a3bj4QwRGByhq9h2.WFFAb%26expires%3D1640995199%26signature%3DDgrB0n%252FvvR1GNcpWOZ%252BVbop%252BxIA4tiViYSW1AhYJo6U\"></script></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Pre-Inca mummy remains found in Lima temple\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39640\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39640#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-39632\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39632\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Frescoes torn from Paestum tomb walls found\">Frescoes torn from Paestum tomb walls found</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, November 27th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Recovered-frescoes.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-39633\" height=\"136\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Recovered-frescoes-200x136.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Recovered-frescoes-200x136.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Recovered-frescoes-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Recovered-frescoes-430x293.jpg 430w\" title=\"Carabinieri stand in front of frescoed slabs.

The frescoes date to around the 4th century B.C. and depict a warrior returning triumphant from battle on his horse followed by attendants, one of them driving a mule laden with spoils, and being greeted by the lady of the household and two of her servants. They originally adorned the tomb of a wealthy man of the indigenous southern Italian tribe of the Lucanians before looters got to them. Unfortunately, since the frescoes were brutally removed and smuggled into the netherworld of the antiquities trade, we don\u2019t know which tomb they came from or anything about its contents that might give us more information about the tomb\u2019s owner.</p>\n<p>The slabs were discovered last May, 20 years after the seminal investigation that first alerted the art squad to their theft. <a href=\"http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/operation-geryon/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Operation Geryon</em></a> was launched by the Carabinieri in 1995 after the theft of eight Greek vases from a Castle of Melfi in south central Italy. A fatal accident ultimately broke the case, when dealer Pasquale Camera crashed his car and died. Highway police found Polaroids of what appeared to be freshly looted artifacts in Camera\u2019s car. A subsequent search of his house which turned up hundreds more pictures and a paper trail a mile long which named names, leading to 70 more raids and the arrest of close to 20 people involved in the looted antiquities trade. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dario-Franceschini-in-front-of-frescoed-slabs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-39634\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dario-Franceschini-in-front-of-frescoed-slabs-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dario-Franceschini-in-front-of-frescoed-slabs-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dario-Franceschini-in-front-of-frescoed-slabs-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dario-Franceschini-in-front-of-frescoed-slabs-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Culture Minister Dario Franceschini stands in front of frescoed stone slabs that had been stolen from a tomb in the ancient city of Paestum.

The collector who was in illegal possession of them claimed he had no idea they were stolen. We\u2019re to believe he saw five Lucanian fresco panels, each of them cracked and damaged in the same way across the middle, and didn\u2019t realize those were the characteristic wounds left by smugglers when they broken the frescoes in half for easier illegal export.</p>\n<p>The recovered paintings will be on display at the Historic Museum of the Carabinieri in Rome before moving to their permanent home at the Paestum Archaeological Museum on January 10th.</p>\n<p>Paestum was a Greek colony founded around 600 B.C. 65 miles south of Naples on the southwestern coast of Italy. They called it Poseidonia after Poseidon, god of the sea. The Lucanians conquered the city in the late 5th century B.C. and renamed it Paistos. The name was Latinized to Paestum when the Romans took control in 273 B.C. after their final defeat of King Pyrrhus of Epirus whom the Lucanians had sided with against Rome.</p>\n<p>The Lucanians left behind hundreds of richly decorated tombs in necropoli around Paestum.

In its heyday during the Roman imperial era, the road linked the Commercial Agora with the State Agora and ran through the valley between the two hills that framed the city. It was paved with marble slabs and decorative mosaics, lined with colonnades, funerary monuments to prominent citizens, public fountains, shops, a brothel and overlooked by luxury homes on the slopes.

The main focus of public, social and economic life in the city moved from the Agorae of old to the streets and the businesses that lined them. The tavern served local food and wines as well as beverages from further afield. The amphorae were found to contain local grape varieties and ones from Gaza and Cilicia, which means that trade was still active enough and there was enough money in the citizens\u2019 hands to make it worthwhile for the pub to stock premium brands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cup-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39621\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cup-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cup-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cup-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cup-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cup-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Perfectly intact drinking cup found in Byzantine tavern. \u00a9 \u00d6AI 2015 Niki Gail\" width=\"150\"/></a>The tavern\u2019s fate was indicated by coins found in a highly destructive fire layer. A greater than average number of large denomination coins were discovered in the tavern, left behind in a fire so severe that people didn\u2019t even bother trying to recover valuable cash in an era when monetary circulation dropped precipitously to a tenth of its previous quantity and coin was scarce. This was during the reign of Emperor Heraclius (610-641 A.D.), who for years was engaged in fighting off a Persian invasion. The Persians sacked Ephesus in 616, two years after an earthquake had brought down a significant portion of the city. Then the forces of the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I sacked the city again in 654-5. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-plate-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39619\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-plate-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-plate-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-plate-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-plate-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-plate-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Byzantine tavern plate \u00a9 \u00d6AI 2015 Niki Gail\" width=\"150\"/></a>Whether it was the Persians or Arabs or fires in the wake of earthquake that caused the destruction of the tavern, it was never rebuilt. It wasn\u2019t even pillaged for supplies. It was just closed and left to decay as were the other shops along the street. The street itself was swept and kept clear of debris for centuries after that, probably because it was a useful connection to the port before it silted up irredeemably and a straight shot for Christian pilgrims to use when visiting shrines.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cups-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39620\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cups-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cups-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cups-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cups-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Byzantine-tavern-drinking-cups-\u00a9-\u00d6AI-2015-Niki-Gail.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Another drinking cup found in tavern. \u00a9 \u00d6AI 2015 Niki Gail\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Austrian Archeological Institute assumes that duty now, which is how it found the tavern. The OAI has a long, strong connection to the city of Ephesus. In fact, the organization was founded specifically to excavate the ancient city. German archaeologist Otto Benndorf started excavating Ephesus in 1895, financed by a large donation by Austrian businessman Karl Mautner Ritter von Markhof. Benndorf founded the Austrian Archaeological Institute in 1898, with the excavation of Ephesus as its first brief. The Institute had been digging and conserving the site ever since, pausing only during both world wars.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"7th century tavern with plates still on shelf found in Ephesus\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39618\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39618#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-39603\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39603\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Staedtler erasers help solve mystery of ultra-thin 13th c. parchment\">Staedtler erasers help solve mystery of ultra-thin 13th c. parchment</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, November 25th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-a-pocket-bible-just-over-5-inches-high-fol.-3v-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39610\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-a-pocket-bible-just-over-5-inches-high-fol.-3v--106x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-a-pocket-bible-just-over-5-inches-high-fol.-3v--106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-a-pocket-bible-just-over-5-inches-high-fol.-3v--200x281.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-a-pocket-bible-just-over-5-inches-high-fol.-3v--430x604.jpg 430w\" title=\"UPenn Ms. Codex 1065, a pocket bible just over five inches high, folio 3v.

Both groups needed bibles that were lightweight and easy to transport, a far cry from the large, thick-paged, multi-volume bibles common in scriptoria, libraries, churches and learning institutions. Between around 1220 and 1300, at least 20,000 and possibly as many as 30,000 portable bibles were produced, most of them in Paris, but also elsewhere in France, plus England, Italy and Spain. The university centers of Paris, Bologna and Oxford were the main production centers.</p>\n<p>The first pocket bibles were pandects (single-volume bibles) and were consistently organized which made them easy to scan for a particular passage, a handy tool for the student and itinerant preacher. The script was tiny, with each letter a mere two millimeters high, and of course written painstakingly by hand. Each page was made of a tissue-thin parchment known as uterine vellum, the key to the books\u2019 portability. Without pages a fraction of a millimeter thick, the pocket bibles of the 13th century could not have existed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-137V-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39609\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-137V--106x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-137V--106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-137V--200x281.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UPenn-Ms.-Codex-1065-137V--430x604.jpg 430w\" title=\"UPenn Ms. Codex 1065, folio 137V.

Approximately 2,000 pocket bibles still exist today, the majority of them, about 54%, of French manufacture. </p>\n<p>Codicologists, people who study the physical object of the book, have long debated how uterine vellum was made. Some medieval and early modern sources refer to the parchment as <em>abortivum</em> or <em>charta non nata</em> (meaning \u201cunborn sheet\u201d), suggesting that it was made from the skin of miscarried or aborted fetal calves. The sheer numbers of aborted livestock fetuses necessary to produce enough parchment for thousands of pocket Bibles and other manuscripts would have materially damaged the health of any herd, however, so some scholars have proffered alternative animal sources for the parchment, like rabbits or squirrels which unlike cows already have very thin skins. Others theorized that the thicker skins of cows or sheep could have been split to produce the ultra-thin parchment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2015/research/pocket-bible-parchment/\" target=\"_blank\">A study led by University of York bioarchaeologists</a> sought to unlock the mystery of uterine vellum, to discover whether it was made using animals with exceptionally fine skin or the result of a specialized craft that worked any skins into tissue-thin sheets. The research team studied samples of uterine vellum drawn from 72 pocket Bibles and seven nonpocket Bibles. The sampled parchment ranged in thickness from .03 to .28 mm. The delicate, more than paper-thin pages were sampled using one of the greatest school supplies of all time: the <a href=\"http://www.staedtler.us/en/products/pencils-accessories/erasers/mars-plastic-526-50-eraser-in-premium-quality/\" target=\"_blank\">Staedtler Mars Plastic</a> eraser. Remember how the bright white eraser would make little tubular crumbs greyed with pencil graphite that you had to blow or brush off your paper? Those characteristic crumbs were the means by which the samples could be taken without damaging the fragile parchment. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Non-invasive-sampling-extracting-protein-from-parchment-using-eraser-crumbs.-Reproduced-by-courtesy-of-The-John-Rylands-Library-University-of-Manchester..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-39605\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Non-invasive-sampling-extracting-protein-from-parchment-using-eraser-crumbs.-Reproduced-by-courtesy-of-The-John-Rylands-Library-University-of-Manchester.-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Non-invasive-sampling-extracting-protein-from-parchment-using-eraser-crumbs.-Reproduced-by-courtesy-of-The-John-Rylands-Library-University-of-Manchester.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Non-invasive-sampling-extracting-protein-from-parchment-using-eraser-crumbs.-Reproduced-by-courtesy-of-The-John-Rylands-Library-University-of-Manchester.-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Non-invasive-sampling-extracting-protein-from-parchment-using-eraser-crumbs.-Reproduced-by-courtesy-of-The-John-Rylands-Library-University-of-Manchester.-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Non-invasive sampling extracting protein from parchment using eraser crumbs. Reproduced by courtesy of The John Rylands Library, University of Manchester.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Participating archives and libraries were sent a kit with erasers, acid-free paper, nitrile gloves and 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Staffers donned gloves and collected the sample by erasing in one direction on an area of the page that had no writing, holes, tears or any other indication of weakness in the structure. The crumbs were caught on a folded page of acid-free paper and tipped into the tubes which were sealed and sent to the University of York laboratory.</p>\n<p>The gentle unidirectional rubbing of the eraser on the pages generated an electrostatic charge that extracted protein from the parchment surface. Those protein samples were then studied using zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) peptide mass fingerprinting and hair follicle pattern analysis, technologies that can determine which species of animals were used to make the parchment and their age at slaughter. The study found that none of the parchment was made from the skin of fetal or neonate animals. The youngest were eight week old calves and adult sheep and goats were also used. Of the 220 folios from 72 pocket bibles sampled, 68% were calfskin, 26% were goat, and 6% were sheep. Most of them were consistent within one bible, but five bibles were found to have parchment from more than one species. Researchers think that those five may be composite bibles rather than a single producer using skins from multiple animals to create one bible.</p>\n<p>So since exotic animal hides weren\u2019t behind the production of this practically see-through parchment, it must have been <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/medieval-europes-first-large-scale-publishing-industry-revealed-a6745981.html\" target=\"_blank\">a specialized craft</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In order to make goat, sheep and eight week old calf parchment look as fine as if it had all come from new-born calves, the medieval artisans had to immerse the skins in alkali-rich liquefied lime so as to get rid of the fats in those skins by transforming the lipids into a form of detergent. That natural soap not only helped thin the skins but also helped whiten them by dissolving all the ingrained grime and stains.</p>\n<p>The alkali in the lime also served to remove the thousands of tiny hairs in the skin \u2013 by weakening the chemical bonds which hold protein molecules together. However, too much exposure to lime would have also turned the skins\u2019 collagen content into gelatine \u2013 thus irreversibly swelling and damaging the product. The medieval craftsmen seem to have discovered the precise time required to thin and whiten the skins in the lime, while not destroying them.</p>\n<p>As well as immersing the skins in lime, the artisans also stretched them on wooden frames, scraped them with a special bladed tool \u2013 then spent many hours rubbing them with volcanic pumice stone to further thin and smooth them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The study has been published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em> and can be <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/18/1512264112.full.pdf?sid=30f8eb8c-43d6-4fb3-94fb-348373827a62\" target=\"_blank\">read in its entirety here (pdf)</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Staedtler erasers help solve mystery of ultra-thin 13th c. parchment\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39603\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39603#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-39592\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39592\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Pendant found in Bulgaria is among oldest known gold jewelry\">Pendant found in Bulgaria is among oldest known gold jewelry</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, November 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varna-pendant.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39593\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varna-pendant-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varna-pendant-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varna-pendant-200x142.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Varna-pendant-430x305.jpg 430w\" title=\"Tiny gold pendant unearthed at Bronze Age Solnitsata site in Bulgaria.

Salt processing at the site began in the Late Neolithic (about 5500 B.C.) when brine from salt water springs was boiled in small, thin-walled ceramic vases and baked into blocks in large domed kilns. The production of salt increased markedly in the Middle Chalcolithic (4700-4500 B.C.) through the Late Chalcolithic (4500-4200 B.C.) when the method of extraction shifted to boiling brine in large ceramic vases placed inside deep, open-air pits up to 10 meters (33 feet) wide. This allowed salt to be produced on an industrial scale and salt blocks were traded locally and throughout the Balkans on pack animals or possibly sleds. There was no wheel yet, so no carts were involved.</p>\n<p>The settlement, which archaeologists estimate had a population of 350 people at its peak, was fortified with wood palisades and earthworks in the Late Neolithic and then strengthened during the Chalcolithic with stone walls whose bases were as much as 13 feet thick. By then the Solnitsata salt complex was producing an eye-watering 4,000 to 5,000 kilos (8,800 to 11,000 pounds) of dry salt at a time (the Neolithic kilns produced about 25 kilos or 55 pounds of salt in one load). At a time when salt was highly valued as the only means of food preservation, the small Solnitsata settlement might as well have been a mint. That\u2019s why they needed such thick walls, to Fort Knoxify the place.</p>\n<p>Given that their neighbors in Varna were mining copper and gold at the time, you might expect the salt-based wealth of Solnitsata to result in burials with similar valuables, but the little pendant is the first gold excavated at the site and it wasn\u2019t a grave good. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Excavation-of-Solnitsata-fortress.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39597\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Excavation-of-Solnitsata-fortress-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Excavation-of-Solnitsata-fortress-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Excavation-of-Solnitsata-fortress-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Excavation-of-Solnitsata-fortress-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Excavation of Solnitsata fortress.

The exploration of the masonry fortifications is of particular interest as Solnitsata\u2019s defensive wall is the oldest stone fortress in the world. Professor Nikolov explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe [fortress] wall that we are unearthing right now shows that the fortress had a shape of a circle with a diameter of about 90 meters. It is interesting that back then the people had valuable knowledge about military affairs. In order to ensure a better defense, the wall was not made round but its sections follow straight lines. That\u2019s because the round shape would have been harder to defend.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Pendant found in Bulgaria is among oldest known gold jewelry\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39592\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39592#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-39573\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39573\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Historical archive found in Russian birds nests\">Historical archive found in Russian birds nests</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, November 23rd, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cathedral-of-the-Assumption-of-the-Blessed-Virgin-attic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39580\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cathedral-of-the-Assumption-of-the-Blessed-Virgin-attic-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cathedral-of-the-Assumption-of-the-Blessed-Virgin-attic-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cathedral-of-the-Assumption-of-the-Blessed-Virgin-attic-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cathedral-of-the-Assumption-of-the-Blessed-Virgin-attic-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cathedral-of-the-Assumption-of-the-Blessed-Virgin-attic.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Cathedral of the Assumption's attic.

To clear the space before construction, archaeologists surveyed the attic which had a thick layer of debris deposited by the swifts and jackdaws that have been nesting under the roof for centuries. The debris is composed of soil, organic litter, branches and layer upon layer of soft and warm paper fragments collected by the birds to line their nests. Among the fragments are pieces of personal letters, scores of them written in an aristocratic hand that mention Russian foreign minister Count Karl Nesselrode, pieces of printed books, pre-revolutionary official documents drawn up by the military and police, a birth certificate, a college diploma, student notebooks with multiplication tables and Easter hymns. The oldest piece is thought to date to the 1830s when the church roof was last replaced.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calendar-page-Dec-19-1917.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39576\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calendar-page-Dec-19-1917-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calendar-page-Dec-19-1917-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calendar-page-Dec-19-1917-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calendar-page-Dec-19-1917-430x647.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calendar-page-Dec-19-1917.jpg 680w\" title=\"Calendar page, December 6th, 1917.

It\u2019s a calendar page from December 6th, 1917, Tsar Nicholas II\u2019s name day, that has a handwritten note on the back quoting a verse by poet Yakov Polonsky about taking comfort in the loss of hope and happiness which in hindsight seems a little premonitory. Nicholas and his family were still alive at the time, but imprisoned in a mansion in Tobolsk. The scrap is a keyhole into the transition of the Old Style Russian dating to the New Style. Russia had used the Julian calendar for centuries, but the Soviets finally switched the country over to the Gregorian system on January 1st, 1918. Both dating systems appear on this calendar page scrap. The big red six is the Julian date, while underneath it in French is the Gregorian date, December 19th, 1917.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1933-ration-card.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39581\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1933-ration-card-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1933-ration-card-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1933-ration-card-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1933-ration-card-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1933-ration-card.jpg 1280w\" title=\"1933 ration card.

Builder Robert Basta purchased the southern Pennsylvania home cheap at auction because it needed a lot of work. He planned to renovate it for resale, something he\u2019s done many times before. While he was away on business, his son Dylan wanted to earn a little extra money while he was home from college, so Robert had him take on a bear of a job \u2014 tearing up the lino in a small upstairs room. Robert had seen a newspaper from 1946 peeking out through the broken flooring; he told Dylan to keep it in case it was interesting. </p>\n<p>The newspaper preserved, Dylan and his brother Bob went on to find a poster of <em>Tarzan the Ape Man</em>, the 1932 movie starring five-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan and Maureen O\u2019Sullivan as Jane. They texted a photo of the poster to Robert. By the time he got back home and the linoleum was all gone, Bob and Dylan had found 16 more movie posters, all in excellent condition. There were other newspapers under the lino too. It seems a previous owner of the house, possibly artist MSW Brungart who is known to have worked for the local movie theater, used paper he had lying around to protect the floorboards before covering them with linoleum.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Any-Old-Port-1932.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39543\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Any-Old-Port-1932-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Any-Old-Port-1932-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Any-Old-Port-1932-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Any-Old-Port-1932-430x645.jpg 430w\" title='\"Any Old Port,\" 1932.

None of the posters were for films they recognized, so they figured they were of small value. A little Googling soon illuminated them to the fact that they had stumbled on a stash that included some of the rarest posters highly desirable to collectors. </p>\n<p>They\u2019re all one sheets from the pre-Code era, a woefully brief period between 1929 and 1934 when studios largely ignored the censorship rules of the Motion Picture Production Code because the Great Depression had hit them like a freight train and sex, nudity and violence sold then just like they sell now. The party came to an abrupt end when the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America began enforcing the code with the iron fist of committed fanatic and equally committed hypocrite Joseph Breen. One of his henchmen Val Lewton explained Breen\u2019s do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do philosophy to producer David O. Selznick:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cMr. Breen goes to the bathroom every morning. He does not deny that he does so or that there is such a place as the bathroom, but he feels that neither his actions nor the bathroom are fit subjects for screen entertainment. This is the essence of the Hays\u2019 office attitude towards prostitution, at least as Joe told it to me in somewhat cruder language.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Congorilla-one-sheet-1932.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-39544\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Congorilla-one-sheet-1932-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Congorilla-one-sheet-1932-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Congorilla-one-sheet-1932-200x297.jpg 200w\" title='\"Congorilla,\" 1932.

The studios caved and for the next 20 years the sex and violence was hidden in oblique dialogue, those weird face-mashing close-mouthed kisses and implied off-screen.</p>\n<p>I really, really love pre-Code movies, but I wouldn\u2019t have seen any of them were it not for Turner Classic Movies. Unlike other classic movies, the pre-Codes never aired on TV until TCM revived interest in them in the 1990s. This is why the Basta family didn\u2019t recognize any of the films on the posters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sporting-Blood-1931.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-39541\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sporting-Blood-1931-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sporting-Blood-1931-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sporting-Blood-1931-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sporting-Blood-1931-430x644.jpg 430w\" title='\"Sporting Blood,\" 1931.

It\u2019s been more than two years since I posted it, and I still regularly rewatch the video. It\u2019s just so, so good. A quick refresher for those of you not as obsessed as I or for anyone who may have missed it the first time:</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6W2ZMpsxhg\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>The only bad thing about that sublime video is that it\u2019s too short. I said at the time that I wished there were a director\u2019s cut so we could see more of the story as it unfolds. Well, there isn\u2019t a director\u2019s cut, but there\u2019s a making of video! It was uploaded a week after the first one and since I watched the embed on the blog entry rather than going to the YouTube channel, despite my repeated viewings I didn\u2019t realize the second one was there. I\u2019m making up for it now, though. I\u2019ve already watched it three times. I love the curator puttering around like a kid at Christmas fixing people\u2019s costumes and props.

In the painting van Ruytenburch\u2019s shortness is very noticeable, and since he was Banninck Cocq\u2019s lieutenant, their comparative height was a meaningful distinction that communicated their difference in status. The curator sniffed about the purple outfit one of the guards was wearing as inaccurate. Surely he had something to say about the choice to make van Ruytenburch so tall. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-38624\" height=\"349\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum-430x349.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum-430x349.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum-150x122.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum-200x162.jpg 200w\" title='\"The Night Watch\" by Rembrandt van Rijn, 1642.

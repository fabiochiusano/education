This one is a special birthday even under a numerical system without a zero because if Caligula really had been the immortal deity he hallucinated himself to be, he\u2019d have turned MM years old today.</p>\n<p>Gaius was born in Anzio to military hero Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus and Vipsania Agrippina, Caesar Augustus\u2019 grand-daughter. Gaius was just two years old when the family moved with Germanicus when he was appointed commander of the army in Germany. His father dressed little Gaius in a miniature army outfit, including child-sized versions of <em>caligae</em>, the hobnailed sandal boots worn by common soldiers. That\u2019s how he got his nickname, Caligula, meaning little caliga. He became a much-beloved mascot. <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html\" target=\"_blank\">Suetonius</a> says the army loved him so much that his mere presence stopped a mutiny after the death of Augustus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Roman caliga, Munich Archaeological Museum\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19369\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum.jpg 760w\" title=\"Roman caliga, Munich Archaeological Museum\" width=\"150\"/></a>When he was around six years old, Little Boot and his family were dispatched to Asia where Germanicus made Roman provinces out of Cappadocia and Commagene and was poisoned in Antioch probably by Piso, the governor of Syria. Emperor Tiberius was thought to have ordered the murder of his nephew and adoptive son. Gaius lived with his mother until Tiberius had her exiled in 29 A.D., then he moved in with his redoubtable grandmother Livia. She died that same year, so he moved in with his other grandmother Antonia, daughter of Augustus\u2019 sister Octavia and Mark Anthony.</p>\n<p>By 31 A.D., Tiberius had exiled/killed everyone in his family except for himself and his sisters. They were theoretically free, but in reality under constant guard and in constant danger of falling afoul of the emperor and suffering the same fate as their brothers, mother and father. Tiberius brought Caligula to live with him in his villa of debauchery in Capri, and Little Boot made himself an able collaborator. His ability to ingratiate himself with the emperor saved his life, although it may have severely twisted his morals at the same time. Suetonius seems to think he was a bad seed all along.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Villa Jovis, Tiberius' largest palace on Capri\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19379\" height=\"93\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius-150x93.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius-150x93.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius-430x268.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius.jpg 800w\" title=\"Villa Jovis, Tiberius' largest palace on Capri\" width=\"150\"/></a>Yet even at that time he could not control his natural cruelty and viciousness, but he was a most eager witness of the tortures and executions of those who suffered punishment, revelling at night in gluttony and adultery, disguised in a wig and a long robe, passionately devoted besides to the theatrical arts of dancing and singing, in which Tiberius very willingly indulged him, in the hope that through these his savage nature might be softened.

By 39 A.D., the treasury was broke and Caligula had to resort to increasingly desperate means of fundraising, from levying new taxes to auctioning off the lives of gladiators to starting a brothel staffed by senators\u2019 wives and daughters to executing rich men for treason and confiscating their wealth. The last two years of his reign were characterized by increasing insanity, sadism and perversion. Of course that makes for the best reading, which is why you should definitely not quit halfway through Suetonius\u2019 <em>Life of Caligula</em>.

Chaerea struck first, then the others took their turns, but still he lived. It took dozens of blows to kill him. Once he was dead, the guards killed his wife and their daughter.</p>\n<p>After his death, all the statues of Caligula (and there were lots of them because at one point Caligula had insisted that every statue be of him, going so far as to replace the heads of ancient statues of gods and heroes with portraits of him) were destroyed. The few statues that have been found of him are often in pieces.</p>\n<p>This is how Suetonius describes him:</p>\n<blockquote><p>He was very tall and extremely pale, with an unshapely body, but very thin neck and legs. His eyes and temples were hollow, his forehead broad and grim, his hair thin and entirely gone on the top of his head, though his body was hairy.

While his face was naturally forbidding and ugly, he purposely made it even more savage, practising all kinds of terrible and fearsome expressions before a mirror.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He didn\u2019t seem to have practiced them before a sculptor. The heads of Caligula that have been found are rather mild and sweet-faced, as befits a man who died six months before his 30th birthday. One of the best preserved ones is in the <a href=\"http://www.glyptoteket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek</a> in Copenhagen, Denmark.

This one is a special birthday even under a numerical system without a zero because if Caligula really had been the immortal deity he hallucinated himself to be, he\u2019d have turned MM years old today.</p>\n<p>Gaius was born in Anzio to military hero Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus and Vipsania Agrippina, Caesar Augustus\u2019 grand-daughter. Gaius was just two years old when the family moved with Germanicus when he was appointed commander of the army in Germany. His father dressed little Gaius in a miniature army outfit, including child-sized versions of <em>caligae</em>, the hobnailed sandal boots worn by common soldiers. That\u2019s how he got his nickname, Caligula, meaning little caliga. He became a much-beloved mascot. <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html\" target=\"_blank\">Suetonius</a> says the army loved him so much that his mere presence stopped a mutiny after the death of Augustus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Roman caliga, Munich Archaeological Museum\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19369\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/caliga-Munich-Archaeological-Museum.jpg 760w\" title=\"Roman caliga, Munich Archaeological Museum\" width=\"150\"/></a>When he was around six years old, Little Boot and his family were dispatched to Asia where Germanicus made Roman provinces out of Cappadocia and Commagene and was poisoned in Antioch probably by Piso, the governor of Syria. Emperor Tiberius was thought to have ordered the murder of his nephew and adoptive son. Gaius lived with his mother until Tiberius had her exiled in 29 A.D., then he moved in with his redoubtable grandmother Livia. She died that same year, so he moved in with his other grandmother Antonia, daughter of Augustus\u2019 sister Octavia and Mark Anthony.</p>\n<p>By 31 A.D., Tiberius had exiled/killed everyone in his family except for himself and his sisters. They were theoretically free, but in reality under constant guard and in constant danger of falling afoul of the emperor and suffering the same fate as their brothers, mother and father. Tiberius brought Caligula to live with him in his villa of debauchery in Capri, and Little Boot made himself an able collaborator. His ability to ingratiate himself with the emperor saved his life, although it may have severely twisted his morals at the same time. Suetonius seems to think he was a bad seed all along.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Villa Jovis, Tiberius' largest palace on Capri\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19379\" height=\"93\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius-150x93.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius-150x93.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius-430x268.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Villa-Jovis-Tiberius.jpg 800w\" title=\"Villa Jovis, Tiberius' largest palace on Capri\" width=\"150\"/></a>Yet even at that time he could not control his natural cruelty and viciousness, but he was a most eager witness of the tortures and executions of those who suffered punishment, revelling at night in gluttony and adultery, disguised in a wig and a long robe, passionately devoted besides to the theatrical arts of dancing and singing, in which Tiberius very willingly indulged him, in the hope that through these his savage nature might be softened. This last was so clearly evident to the shrewd old man, that he used to say now and then that to allow Gaius to live would prove the ruin of himself and of all men, and that he was rearing a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>(Phaeton was the son of the sun god Helios and Clymene who asked to be allowed to drive his father\u2019s chariot for a day to prove his paternity. He was horrible at it, alternately freezing and burning the earth so badly that he turned half of Africa into a desert. Zeus had to kill him with a thunderbolt to prevent him from burning the globe to a cinder.)</p>\n<p>When Tiberius died in 37 A.D., Caligula took the throne. Tiberius was old and sick, but Caligula might have had a hand in his final disposition. He is said to have poisoned the old man first, and then smothered him when he wasn\u2019t quite dead enough to give up the imperial ring.</p>\n<p>Murderous or not, there was an auspicious beginning to his reign. The first few months were pure honeymoon. The army still loved him as Little Boot, son of the great general Germanicus, and everyone else was just so thrilled to be rid of the blood-thirsty, treason-happy degenerate Tiberius that they gloried in the dawn of a new day. He recalled the unjustly banished, stopped the censorship of certain authors, allowed magistrates to take independent action, called new elections and restored the vote, threw lavish games, cut taxes and finished public works that stingy Tiberius had defunded.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Caligula-sisters.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21925\" height=\"73\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Caligula-sisters-150x73.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Caligula-sisters-150x73.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Caligula-sisters-200x98.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Caligula-sisters-430x211.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Caligula-sisters.jpg 745w\" title=\"Sestertius of Caligula (obverse) and his sisters as goddesses (reverse), ca. 37-8 A.D.\" width=\"150\"/></a>All this largesse was costly. By 39 A.D., the treasury was broke and Caligula had to resort to increasingly desperate means of fundraising, from levying new taxes to auctioning off the lives of gladiators to starting a brothel staffed by senators\u2019 wives and daughters to executing rich men for treason and confiscating their wealth. The last two years of his reign were characterized by increasing insanity, sadism and perversion. Of course that makes for the best reading, which is why you should definitely not quit halfway through Suetonius\u2019 <em>Life of Caligula</em>. He even gives you the perfect starting point. <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#ref34\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 22 begins</a>: \u201cSo much for Caligula as emperor; we must now tell of his career as a monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>The stories of brutal murders, incest, going to war against the sea, declaring himself a god greater than all the deities in the pantheon, declaring his sisters goddesses first and then eventually killing them all, planning to make his horse Incitatus a senator and ever so much more crazy are Caligula\u2019s primary legacy. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074006/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>I, Claudius</em></a> draws liberally on Suetonius as does the hilariously atrocious quasi-porn movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080491/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Caligula</em></a>, which started off as a legitimate film with a script by Gore Vidal starring Malcolm McDowell as Caligula and Helen Mirren as his favorite wife Caesonia, but ended up as a Bob Guccione Penthouse special.</p>\n<p>The Senate was a favorite target of Caligula\u2019s and over the years several senators hatched conspiracies to assassinate him. They all failed. It was officers in the Praetorian Guard, the emperor\u2019s bodyguards, who finally did the deed in 41 A.D., apparently instigated by one too many gay jokes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When they had decided to attempt his life at the exhibition of the Palatine games, as he went out at noon, Cassius Chaerea, tribune of a cohort of the praetorian guard, claimed for himself the principal part; for Gaius used to taunt him, a man already well on in years, with voluptuousness and effeminacy by every form of insult. When he asked for the watchword Gaius would give him \u201cPriapus\u201d or \u201cVenus,\u201d and when Chaerea had occasion to thank him for anything, he would hold out his hand to kiss, forming and moving it in an obscene fashion. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cryptoporticus-where-Caligula-was-assassinated.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Cryptoporticus (underground passage) where Caligula may have been assassinated\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19381\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cryptoporticus-where-Caligula-was-assassinated-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cryptoporticus-where-Caligula-was-assassinated-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cryptoporticus-where-Caligula-was-assassinated-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cryptoporticus-where-Caligula-was-assassinated-430x283.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cryptoporticus-where-Caligula-was-assassinated.jpg 694w\" title=\"Cryptoporticus (underground passage) where Caligula may have been assassinated\" width=\"150\"/></a>Some senators were also in on the plot. On January 24th, 41 A.D., Cassius Chaerea and some other guards approached Caligula in a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/1081\" target=\"_blank\">passageway under his palace</a> on the Palatine and stabbed him. Chaerea struck first, then the others took their turns, but still he lived. It took dozens of blows to kill him. Once he was dead, the guards killed his wife and their daughter.</p>\n<p>After his death, all the statues of Caligula (and there were lots of them because at one point Caligula had insisted that every statue be of him, going so far as to replace the heads of ancient statues of gods and heroes with portraits of him) were destroyed. The few statues that have been found of him are often in pieces.</p>\n<p>This is how Suetonius describes him:</p>\n<blockquote><p>He was very tall and extremely pale, with an unshapely body, but very thin neck and legs. His eyes and temples were hollow, his forehead broad and grim, his hair thin and entirely gone on the top of his head, though his body was hairy. Because of this to look upon him from a higher place as he passed by, or for any reason whatever to mention a goat, was treated as a capital offence. While his face was naturally forbidding and ugly, he purposely made it even more savage, practising all kinds of terrible and fearsome expressions before a mirror.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He didn\u2019t seem to have practiced them before a sculptor. The heads of Caligula that have been found are rather mild and sweet-faced, as befits a man who died six months before his 30th birthday. One of the best preserved ones is in the <a href=\"http://www.glyptoteket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek</a> in Copenhagen, Denmark. There are still traces of the original polychrome paint (a lot of the weathering on the white marble is actually paint remnants) on the head, which allowed experts to create a reconstruction of the original colored version.</p>\n<p>They examined the portrait using raking light (light held at an angle almost parallel to the surface which reveals the effects of painting that impressed itself onto the marble over the centuries even though it\u2019s gone now), ultraviolet and infrared to get as much information as possible about how the original was painted. A second head was computer-carved into marble to be an exact copy of the original, then it was painted according to the scheme determined by analysis.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Original-head-of-Caligula.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21926\" height=\"273\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Original-head-of-Caligula-200x273.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Original-head-of-Caligula-200x273.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Original-head-of-Caligula-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Original-head-of-Caligula-430x588.jpg 430w\" title=\"Head of\u0096 Emperor Caligula, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Polychrome-reconstruction-of-head-of-caligula.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-21927\" height=\"275\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Polychrome-reconstruction-of-head-of-caligula-200x275.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Polychrome-reconstruction-of-head-of-caligula-200x275.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Polychrome-reconstruction-of-head-of-caligula-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Polychrome-reconstruction-of-head-of-caligula-430x591.jpg 430w\" title=\"Color reconstruction of Caligula's head, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>I\u2019m not seeing the goat, but he\u2019s definitely got sunken temples and a broad forehead.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s his birthday, so let\u2019s not just wallow in Little Boot\u2019s bad reputation.

Fortunately for last year\u2019s demolition crew, the bomb was buried three feet deep, so they never encountered it. The workers digging the foundations of the new office building going up at the site, on the other hand, found it.</p>\n<p>Authorities attempted to defuse the bomb on the spot but had trouble with the chemical delay-action detonator, a mechanism that was used in only 10% of bombs, but because it had a bad habit of not working appears in a disproportionate number of unexploded bombs. Finally they gave up trying to defuse it and decided to explode it inside. Even a controlled explosion is dangerous in the densely populated center of Munich, so 2,500 people in the area around the bomb were evacuated and cars removed. Streets were blocked off, three subway stations closed and people further out were asked not to leave their homes.</p>\n<p>Bales of hay and thousands of sandbags were stacked around the bomb to help absorb the explosive shock, and then, just before 10:00 PM on Tuesday night, this happened:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BQIE00_3o8&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The strength of the explosion shattered surrounding windows. Some of the hay drifted up to rooftops and set them on fire. Firefighters were on alert and were able to put them out promptly with only minor damage. No people were injured.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Experts say that the undiscovered bombs in Germany become more dangerous with each passing year. Last year, a former bomb disposal chief told SPIEGEL ONLINE that \u201cunexploded bombs are becoming more dangerous by the day through material fatigue as a result of ageing and through erosion of safety elements in the trigger mechanisms.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bombs are found so often in Germany \u2014 thousands a year, an average of 15 a day \u2014 that most of the time the removals don\u2019t even make the news.

It was donated to the Massachusetts Historical Society by Elkanah Watson in 1803, just 22 years after he received it as a gift from Benjamin Franklin himself. As a young man, Elkanah Watson was apprenticed to merchant, slave trader and committed Federalist John Brown, co-founder of what would later be named Brown University in honor of him and his brothers. In 1779, Brown and some other Revolutionary leaders asked the 21-year-old Watson to carry some dispatches to Benjamin Franklin in France. Elkanah, dissatisfied with what he\u2019d seen of the merchant gig and yearning to see more of the world, gladly took the assignment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Patience_Wright-ca-1782.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Patience Wright ca. 1782\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19342\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Patience_Wright-ca-1782-109x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Patience_Wright-ca-1782-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Patience_Wright-ca-1782-200x275.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Patience_Wright-ca-1782-430x591.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Patience_Wright-ca-1782.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Patience Wright ca. 1782\" width=\"109\"/></a>He continued to act as courier between the nascent United States and its delegation in France for several years. On one of those trips he met <a href=\"http://www.npg.si.edu/exhibit/murray/#3\" target=\"_blank\">Mrs. Patience Lovell Wright</a>, an eccentric widow who supported her family after her husband\u2019s death by turning her hobby of sculpting faces in bread dough and wax into a wildly successful profession. So successful was she that she moved to England and sculpted the likes of the King and Queen \u2014 whom she called George and Charlotte \u2014 as well as William Pitt and Admiral Richard Howe. She also spied on them all in support of the Revolutionary cause. Legend has it that she would make wax heads of Patriots, then hide them under her apron when a Royalist came to her studio. Legend also has it that she would hide spy notes inside the wax heads, then ship them back to the States. During 1775 and 1776, she was one of Franklin\u2019s best sources of intelligence about what the British were planning.</p>\n<p>In 1781 Watson commissioned Mrs. Wright to make a wax sculpture of Benjamin Franklin\u2019s head. When the work was done, Franklin invited them both to dinner at Passy. Here\u2019s the passage describing the events from <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/menandtimes00watsrich\" target=\"_blank\">Elkanah\u2019s memoirs</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I employed Mrs. W. to make the head of Franklin, which was often the source of much amusement to me. After it was completed, both being invited to dine with Franklin, I conveyed her to Passy in my carriage, she bearing the head upon her lap. No sooner in presence of the Doctor, than she had placed one head by the side of the other. \u201cThere!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201care twin brothers.\u201d The likeness was truly admirable, and at the suggestion of Mrs. Wright, to give it more effect, Franklin sent me a suit of silk clothes he wore in 1778. Many years afterwards, the head was broken in Albany, and the clothes I presented to the \u201cHistorical Society of Massachusetts.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s an inscription inked on the inner lining of the vest that claims Franklin wore this very suit when he signed the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fr1788-1.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Treaty of Amity and Commerce</a> with France on February 6, 1778, but in the letter he wrote to the Massachusetts Historical Society from Albany in 1803 Watson wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This may certify that in the year 1781, being at Paris, in France, the celebrated Mrs. Wright executed for me an excellent likeness in wax of the immortal Dr. Benjamin Franklin. Dining with her at the Doctor\u2019s, in Passy, and on comparing the heads, I suggested that such a head deserved a suit of his own clothes, on which he rang for his servant, directing him to bring the suit he wore\u2026in the year of the signing of the famous Treaty of Alliance between France and America, in February, 1778.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-page1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Treaty of Alliance, page one\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19343\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-page1-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-page1-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-page1-200x297.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-page1-430x640.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-page1.jpg 1347w\" title=\"Treaty of Alliance, page one\" width=\"100\"/></a>Watson then wrote a follow-up emphasizing that the clothes were from the <em>year</em> Franklin signed the treaty, not the precise time he signed the treaty. This doesn\u2019t in any way decrease the historical importance of the suit. Franklin\u2019s clothes played a massive role in the ginger diplomatic balancing act he had to do to secure the vital support of France for the baby United States.  <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-sigs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Treaty of Alliance, last page with signatures and seals\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19344\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-sigs-101x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-sigs-101x150.jpg 101w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-sigs-200x295.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-sigs-430x635.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Treaty-of-Alliance-sigs.jpg 1358w\" title=\"Treaty of Alliance, last page with signatures and seals\" width=\"101\"/></a>The Treaty of Amity and Commerce and the <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fr1788-2.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Treaty of Alliance</a>, both signed on the same day, ensured that the raggedy new country would have economic and military support from one global superpower in its war against the other.

He was the incarnation of the democratic spirit of the new country, and everyone from King Louis XVI to Queen Marie Antoinette on down thought he was the bees knees.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reproduction-showing-original-plum-color.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Reproduction at the Massachusetts Historical Society showing the original plum color\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19345\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reproduction-showing-original-plum-color-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reproduction-showing-original-plum-color-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reproduction-showing-original-plum-color-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reproduction-showing-original-plum-color-430x430.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Reproduction-showing-original-plum-color.jpg 600w\" title=\"Reproduction at the Massachusetts Historical Society showing the original plum color\" width=\"150\"/></a>This particular suit looks a very somber brown now, but it was originally a plum or claret color. Still modest and restrained, of course, but not quite as much as his brown homespun he called his \u201cQuaker\u201d suit. The fading of the color is one of the main conservation issues the Smithsonian will have to tackle. Although the structure of the three pieces \u2014 breeches, waistcoat and coat \u2014 remains sound, as does the linen lining, there are places where the fabric is puckering and flaking. Now that the museum owns the suit outright, it can work on a conservation plan based on their years of research and the latest technologies that will stabilize it to ensure it remains in the American cultural patrimony for centuries to come.</p>\n<p>Below is the account in Elkanah Watson\u2019s memoirs of Mrs. Wright\u2019s creation of the wax head of Benjamin Franklin, Franklin\u2019s donation of one of his suits to complete the look, and the later wacky adventures of the suit and the head in France and England.

If you think this must have been a painfully tedious experience, you think right.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cBefore preparation, one of the tiny flecks of amber, about 1 millimeter in diameter, wafted onto the floor of my lab,\u201d [David Grimaldi, curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York,] recalled. \u201cAlex Schmidt and my assistant who did the prep, Paul Nascimbene, spent about three hours on their hands and knees with flashlights. I don\u2019t know how, but they found the speck on the floor hidden in the corner between two lab benches. It was a nerve-wracking time.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Triassic-midge-fly.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Triassic midge fly parts, head upper left\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19321\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 60px) 100vw, 60px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Triassic-midge-fly-60x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Triassic-midge-fly-60x150.jpg 60w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Triassic-midge-fly-121x300.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Triassic-midge-fly-323x800.jpg 323w\" title=\"Triassic midge fly parts, head upper left\" width=\"60\"/></a>It\u2019s a good thing they were that dedicated to the task, because out of the 70,000 droplets of amber they analyzed for inclusions, three of them contained the groundbreaking arthropods: one partial midge fly (Diptera) about the size of a head of a pin, and two new species of gall mites. The amber had preserved the head, antenna, four legs and some fragments of the body of the midge fly which taken together were 1.5-2 millimeters in size.</p>\n<p>The mites were complete and far tinier. One of them, <em>Triasacarus fedelei</em>, is shaped like a worm and is 210 microns long. Due to its body shape and differences in the structure of the mouth, researchers believe it may be an ancestor of modern gall mites. The second mite, <em>Ampezzoa triassica</em>, is even smaller at 124 microns in length. Its shape is more typical of modern gall mites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gall-mites-in-230-million-year-old-amber-droplets.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Gall mites in 230-million-year-old amber droplets\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-19323\" height=\"260\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gall-mites-in-230-million-year-old-amber-droplets-200x260.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gall-mites-in-230-million-year-old-amber-droplets-200x260.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gall-mites-in-230-million-year-old-amber-droplets-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gall-mites-in-230-million-year-old-amber-droplets-430x560.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gall mites in 230-million-year-old amber droplets\" width=\"200\"/></a>The amber preserved these creatures so well that scientists could examine them in microscopic detail, allowing them to identify minute characteristics like tiny waxy filaments on the surface of <em>Triasacarus fedelei\u2019</em>s body that are thought to have helped protect them from predators, parasites and the elements. Both mites have two pairs of legs like present-day mites.</p>\n<p>One way in which they\u2019re different from their modern relatives is that the Triassic mites must have fed on conifers, since it\u2019s conifer resin that hardens into amber. Today 97% of Eriophyoidea, the group gall mites belong to, feed on flowering plants, which means the mites changed their eating and living habits entirely when the new plant species came on the scene about 140 million years ago.</p>\n<p>The Dolomite amber study has been published in the current issue of the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/08/21/1208464109\" target=\"_blank\">You can read it here</a> if you have access to a subscription.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"230-million-year-old mites found in Dolomite amber\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/19306\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/19306#comments\">8 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-19280\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/19280\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Family receives soldier\u2019s will left on a bus in 1944\">Family receives soldier\u2019s will left on a bus in 1944</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, August 27th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Private-Gordon-Heaton.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19293\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Private-Gordon-Heaton-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Private-Gordon-Heaton-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Private-Gordon-Heaton-200x289.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Private-Gordon-Heaton.jpg 306w\" title=\"Private Gordon Heaton\" width=\"103\"/></a>In October of last year, employees at the National Express bus depot in Birmingham were clearing out the lost property office so it could be painted when they came across something that had been lost since 1944. When she moved a heavy cardboard box on top of a dusty old metal cabinet, Christine McDaid found an old war office envelope.

The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-15641130\" target=\"_blank\">story was picked up by the BBC</a> at the time. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Route_Tilly_Memorial_plaque.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19291\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Route_Tilly_Memorial_plaque-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Route_Tilly_Memorial_plaque-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Route_Tilly_Memorial_plaque-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Route_Tilly_Memorial_plaque-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Route_Tilly_Memorial_plaque.jpg 612w\" title=\"Route de Tilly memorial plaque for Worchestershire Regiment\" width=\"112\"/></a>While they waited for a response, Christine McDaid did some research on Private Heaton and found that he had been killed in France in August of 1944, less than two months after he made the will.

Hall\u2019s 80-year-old great uncle John Heaton is sick in the hospital and David has been visiting him. He got the idea to look for information about his uncle\u2019s long-lost brother Gordon who they thought had died during the war. When he searched for \u201cPrivate Gordon Heaton\u201d he found the story about the will. He knew the name alone wasn\u2019t enough information to be certain it was the same person, but he contacted National Express and did further research. War department records confirmed that the will was indeed the last testament of the great uncle he never knew.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Will-Form-e1346058702594.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19297\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Will-Form-e1346058702594-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Will-Form-e1346058702594-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Will-Form-e1346058702594-200x252.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Will-Form-e1346058702594-430x542.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Will-Form-e1346058702594.jpg 613w\" title=\"Form letter from war office regarding Private Heaton's estate\" width=\"118\"/></a>In a sad coincidence, the Heatons never received the war office telegram informing them of their son\u2019s death. Then months later, the will, as we know, was left on a bus, so they never received anything official notice that Gordon was dead at all. They just assumed he had died when the war was over and he didn\u2019t come back. </p>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19333299\" target=\"_blank\">Christine McDaid returned the documents to David Hall</a> who accepted them gratefully in his great-uncle\u2019s name.

Spacious burial grounds set in a landscaped park-like environment on the outskirts of a city were a reaction to the increasingly crowded urban churchyards which were often putrid, poorly guarded and vermin-infested. Old remains in such places had to be regularly disinterred to make room for new ones since there was little room for expansion.</p>\n<p>P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris was the first garden cemetery established in 1804. The first one in the United States was Mount Auburn Cemetery outside Boston in 1831. Its pastoral vista of rolling hills with classical monuments, bodies of water and groves of trees had the appeal of an English garden, then a popular landscaping trend. It was also non-sectarian, unlike the churchyards which determined who could be buried in them based on their religious affiliation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/greenwood-entrance.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Gothic revival entrance to Green-Wood\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19268\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/greenwood-entrance-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/greenwood-entrance-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/greenwood-entrance-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/greenwood-entrance-430x282.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gothic revival entrance to Green-Wood\" width=\"150\"/></a>So beautiful and peaceful were the new garden cemeteries that they become popular tourist attractions. People would make a day of it and picnic on the grounds.

Today, on the anniversary of his burial, <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/august/searching-for-richard-iii\" target=\"_blank\">archaeologists from the University of Leicester will try to dig him up again</a>. It\u2019s the first archaeological excavation ever to search for the lost grave of a British sovereign.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all the Tudors\u2019 fault, of course. Henry Tudor\u2019s Lancastrian troops defeated Richard\u2019s Yorkist army at the Battle of Bosworth Field on August 22, 1485. Richard died on that field, felled by blows to the head from a poleaxe. With Richard\u2019s death, Henry Tudor became King Henry VII. One of his first acts as monarch the day after the battle was to bring Richard\u2019s body to nearby Leicester where it would be exposed, naked, and then hanged for all to see so there would be no question that the old king was dead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-white-destrier-felled-Southwark-cathedral.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Richard III falls at Bosworth; Shakespeare Window in Southwark Cathedral, designed by Christopher Webb, 1954\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19235\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-white-destrier-felled-Southwark-cathedral-e1345881118769-150x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-white-destrier-felled-Southwark-cathedral-e1345881118769-150x148.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-white-destrier-felled-Southwark-cathedral-e1345881118769-200x197.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-white-destrier-felled-Southwark-cathedral-e1345881118769-430x424.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-white-destrier-felled-Southwark-cathedral-e1345881118769.jpg 805w\" title=\"Richard III falls at Bosworth; Shakespeare Window in Southwark Cathedral, designed by Christopher Webb, 1954\" width=\"150\"/></a>After two days of being subjected to public ignominy, Richard\u2019s body was buried at Leicester\u2019s Church of the Franciscans, aka the Greyfriars. After years of dynastic dispute, the new king certainly wasn\u2019t going to have the one he considered a usurper buried in kingly pomp with his ancestors in London, so instead the friars buried him unceremoniously in their abbey. Ten years later, Henry\u2019s guilty conscience gnawed at him enough that he would spend \u00a350 to have an alabaster memorial monument built over Richard\u2019s tomb.</p>\n<p>Then came the second Tudor Henry. Henry VIII split with the Catholic Church and the violent dissolution of the monasteries that followed did not spare Greyfriars. In November of 1538, the Greyfriars abbey and church in Leicester was destroyed. There is no record from that time describing what happened to Richard\u2019s tomb and remains. The popular legend is that his tomb was smashed to bits and Richard\u2019s body was taken by a mob and thrown in the River Soar. The earliest source for that story comes from mapmaker and historian John Speede writing seventy years after the purported events, however, and people who certainly would have written about it in the interim had it happened never mention a desecrating mob.</p>\n<p>In fact, according to Christopher Wren, father of the famous architect, in 1612 there was a new monument over Richard\u2019s grave. The property where the monastery once stood had been purchased by Leicester\u2019s former mayor Robert Herrick who built an elegant house and gardens on the site. On the spot where the tomb of the king had been, Herrick erected a pillar inscribed, \u201cHere lies the body of Richard III, some time King of England.\u201d Wren worked as a tutor to Herrick\u2019s nephew at that time and saw the monument while walking the grounds with Robert.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-plaque.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Richard III Society plaque on Grey Friars Street\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19239\" height=\"80\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-plaque-150x80.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-plaque-150x80.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-plaque-200x107.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-plaque-430x231.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Richard-III-plaque.jpg 1548w\" title=\"Richard III Society plaque on Grey Friars Street\" width=\"150\"/></a>As the centuries passed, development entirely changed the cityscape and the exact location of Greyfriars church was lost, although the neighborhood was known. (There\u2019s a street in the area conveniently called Grey Friars Street.) The <a href=\"http://www.richardiii.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard III Society</a> put a plaque on a building to mark one potential spot.</p>\n<p>A recent archaeological survey on Grey Friars Street done when a 1950s structure was being demolished to make way for new construction cast a whole new light on the question of where the church had been. It was a case of the dog barking in the night. The dig was in the center of the Greyfriars location, but archaeologists found nothing but a small piece of stone coffin lid. If the church had been there, they would have found much more evidence of its presence. This non-discovery discovery moved the epicenter of the Greyfriars site considerably to the west, an area that has more parking lots than real estate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/John-Speede-map-of-Leicester.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"John Speede map of Leicester county and city, 1616\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19241\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/John-Speede-map-of-Leicester-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/John-Speede-map-of-Leicester-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/John-Speede-map-of-Leicester-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/John-Speede-map-of-Leicester-430x319.jpg 430w\" title=\"John Speede map of Leicester county and city, 1616\" width=\"150\"/></a>Another recent discovery that boosted the odds of finding Richard\u2019s burial was made by genealogist and Richard III expert Dr. John Ashdown-Hill. While researching his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Days-Richard-III/dp/0752454048\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Last Days of Richard III</em></a>, Ashdown-Hill examined the maps John Speede had made when he searched for Richard\u2019s grave. He found that Speede had been looking at the wrong monastery, Blackfriars instead of Greyfriars.</p>\n<p>Armed with this new information, University of Leicester experts used map regression analysis (a systematic comparison of different kinds of maps from different eras) to pinpoint the most likely site of the former Greyfriars church. It\u2019s a parking lot used by the Leicester City Council.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Leicester-council-carpark.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Leicester City Council parking lot\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-19237\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Leicester-council-carpark-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Leicester-council-carpark-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Leicester-council-carpark-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Leicester-council-carpark-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Leicester-council-carpark.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Leicester City Council parking lot\" width=\"200\"/></a>The parking lot was surveyed Friday with ground-penetrating radar, and several archaeological hot spots were identified. Today the excavation begins. Guided by the GPR data, the archaeological team plans to start digging two long trenches.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The trenches will run North-South and should intersect with the church\u2019s East-West walls (helpfully, Christian churches are usually built on the same alignment). The ULAS team shouldn\u2019t have to dig too deep as, although there are hundreds of years of remains to get through, the actual strata are fairly shallow. Previous Leicester excavations have shown that the Roman layer is less than a meter down \u2013 and if you reach that, you\u2019ve gone way past 1485.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The excavation will continue for two weeks. No visits to the dig will be allowed because the parking lot is for Council employees only, and it\u2019s not in a publicly accessible area under normal circumstances. The weekend of September 8th, however, the site will be opened to the public. Come Monday the trenches will be filled back in and a week later it will be a parking lot again.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists are very cautious in their estimates of what they might find. Fragments of an alabaster tomb would be nice; human remains of a male of proper age bearing evidence of fatal battle wounds would be ideal. Since time is very limited, they won\u2019t be able to excavate any remains that aren\u2019t likely Richard candidates, and given that churches and abbeys were thick with burials inside and outside the buildings, they could well encounter an embarrassment of options.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Michael-Ibsen-DNA-swab.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Michael Ibsen swabs his cheek for his royal DNA\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-19247\" height=\"102\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Michael-Ibsen-DNA-swab-150x102.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Michael-Ibsen-DNA-swab-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Michael-Ibsen-DNA-swab-200x136.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Michael-Ibsen-DNA-swab-430x292.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Michael-Ibsen-DNA-swab.jpg 475w\" title=\"Michael Ibsen swabs his cheek for his royal DNA\" width=\"150\"/></a>If by some freakish good luck they do find remains that could be Richard\u2019s, DNA experts will attempt to match its mitochondrial DNA to that of a direct descendant down the female line of Richard\u2019s sister, Anne of York. Dr. Ashdown-Hill traced this unbroken matrilineal genealogy to Mrs. Joy Ibsen, an English-born journalist who had emigrated to Canada in her 20s.

The painting on the wall of the church of the Sanctuary of Mercy was the only work in town done by turn of the century artist El\u00edas Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez and one of his granddaughters had just donated money to restore it.</p>\n<p>The fresco, a 20-by-15-inch portrait of Christ wearing the crown of thorns called <em>Ecce Homo</em>, was in poor condition.

They had no idea who had perpetrated the vile act, but the initial assumption was that it was a work of vandalism done in secret which they denounced in no uncertain terms. The blog entry noted that the Mart\u00ednez family had met with the mayor to lodge a complaint and that the possibility of legal action was not excluded.</p>\n<p>This week the story made the Spanish press (the <a href=\"http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2012/08/21/actualidad/1345563468_581914.html\" target=\"_blank\">El Pais article</a> has an entertaining dragable before and after graphic), then it made the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ykyww/an_old_church_in_spain_needed_to_restore_a_worn/\" target=\"_blank\">Internet</a> and news outlets all over the world.</p>\n<p>As \u201cEcce Mono\u201d (\u201cBehold the Monkey\u201d) went viral, the culprit stepped forward. It was no malicious vandal, but rather an 81-year-old church volunteer named Cecilia Gim\u00e9nez, an amateur artist who had done touch-ups on the painting several times over the years. In an <a href=\"http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20120822/ayuntamiento-no-descarta-actuar-contra-anciana-destrozado-ecce-homo/559369.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Spanish television</a> (clips from that story are in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Ao8XPDaU4\" target=\"_blank\">this BBC video</a> translated into English), she claimed there was no secret about it at all. She did it with the advanced knowledge and permission of the priest and in full view of anybody who walked into the church as she worked. The church has no money so volunteers are always fixing things and this was no different.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s an accomplished artist, she insisted, who once had a four-room exhibition of her work from which she sold 40 paintings. Something just went wrong this time. She doesn\u2019t know why, but it just got out of hand. When she realized she was in way over her head, she reported her work to the town councilor for culture, Juan Maria de Ojeda. She loved the painting and just wanted to help.</p>\n<p>The city council is still <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/world/europe/botched-restoration-of-ecce-homo-fresco-shocks-spain.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">considering taking some kind of legal action against her</a> because her good intentions notwithstanding, her unsolicited intervention was \u201can assault on artistic patrimony.\u201d I seriously doubt they\u2019ll take it to the law. She\u2019s an elderly church booster who is the sole caretaker of her disabled 60-year-old son. The diocese also thinks the reaction has been exaggerated since little old ladies are always doing stuff like this in churches out of devotion and nobody gets too wound up about the quality of their work.</p>\n<p>City officials are bringing in professional restorers Monday to see if Cecilia Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s \u201crestoration\u201d can be undone. Prospects are grim. The original work is a hundred years old and it was done directly on the unprepped wall with oil paints. There\u2019s a reason frescoes are made with pigment applied to wet plaster; oil on wall tends to flake right off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Tourists-get-their-picture-taken-with-the-Jesus-Monkey.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Tourists get their picture taken with the Jesus Monkey, photo by Gorka Lejacegi\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19191\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Tourists-get-their-picture-taken-with-the-Jesus-Monkey-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Tourists-get-their-picture-taken-with-the-Jesus-Monkey-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Tourists-get-their-picture-taken-with-the-Jesus-Monkey-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Tourists-get-their-picture-taken-with-the-Jesus-Monkey-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Tourists-get-their-picture-taken-with-the-Jesus-Monkey.jpg 980w\" title=\"Tourists get their picture taken with the Jesus Monkey, photo by Gorka Lejacegi\" width=\"150\"/></a>If it can\u2019t be re-restored, that might be a boon for the city. \u201cThe world\u2019s worst restoration\u201d has a growing fan club now. It has become a major <a href=\"http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2012/08/23/album/1345746996_140946.html#1345746996_140946_1345747230\" target=\"_blank\">tourist attraction</a> and subject of a <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/ayuntamiento-de-borja-zaragoza-mantenimiento-de-la-nueva-versi%C3%B3n-del-ecce-homo-de-borja\" target=\"_blank\">Change.org petition</a> to keep the new version rather than allow restorers to revert it back to the original. As the petition puts it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The daring work of the spontaneous artist in the <em>Ecce Homo</em> of the Sanctuary of Mercy of Borja is an endearing and a loving act, a clever reflection of political and social situation of our time. It reveals a subtle critique of creationist theories of the Church, as well as questioning the emergence of new idols. The result of the intervention cleverly combines primitive expressionism Francisco de Goya, with figures such as Ensor, Munch, Modigliani or Die Br\u00fccke group of German Expressionism.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also the Monchichi school of Sekiguchi Corporation and Hanna-Barbera.</p>\n<p>Anyway it\u2019s not like the original is a masterpiece, despite what some of the more sensationalistic headlines said when the story first broke. It has more sentimental value than artistic or historical significance. Elias Garcia Martinez was a fairly well-known local painter of traditional-style popular works in the late 19th and early 20th century. He was a professor at the Fine Arts School of Zaragoza from 1894 until his retirement in 1929, and he and his family used to vacation in Borja during the summer break. One of those summers he spent two hours painting Christ with a crown of thorns on a church wall in honor of the Virgin of Mercy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Guido-Renihead-of-christ-crowned-with-thorns-1620.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35887\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Guido-Renihead-of-christ-crowned-with-thorns-1620-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Guido-Renihead-of-christ-crowned-with-thorns-1620-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Guido-Renihead-of-christ-crowned-with-thorns-1620-200x249.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Guido-Renihead-of-christ-crowned-with-thorns-1620-430x535.jpg 430w\" title='\"Head of Christ Crowned with Thorns\" by Guido Reni, 1620' width=\"120\"/></a>It wasn\u2019t even a work born from the fires of his imagination. He copied it from a mass-production print, etching, maybe a porcelain plate or one of those prayer cards with cheesy pictures of saints. The true original was Baroque master Guido Reni who around 1630 made an oil on copper panel painting called <em>Head of Christ Crowned with Thorns</em>, <a href=\"http://www.dia.org/object-info/17982f50-0fcb-403e-ab09-6d644c606834.aspx?position=2\" target=\"_blank\">now in the Detroit Institute of Arts</a>. He made several other similar pieces (<a href=\"http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=1672&amp;langue=en\" target=\"_blank\">here\u2019s one in the Louvre</a>), and by the time Martinez was painting, versions of Reni\u2019s roll-eyed Christ \u2014 now modestly attired in bulky tunics \u2014 were ubiquitous.</p>\n<p>Martinez\u2019s version isn\u2019t even all that great of a copy, in my opinion.

Stephon Tull was looking through old boxes of his father\u2019s when he came across a reel labeled \u201cDr. King interview, Dec. 21, 1960.\u201d He borrowed an old reel-to-reel player from a friend and listened to the recording. It was of his father interviewing Martin Luther King, Jr. about the civil rights movement, the philosophy of non-violence, the political impact of that year\u2019s sit-ins and his certainty that the child his wife Coretta was carrying would be a boy. (He was right; Dexter Scott King, Dr. King\u2019s second son, was born just over a month later.)</p>\n<p>Tull had no idea that his father, an insurance salesman, had recorded an interview with King as part of a book he planned to write. The book would have been a first person exploration of his father\u2019s childhood in segregated Chattanooga and his adult life in Nashville under Jim Crow and during the civil rights era. The book was never completed, and Tull\u2019s father stored the recording in the attic. Stephon doesn\u2019t know if anyone other than his father heard the recording before he stashed it away. His father is in his 80s now. He\u2019s ill and is currently under hospice care, so he\u2019s not able to fill in the blanks on this remarkable find.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the only clip I\u2019ve been able to find from the recording:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-T4pO2OpSQ&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>Mr. Tull is asking Dr. King about the effect of the sit-ins that were held at segregated lunch counters all over the South in 1960. The sit-ins in Nashville had taken place earlier that year, from February 13th to May 10th, at the whites-only lunch counters of Woolworth\u2019s, Walgreens and other major downtown retailers. Congressman John Lewis, then a student at Nashville\u2019s Fisk University and of the philosophy of non-violent protest, was one of the notable participants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sit-in-Nashville-Woolworths-lunch-counter-2-1960.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Sit-in at the Nashville Woolworths lunch counter, February 19, 1960\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19162\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sit-in-Nashville-Woolworths-lunch-counter-2-1960-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sit-in-Nashville-Woolworths-lunch-counter-2-1960-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sit-in-Nashville-Woolworths-lunch-counter-2-1960-200x161.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sit-in-Nashville-Woolworths-lunch-counter-2-1960-430x346.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sit-in at the Nashville Woolworths lunch counter, February 19, 1960\" width=\"150\"/></a>The earliest sit-ins passed without incident, but as they continued they engendered increasing wrath among the business owners and segregationist crowds. By the end of February, sit-in protesters were getting arrested for disorderly conduct. The pro-segregation protesters harassing and attacking them were not. To support the sit-ins, religious leaders from Nashville\u2019s black churches encouraged a boycott of businesses with segregated counters. An estimated 98% of Nashville\u2019s black population participated in the boycott. Retailers promptly felt the financial sting.</p>\n<p>On April 19th, the home of Z. Alexander Looby, a lawyer who was defending many of the demonstrators arrested at sit-ins, was bombed. He and his wife were unharmed, but the incident spurred a major protest in which 4,000 people marched on City Hall. The protest leaders met with Mayor Ben West on the courthouse steps, and he agreed publicly that segregation was immoral but said that store managers had to decide on their own whether to serve customers regardless of the color of their skin. On May 10th, a half-dozen Nashville retailers opened their lunch counters to black customers, making Nashville the first major city in the South to begin to desegregate its facilities.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t smooth sailing from there on out, needless to say. Desegregation would remain an arduous struggle over the next four years until the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited segregation in public places in the entire country.</p>\n<p>Martin Luther King\u2019s thoughts on non-violent protest and the sit-ins are well-known. He released many interviews and wrote about the topics extensively. Another subject addressed in Tull\u2019s recording is of particular interest to historians: King\u2019s recent trip to Africa and how the civil rights movement in the United States had an impact on the independence movements taking root on that continent.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In another part of Tull\u2019s recording, King describes a recent trip to Africa. He explains to Tull\u2019s father the importance of the civil rights movement both in the United States and abroad.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is quite a bit of interest and concern in Africa for the situation in the United States. African leaders in general, and African people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and familiar with what has taken place,\u201d he said, \u201cWe must solve this problem of racial injustice if expect to maintain our leadership in the world, and if we expect to maintain a moral voice in a world that is two thirds color.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Clayborne Carson, founding director of Stanford University\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.kinginstitute.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute</a>, King is talking about a trip to Nigeria he took in November of 1960, just a month before the Tull interview. King was personally invited to Lagos by Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria\u2019s first governor-general of African descent, to attend his inauguration on November 16th, 1960. In 1963, Azikiwe would become the first president of the independent Republic of Nigeria.</p>\n<p>Carson notes that there isn\u2019t very much information out there about the Nigeria trip. King didn\u2019t do any interviews or press conferences while he was there, nor does he talk about the Nigerian trip in any extant letters or documents. The Tull interview is a rare gem on that score.</p>\n<p>Stephon Tull is planning to sell the recording through collector and broker Keya Morgan in New York City. Will it fall into the private abyss or will a museum, the <a href=\"http://www.thekingcenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">King Center</a> or another institution get to preserve it for posterity?</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Unknown MLK recording found in Nashville attic\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/19146\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/19146#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2012/08/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

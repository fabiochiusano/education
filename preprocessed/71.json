{"content": "comments By Emily Robinson , Datacamp . Following Dave Robinson\u2019s sage tweet to write a blog post when you\u2019ve given the same advice three times, this post is a collection of my thoughts and recommendations for people interested in applying to data science jobs in the US. Many of these principles also apply to tech jobs in general. A disclaimer: I have never worked as a recruiter or career coach. This knowledge comes from mainly from my study of Organizational Behavior (including negotiations and women in tech) in graduate school and my own career. This advice also will not fit every single situation. The people who will benefit the most from this post are probably those who are applying for their first data science job and/or are in or recently out of school. If there\u2019s another tip or a caveat I should add, send me a note on twitter! Jump to: Application Online Presence Finding and Evaluating Jobs Resume and Cover Letter Interviewing Offer Stage Initial response Juggling multiple options Negotiating Application Online Presence Take stock of your online presence. Check your privacy settings on Facebook or any other social media you use to make sure you\u2019ve limited what\u2019s available publicly. While many online job applications now have places for twitter handles, don\u2019t include yours unless you use it mainly in a professional manner (e.g. tweeting about data science resources or pets. Pets are always appropriate). If you have a GitHub, pin the repos you want people to see and add READMEs that explain what the project is. I also strongly recommend creating a blog to write about data science, whether it\u2019s projects you\u2019ve worked on, an explanation of a machine learning method, or a summary of a conference you attended. If you need more convincing that blogging is a great use of your time, check out this post by Dave Robinson on the subject. If you program in R, you can use blogdown to create a website. Emily Zabor has written a great tutorial for this; find more blogdown resources in Mara Averick\u2019s extensive list . If you don\u2019t use R, you can use Hugo (which blogdown is built on top of) directly or start out with Medium . Finding and Evaluating Jobs Browse widely : jobs in data science go by many names besides data scientist. These include: product analyst, data analyst, research scientist, quantitative analyst, and machine learning engineer. Different companies use different names for similar roles and some are changing what their titles mean (see Lyft\u2019s post on their recent shift of data analyst to data scientist and data scientist to research scientist). Even the definition of what separates a data analyst from a data scientist is not agreed upon (see this recent post by Mikhail Popov summarizing different perspectives). Try searching for all of these terms to find positions and then use the description to evaluate the fit. If you\u2019re interested in start-ups, Angelist has thousands of positions, many of which list a salary range. Do some self-reflection : rather than applying to every type of data science job you find, think about where you want to specialize. A distinction I\u2019ve found helpful when thinking of my own career and looking at jobs is the Type A vs. Type B data scientist . \u201cA\u201d stands for analysis: type A data scientists have strong statistics skill and the ability to work with messy data and communicate results. \u201cB\u201d stands for build: type B data scientists have very strong coding skills, maybe have a background in software engineering, and focus on putting machine learning models, such as recommendation systems, into production. Also consider what data stage you want your company to be in (see discussion in Robert Chang\u2019s post ). An advantage of working at a smaller company is you can try different parts of data science; big companies are more specialized, so you may not be able to try both creating a lifetime value model and tuning a recommendation system, and many problems, like data engineering, are abstracted away. On the other hand, at smaller companies you\u2019ll usually need to deal more with data quality problems, poor documentation, and slow query processing. While data stage is correlated with company size, a big company that\u2019s been around for 100 years may not have data science maturity. Don\u2019t demand perfection : your first job in the field probably won\u2019t be your dream one. It\u2019s easier to transition within your field or bring data science into your current role; even if you\u2019re looking to eventually leave your domain, you may need to start out by moving to a position where you can leverage your other skills. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have certain requirements and preferences (see above), but it does mean you\u2019ll want to have some flexibility. It\u2019s very normal to switch jobs in tech even after just a year or two, so you\u2019re not signing yourself up for the next 15 years. To me, the most important criteria for my first job was that it was a supportive environment, with lots of other analyst, where I could learn a lot. And as Jonathan Nolis points out, you can\u2019t know exactly what you want before you\u2019re even in the field and you\u2019ll learn even from bad jobs, so don\u2019t stress too much: Early in my career I spent a lot of emotional effort trying to figure out which job was \u201cright\u201d for me and what exactly I needed, but now I realize that even my bad jobs were good experiences to learn what\u2019s important to me. 2/ \u2014 Jonathan Nolis (@skyetetra) May 29, 2018 Don\u2019t undersell yourself : job descriptions are generally wishlists with some flexibility. If you meet 80% of the requirements (e.g. you\u2019re a year short of their required work experience or haven\u2019t worked with one component of their tech stack), but are otherwise a good fit, you should still apply. With that said, be wary of job descriptions that describe a unicorn - a PhD in Computer Science who\u2019s also worked for 5+ years as a data scientist and is an expert in cutting-edge statistics, deep learning, and communicating with business partners - and lists a huge range of responsibilities, running from doing production-level machine learning to creating dashboards to running A/B tests. It usually means they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for and they expect a data scientist to come and solve all their problems without any support. Look for connections on LinkedIn : check if you know anyone at the company you\u2019re interested in. If you don\u2019t know anyone, see if there\u2019s anyone in your alumni networks (bootcamp, college, that kickball team you joined one summer). You can also check for second connections and see if the person who bridges you can introduce you. Many jobs get hundreds if not thousands of applications for each position and having someone refer you or give you feedback on what the team is looking for is enormously helpful. If you do reach out, take the time to tailor the message: if you don\u2019t know the person, do your research and reference their background or public work. Check out meetups and conferences : sometimes hiring managers will come to meetups or conferences to recruit. You may also meet someone in the company or sub-industry you\u2019re interested in. You can ask if they have time for an informational interview so you can learn more about their field. If you ask if their company has an opening or if they can refer you, though, you\u2019ll probably be directed to the company\u2019s career page. This is why it\u2019s important to build your network before you need it - starting off with a strong ask is not a great way to build a mutually fulfilling relationship. Check out my previous posts about finding community and reaching out if you\u2019re interested to read more about how you can build your network. Resume and Cover Letter Keep your resume to one page : you don\u2019t have to list everything you\u2019ve ever done. Try making a master resume which has all of your work history and then pull what\u2019s most relevant for each job. Don\u2019t put a laundry list of every technology you\u2019ve ever used; focus on the ones that you\u2019ll be comfortable talking about. A tip from a recruiter: \u201cdon\u2019t use graphs showing how experienced you are in certain technologies. If you have python being a full bar, do you actually know 100% of what there is to know about python?\u201d If you\u2019re running out of room and have a summary or objective statement, you can leave it off as those are much less common now. If you come from academia and have work experience, consider leaving off publications if they\u2019re not looking for a PhD and it\u2019s not a research position. Proofread : having typos or grammar errors in you\u2019re reSume can be the quickest way to have your aplication elimminated. Use spel-check and have a friend or too check it over. Don\u2019t include a picture : while this is common in some countries in Europe and South America, it is not appropriate in the US. Tailor your resume to the position : bigger companies often have automated resume-screening systems that check for keywords. Look in the job description to find those words; you can use a tool like TagCrowd to see which words are most common. For example, does it say leadership instead of management? Does it say NLP or natural language processing? Change your words to match theirs. Start your bullets with a verb : write \u201canalyzed 300 papers\u201d instead of \u201cI analyzed 300 papers.\u201d Quantify your accomplishments where possible : instead of saying \u201cran experiments on our ranking algorithm\u201d, write \u201cran more than 60 experiments that led to $2.3 million in additional revenue.\u201d Write a cover letter : if there is a place to submit a cover letter, do so. Some companies will eliminate candidates if they haven\u2019t written one. Just like your resume, you can have a master cover letter that you pull paragraphs from. Tailor at least the first and closing paragraph to the company and make sure you get their name correct! The more specific you can be, the better; show you\u2019ve done your research on the company and have specific reasons why you\u2019re interested in this position. Try to find the hiring manager\u2019s name (see here ) so you can address the letter to them instead of a \u201cDear Hiring Manager.\u201d If you want more guidance on writing a good letter, these articles of 31 tips and 5 common phrases to avoid are great places to start. data science hiring PSA: some advice out there says that cover letters don't matter, so just slap a new file name on your resume and label it a cover letter, or write a single sentence that says \"this is my cover letter.\" this is bad advice. \u2014 Jesse Maegan (@kierisi) May 7, 2018 Interviewing Prepare and practice : there are two main types of questions you\u2019ll be asked- technical and behavioral. For behavioral questions such as \u201ctell me about a time you had a conflict with a team member\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s your greatest strength,\u201d tell a story using the situation-behavior-outcome model: describe the situation you faced, how you handled it, and the result. Try to keep your answers short but comprehensive. It\u2019s worth keeping a list of these examples and thinking about which ones most show case the experiences and traits most relevant to the specific job you\u2019re interviewing for. For technical questions, you\u2019ll want to find out the interview structure. The structure of interviews and types of questions range widely: you may have to do a take-home, answer Computer Science questions (e.g. invert a binary tree), explain random forests, give a presentation, write SQL code, etc. It\u2019s very helpful to know ahead of time what to expect. Check out Glassdoor for reviews of the interview process and ask your network if anyone\u2019s interviewed there. You can also ask HR in your initial phone screen what to expect. If you\u2019re coming in for multiple interviews, you can ask what topics will be covered in each and what the structure will be (e.g. \u201cWill I be doing any whiteboard coding?\u201d). Once you know, you can focus your preparation there. If you\u2019re stumped on a problem, consider saying, \u201cI am not sure, but this is how I would go about solving it.\u201d Often, you\u2019re evaluated on how you work through the problem, not whether you get the correct answer. For more tips, check out Trey Causey\u2019s post on his experience in the data science job market, Erin Shellman\u2019s guide to landing a data science job, and Mikhail Popov\u2019s post on Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s process for fulfilling a data analyst position. Anything on your resume is fair game : if you have an internship from six years ago on your resume or list AWS as a skill, be prepared to be asked a question about it. Research the company : you should have done some when writing your cover letter, but once you get the interview, dig a little deeper. In addition to the tips in the thread below, find out about your interviewers\u2019 professional accomplishments. I was very impressed when a candidate I was interviewing asked some technical questions about a presentation I had given. Especially if you are interviewing at a startup, spend an hour doing your research. Here's the formula: 1) Crunchbase. Find out funding, investors, etc. 2) LinkedIn. Who works there? 3) Glassdoor. What do people say about the company? 4) Company web site. Read all you can stand. \u2014 Jensen Harris (@jensenharris) May 16, 2018 Have questions ready : each interviewer should leave time for questions at the end. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s a bad sign! Interviewing is a two-way matching process: you\u2019re evaluating them as much as they\u2019re evaluating you. If you don\u2019t know what to ask, check out Julia Evans\u2019 list . She splits them into categories such as quality of life, culture, and management practices; think about what matters most to you! You can ask each interviewer different questions to maximize how many you can get answered, but you could also try to ask multiple people the same questions to see if and how their answers differ. If it\u2019s a start-up, I highly recommend checking out this list of questions to ask. Never name a salary number : don\u2019t tell them either your current salary or your expectation for this one. In some places, including New York City and California, it is actually illegal for them to ask you your current salary. If you name a number, you risk them giving you a lower offer than they would have otherwise. Their offer should not depend on your current salary or expectations; it should be your worth in the market and similar to the salary of your peers there! If there\u2019s question on the application form, put \u201cNA\u201d or \u201cflexible;\u201d if forced to write a number, put 0 and add somewhere else \u201cNote: I entered $0 on the salary question because I am flexible on salary if we determine there is a mutual fit.\u201d If you\u2019re asked in an interview, redirect the conversation by saying something like, \u201cBefore discussing salary, I\u2019d like to learn more about the position and focus on what value I can bring to the company. I\u2019m sure if it\u2019s a good fit we can reach an agreement on a competitive overall package.\u201d If it\u2019s about your current salary and you\u2019re in a different job type/industry with a lower salary, you can say something like, \u201cSince this position is a large change from my current job, let\u2019s discuss what my responsibilities at this company will be and work together at the end of the process to determine a fair salary for this position.\u201d If they insist on knowing your expectation, give a large range based on research into what\u2019s standard in the industry and at that company. For example, you can say, \u201cFrom my research and past experience, my understanding is a base salary of $95k to $120k is standard, but I\u2019m most interested in the fit with the position and overall compensation package.\u201d You can look at the H1B visa data , Glassdoor , and paysa to give yourself a ballpark. And talk to friends! Knowledge is power. Some friendly folks will also do a salary information exchange: while I'm on it, my DMs are always open if you want to send me your salary. especially if you work in data, work in Toronto, or work in a \"technical\" role with 0-3 years of experience. if you're an URM, I'll tell you mine too. knowledge is power \ud83d\udcaa \u2014 Sharla Gelfand (@sharlagelfand) April 15, 2018 Handle rejection gracefully : you will almost inevitably get rejected from jobs, maybe dozens of them. Data science is a competitive field, and this is a very normal process that everyone goes through. If they give you the rejection (versus just never hearing back), you can express your disappointment politely (e.g. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u201d) and thank them for their consideration. You can ask for feedback, but know that many hiring managers won\u2019t be able to give you any because they want to avoid the possibility of being sued if a comment is interpreted as discriminatory. While it\u2019s okay to take a little time to wallow, don\u2019t lash out in public or to the hiring manager. It won\u2019t help the situation, but it will hurt your professional reputation. one of the things that should go without saying, but here we are, is that it's important to handle rejection gracefully. data science positions can be highly competitive. having a public meltdown and/or sending the hiring manager nasty/demanding emails is... bad. \u2014 Jesse Maegan (@kierisi) May 29, 2018 Offer Stage Initial response For the initial offer, you may get a phone call, an email with the details, or an email asking for time to go over the offer by phone. In all cases, make sure you express your excitement and gratitude for the opportunity. Don\u2019t accept right away: get the full offer in writing, say you need to review it, and ask if you can reconnect in a few days. This sets the stage for negotiating and gives you time if you\u2019re considering other offers. If you need more information (e.g. starting date possibilities, health insurance information), you should ask for it before your second conversation so you can have the full picture. Juggling multiple options Unfortunately, you probably won\u2019t get offers (or rejections) from all the companies you\u2019re interested in at once. More likely, when you get an offer, you might be in the final round for another company, just finished with the phone screen in another, and waiting to hear back from others. What if one of the ones you\u2019re waiting on is your \u201cdream job\u201d? If you\u2019re in or very close to the final round with a company, tell them about your other option. Reiterate how interested you are in their company (and if they\u2019re your first choice, tell them!), but explain that you\u2019re received another offer and would appreciate if they would be able to give you a decision by X date. Recruiters understand that you\u2019re likely to be interviewing with other companies and deal with this situation all the time. If you\u2019re very early in the other process, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to speed it along enough to have an offer in time, and you may need to decide whether to accept the offer without knowing your other options. Negotiating Even if the offer is more than you expected or it would be a big increase from your current job, you should negotiate. Tech companies expect you to negotiate. You can almost always get at least another $5k or a 5% increase in base salary and very likely more depending on the company and original offer. You could also ask for a signing bonus or more stock options. Remember that it\u2019s not selfish or greedy to negotiate: Other thoughts: it's not about the salary you make now. It's about the salaries of your peers at the new place. It may be a large bump for you now, but once you're hired you'll be doing the same work for less pay. \u2014 bletchley punk (@alicegoldfuss) May 2, 2018 Also think about the non-monetary benefits you\u2019re interested in. For example, maybe you want to be able to work from home one day a week. Maybe you want them to cover the cost of two conferences a year. If it\u2019s a smaller company, you can ask for a different job title. How much you can negotiate for depends on your bargaining position and the company. A non-profit will probably have less room on salary. If you have another offer or you\u2019re well compensated in your current job, you have a strong alternative. If you have a rare skill that they recruited you for or the role has been open for a long time, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to find someone else. You should do your research on the salary websites mentioned above so you can explain why you\u2019re asking for the numbers you are. Aim high so you have room to compromise and give a number, not a range - if you say you\u2019re looking for between a 5k and 10k increase, they\u2019ll probably give you the 5k. Reiterate why you\u2019re excited about the company and position and how you bring X, Y, Z to the table. Finally, start the conversation with the set of things you\u2019re interested in instead of raising and settling one issue after another. This way, they\u2019ll both feel they have the picture of what you want and you can do compromises among issues (e.g. you might accept a $5k base salary increase and $5k signing bonus instead of a $10k base salary increase). I highly recommend reading more about how to negotiate well; this comprehensive two-part post by Haseeb Qureshi on his 10 rules for negotiating (with many specific examples from his own successful tech job search) is an excellent place to start. I also like these HBR articles on 15 rules for negotiating an offer and on advice for women (who unfortunately need to sometimes modify negotiation tactics). It is very , very , very rare for a company to pull an offer because you negotiated. If they do, you do not want to work there. One caveat: if you\u2019re negotiating and you get everything you ask for, the company expects you to accept! You of course don\u2019t have to, but you shouldn\u2019t be stringing along a company you\u2019re not serious about. And knowing you\u2019ll accept also allows you to say the magic words, \u201cIf we can get to X, Y, and Z, I would be thrilled to accept the offer.\u201d Conclusion Job hunting is stressful, especially if you\u2019re working full-time and/or looking to change industries. I hope this post has given you a good starting point for understanding the hiring process in data science, what mistakes to avoid, and what strategies you can leverage in the process. If you\u2019re still looking more, this is an incredibly comprehensive guide from Favio Vazquez , which includes his own thoughts and links to dozens of resources. As I said at the start, feedback and additions to this post are very welcome!

href=\"https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440\">write a blog post</a> when you\u2019ve given the same advice three times, this post is a collection of my thoughts and recommendations for people interested in applying to data science jobs in the US. Many of these principles also apply to tech jobs in general.</p>\n<p>A disclaimer: I have never worked as a recruiter or career coach. This knowledge comes from mainly from my study of Organizational Behavior (including negotiations and women in tech) in graduate school and my own career. This advice also will not fit every single situation. The people who will benefit the most from this post are probably those who are applying for their first data science job and/or are in or recently out of school. If there\u2019s another tip or a caveat I should add, send me a note on twitter!</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-to\">Jump to:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#application\">Application</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#online-presence\">Online Presence</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#finding-and-evaluating-jobs\">Finding and Evaluating Jobs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#resume-and-cover-letter\">Resume and Cover Letter</a></li>\n</ol>\n<li><a href=\"#interviewing\">Interviewing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#offer-stage\">Offer Stage</a>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#initial-response\">Initial response</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#juggling-multiple-options\">Juggling multiple options</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#negotiating\">Negotiating</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li></li></ol>\n<h3 id=\"application\">Application</h3>\n<h4 id=\"online-presence\">Online Presence</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-62362\" height=\"173\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/best-job-small.jpg\" width=\"250\"/></p>\n<p>Take stock of your online presence. Check your privacy settings on Facebook or any other social media you use to make sure you\u2019ve limited what\u2019s available publicly. While many online job applications now have places for twitter handles, don\u2019t include yours unless you use it mainly in a professional manner (e.g. tweeting about data science resources or pets. Pets are always appropriate).</p>\n<p>If you have a GitHub, pin the repos you want people to see and add READMEs that explain what the project is. I also strongly recommend creating a blog to write about data science, whether it\u2019s projects you\u2019ve worked on, an explanation of a machine learning method, or a summary of a conference you attended. If you need more convincing that blogging is a great use of your time, check out <a href=\"http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/\">this post</a> by Dave Robinson on the subject. If you program in R, you can use blogdown to create a website.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.emilyzabor.com/\">Emily Zabor</a> has written a <a href=\"http://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html\">great tutorial</a> for this; find more blogdown resources in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dataandme\">Mara Averick\u2019s</a> <a href=\"https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/10/keeping-up-with-blogdown/\">extensive list</a>.

These include: product analyst, data analyst, research scientist, quantitative analyst, and machine learning engineer. Different companies use different names for similar roles and some are changing what their titles mean (see <a href=\"https://eng.lyft.com/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c\">Lyft\u2019s post</a> on their recent shift of data analyst to data scientist and data scientist to research scientist). Even the definition of what separates a data analyst from a data scientist is not agreed upon (see this <a href=\"https://mpopov.com/blog/2018/5/24/data-analyst-vs-data-scientist-industry-perspectives\">recent post</a> by Mikhail Popov summarizing different perspectives). Try searching for all of these terms to find positions and then use the description to evaluate the fit. If you\u2019re interested in start-ups, <a href=\"https://angel.co/\">Angelist</a> has thousands of positions, many of which list a salary range.</li>\n<li><strong>Do some self-reflection</strong>: rather than applying to every type of data science job you find, think about where you want to specialize. A distinction I\u2019ve found helpful when thinking of my own career and looking at jobs is the <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-data-science/answer/Michael-Hochster\">Type A vs. Type B data scientist</a>. \u201cA\u201d stands for analysis: type A data scientists have strong statistics skill and the ability to work with messy data and communicate results. \u201cB\u201d stands for build: type B data scientists have very strong coding skills, maybe have a background in software engineering, and focus on putting machine learning models, such as recommendation systems, into production. Also consider what data stage you want your company to be in (see discussion in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rchang/my-two-year-journey-as-a-data-scientist-at-twitter-f0c13298aee6\">Robert Chang\u2019s post</a>). An advantage of working at a smaller company is you can try different parts of data science; big companies are more specialized, so you may not be able to try both creating a lifetime value model and tuning a recommendation system, and many problems, like data engineering, are abstracted away. On the other hand, at smaller companies you\u2019ll usually need to deal more with data quality problems, poor documentation, and slow query processing. While data stage is correlated with company size, a big company that\u2019s been around for 100 years may not have data science maturity.</li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t demand perfection</strong>: your first job in the field probably won\u2019t be your dream one. It\u2019s easier to transition within your field or bring data science into your current role; even if you\u2019re looking to eventually leave your domain, you may need to start out by moving to a position where you can leverage your other skills. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have certain requirements and preferences (see above), but it does mean you\u2019ll want to have some flexibility. It\u2019s very normal to switch jobs in tech even after just a year or two, so you\u2019re not signing yourself up for the next 15 years. To me, the most important criteria for my first job was that it was a supportive environment, with lots of other analyst, where I could learn a lot. And as Jonathan Nolis points out, you can\u2019t know exactly what you want before you\u2019re even in the field and you\u2019ll learn even from bad jobs, so don\u2019t stress too much:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Early in my career I spent a lot of emotional effort trying to figure out which job was \u201cright\u201d for me and what exactly I needed, but now I realize that even my bad jobs were good experiences to learn what\u2019s important to me. 2/</p>\n<p>\u2014 Jonathan Nolis (@skyetetra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skyetetra/status/1001470670390243330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 29, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script><br>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-54256\" height=\"205\" sizes=\"(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-mean-small.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-mean-small.jpg 203w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-mean-small-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-mean-small-120x120.jpg 120w\" width=\"203\"/></br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t undersell yourself</strong>: job descriptions are generally wishlists with some flexibility. If you meet 80% of the requirements (e.g. you\u2019re a year short of their required work experience or haven\u2019t worked with one component of their tech stack), but are otherwise a good fit, you should still apply. With that said, be wary of job descriptions that describe a unicorn - a PhD in Computer Science who\u2019s also worked for 5+ years as a data scientist and is an expert in cutting-edge statistics, deep learning, and communicating with business partners - and lists a huge range of responsibilities, running from doing production-level machine learning to creating dashboards to running A/B tests. It usually means they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for and they expect a data scientist to come and solve all their problems without any support.</li>\n<li><strong>Look for connections on LinkedIn</strong>: check if you know anyone at the company you\u2019re interested in. If you don\u2019t know anyone, see if there\u2019s anyone in your alumni networks (bootcamp, college, that kickball team you joined one summer). You can also check for second connections and see if the person who bridges you can introduce you. Many jobs get hundreds if not thousands of applications for each position and having someone refer you or give you feedback on what the team is looking for is enormously helpful. If you do reach out, take the time to tailor the message: if you don\u2019t know the person, do your research and reference their background or public work.</li>\n<li><strong>Check out meetups and conferences</strong>: sometimes hiring managers will come to meetups or conferences to recruit. You may also meet someone in the company or sub-industry you\u2019re interested in. You can ask if they have time for an <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/3-steps-to-a-perfect-informational-interview\">informational interview</a> so you can learn more about their field. If you ask if their company has an opening or if they can refer you, though, you\u2019ll probably be directed to the company\u2019s career page. This is why it\u2019s important to build your network before you need it - starting off with a strong ask is not a great way to build a mutually fulfilling relationship.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out my previous posts about <a href=\"http://hookedondata.org/Building-Your-Data-Science-Network-Finding-Community/\">finding community</a> and <a href=\"http://hookedondata.org/Building-Your-Data-Science-Network-Reaching-Out/\">reaching out</a> if you\u2019re interested to read more about how you can build your network.</p>\n<h4 id=\"resume-and-cover-letter\">Resume and Cover Letter</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep your resume to one page</strong>: you don\u2019t have to list everything you\u2019ve ever done. Try making a master resume which has all of your work history and then pull what\u2019s most relevant for each job. Don\u2019t put a laundry list of every technology you\u2019ve ever used; focus on the ones that you\u2019ll be comfortable talking about. A tip from a recruiter: \u201cdon\u2019t use graphs showing how experienced you are in certain technologies. If you have python being a full bar, do you actually know 100% of what there is to know about python?\u201d If you\u2019re running out of room and have a summary or objective statement, you can leave it off as those are much less common now. If you come from academia and have work experience, consider leaving off publications if they\u2019re not looking for a PhD and it\u2019s not a research position.</li>\n<li><strong>Proofread</strong>: having typos or grammar errors in you\u2019re reSume can be the quickest way to have your aplication elimminated. Use spel-check and have a friend or too check it over.</li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t include a picture</strong>: while this is common in some countries in Europe and South America, it is not appropriate in the US.</li>\n<li><strong>Tailor your resume to the position</strong>: bigger companies often have automated resume-screening systems that check for keywords. Look in the job description to find those words; you can use a tool like <a href=\"https://tagcrowd.com/\">TagCrowd</a> to see which words are most common. For example, does it say leadership instead of management? Does it say NLP or natural language processing? Change your words to match theirs.</li>\n<li><strong>Start your bullets with a verb</strong>: write \u201canalyzed 300 papers\u201d instead of \u201cI analyzed 300 papers.\u201d</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-quantify-your-resume-bullets-when-you-dont-work-with-numbers\">Quantify</a> your accomplishments where possible</strong>: instead of saying \u201cran experiments on our ranking algorithm\u201d, write \u201cran more than 60 experiments that led to $2.3 million in additional revenue.\u201d</li>\n<li><strong>Write a cover letter</strong>: if there is a place to submit a cover letter, do so. Some companies will eliminate candidates if they haven\u2019t written one. Just like your resume, you can have a master cover letter that you pull paragraphs from. Tailor at least the first and closing paragraph to the company and make sure you get their name correct! The more specific you can be, the better; show you\u2019ve done your research on the company and have specific reasons why you\u2019re interested in this position. Try to find the hiring manager\u2019s name (see <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-3-rules-of-addressing-your-cover-letter\">here</a>) so you can address the letter to them instead of a \u201cDear Hiring Manager.\u201d If you want more guidance on writing a good letter, these articles of <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-write-a-cover-letter-31-tips-you-need-to-know\">31 tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-common-cover-letter-phrases-that-are-losing-you-the-job\">5 common phrases to avoid</a> are great places to start.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">data science hiring PSA:</p>\n<p>some advice out there says that cover letters don't matter, so just slap a new file name on your resume and label it a cover letter, or write a single sentence that says \"this is my cover letter.\"</p>\n<p>this is bad advice.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Jesse Maegan (@kierisi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/993495072174899200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>\n<h3 id=\"interviewing\">Interviewing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prepare and practice</strong>: there are two main types of questions you\u2019ll be asked- technical and behavioral. For behavioral questions such as \u201ctell me about a time you had a conflict with a team member\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s your greatest strength,\u201d tell a story using the situation-behavior-outcome model: describe the situation you faced, how you handled it, and the result. Try to keep your answers short but comprehensive. It\u2019s worth keeping a list of these examples and thinking about which ones most show case the experiences and traits most relevant to the specific job you\u2019re interviewing for. For technical questions, you\u2019ll want to find out the interview structure. The structure of interviews and types of questions range widely: you may have to do a take-home, answer Computer Science questions (e.g. invert a binary tree), explain random forests, give a presentation, write SQL code, etc. It\u2019s very helpful to know ahead of time what to expect. Check out Glassdoor for reviews of the interview process and ask your network if anyone\u2019s interviewed there. You can also ask HR in your initial phone screen what to expect. If you\u2019re coming in for multiple interviews, you can ask what topics will be covered in each and what the structure will be (e.g. \u201cWill I be doing any whiteboard coding?\u201d). Once you know, you can focus your preparation there. If you\u2019re stumped on a problem, consider saying, \u201cI am not sure, but this is how I would go about solving it.\u201d Often, you\u2019re evaluated on how you work through the problem, not whether you get the correct answer. For more tips, check out <a href=\"http://treycausey.com/data_science_interviews.html\">Trey Causey\u2019s post</a> on his experience in the data science job market, <a href=\"http://www.erinshellman.com/crushed-it-landing-a-data-science-job/\">Erin Shellman\u2019s guide</a> to landing a data science job, and <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/02/02/hiring-data-scientist/\">Mikhail Popov\u2019s post</a> on Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s process for fulfilling a data analyst position.</li>\n<li><strong>Anything on your resume is fair game</strong>: if you have an internship from six years ago on your resume or list AWS as a skill, be prepared to be asked a question about it.</li>\n<li><strong>Research the company</strong>: you should have done some when writing your cover letter, but once you get the interview, dig a little deeper. In addition to the tips in the thread below, find out about your interviewers\u2019 professional accomplishments. I was very impressed when a candidate I was interviewing asked some technical questions about a presentation I had given.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Especially if you are interviewing at a startup, spend an hour doing your research. Here's the formula:</p>\n<p>1) Crunchbase. Find out funding, investors, etc.<br>2) LinkedIn. Who works there?<br>3) Glassdoor. What do people say about the company?<br/>4) Company web site.

If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s a bad sign! Interviewing is a two-way matching process: you\u2019re evaluating them as much as they\u2019re evaluating you. If you don\u2019t know what to ask, check out <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/\">Julia Evans\u2019 list</a>. She splits them into categories such as quality of life, culture, and management practices; think about what matters most to you! You can ask each interviewer different questions to maximize how many you can get answered, but you could also try to ask multiple people the same questions to see if and how their answers differ. If it\u2019s a start-up, I highly recommend checking out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jensenharris/status/988967889330819072\">this list</a> of questions to ask.</li>\n<li><strong>Never name a salary number</strong>: don\u2019t tell them either your current salary or your expectation for this one. In some places, including New York City and California, it is actually illegal for them to ask you your current salary. If you name a number, you risk them giving you a lower offer than they would have otherwise. Their offer should not depend on your current salary or expectations; it should be your worth in the market and similar to the salary of your peers there! If there\u2019s question on the application form, put \u201cNA\u201d or \u201cflexible;\u201d if forced to write a number, put 0 and add somewhere else <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/answer-illegal-salary-question-right-way\">\u201cNote: I entered $0 on the salary question because I am flexible on salary if we determine there is a mutual fit.\u201d</a> If you\u2019re asked in an interview, redirect the conversation by saying something like, \u201cBefore discussing salary, I\u2019d like to learn more about the position and focus on what value I can bring to the company. I\u2019m sure if it\u2019s a good fit we can reach an agreement on a competitive overall package.\u201d If it\u2019s about your current salary and you\u2019re in a different job type/industry with a lower salary, you can say something like, <a href=\"https://biginterview.com/blog/2015/10/salary-expectations.html\">\u201cSince this position is a large change from my current job, let\u2019s discuss what my responsibilities at this company will be and work together at the end of the process to determine a fair salary for this position.\u201d</a> If they insist on knowing your expectation, give a large range based on research into what\u2019s standard in the industry and at that company. For example, you can say, \u201cFrom my research and past experience, my understanding is a base salary of $95k to $120k is standard, but I\u2019m most interested in the fit with the position and overall compensation package.\u201d You can look at the <a href=\"http://h1bdata.info/index.php\">H1B visa data</a>, <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/\">Glassdoor</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.paysa.com/salaries/\">paysa</a> to give yourself a ballpark. And talk to friends! Knowledge is power. Some friendly folks will also do a salary information exchange:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">while I'm on it, my DMs are always open if you want to send me your salary. especially if you work in data, work in Toronto, or work in a \"technical\" role with 0-3 years of experience. if you're an URM, I'll tell you mine too. knowledge is power \ud83d\udcaa</p>\n<p>\u2014 Sharla Gelfand (@sharlagelfand) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/985599731601723393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle rejection gracefully</strong>: you will almost inevitably get rejected from jobs, maybe dozens of them. Data science is a competitive field, and this is a very normal process that everyone goes through. If they give you the rejection (versus just never hearing back), you can express your disappointment politely (e.g. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u201d) and thank them for their consideration. You can ask for feedback, but know that many hiring managers won\u2019t be able to give you any because they want to avoid the possibility of being sued if a comment is interpreted as discriminatory. While it\u2019s okay to take a little time to wallow, don\u2019t lash out in public or to the hiring manager. It won\u2019t help the situation, but it will hurt your professional reputation.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">one of the things that should go without saying, but here we are, is that it's important to handle rejection gracefully. data science positions can be highly competitive. having a public meltdown and/or sending the hiring manager nasty/demanding emails is... bad.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Jesse Maegan (@kierisi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1001465251647369219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 29, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>\n<h3 id=\"offer-stage\">Offer Stage</h3>\n<h4 id=\"initial-response\">Initial response</h4>\n<p>For the initial offer, you may get a phone call, an email with the details, or an email asking for time to go over the offer by phone. In all cases, make sure you express your excitement and gratitude for the opportunity. Don\u2019t accept right away: get the full offer in writing, say you need to review it, and ask if you can reconnect in a few days. This sets the stage for negotiating and gives you time if you\u2019re considering other offers. If you need more information (e.g. starting date possibilities, health insurance information), you should ask for it before your second conversation so you can have the full picture.</p>\n<h4 id=\"juggling-multiple-options\">Juggling multiple options</h4>\n<p>Unfortunately, you probably won\u2019t get offers (or rejections) from all the companies you\u2019re interested in at once. More likely, when you get an offer, you might be in the final round for another company, just finished with the phone screen in another, and waiting to hear back from others. What if one of the ones you\u2019re waiting on is your \u201cdream job\u201d?</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in or very close to the final round with a company, tell them about your other option. Reiterate how interested you are in their company (and if they\u2019re your first choice, tell them!), but explain that you\u2019re received another offer and would appreciate if they would be able to give you a decision by X date. Recruiters understand that you\u2019re likely to be interviewing with other companies and deal with this situation all the time. If you\u2019re very early in the other process, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to speed it along enough to have an offer in time, and you may need to decide whether to accept the offer without knowing your other options.</p>\n<h4 id=\"negotiating\">Negotiating</h4>\n<p>Even if the offer is more than you expected or it would be a big increase from your current job, you should negotiate. Tech companies <strong>expect</strong> you to negotiate. You can almost always get at least another $5k or a 5% increase in base salary and very likely more depending on the company and original offer. You could also ask for a signing bonus or more stock options. Remember that it\u2019s not selfish or greedy to negotiate:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Other thoughts: it's not about the salary you make now. It's about the salaries of your peers at the new place.

For example, maybe you want to be able to work from home one day a week. Maybe you want them to cover the cost of two conferences a year. If it\u2019s a smaller company, you can ask for a different job title.</p>\n<p>How much you can negotiate for depends on your bargaining position and the company. A non-profit will probably have less room on salary. If you have another offer or you\u2019re well compensated in your current job, you have a strong alternative. If you have a rare skill that they recruited you for or the role has been open for a long time, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to find someone else. You should do your research on the salary websites mentioned above so you can explain why you\u2019re asking for the numbers you are. Aim high so you have room to compromise and give a number, not a range - if you say you\u2019re looking for between a 5k and 10k increase, they\u2019ll probably give you the 5k. Reiterate why you\u2019re excited about the company and position and how you bring X, Y, Z to the table. Finally, start the conversation with the set of things you\u2019re interested in instead of raising and settling one issue after another. This way, they\u2019ll both feel they have the picture of what you want and you can do compromises among issues (e.g. you might accept a $5k base salary increase and $5k signing bonus instead of a $10k base salary increase).</p>\n<p>I highly recommend reading more about how to negotiate well; this <a href=\"https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/\">comprehensive two-part post</a> by <a href=\"https://haseebq.com/\">Haseeb Qureshi</a> on his 10 rules for negotiating (with many specific examples from his own successful tech job search) is an excellent place to start. I also like these HBR articles on <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/04/15-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer\">15 rules for negotiating an offer</a> and on <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/06/why-women-dont-negotiate-their-job-offers\">advice for women</a> (who unfortunately need to sometimes modify negotiation tactics).</p>\n<p>It is <em>very</em>, <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> rare for a company to pull an offer because you negotiated. If they do, you do not want to work there.</p>\n<p>One caveat: if you\u2019re negotiating and you get everything you ask for, the company expects you to accept! You of course don\u2019t have to, but you shouldn\u2019t be stringing along a company you\u2019re not serious about. And knowing you\u2019ll accept also allows you to say the magic words, \u201cIf we can get to X, Y, and Z, I would be thrilled to accept the offer.\u201d</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Job hunting is stressful, especially if you\u2019re working full-time and/or looking to change industries.

Robinson\u2019s sage tweet to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440\">write a blog post</a> when you\u2019ve given the same advice three times, this post is a collection of my thoughts and recommendations for people interested in applying to data science jobs in the US. Many of these principles also apply to tech jobs in general.</p>\n<p>A disclaimer: I have never worked as a recruiter or career coach. This knowledge comes from mainly from my study of Organizational Behavior (including negotiations and women in tech) in graduate school and my own career. This advice also will not fit every single situation. The people who will benefit the most from this post are probably those who are applying for their first data science job and/or are in or recently out of school.

These include: product analyst, data analyst, research scientist, quantitative analyst, and machine learning engineer. Different companies use different names for similar roles and some are changing what their titles mean (see <a href=\"https://eng.lyft.com/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c\">Lyft\u2019s post</a> on their recent shift of data analyst to data scientist and data scientist to research scientist). Even the definition of what separates a data analyst from a data scientist is not agreed upon (see this <a href=\"https://mpopov.com/blog/2018/5/24/data-analyst-vs-data-scientist-industry-perspectives\">recent post</a> by Mikhail Popov summarizing different perspectives). Try searching for all of these terms to find positions and then use the description to evaluate the fit. If you\u2019re interested in start-ups, <a href=\"https://angel.co/\">Angelist</a> has thousands of positions, many of which list a salary range.</li>\n<li><strong>Do some self-reflection</strong>: rather than applying to every type of data science job you find, think about where you want to specialize. A distinction I\u2019ve found helpful when thinking of my own career and looking at jobs is the <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-data-science/answer/Michael-Hochster\">Type A vs. Type B data scientist</a>. \u201cA\u201d stands for analysis: type A data scientists have strong statistics skill and the ability to work with messy data and communicate results. \u201cB\u201d stands for build: type B data scientists have very strong coding skills, maybe have a background in software engineering, and focus on putting machine learning models, such as recommendation systems, into production. Also consider what data stage you want your company to be in (see discussion in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rchang/my-two-year-journey-as-a-data-scientist-at-twitter-f0c13298aee6\">Robert Chang\u2019s post</a>). An advantage of working at a smaller company is you can try different parts of data science; big companies are more specialized, so you may not be able to try both creating a lifetime value model and tuning a recommendation system, and many problems, like data engineering, are abstracted away. On the other hand, at smaller companies you\u2019ll usually need to deal more with data quality problems, poor documentation, and slow query processing. While data stage is correlated with company size, a big company that\u2019s been around for 100 years may not have data science maturity.</li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t demand perfection</strong>: your first job in the field probably won\u2019t be your dream one. It\u2019s easier to transition within your field or bring data science into your current role; even if you\u2019re looking to eventually leave your domain, you may need to start out by moving to a position where you can leverage your other skills. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have certain requirements and preferences (see above), but it does mean you\u2019ll want to have some flexibility. It\u2019s very normal to switch jobs in tech even after just a year or two, so you\u2019re not signing yourself up for the next 15 years. To me, the most important criteria for my first job was that it was a supportive environment, with lots of other analyst, where I could learn a lot. And as Jonathan Nolis points out, you can\u2019t know exactly what you want before you\u2019re even in the field and you\u2019ll learn even from bad jobs, so don\u2019t stress too much:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Early in my career I spent a lot of emotional effort trying to figure out which job was \u201cright\u201d for me and what exactly I needed, but now I realize that even my bad jobs were good experiences to learn what\u2019s important to me. 2/</p>\n<p>\u2014 Jonathan Nolis (@skyetetra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skyetetra/status/1001470670390243330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 29, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script><br>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-54256\" height=\"205\" sizes=\"(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-mean-small.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-mean-small.jpg 203w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-mean-small-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-mean-small-120x120.jpg 120w\" width=\"203\"/></br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t undersell yourself</strong>: job descriptions are generally wishlists with some flexibility. If you meet 80% of the requirements (e.g. you\u2019re a year short of their required work experience or haven\u2019t worked with one component of their tech stack), but are otherwise a good fit, you should still apply. With that said, be wary of job descriptions that describe a unicorn - a PhD in Computer Science who\u2019s also worked for 5+ years as a data scientist and is an expert in cutting-edge statistics, deep learning, and communicating with business partners - and lists a huge range of responsibilities, running from doing production-level machine learning to creating dashboards to running A/B tests. It usually means they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for and they expect a data scientist to come and solve all their problems without any support.</li>\n<li><strong>Look for connections on LinkedIn</strong>: check if you know anyone at the company you\u2019re interested in. If you don\u2019t know anyone, see if there\u2019s anyone in your alumni networks (bootcamp, college, that kickball team you joined one summer). You can also check for second connections and see if the person who bridges you can introduce you. Many jobs get hundreds if not thousands of applications for each position and having someone refer you or give you feedback on what the team is looking for is enormously helpful. If you do reach out, take the time to tailor the message: if you don\u2019t know the person, do your research and reference their background or public work.</li>\n<li><strong>Check out meetups and conferences</strong>: sometimes hiring managers will come to meetups or conferences to recruit. You may also meet someone in the company or sub-industry you\u2019re interested in. You can ask if they have time for an <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/3-steps-to-a-perfect-informational-interview\">informational interview</a> so you can learn more about their field. If you ask if their company has an opening or if they can refer you, though, you\u2019ll probably be directed to the company\u2019s career page. This is why it\u2019s important to build your network before you need it - starting off with a strong ask is not a great way to build a mutually fulfilling relationship.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out my previous posts about <a href=\"http://hookedondata.org/Building-Your-Data-Science-Network-Finding-Community/\">finding community</a> and <a href=\"http://hookedondata.org/Building-Your-Data-Science-Network-Reaching-Out/\">reaching out</a> if you\u2019re interested to read more about how you can build your network.</p>\n<h4 id=\"resume-and-cover-letter\">Resume and Cover Letter</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep your resume to one page</strong>: you don\u2019t have to list everything you\u2019ve ever done. Try making a master resume which has all of your work history and then pull what\u2019s most relevant for each job. Don\u2019t put a laundry list of every technology you\u2019ve ever used; focus on the ones that you\u2019ll be comfortable talking about. A tip from a recruiter: \u201cdon\u2019t use graphs showing how experienced you are in certain technologies. If you have python being a full bar, do you actually know 100% of what there is to know about python?\u201d If you\u2019re running out of room and have a summary or objective statement, you can leave it off as those are much less common now. If you come from academia and have work experience, consider leaving off publications if they\u2019re not looking for a PhD and it\u2019s not a research position.</li>\n<li><strong>Proofread</strong>: having typos or grammar errors in you\u2019re reSume can be the quickest way to have your aplication elimminated. Use spel-check and have a friend or too check it over.</li>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t include a picture</strong>: while this is common in some countries in Europe and South America, it is not appropriate in the US.</li>\n<li><strong>Tailor your resume to the position</strong>: bigger companies often have automated resume-screening systems that check for keywords. Look in the job description to find those words; you can use a tool like <a href=\"https://tagcrowd.com/\">TagCrowd</a> to see which words are most common. For example, does it say leadership instead of management? Does it say NLP or natural language processing? Change your words to match theirs.</li>\n<li><strong>Start your bullets with a verb</strong>: write \u201canalyzed 300 papers\u201d instead of \u201cI analyzed 300 papers.\u201d</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-quantify-your-resume-bullets-when-you-dont-work-with-numbers\">Quantify</a> your accomplishments where possible</strong>: instead of saying \u201cran experiments on our ranking algorithm\u201d, write \u201cran more than 60 experiments that led to $2.3 million in additional revenue.\u201d</li>\n<li><strong>Write a cover letter</strong>: if there is a place to submit a cover letter, do so. Some companies will eliminate candidates if they haven\u2019t written one. Just like your resume, you can have a master cover letter that you pull paragraphs from. Tailor at least the first and closing paragraph to the company and make sure you get their name correct! The more specific you can be, the better; show you\u2019ve done your research on the company and have specific reasons why you\u2019re interested in this position. Try to find the hiring manager\u2019s name (see <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-3-rules-of-addressing-your-cover-letter\">here</a>) so you can address the letter to them instead of a \u201cDear Hiring Manager.\u201d If you want more guidance on writing a good letter, these articles of <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-write-a-cover-letter-31-tips-you-need-to-know\">31 tips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-common-cover-letter-phrases-that-are-losing-you-the-job\">5 common phrases to avoid</a> are great places to start.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">data science hiring PSA:</p>\n<p>some advice out there says that cover letters don't matter, so just slap a new file name on your resume and label it a cover letter, or write a single sentence that says \"this is my cover letter.\"</p>\n<p>this is bad advice.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Jesse Maegan (@kierisi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/993495072174899200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>\n<h3 id=\"interviewing\">Interviewing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prepare and practice</strong>: there are two main types of questions you\u2019ll be asked- technical and behavioral. For behavioral questions such as \u201ctell me about a time you had a conflict with a team member\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s your greatest strength,\u201d tell a story using the situation-behavior-outcome model: describe the situation you faced, how you handled it, and the result. Try to keep your answers short but comprehensive. It\u2019s worth keeping a list of these examples and thinking about which ones most show case the experiences and traits most relevant to the specific job you\u2019re interviewing for. For technical questions, you\u2019ll want to find out the interview structure. The structure of interviews and types of questions range widely: you may have to do a take-home, answer Computer Science questions (e.g. invert a binary tree), explain random forests, give a presentation, write SQL code, etc. It\u2019s very helpful to know ahead of time what to expect. Check out Glassdoor for reviews of the interview process and ask your network if anyone\u2019s interviewed there. You can also ask HR in your initial phone screen what to expect. If you\u2019re coming in for multiple interviews, you can ask what topics will be covered in each and what the structure will be (e.g. \u201cWill I be doing any whiteboard coding?\u201d). Once you know, you can focus your preparation there. If you\u2019re stumped on a problem, consider saying, \u201cI am not sure, but this is how I would go about solving it.\u201d Often, you\u2019re evaluated on how you work through the problem, not whether you get the correct answer. For more tips, check out <a href=\"http://treycausey.com/data_science_interviews.html\">Trey Causey\u2019s post</a> on his experience in the data science job market, <a href=\"http://www.erinshellman.com/crushed-it-landing-a-data-science-job/\">Erin Shellman\u2019s guide</a> to landing a data science job, and <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/02/02/hiring-data-scientist/\">Mikhail Popov\u2019s post</a> on Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s process for fulfilling a data analyst position.</li>\n<li><strong>Anything on your resume is fair game</strong>: if you have an internship from six years ago on your resume or list AWS as a skill, be prepared to be asked a question about it.</li>\n<li><strong>Research the company</strong>: you should have done some when writing your cover letter, but once you get the interview, dig a little deeper. In addition to the tips in the thread below, find out about your interviewers\u2019 professional accomplishments. I was very impressed when a candidate I was interviewing asked some technical questions about a presentation I had given.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Especially if you are interviewing at a startup, spend an hour doing your research.

If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s a bad sign! Interviewing is a two-way matching process: you\u2019re evaluating them as much as they\u2019re evaluating you. If you don\u2019t know what to ask, check out <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/\">Julia Evans\u2019 list</a>. She splits them into categories such as quality of life, culture, and management practices; think about what matters most to you! You can ask each interviewer different questions to maximize how many you can get answered, but you could also try to ask multiple people the same questions to see if and how their answers differ. If it\u2019s a start-up, I highly recommend checking out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jensenharris/status/988967889330819072\">this list</a> of questions to ask.</li>\n<li><strong>Never name a salary number</strong>: don\u2019t tell them either your current salary or your expectation for this one. In some places, including New York City and California, it is actually illegal for them to ask you your current salary. If you name a number, you risk them giving you a lower offer than they would have otherwise. Their offer should not depend on your current salary or expectations; it should be your worth in the market and similar to the salary of your peers there! If there\u2019s question on the application form, put \u201cNA\u201d or \u201cflexible;\u201d if forced to write a number, put 0 and add somewhere else <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/answer-illegal-salary-question-right-way\">\u201cNote: I entered $0 on the salary question because I am flexible on salary if we determine there is a mutual fit.\u201d</a> If you\u2019re asked in an interview, redirect the conversation by saying something like, \u201cBefore discussing salary, I\u2019d like to learn more about the position and focus on what value I can bring to the company. I\u2019m sure if it\u2019s a good fit we can reach an agreement on a competitive overall package.\u201d If it\u2019s about your current salary and you\u2019re in a different job type/industry with a lower salary, you can say something like, <a href=\"https://biginterview.com/blog/2015/10/salary-expectations.html\">\u201cSince this position is a large change from my current job, let\u2019s discuss what my responsibilities at this company will be and work together at the end of the process to determine a fair salary for this position.\u201d</a> If they insist on knowing your expectation, give a large range based on research into what\u2019s standard in the industry and at that company. For example, you can say, \u201cFrom my research and past experience, my understanding is a base salary of $95k to $120k is standard, but I\u2019m most interested in the fit with the position and overall compensation package.\u201d You can look at the <a href=\"http://h1bdata.info/index.php\">H1B visa data</a>, <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/\">Glassdoor</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.paysa.com/salaries/\">paysa</a> to give yourself a ballpark. And talk to friends! Knowledge is power. Some friendly folks will also do a salary information exchange:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">while I'm on it, my DMs are always open if you want to send me your salary. especially if you work in data, work in Toronto, or work in a \"technical\" role with 0-3 years of experience. if you're an URM, I'll tell you mine too. knowledge is power \ud83d\udcaa</p>\n<p>\u2014 Sharla Gelfand (@sharlagelfand) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/985599731601723393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Handle rejection gracefully</strong>: you will almost inevitably get rejected from jobs, maybe dozens of them. Data science is a competitive field, and this is a very normal process that everyone goes through. If they give you the rejection (versus just never hearing back), you can express your disappointment politely (e.g. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u201d) and thank them for their consideration. You can ask for feedback, but know that many hiring managers won\u2019t be able to give you any because they want to avoid the possibility of being sued if a comment is interpreted as discriminatory. While it\u2019s okay to take a little time to wallow, don\u2019t lash out in public or to the hiring manager. It won\u2019t help the situation, but it will hurt your professional reputation.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">one of the things that should go without saying, but here we are, is that it's important to handle rejection gracefully. data science positions can be highly competitive. having a public meltdown and/or sending the hiring manager nasty/demanding emails is... bad.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Jesse Maegan (@kierisi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1001465251647369219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 29, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>\n<h3 id=\"offer-stage\">Offer Stage</h3>\n<h4 id=\"initial-response\">Initial response</h4>\n<p>For the initial offer, you may get a phone call, an email with the details, or an email asking for time to go over the offer by phone. In all cases, make sure you express your excitement and gratitude for the opportunity. Don\u2019t accept right away: get the full offer in writing, say you need to review it, and ask if you can reconnect in a few days. This sets the stage for negotiating and gives you time if you\u2019re considering other offers. If you need more information (e.g. starting date possibilities, health insurance information), you should ask for it before your second conversation so you can have the full picture.</p>\n<h4 id=\"juggling-multiple-options\">Juggling multiple options</h4>\n<p>Unfortunately, you probably won\u2019t get offers (or rejections) from all the companies you\u2019re interested in at once. More likely, when you get an offer, you might be in the final round for another company, just finished with the phone screen in another, and waiting to hear back from others. What if one of the ones you\u2019re waiting on is your \u201cdream job\u201d?</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in or very close to the final round with a company, tell them about your other option. Reiterate how interested you are in their company (and if they\u2019re your first choice, tell them!), but explain that you\u2019re received another offer and would appreciate if they would be able to give you a decision by X date. Recruiters understand that you\u2019re likely to be interviewing with other companies and deal with this situation all the time. If you\u2019re very early in the other process, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to speed it along enough to have an offer in time, and you may need to decide whether to accept the offer without knowing your other options.</p>\n<h4 id=\"negotiating\">Negotiating</h4>\n<p>Even if the offer is more than you expected or it would be a big increase from your current job, you should negotiate. Tech companies <strong>expect</strong> you to negotiate. You can almost always get at least another $5k or a 5% increase in base salary and very likely more depending on the company and original offer. You could also ask for a signing bonus or more stock options. Remember that it\u2019s not selfish or greedy to negotiate:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Other thoughts: it's not about the salary you make now. It's about the salaries of your peers at the new place.

For example, maybe you want to be able to work from home one day a week. Maybe you want them to cover the cost of two conferences a year. If it\u2019s a smaller company, you can ask for a different job title.</p>\n<p>How much you can negotiate for depends on your bargaining position and the company. A non-profit will probably have less room on salary. If you have another offer or you\u2019re well compensated in your current job, you have a strong alternative. If you have a rare skill that they recruited you for or the role has been open for a long time, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to find someone else. You should do your research on the salary websites mentioned above so you can explain why you\u2019re asking for the numbers you are. Aim high so you have room to compromise and give a number, not a range - if you say you\u2019re looking for between a 5k and 10k increase, they\u2019ll probably give you the 5k. Reiterate why you\u2019re excited about the company and position and how you bring X, Y, Z to the table. Finally, start the conversation with the set of things you\u2019re interested in instead of raising and settling one issue after another. This way, they\u2019ll both feel they have the picture of what you want and you can do compromises among issues (e.g. you might accept a $5k base salary increase and $5k signing bonus instead of a $10k base salary increase).</p>\n<p>I highly recommend reading more about how to negotiate well; this <a href=\"https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/\">comprehensive two-part post</a> by <a href=\"https://haseebq.com/\">Haseeb Qureshi</a> on his 10 rules for negotiating (with many specific examples from his own successful tech job search) is an excellent place to start. I also like these HBR articles on <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/04/15-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer\">15 rules for negotiating an offer</a> and on <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/06/why-women-dont-negotiate-their-job-offers\">advice for women</a> (who unfortunately need to sometimes modify negotiation tactics).</p>\n<p>It is <em>very</em>, <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> rare for a company to pull an offer because you negotiated. If they do, you do not want to work there.</p>\n<p>One caveat: if you\u2019re negotiating and you get everything you ask for, the company expects you to accept! You of course don\u2019t have to, but you shouldn\u2019t be stringing along a company you\u2019re not serious about. And knowing you\u2019ll accept also allows you to say the magic words, \u201cIf we can get to X, Y, and Z, I would be thrilled to accept the offer.\u201d</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Job hunting is stressful, especially if you\u2019re working full-time and/or looking to change industries. I hope this post has given you a good starting point for understanding the hiring process in data science, what mistakes to avoid, and what strategies you can leverage in the process. If you\u2019re still looking more, this is an <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-two-sides-of-getting-a-job-as-a-data-scientist-a4571acc58bc\">incredibly comprehensive guide</a> from <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/@faviovazquez\">Favio Vazquez</a>, which includes his own thoughts and links to dozens of resources.</p>\n<p>As I said at the start, feedback and additions to this post are very welcome!

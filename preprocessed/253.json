selected blog posts and op-eds.  I've narrowed it down to a mere (!) 150 posts, in seven broad categories, and I'd love your input in helping me narrow it down more.\n\n<p>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LJ8HJ3C\">moral psychology</a> (poll went live March 16)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NSY9M3D\">technology (live as of today)</a></li>\n<li>belief, desire, and self-knowledge</li>\n<li>culture and humor</li>\n<li>cosmology, skepticism, and weird minds</li>\n<li>consciousness</li>\n<li>metaphilosophy and sociology of philosophy</li><p>\n\nEvery week I'll post a poll with about twenty posts or op-eds to rate, on one of those seven themes.  No need to rate all twenty!  Just rate any posts or op-eds you remember.  Each poll will also contain links to the original posts and op-eds so you can refresh your memory if you want.<p>\n\nIt would be a great help if you could answer some of these polls -- if only just to click \"a favorite\" next to a few you remember fondly.  I will take this input seriously in selecting what to include in the book.<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NSY9M3D\">Today's poll, 17 selected posts on philosophy of technology</a>.<p>\n\nTake the poll, and share widely!<p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3rri18TyZ2s/WrEizMuN1SI/AAAAAAAAAuU/Mm1GvXKNgEwXyIuyjjuh_26JwW1OjkGRQCLcBGAs/s1600/RodinRobot.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1022\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3rri18TyZ2s/WrEizMuN1SI/AAAAAAAAAuU/Mm1GvXKNgEwXyIuyjjuh_26JwW1OjkGRQCLcBGAs/s400/RodinRobot.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></div>\n<p>\n[<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/si-mocs/24011702280\">image source</a>]\n\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/help-me-choose-posts-for-my-next-book_20.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-03-20T08:05:00-07:00\">8:05 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4949110430235532465\" onclick=\"\">2\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/announcements\" rel=\"tag\">announcements</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/technology\" rel=\"tag\">technology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, February 02, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1991177134013119798\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/designing-ai-with-rights-consciousness.html\">Designing AI with Rights, Consciousness, Self-Respect, and Freedom (with Mara Garza)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights2.htm\">New paper</a> in draft!<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KrtXW9r1OO0/WnSre4e2gFI/AAAAAAAAAp8/qMcUWqg2ESU4Ab2LkJxxVGxgbDrB_oKsgCLcBGAs/s1600/artificial-intelligence-2167835_960_720.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"642\" data-original-width=\"960\" height=\"134\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KrtXW9r1OO0/WnSre4e2gFI/AAAAAAAAAp8/qMcUWqg2ESU4Ab2LkJxxVGxgbDrB_oKsgCLcBGAs/s200/artificial-intelligence-2167835_960_720.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\nAbstract:<p>\n\nWe propose four policies of ethical design of human-grade Artificial Intelligence.  Two of our policies are precautionary.  Given substantial uncertainty both about ethical theory and about the conditions under which AI would have conscious experiences, we should be cautious in our handling of cases where different moral theories or different theories of consciousness would produce very different ethical recommendations.  Two of our policies concern respect and freedom.  If we design AI that deserves moral consideration equivalent to that of human beings, that AI should be designed with self-respect and with the freedom to explore values other than those we might selfishly impose.  We are especially concerned about the temptation to create human-grade AI pre-installed with the desire to cheerfully sacrifice itself for its creators\u2019 benefit.<p>\n\nFull version <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights2.htm\">here</a>.\n\nAs always, comments and critical discussion welcome, either by email to me or as comments on this post.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/photos/artificial%20intelligence/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/designing-ai-with-rights-consciousness.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-02-02T10:20:00-08:00\">10:20 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1991177134013119798\" onclick=\"\">19\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/artificial%20intelligence\" rel=\"tag\">artificial intelligence</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, January 18, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2285382327477492462\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/flying-free-of-deathbed-with.html\">Flying Free of the Deathbed, with Technological Help</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Today marks the third year since the death of my father, Kirkland Gable.  (Some memories of him <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/memories-of-my-father.html\">here</a>.)  I now better understand than I once did why the ancient Confucian tradition recommends three years' mourning for one's parents.  To my surprise -- since we had only been in contact about once a month before his death -- I find myself almost every day still thinking about his absence.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WkJaa2_oy0k/Wl-4-ASi_TI/AAAAAAAAAoU/8-QQpHqtyuYTq_DrsijJXokd0g18XkI7wCLcBGAs/s1600/William_Blake_-_Sconfitta_-_Frontispiece_to_The_Song_of_Los.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1229\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WkJaa2_oy0k/Wl-4-ASi_TI/AAAAAAAAAoU/8-QQpHqtyuYTq_DrsijJXokd0g18XkI7wCLcBGAs/s320/William_Blake_-_Sconfitta_-_Frontispiece_to_The_Song_of_Los.jpg\" width=\"246\"/></a></div><p>\n\nMy father spent the final twenty years of his life severely disabled and often bedridden.  Among his many maladies, he suffered from severe <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Complex-Regional-Pain-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet\">Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome</a> in one foot, which meant that he was in constant pain which would be seriously aggravated, sometimes for weeks, from even mild exertion, such as ten minutes' walking, or jostling the foot too much during sleep or while in a wheelchair.  It was, I believe, ultimately the CRiPS that killed him, through the side effects of long-term narcotics and the bodily harm from spending years almost immobile in bed.<p>\n\nI have often wished, during his final years, that we could have freed him from his horrible bed.  I've tried this in imagination many times, attempting to write it up as a science fiction story.  But the story never seems to come out right.  Today, instead of the story I can't yet write, let me discuss a technological innovation that I think would be interesting for people who are bedridden.<p>\n\nThe core idea is simple and would be easy to implement.  Probably, it is already being implemented somewhere.  (Links and info welcome!)  <b>Equip an able-bodied volunteer, the \"Host\", with a camera above each eye and a microphone by each ear.  Equip the bedridden person, the \"Rider\", with VR gear that immersively presents these audiovisual stimuli to Rider's eyes and ears.  Also equip Rider with a microphone to speak with Host</b>, directly into Host's ear.  Now send Host on a trip.  <b>During this trip, let Host be guided mainly by Rider's expressed desires</b>, going where Rider wants, looking where Rider wants to look, stopping and listening where Rider wants to stop and listen.  Unlike VR tours as they currently exist, Host can interact with and alter the environment in real time.  Rider could have Host lift a flower and turn it in their hands, then cast the flower into a stream and watch it drift away.  Host could purchase goods or services on Rider's behalf.  Host could conduct a conversation through Rider, interacting with locals by having Rider speak Host's words verbatim.<p>\n\n(In the psychology literature, speaking the words of another immediately upon hearing them quietly projected into your ear is called \"<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/136216880100500203\">conversational shadowing</a>\".  In his career as a psychologist, my father was involved in some early shadowing studies.  Shadowing can be surprisingly fast and smooth once one gets the hang of it, with utterances almost simultaneous as the host half-anticipates the rider's next word.)<p>\n\nA more ambitious Host-Rider setup would employ VR gloves.  As I imagine it, <b>Rider and Host wear matching gloves.  These gloves are synchronized to move in exactly the same way</b> -- of course with quick escape overrides and perhaps with Rider's motions damped down to prevent overextension or bumping into unseen obstacles near the bed.  This would take some excellent technological chicanery with good motion tracking (Nintendo Wii, improved) and some way of restricting or guiding the movements of the gloves on each end, perhaps using magnetic fields, so that when Rider wants to move a hand on vector W and Host wants to move it on vector V, the result is some compromise vector (barring safety override).  An intuitive collaboration would be necessary between Rider and Host, and gentle, predictable movements.  With practice, I think it would not be unfeasible, at least in safe and simple environments, for Rider to feel as though it is almost <i>their</i> hands that are moving in the virtual environment.  This could be further enhanced with tactile feedback -- that is, if pressure sensors in Host's gloves communicated with actuators in Rider's gloves that exerted corresponding pressures in corresponding locations.<p>\n\n(Here, compare the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_transfer_illusion\">Rubber Hand or Body Transfer Illusion</a>.  I have been a participant in some body transfer experiments and have informally conducted others at home with friends and family.  It is amazing how flexible one's sense of one's bodily shape, position, and boundaries can be, given suggestive feedback!)<p>\n\nA final, expensive, risky, and much more conjectural step here -- probably a step too far -- would involve equipping Host and Rider with helmets with brain-imaging technology and the capacity for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation\">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a> (or some other ability to directly stimulate or suppress brain activity).  For example, for <b>a fuller tactile experience, activity in Host's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex\">primary somatosensory cortex</a> could be tracked, and a vague, faint echo of it could be stimulated in matching areas in Rider's cortex</b>.  One wouldn't want too much synchrony, and anyhow brains differ somewhat in their organizational structure, even in fairly similarly structured regions like somatosensory cortex.   Also, of course, you wouldn't want much motor signal going down through efferent nerves into the Rider's body, making Rider move around in the bed.  Also, current brain imaging technologies, even if we imagine portable versions of them, wouldn't be spatiotemporally sharp enough to do a proper job of it.  But still, a dim, vague signal <i>might</i> be very suggestive for an otherwise well-harmonized, collaborative Host and Rider, in a rich environmental context with very clear cues and expectations.<p>\n\nI won't conjecture about, say, attempting to match activity in emotional regions or associative cortex.  Conjecturing about a high degree of match between different people's brains is both neurophysiologically unrealistic and possibly too threatening to the autonomy of Host and Rider -- though of course there are dark, interesting, far-future science-fictional possibilities there.<p>\n\nLet's bracket, then, this last conjectural step with brain imaging and brain stimulation, and focus just on the VR experience with audiovisual input, shadowing, and matching-motion gloves -- all in a positive, harmonious, and non-exploitative relationship with a host.  I think that would be pretty cool, and near- to medium-term technologically achievable.  If it plays out right, it might give some bedridden people a chance to explore the world beyond their bed in a much more vivid, engaging, and interactive manner.<p>\n\nMy father was both a psychologist and an inventor.  In 1995, when he was first diagnosed with cancer, he had been wanting to go to Hong Kong, and he had to cancel the trip to attempt a bone marrow transplant.  He never did make it to Hong Kong.  I wish I could bring him back, build some of this technology with him, then take him there.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/flying-free-of-deathbed-with.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-01-18T08:12:00-08:00\">8:12 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2285382327477492462\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sense%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">sense experience</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, September 14, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1671256860111387095\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/what-would-it-take-for-humanity-to.html\">What would it take for humanity to survive?

But you never take time to imagine the impossible. Like maybe you survive.</i> (Doctor Who, \u201cThe End of the World\u201d)<p>\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that humanity is doomed: <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html\">environmental catastrophe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/ISEC_a_00273\">nuclear war</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/-sp-ebola-outbreak-risk-global-pandemic-next\">pandemics</a> all seem capable of wiping us out, and that\u2019s without imagining all of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo\"> the exciting new technologies that might be lying in wait across the horizon waiting to devour us</a>. However, I\u2019m an optimist. I think there\u2019s an excellent chance humanity will see this century out. And if we eventually become a <a href=\"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/space.2017.29009.emu?journalCode=space&amp;\">multi-planetary species</a>, the odds start looking really quite good for us. Nonetheless, in thinking about the potential value in human survival (or the potential loss from human extinction), I think we could do more first to pin down whether (and why) we should care about our survival, and exactly what would be required for us to survive. <p>\n\nFor many hardnosed people, I imagine there\u2019s an obvious answer to both questions: there is no <i>special </i>value in human survival, and in fact, the universe may be a better place for everyone (including perhaps us) if we were to all quietly go extinct. This is a position I\u2019ve heard from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Human_Extinction_Movement\">ecologists</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism\">antinatalists</a>, and while I won\u2019t debate it here, I find it deeply unpersuasive. As far as we know, humanity is the only truly intelligent species in the universe \u2013 the only species that is capable of great works of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire\">art</a>, <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/WILS-4\">philosophy</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy\">technological development</a>. And while we may not be the only <i>conscious </i>species on earth, we are likely the only species capable of the more rarefied forms of happiness and value. Further to that, even though there are surely other conscious species on earth worth caring about, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150323-how-long-will-life-on-earth-last\">our sun will finish them off in a few billion years</a>, and they\u2019re not getting off this planet without our help (in other words: no dogs on Mars unless we put them there). <p>\n\nHowever, even if you\u2019re sympathetic to this line of response, it admittedly doesn\u2019t show there\u2019s any value in specifically <i>human</i> survival. Even if we grant that humans are an important source of utility worth protecting, <i>surely</i> there are intelligent aliens somewhere out there in the cosmos capable of enjoying just as fancy pleasures as those we experience. Insofar as we\u2019re concerned with human survival at all, then, maybe it should just be in virtue of our more general high capacity for well-being? <p>\nAgain, I\u2019m not particularly convinced by this. Leaving aside the fact that we may be alone in the universe, I can\u2019t shake the deep intuition that there\u2019s some special value in the thriving of humanity, even if only for us. To illustrate the point, imagine that one day a group of tiny aliens show up in orbit and politely ask if they can terraform earth to be more amenable to them, specifically replacing our atmosphere with one composed of sulphur dioxide. The downside of this will be that humanity and all of the life on Earth will die out. On the upside, however, the aliens\u2019 tiny size means that Earth could sustain <i>trillions </i>of them. \u201cYou\u2019re rational ethical beings,\u201d they say. \u201cSurely, you can appreciate that it\u2019s a better use of resources to give us your planet? Think of all the utility we\u2019d generate! And if you\u2019re really worried, we can keep a few organisms from every species alive in one of our alien zoos.\u201d <p>\n\nMaybe I\u2019m parochial and selfish, but the idea that we should go along with the aliens\u2019 wishes seems <i>absurd </i>to me (well, maybe they can have Mars). One of my deepest moral intuitions is that there is some special good that we are rationally allowed \u2013 if not obliged \u2013 to pursue in ensuring the continuation and thriving of humanity. <p>\nLet\u2019s just say you agree with me. We now face a further question: what would it take for humanity to survive in this ethically relevant sense? It\u2019s a surprisingly hard question to answer. One simple option would be that we survive as long as the species <i>Homo sapiens</i> is still kicking around. Without getting too deeply into the semantics of \u201chumanity\u201d, it seems like this misses the morally interesting dimensions of survival. For example, imagine that in the medium term future, beneficial gene-modding becomes ubiquitous, to the point where all our descendants would be reproductively cut off from breeding with the likes of us. While that would mean the end of Homo sapiens (at least by standard definitions of species), it wouldn\u2019t, to my mind, mean <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_and_First_Men\">the end of humanity in the broader and more ethically meaningful sense</a>. <p>\n\nA trickier scenario would involve the idea that one day we may cease to be biological organisms, having all uploaded ourselves to computers or robot bodies. Could humanity still exist in this scenario? My intuition is that we might well survive this. Imagine a civilization of robots who counted biological humans among their ancestors, and went around quoting Shakespeare to each other, discussing the causes of the Napoleonic Wars, and debating whether the great television epic <i>Game of Thrones</i> was a satisfactory adaptation of the books. In <i>that </i>scenario, I feel that humanity in the broader sense could well be thriving, even if we no longer have biological bodies. <p>\n\nThis leads me to a final possibility: maybe what\u2019s ethically relevant in our survival is really the survival of our culture and values: that what matters is really that beings relevantly like us are partaking in the artistic and cultural fruits of our civilization. <p>\n\nWhile I\u2019m tempted by this view, I think it\u2019s just a little bit too liberal. Imagine we wipe ourselves out next year in a war involving devastating bioweapons, and then a few centuries later, a group of aliens show up on Earth to find that nobody\u2019s home. Though they\u2019re disappointed that there are no living humans, they are <i>delighted </i>by the cultural treasure trove of they\u2019ve found. Soon, alien scholars are quoting Shakespeare and George R.R. Martin and figuring out how to cook pasta <i>al dente</i>. Earth becomes to the aliens what Pompeii is to us: a fantastic tourist destination, a cultural theme park. <p>\n\nIn that scenario, my gut says <i>we still lose</i>. Even though there are beings that are (let\u2019s assume) relevantly like us that are enjoying our culture, humanity did not survive in the ethically relevant sense. <p>\n\nSo what\u2019s missing? What is it that\u2019s preserved in the robot descendant scenario that\u2019s missing in the alien tourist one? My only answer is that some kind of appropriate causal continuity must be what makes the difference. Perhaps it\u2019s that we choose, through a series of voluntary, purposive actions to bring about the robot scenario, whereas the alien theme park is a mere accident. Or perhaps it\u2019s the fact that I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s a gradual transition from us to the robots, rather than the eschatological lacuna of the theme park case. <p>\n\nI have some more thought experiments that might help us decide between these alternatives, but that would be taking us beyond the scope of a blogpost. And perhaps my intuitions that got us this far are already radically at odds with yours. But in any case, as we take our steps into the next stage of human development, I think it\u2019s important for us to figure out what it is about us (if anything) that makes humanity valuable. <p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/photos/lightning/\">image source</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/what-would-it-take-for-humanity-to.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-09-14T08:00:00-07:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1671256860111387095\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Henry%20Shevlin\" rel=\"tag\">Henry Shevlin</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, August 16, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"415928561761855095\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/what-would-or-should-you-do-with.html\">What Would (or Should) You Do With Administrator Access to Your Mind (guest post by Henry Shevlin)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>guest post by</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n<a href=\"http://henryshevlin.com/\">Henry Shevlin</a><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DTf7_C_tEwg/WZMamhqnX6I/AAAAAAAAATk/86TQt7I2ASQLyedV8hGJxAsrrv_ASetGQCLcBGAs/s1600/login-570317_1280-1080x675.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"675\" data-original-width=\"1080\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DTf7_C_tEwg/WZMamhqnX6I/AAAAAAAAATk/86TQt7I2ASQLyedV8hGJxAsrrv_ASetGQCLcBGAs/s320/login-570317_1280-1080x675.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n<i>\n'Dial 888,' Rick said as the set warmed.

DICK, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep)<p></p></p></p></p></p></i>\n\n--------------------------<p>\n\nWe don\u2019t have direct control over most our beliefs and attitudes, let alone most of our drives and desires. No matter how much money was offered as an incentive, for example, I couldn\u2019t will myself to believe in fairies by this evening. Similarly, figuring out how to rid ourselves of our involuntary prejudices and biases is tricky (see <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603687/\">here</a> for an attempt), and changing our basic drives (such as our sexual orientation) is almost certainly impossible. <p>\nThat\u2019s not to say that we have <i>zero</i> control over any of these things. If I wanted to increase the likelihood of having religious beliefs, for example, I might decide to start hanging out with religious people, or attending services. But it\u2019s a messy and indirect path to acquiring new beliefs and values. <p>\nImagine, then, how useful it would be if we had some kind of more direct ability to control our minds. In thinking about this possibility, a useful analogy comes from the idea of Administrator access on a computer. What if \u2013 perhaps for just a few hours a month \u2013 you could delve into your beliefs, your values, and your drives, and reconfigure them to your heart\u2019s content, before \u2018logging back in\u2019 as your (now modified) self? <p>\nSome immediately tempting applications of this possibility are fairly clear. For one, we\u2019d perhaps want to eliminate or tone down our most egregious cognitive biases: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias\">post-purchase rationalization</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy\">sunk cost fallacy</a>, and so on. Similarly, we might want to rid ourselves of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype\">implicit prejudices</a> that we may have against groups or individuals. Prejudiced against elderly people? Just go into Settings Menu and adjust your slider to correct it. Irrationally resentful of a colleague who accidentally slighted you? A quick fix to remove the relevant emotion and you\u2019re sorted. <p>\nAnother attractive application might be to bring our immediate desires into line with our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_volition\">higher-order desires</a>. Crave cigarettes and wish you didn\u2019t? Tamp down the relevant first-order desire and you\u2019re sorted. Wish you had the motivation to run in the mornings? Then ramp up the slider for \u201cdesire to go jogging\u201d. We might even want to give ourselves some helpful false beliefs or \u2018constructive myths\u2019. Disheartened by the fact that you as an individual can do little to prevent climate change? Maybe a false belief that you can be a powerful agent for change will help you do good. <p>\nFinally, we come to the most controversial stuff, like values, drives, and memories. Take values first.  Imagine that you find yourself trapped in a small town where you\u2019re ostracised for your deviant political beliefs. One easy option might be to simply tweak your values to come into line with your community. Or imagine if you could adjust things like your sexual drives and orientation. Certainly, some people might feel relief at ridding themselves of certain kinks or fetishes that they found oppressive, while others might enjoy experimenting with recalibrating their sexuality. But we could also find that people were pressured or tempted to adjust their sexuality to bring it into line with the bigoted social expectations of their community, and it\u2019s hard not to find that a morally troubling idea. Finally, imagine if we could wipe away unpleasant memories at will \u2013 the bad relationships, social gaffes, and painful insults could be gone in a moment. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind\">What could possibly go wrong with that?</a> <p>\nAs much as I like the idea of tweaking my mind, I feel uncomfortable about lot of these possibilities.  First, at the risk of sounding cliched, it seems like the gains of personal growth are often as much in the journey as the destination. So, take someone who learns to become more patient with others\u2019 failings. Along the way, she\u2019s probably going to pick up a bunch of other important realizations \u2013 of her own fallibility, perhaps, or of the distress she\u2019s caused in the past by dismissing people. Skipping straight to the outcome threatens to cheat her, and us, of something valuable. Similarly, sometimes along the road of personal change, we realize that we\u2019ve been aiming for the wrong thing. Someone who desperately wants to fit in with their peer group, for example, might slowly and painfully realize that they don\u2019t like their peers as much as they thought. Skipping out the journey, then, not only robs us of potential goods we might find along the way, but also of the capacity to change our mind about where we\u2019re going. <p>\nThere might also be some kinds of extrinsic goods that would be lost if we could all tweak our minds so effortlessly. Take the example of someone who wishes he could fit in with his more conservative community. Even though he might relish not having values that are different from those around him, by holding onto them, he could be providing encouragement and cover for other political deviants in his town. In much the same way, diversity of opinion, outlook, and motivation may be valuable for the community at large, despite not always being pleasant for those in the minority. This can be true even if the majority perspective in the community is in the right: dissenters can helpfully force the dominant voices to articulate and justify their views. <p>\nFinally, we could run into serious unexpected consequences \u2013 maybe getting rid of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\">availability heuristic</a> would turn out to drastically slow down my reasoning, for example, or perhaps making myself more prosocial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(film)\">could backfire on me if I live in an antisocial community</a>. Still more catastrophic consequences might involve deviant paths to fulfilment of desires. If (in Administrator mode) I give myself an overriding desire to be \u201cfitter than the average person in my town\u201d, for example, I might (as a normal user) go on to decide that the fastest way to achieve that goal is to kill all the healthy people in my community! More prosaically, it\u2019s also easy to imagine people being tempted to reconfigure their difficult-to-achieve desires (like becoming rich and famous) and instead replacing them with stuff that\u2019s easy to achieve (collecting paperclips, say, or counting blades of grass). Perhaps they would be well advised to do so, but this is <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#DesThe\">philosophically controversial</a> to say the least! <p>\nWhile Administrator Access to our own minds is of course just science fiction for now, I think it\u2019s a useful tool for probing our intuitions about well-being, rationality, and personal change. It could also potentially guide us in situations where do have more powerful ways of influencing the development of minds. This may be a big deal in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem\">development of future forms of artificial intelligence</a>, for example, but something similar arguably applies even when we\u2019re deciding how to raise our children (should we encourage them to <a href=\"http://www.philosophymatters.org/2012/12/the-ethics-of-santa-claus/\">believe in Santa Claus?</a>). <p>\nFor my part, I doubt I could resist making a few tweaks to myself (maybe I\u2019d finally get to make good use of that gym membership). But I\u2019d do so carefully... and likely with a sense of trepidation and unease.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://sweetadelines.org.uk/reminder-on-member-password/\">image source</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/what-would-or-should-you-do-with.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-08-16T08:00:00-07:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=415928561761855095\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Henry%20Shevlin\" rel=\"tag\">Henry Shevlin</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, June 01, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7390077429191586003\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-social-role-defense-of-robot-rights.html\">The Social-Role Defense of Robot Rights</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Daniel Estrada's <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/collection/Yq0ePB\">Made of Robots</a> has launched a Hangout on Air series in philosophy of technology.  The first episode is terrific!<p>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"YOUTUBE-iframe-video\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TUMIxBnVsGc/0.jpg\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUMIxBnVsGc?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"320\"></iframe>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"youtube-player\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"10\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUMIxBnVsGc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\"></iframe><p>\n\nRobot rights cheap yo.<p>\n<b>Cheap:</b> Estrada's argument for robot rights <b>doesn't require that robots have any conscious experiences</b>, any feelings, any reinforcement learning, or (maybe) any cognitive processing at all.  Most other defenses of the moral status of robots assume, implicitly or explicitly, that robots who are proper targets of moral concern will exist only in the future, once they have cognitive features <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights.htm\">similar to humans</a> or at least similar to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13347-013-0122-y\">non-human vertebrate animals</a>.<p>\n\nIn contrast, <b>Estrada argues that robots <i>already</i> deserve rights -- actual robots that currently exist</b>, even simple robots.<p>\n\nHis core argument is this:<p>\n\n1. Some robots are already \"social participants\" deeply incorporated into our social order.<p>\n\n2. Such deeply incorporated social participants deserve social respect and substantial protections -- \"rights\" -- regardless of whether they are capable of interior mental states like joy and suffering.<p>\n\nLet's start with some comparison cases.  Estrada mentions <b>corpses and teddy bears</b>.  We normally treat corpses with a certain type of respect, even though we think they themselves aren't capable of states like joy and suffering.  And there's something that seems at least a little creepy about abusing a teddy bear, even though it can't feel pain.<p>\n\nYou could explain these reactions without thinking that corpses and teddy bears deserve rights.  Maybe it's the person who existed in the past, whose corpse is now here, who has rights not to be mishandled after death.  Or maybe the corpse's relatives and friends have the rights.  Maybe what's creepy about abusing a teddy bear is what it says about the abuser, or maybe abusing a teddy harms the child whose bear it is.<p>\n\nAll that is plausible, but another way of thinking emphasizes the social roles that corpses and teddy bears play and the importance to our social fabric (arguably) of our treating them in certain ways and not in other ways.  Other comparisons might be: flags, classrooms, websites, parks, and historic buildings.  Destroying or abusing such things is not morally neutral. <b> Arguably, mistreating flags, classrooms, websites, parks, or historic buildings is a harm to society -- a harm that does not reduce to the harm of one or a few specific property owners who bear the relevant rights.</b><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uWw3woAxQZo/WR49PbzJxTI/AAAAAAAAALY/vPH1MkBo9N42OJW61dmIuao6jN6gtLALACLcB/s1600/KS_HitchBOT.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uWw3woAxQZo/WR49PbzJxTI/AAAAAAAAALY/vPH1MkBo9N42OJW61dmIuao6jN6gtLALACLcB/s320/KS_HitchBOT.jpg\" width=\"181\"/></a></div><p>\n\nArguably, the destruction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT\">hitchBOT</a> was like that.  HitchBOT was cute ride-hitching robot, who made it across the length of Canada but who was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/03/us/hitchbot-robot-beheaded-philadelphia-feat/\">destroyed by pranksters in Philadelphia</a> when its creators sent it to repeat the feat in the U.S.  Its destruction not only harmed its creators and owners, but also the social networks of hitchBOT enthusiasts who were following it and cheering it on.<p>\n\nIt might seem overblown to say that a flag or a historic building deserves <i>rights</i>, even if it's true that flags and historic buildings in some sense deserve respect.  If this is all there is to \"robot rights\", then we have a very thin notion of rights.  Estrada isn't entirely explicit about it, but I think he wants more than that.<p>\n\nHere's the thing that makes the robot case different: <b>Unlike flags, buildings, teddy bears, and the rest, robots can <i>act</i>.</b>  I don't mean anything too fancy here by \"act\".  Maybe all I mean or need to mean is that it's reasonable to take the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance\">intentional stance</a>\" toward them.  <b>It's reasonable to treat them as though they had beliefs, desires, intentions, goals -- and that adds a new richer dimension, maybe different in kind, to their role as nodes in our social network</b>.<p>\n\nMaybe that new dimension is enough to warrant using the term \"rights\".  Or maybe not.  I'm inclined to think that whatever rights existing (non-conscious, not cognitively sophisticated) robots deserve remain derivative on us -- like the \"rights\" of flags and historic buildings.  Unlike human beings and apes, <b>such robots have no <i>intrinsic </i>moral status</b>, independent of their role in our social practices.  To conclude otherwise would require more argument or a different argument than Estrada gives.<p>\n\nRobot rights cheap!  That's good.  I like cheap.  Discount knock-off rights!  If you want <i>luxury </i>rights, though, you'll have to look somewhere else (for now).<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT\">image source</a>]\n\nUpdate: I changed \"have rights\" to \"deserve rights\" in a few places above.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-social-role-defense-of-robot-rights.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-06-01T15:51:00-07:00\">3:51 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7390077429191586003\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, January 16, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5130354317671929942\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/ai-consciousness-reply-to-schwitzgebel.html\">AI Consciousness: A Reply to Schwitzgebel</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://cosmos.nautil.us/feature/72/it-may-not-feel-like-anything-to-be-an-alien\"><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" imageanchor=\"1\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-26J8gxsADB8/WFrVgq3NjfI/AAAAAAAABss/vXXz4kmFpmgMImPfppzxQm4L9VWaWb0MgCLcB/s200/cosmos-a-72.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\" width=\"140\"/></div></a></p></div><p>\n<b>Guest post by <a href=\"http://schneiderwebsite.com/index.html\">Susan Schneider</a><p></p></b>\n\nIf AI outsmarts us, I hope its conscious. It might help with the horrifying control problem \u2013 the problem of how to control superintelligent AI (SAI), given that SAI would be vastly smarter than us and could rewrite its own code. Just as some humans respect nonhuman animals because animals feel, so too, conscious SAI might respect us because they see within us the light of conscious experience.<p>\n\nSo, will an SAI (or even a less intelligent AI) be conscious? In a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7M4b_9PJ-g\">Ted talk</a>, <a href=\"http://cosmos.nautil.us/feature/72/it-may-not-feel-like-anything-to-be-an-alien\">Nautilus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-schneider/goodbye-little-green-men_b_9108036.html\">Huffington Post</a> pieces, and some academic articles (all at <a href=\"http://schneiderwebsite.com/index.html\">my website</a>) I\u2019ve been urging that it is an important open question.<p>\n\nI love <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/12/is-most-of-intelligence-in-universe-non.html\">Schwitzgebel's reply</a> because he sketches the best possible scenario for AI consciousness: noting that conscious states tend to be associated with slow, deliberative reasoning about novel situations in humans, he suggests that SAI may endlessly invent novel tasks \u2013 e.g., perhaps they posit ever more challenging mathematical proofs, or engage in an intellectual arms race with competing SAIs. So SAIs could still engage in reasoning about novel situations, and thereby be conscious.<p>\n\nIndeed, perhaps SAI will deliberately engineer heightened conscious experience in itself, or, in an instinct to parent, create AI mindchildren that are conscious.<p>\n\nSchwitzgebel gives further reason for hope: \"...unity of organization in a complex system plausibly requires some high-level self-representation or broad systemic information sharing.\" He also writes: \"Otherwise, it's unlikely that such a system could act coherently over the long term. Its left hand wouldn't know what its right hand is doing.\"<p>\n\nBoth of us agree that leading scientific approaches to consciousness correlate consciousness with novel learning and slow, deliberative focus, and that these approaches also associate consciousness with some sort of broad information sharing from a central system or global workspace (see Ch. 2 of my <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/language-thought\">Language of Thought: a New Philosophical Direction</a> where I mine <a href=\"http://cogweb.ucla.edu/CogSci/GWorkspace.html\">Baars' Global Workspace Theory</a> for a computational approach to LOT's central system).<p>\n\nMaybe it is just that I'm too despondent since Princess Leah died. But here's a few reasons why I still see the glass half empty:<p>\n<blockquote><p>a. Eric's points assume that reasoning about novel situations, and centralized, deliberative thinking more generally, will be implemented in SAI in the same way they are in humans  \u2013 i.e., in a way that involves conscious experience. But the space of possible minds is vast: There could be other architectural ways to get novel reasoning, central control, etc. that do not involve consciousness or a global workspace. Indeed, if we merely consider biological life on Earth we see intelligences radically unlike us (e.g., slime molds, octopuses); there will likely be radically different cognitive architectures in the age of AGI/superintelligence.<p>\n\nb. SAI may not have a centralized architecture in any case.  A centralized architecture is a place where highly processed information comes together from the various sensory modalities (including association areas). Consider the octopus, which apparently has more neurons in its arms than in its brain. The arms can carry out activity without the brain; these activities do not need to be coordinated by a central controller or global workspace in the brain proper. Maybe a creature already exists, elsewhere in the universe, that has even less central control than the octopus.<p>\n\nIndeed, coordinated activity doesn't require that a brain region or brain process be a place where it all comes together, although it helps. There are all kinds of highly coordinated group activities on Earth, for instance (the internet, the stock market). And if you ask me, there are human bodies that are now led by coordinated conglomerates without a central controller. Here, I am thinking of split brain patients, who engage in coordinated activity (i.e., the right and left limbs seem to others to be coordinated).  But the brain has been split through removal of the corpus collosum, and plausibly, there are two subjects of experience there.  The coordination is so convincing that even the patent's spouse doesn't realize there are two subjects there.  It takes highly contrived laboratory tests to determine that the two hemispheres are separate conscious beings.  How could this be? Each hemisphere examines the activity of the other hemisphere (the right hemisphere observes the behavior of the limb it doesn't control, etc.) And only one hemisphere controls the mouth.<p>\n\nc. But assume the SAI or AGI has a similar cognitive architecture as we do; in particular, assume it has an integrated central system or global workspace (as in Baars' Global Workspace Theory).  I still think consciousness is an open question here. The problem is that only some implementations of a central system (or global workspace) may be conscious, while others may not be. Highly integrated, centralized information processing may be necessary, but not sufficient.  For instance, it may be that the very properties of neurons that enable consciousness, C1-C3, say, are not ones that AI programs need to reproduce to get AI systems that do the needed work. Perhaps AI programmers can get sophisticated information processing without needing to go as far as build systems to instantiate C1-C3. Or perhaps a self-improving AI may not bother to keep consciousness in its architecture, or lacking consciousness, it may not bother to engineer it in, as its final and instrumental goals may not require it. And who knows what their final goals will be; none of the instrumental goals <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0198739834\">Bostrom</a> and others identify require consciousness (goal content integrity, cognitive enhancement,etc.)</p></p></p></p></blockquote><p>\n<i>Objection</i> (<a href=\"http://henryshevlin.com/\">Henry Shevlin</a> and others): am I denying that it is nomologically possible to create a copy of a human brain, in silicon or some other substance, that precisely mimics the causal workings of the brain, including consciousness?<p>\n\nI don't deny this. I think that <i>if</i> you copy the precise causal workings of cells in a different medium you could get consciousness.  The problem is that it may not be technologically feasible to do so. (An aside: for those who care about the nature of properties, I reject pure categorical properties; I have a two-sided view, following <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-4975.00003/abstract\">Heil and Martin</a>. Categoricity and dispositionality are just different ways of viewing the same underlying property\u2014two different modes of presentation, if you will.  So consciousness properties that have all and only the same dispositions are the same type of property. You and your dispositional duplicate can't differ in your categorical properties then. <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/\">Zombies</a> aren't possible.)<p>\n\nIt seems <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjunctive_possibility\">nomologically possible</a> that an advanced civilization could build a gold sphere the size of Venus. What is the probability this will ever happen though? This depends upon economics and sociology \u2013 a civilization would need to be a practical incentive to do this. I bet it will never happen.<p>\n\nAI is currently being built to do specific tasks better than us. This is the goal, not reproducing consciousness in machines. It may be that the substrate used to build AI is not a substrate that instantiates consciousness easily.  Engineering consciousness in may be too expensive and time consuming. Like building the Venus-sized gold sphere.  Indeed, given the ethical problems with creating sentient beings and then having them work for us, AI programs may aim to build systems that aren't conscious.<p>\n\nA response here is that once you get a sophisticated information processor, consciousness inevitably arises. Three things seem to fuel this view: (1) <a href=\"http://integratedinformationtheory.org/\">Tonini's information integration theory (IIT)</a>.  But it seems to have counterexamples (see <a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1823\">Scott Aaronson's blog</a>). (2) <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/\">Panpsychism/panprotopsychism</a>. Even if one of these views is correct, the issue of whether a given AI is conscious is about whether the AI in question has the kind of conscious experience macroscopic subjects of experience (persons, selves, nonhuman animals) have.   Merely knowing whether panpsychism or panprotopsychism is true does not answer this.  We need to know which structural relations between particles lead to macroexperience. (3) Neural replacement cases.  I.e., thought experiments in which you are asked to envision replacing parts of your brain (at time t1) with silicon chips that function just like neurons, so that in the end, (t2), your brain is made of silicon. You are then asked: intuitively are you still conscious? Do you think the quality of your consciousness would change? These cases only goes so far. The intuition <i>is</i> plausible that from t1 to t2, at no point would you would lose consciousness or have your consciousness diminished (see <a href=\"http://consc.net/chalmers/\">Chalmers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/ejlowepages/\">Lowe</a> and <a href=\"http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/alvin-plantinga/\">Plantinga</a> for discussion of such thought experiments). This is because a dispositional duplicate of your brain is created, from t1 to t2.  If the chips are dispositional duplicates of neurons, sure, I think the duplicate would be conscious. (I'm not sure this would be a situation in which you survived though-see <a href=\"https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/the-philosophy-of-her/\">my NYT op-ed on uploading</a>.) But why would an AI company build such a system from scratch, to clean your home, be a romantic partner, advise a president, etc?<p> \n\nAgain, is not clear, currently, that just by creating a fast, efficient program (\"IP properties\") we have also copied the very same properties that give rise to consciousness in humans (\"C properties\"). It may require further work to get C properties, and in different substrates, it may be hard, far more difficult than building a biological system from scratch. Like creating a gold sphere the size of Venus.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/ai-consciousness-reply-to-schwitzgebel.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-01-16T07:00:00-08:00\">7:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5130354317671929942\" onclick=\"\">22\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/AI%2Frobot%2FMartian%20rights\" rel=\"tag\">AI/robot/Martian rights</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/artificial%20intelligence\" rel=\"tag\">artificial intelligence</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Susan%20Schneider\" rel=\"tag\">Susan Schneider</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, October 11, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8204433781102751953\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/my-daughters-rented-eyes.html\">My Daughter's Rented Eyes</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>(inspired by a conversation with <a href=\"http://craphound.com/bio/\">Cory Doctorow</a> about how a kid's high-tech rented eyes might be turned toward favored products in the cereal aisle)<p>\n\nAt two million dollars outright, of course I couldn't afford to <i>buy </i> eyes for my four-year-old daughter Eva.  So, like everyone else whose kids had been blinded by the GuGuBoo Toy company's defective dolls (may its executives rot in bankruptcy Hell), I <i>rented </i>the eyes.  What else could I possibly do?<p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wiWk9VUYfNg/V_0AlfSfkzI/AAAAAAAABlw/ixdvEkXaZQwGg3MjirKijOVKqbtpMMZGgCLcB/s1600/EyesA.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"139\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wiWk9VUYfNg/V_0AlfSfkzI/AAAAAAAABlw/ixdvEkXaZQwGg3MjirKijOVKqbtpMMZGgCLcB/s400/EyesA.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><p>\n\n\nUnlike some parents, I actually read the Eye &amp; Ear Company's contract.  So I knew part of what we were in for.  If we didn't make the monthly payments, her eyes would shut off.  We agreed to binding arbitration.  We agreed to a debt-priority clause, to financial liability for eye extraction, to automatic updates.  We agreed that from time to time the saccade patterns of her eyes would be subtly adjusted so that her gaze would linger over advertisements from companies that partnered with Eye &amp; Ear Co.  We agreed that <b>in the supermarket, Eva's eyes would be gently maneuvered toward the Froot Loops and the M&amp;Ms.</b><p>\n\nWhen the updates came in, we always had the legal right to refuse them.  We could, hypothetically, turn off Eva's eyes, then have them surgically removed and returned to Eye &amp; Ear Co.  Each new rental contract was thus technically voluntary.<p>\n\nWhen Eva was seven, the new updater threatened shutoff unless we transferred $1000 into a debit account.  Her updated eyes contained new software to detect any copyrighted text or images she might see.  <b>Instead of buying copyrighted works in the usual way, we agreed to have a small fee deducted from our account for each work Eva viewed.</b>  Instead of paying $4.99 for the digital copy of a Dr Seuss book, Eye &amp; Ear would deduct $0.50 each time she read the book.  Video games might be free with ads, or $0.05 per play, or $0.10, or even $1.00.  Since our finances were tight, we set up <b>parental controls</b>: Eva's eyes required parental permission for any charge over $0.99 or any cumulative charges over $5.00 in a day -- and of course they also blocked any \"adult\" material.  Until we granted approval, blocked or unpaid material was blurred and indecipherable, even if she was just peeking over someone's shoulder at a book or walking past a television in a dentist's lobby.<p>\n<b>When Eva was ten, the updater overlaid advertisements in her visual field.</b>  It helped keep the rental costs down.  (We could have bought out of the ads for an extra $6,000 a year.)  The ads never interfered much with Eva's vision -- they just kind of scrolled across the top of her visual field sometimes, Eva told us, or printed themselves onto clouds and the sides of buildings.<p>\n\nBy the time Eva was thirteen, I'd finally risen to a managerial position at work, and we could afford the <b>new luxury eyes</b> for her.  By adjusting the settings, Eva could see infrared at night.  She could zoom in on distant objects.  She could bug out her eyes and point them in different directions like some sort of weird animal, to take in a broader field of view.  She could also take snapshots and later retrieve them with a subvocalization -- which gave her a great advantage at school over her normal-eyed and cheaper-eyed peers.  Installed software could <b>text-search through stored snapshots, solve mathematical equations, and pull relevant information from the internet</b>.  When teachers tried to ban such enhancements from the classroom, Eye &amp; Ear fought back, arguing that the technology had become so integral to the children's lives that it couldn't be removed without disabling them.  Eye &amp; Ear refused to develop the technology to turn off the enhancement features, and no teacher could realistically prevent a kid from blinking and subvocalizing.<p>\n\nBy the time Eva was seventeen it looked like she and the two other <b>kids at her high school with luxury eye rentals would more or less have their choice among elite universities</b>.  I refused to believe the rumors about parents intentionally blinding their children so that they too could rent eyes.<p>\n\nWhen Eva turned twenty, all the updates -- not just the cheap ones -- required that you accept the <b>\"acceleration\" technology</b>.  <b>Companies contracted with Eye &amp; Ear to privilege their messages and materials for faster visual processing. </b> Pepsi paid a hundred million dollars a year so that users' eyes would prioritize resolving Pepsi cans and Pepsi symbols in the visual scene.  Coca Cola cans and symbols were \"deprioritized\" and stayed blurry unless you focused on them for a few seconds.  Loading stored images worked similarly.  A remembered scene with a Pepsi bottle in it would load almost instantly.  One with a Coke bottle would take longer and might start out fuzzy or fragmented.<p>\n<b>Eye &amp; Ear started to make glasses for the rest of us</b>, which imitated some of the functions of the implants.  Of course they were incredibly useful.  Who wouldn't want to take snapshots, see in the dark, zoom into the distance, get internet search and tagging?  We all rented whatever versions we could afford, signed the annual terms and conditions, received the updates.  We wore them pretty much all day, even in the shower.  The glasses beeped alarmingly whenever you took them off, unless you went through a complex shutdown sequence.<p>\n\nWhen the \"Johnson for President\" campaign bought an acceleration, the issue went all the way to the Supreme Court.  <b>Johnson's campaign had paid Eye &amp; Ear to prioritize the perception of his face and deprioritize the perception of his opponent's face, prioritize the visual resolution and recall of his ads</b>, deprioritize the resolution and recall of his opponent's ads.  Eva was now a high-powered lawyer in a New York firm, on the fast track toward partner.  She worked for the Johnson campaign, though I wouldn't have thought it was like her.  Johnson was so authoritarian, shrill, and right-wing -- or at least it seemed so to me, when I took my glasses off.<p>\n\nJohnson favored immigration restrictions, and his opponent claimed (but never proved) that Eye &amp; Ear implemented an algorithm that highlighted people's differences in skin tone -- making the lights a little lighter, the darks a little darker, the East Asians a bit yellow.  Johnson won narrowly, before his opponent's suit about the acceleration had made it through the appeals process.  It didn't hit the high court until a month after Johnson's inauguration.  Eva helped prepare Johnson's defense.  Eight of the nine justices were over eighty years old.  They lived stretched lives with enhanced longevity and of course all the best implants.  They heard the case through the very best ears.<p>\n\n---------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated post:<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/possible-cognitive-and-cultural-effects.html\">Possible Cognitive and Cultural Effects of Video Lifelogging</a> (Apr 21, 2016)<p>\n\n\n---------------------------------<p>\n\n\nImage source:<p>\n\n\nPhoto: HAL 9000 resurrected by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ramyoga/\">Ram Yoga</a>, doubled.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/my-daughters-rented-eyes.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-10-11T09:03:00-07:00\">9:03 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=8204433781102751953\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, July 22, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"787264466276318761\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/07/under-what-conditions-would-you-upload.html\">Under What Conditions Would You Upload into a Simulated World?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I have a new science fiction story out in <a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/\">Clarkesworld</a> (<a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/schwitzgebel_07_16/\">text version</a>, <a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/audio_07_16a/\">audiocast</a>).  One of my philosophical aims in that story is to reflect about the conditions under which it would make sense to upload into a simulated world.<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading\">Mind uploading</a>\" is the hypothetical process of copying your mind into a computational device.  If futurists such as <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/\">Ray Kurzweil</a> are correct, we might be only a few decades away from mind uploading as a real technological option.<p>\n\nWhen mind uploading is presented in science fiction, usually the following are assumed:<p>\n\n(1.) The uploaded mind <b>retains all the important psychological features</b> of the original mind (including, of course, a genuine stream of conscious experiences).<p>\n\n(2.) The uploaded mind <b>experiences a world as rich as the world of the original mind</b>.  If the mind is uploaded into a robot, that world might just be the same world as the world of the original mind.  If the mind is uploaded into a <a href=\"http://www.simulation-argument.com/\">Sim</a> or a <a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html\">Matrix world</a> -- that is, an artificial environment of some sort -- that artificial environment is usually assumed to be as rich and interesting as the mundane environment of everyday Earth for normally embodied humans.<p>\n\nUnder these conditions, if we also assume that uploading has substantial advantages in improving longevity, allowing backups, improving one's cognitive powers, or giving oneself access to a new rich vein of experiences and possibilities, then it probably makes sense to upload, unless one is strongly committed to traditional human embodiment or to projects or relationships that would no longer be possible post-upload.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wCbge91oDAk/V3rfNdJoQJI/AAAAAAAABbU/_vQrra2kyykupTvXtdA8HrcdOzWKop4dgCLcB/s1600/DanceFloor.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wCbge91oDAk/V3rfNdJoQJI/AAAAAAAABbU/_vQrra2kyykupTvXtdA8HrcdOzWKop4dgCLcB/s400/DanceFloor.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nHowever, it seems natural to suppose that if uploading does someday become possible the first uploads will not have features (1) and (2).  <b>The first uploaded people (or \"people\"), </b>even if genuinely conscious,<b> might be seriously psychologically impaired and unable to access a full, rich world of experiences.<p>\n\nThere might, however, still be advantages of uploading in terms of longevity and experienced pleasure.</p></b><p>\n\nIn \"Fish Dance\", the narrator is presented with the option of uploading his mind under these conditions:<p>\n\n(a.) the <b>world is tiny</b>: a single dance floor, with no input from the larger world outside;</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n(b.) his <b>mind is limited</b>: he will have some memories from his pre-uploaded self, but he won't fully understand them, and furthermore he won't be able to lay down new memories that last for more than an hour or so;\n(c.) his dance-floor experiences will be <b>extremely pleasurable</b>: ideal experiences of dancing ecstasy;\n(d.) he will experience this extreme pleasure for <b>a billion years</b>.<p>\n\nAlso relevant, of course, are the relationships and projects that he would be leaving behind.  (In our narrator's case, a recently deceased child, a living teenage child who wants him to upload, a stale marriage, and an okay but not inspiring career as a professor.)<p>\n\nI say the relationships and projects \"he\" will leave behind, but of course one interesting question is whether it makes sense to call the uploaded being \"him\", that is, the same \"him\" as the narrator. <p>\n\nIf it seems obvious to you what one should do under such conditions, the parameters are of course adjustable: We can increase or decrease psychological function, psychological similarity, and quality of memory.  We can increase or decrease the size of the world and the range of available input.  We can increase or decrease the pleasure and longevity.  We can modify the relationships and projects that would be left behind.<p>\n\nYou or your descendants might actually face some version of this decision.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/schwitzgebel_07_16/\">Fish Dance</a>\" (Clarkesworld #118, July 2016)<p>\n\nRelated blogpost: <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/05/goldfish-pool-immortality.html\">Goldfish Pool Immortality</a> (May 30, 2014)<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/401383385509774907/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/07/under-what-conditions-would-you-upload.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-07-22T03:41:00-07:00\">3:41 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=787264466276318761\" onclick=\"\">13\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/personal%20identity\" rel=\"tag\">personal identity</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, June 27, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3139237466837224032\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/susan-schneider-on-how-to-prevent_27.html\">Susan Schneider on How to Prevent a Zombie Dictatorship</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Last week I posted \"<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-to-accidentally-become-zombie-robot.html\">How to Accidentally Become a Zombie Robot</a>\", discussing Susan Schneider's <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Can-A-Robot-Feel-Susan-Schneide#.V2rDcojGso8\">recent TEDx-talk</a> proposal for checking whether silicon chips can be conscious.  Susan has written the following reply, which she invited me to share on the blog.<p>\n\n---------------------------------------------<p>\n\nEric,<p>\n\nGreetings from a caf\u00e9 in Lisbon! Your new, seriously cool <i>I,Brain</i> case raises an important point about my original test in my Ted talk and is right out of a cyberpunk novel.  A few initial points, for readers, before I respond, as Ted talks don\u2019t give much philosophical detail:<p>\n\n1. It may be that the microchips are made of something besides silicon, (right now, e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene are alternate substrates under development). I don\u2019t think this matters \u2013 the issues that arise are the same.<p>\n\n2. It will be important that any chip test involve the <b>very kind of chip substrate and design</b> as that used in the AI in question.<p>\n\n3. Even if a kind of chip works in humans, there is still the issue of whether the AI in question has the right functional organization for consciousness. Since AI could be very different than us, and it is even difficult to figure out these issues in the case of biological creatures like the octopus, this may turn out to be very difficult.<p>\n\n4. For relation of the chip test to intriguing ideas of Ned Block and Dave Chalmers on this issue, see a paper on <a href=\"http://schneiderwebsite.com/Susan_Schneiders_Website/Research.html\">my website</a> (a section in \u201c<a href=\"http://schneiderwebsite.com/Susan_Schneiders_Website/Research_files/How%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind%20can%20Shape%20the%20Future.pdf\">The Future of Philosophy of Mind</a>\u201d, based on an earlier op-ed of mine.)<p>\n\n5. As Eric knows, it is probably a mistake to assume that brain chips will be functional isomorphs. I\u2019m concerned with the development of real, emerging technologies, because I am concerned with finding a solution to the problem of AI consciousness based on an actual test. Brain chips, already under development at DARPA, may eventually be faster and more efficient information processors, enhance human consciousness, or, they may be low fidelity copies of what a given minicolumn does.  This depends upon how medicine progresses...<p>\n \nBack to my original \u201cChip Test\u201d (in the Ted talk). It\u2019s 2045. You are ready to upgrade your aging brain.  You go to <i>I,Brain</i>. They can gradually replace parts of your biological brain with microchips.  You are awake during the surgery, suppose, and they replace a part of your biological brain that is responsible for some aspect of consciousness, with a microchip.  Do you lose consciousness of something (e.g., do you lose part of your visual field)? If so, you will probably notice. This would be a sign that the microchip is the wrong stuff. Science could try and try to engineer a better chip, but if after years of trying, they never could get it right, perhaps we should conclude that that kind of substrate (e.g., silicon) does not give rise to consciousness.<p>\n\nOn the other hand, if the chips work, that kind of substrate is in principle the right stuff (it can, in the right mental environment, give rise to qualia) although there is a further issue of whether a particular AI that has such chips has the right organization to be conscious (e.g., maybe it has nothing like a global workspace, like a Rodney Brooks style robot, or maybe it is superintelligent, and has mastered everything already and eliminated consciousness because it is too slow and inefficient).<p>\n\nEric, your test is different, and I agree that someone should not trust that test. This would involve a systematic deception. What kind of society would do this?  A <b>zombie dictatorship</b>, of course, which seeks to secretly eliminate conscious life from the planet.  :-) <p> \n\nBut I think you want to apply your larger point to the original test. Is the idea: couldn\u2019t a chip be devised that would falsely indicate consciousness to the person? (Let\u2019s call this a \u201csham qualia chip.\u201d ) I think it is, so here\u2019s a reply: God yes, in a dystopian world. We had better watch out! That would be horrible medicine\u2026and luckily, it would involve a good deal of expense and effort, (systematically fooling someone about say, their visual experience, would be a major undertaking), so science would likely first seek a genuine chip substitute that preserved consciousness. (Would a sham qualia chip even clear the FDA :-) ? Maybe only if microchips were not the right stuff and it was the best science could do. After all, people would always be missing lost visual qualia, and it is best that they not suffer like this....). But crucially, since this would involve a deliberate effort on the part of medical researchers, we would know this, and so we would know that the chip is not a true substitute. Unless, that is, we are inhabitants of a <b>zombie dictatorship</b>.<p>\n\nThe upshot: It would involve a lot of extra engineering effort to produce a <b><i>sham qualia chip</i></b>, and we would hopefully know that the sham chip was really a device designed to fool us. If this was done because the genuine chip substitute could not be developed, this would probably indicate that chips aren\u2019t the right stuff, or that science needs to go back to the drawing board.<p>\n\nI propose a global ban on sham qualia chips in interest of preserving democracy.<p>\n\n---------------------------------------------<p>\n\nI (Eric) have some thoughts in response.  I'm not sure it would be harder to make a sham qualia chip than a genuine qualia chip.  Rather than going into detail on that now, I'll let it brew for a future post.  Meanwhile, others' reactions welcomed too!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/susan-schneider-on-how-to-prevent_27.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-06-27T12:38:00-07:00\">12:38 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3139237466837224032\" onclick=\"\">15\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, June 23, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2551089337465692193\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-to-accidentally-become-zombie-robot.html\">How to Accidentally Become a Zombie Robot</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7NZUq1mGWSU/V2wZ8SmWmKI/AAAAAAAABaU/qG4LQHNpOOs6CQVbl521xy3MA4kWotudACLcB/s1600/GeminoidF.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7NZUq1mGWSU/V2wZ8SmWmKI/AAAAAAAABaU/qG4LQHNpOOs6CQVbl521xy3MA4kWotudACLcB/s320/GeminoidF.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nSusan Schneider's <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Can-A-Robot-Feel-Susan-Schneide#.V2rDcojGso8\">beautifully clear TEDx talk</a> on the future of robot consciousness has me thinking about the possibility of accidentally turning oneself into a zombie.  (I mean \"zombie\" <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/\">in the philosopher's sense</a>: a being who outwardly resembles us but who has no stream of conscious experience.)<p>\n\nSuppose that AI continues to rely on silicon chips and that -- as Schneider thinks is possible -- silicon chips just aren't the right kind of material to host consciousness.  (I'll weaken these assumptions below.)  It's 2045 and you walk into the iBrain store, thinking about having your degenerating biological brain replaced with more durable silicon chips.  Lots of people have done it already, and now the internet is full of programmed entities that claim to be happily uploaded people who have left their biological brains behind.  Some of these uploaded entities control robotic or partly organic bodies; others exist entirely in virtual environments inside of computers.  If Schneider is right that none of these silicon-chip-instantiated beings is actually conscious, then what has actually happened is that all of the biological people who \"uploaded\" actually committed <i>suicide</i>, and what exist are only non-conscious simulacra of them.<p>\n\nYou've read some philosophy.  You're worried about exactly that possibility.  Maybe that's why you've been so slow to visit the local iBrain store.  Fortunately, the iBrain company has discovered a way to upload you <i>temporarily</i>, so you can try it out -- so that you can determine introspectively for yourself whether the uploaded \"you\" really would be conscious.  Federal regulations prohibit running an uploaded iBrain at the same time that the original source person is conscious, but the company can scan your brain non-destructively while you are sedated, run the iBrain for a while, then pause your iBrain and update your biological brain with memories of what you experienced.  A trial run!<p>\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like this: You walk into the iBrain store, you are put to sleep, a virtual you wakes up in a robotic body and says \"Yes, I really am conscious!  Interesting how this feels!\" and then does some jogging and jumping jacks to test out the the body.  The robotic body then goes to sleep and the biological you wakes up and says, \"Yes, I was conscious even in the robot.  My philosophical doubts were misplaced.  Upload me into iBrain!\"<p>\n\nHere's the catch: <b>After you wake, how do you know those memories are accurate memories of having actually been conscious?</b>  When the iBrain company tweaks your biological neurons to install the memories of what \"you\" did in the robotic body, it's hard to see how you could be sure that those memories aren't merely <i>presently </i>conscious <i>seeming</i>-memories of past events that weren't actually consciously experienced at the time they occurred.  Maybe the robot \"you\" really was a zombie, though you don't realize that now.<p>\n\nYou might have thought of this possibility in advance, and so you might remain skeptical.  But it would take a lot of philosophical fortitude to sustain that skepticism across many \"trial runs\".  If biological you has lots of seeming-memories of consciousness as a machine, and repeatedly notices no big disruptive change when the switch is flipped from iBrain to biological brain, it's going to be hard to resist the impression that you really are conscious as a machine, even if that impression is false -- and thus you might decide to go ahead and do the upload permanently, unintentionally transforming yourself into an experienceless zombie.<p>\n\nBut maybe if a silicon-chip brain could really duplicate your cognitive processes well enough to drive a robot that acts just as you would act, then the silicon-chip brain really would have to be conscious?  That's a plausible (though disputable) philosophical position.  So let's weaken the philosophical and technological assumptions a little.  We can still get a skeptical zombie scenario going.<p>\n\nSuppose that the iBrain company tires of all the \"trial runs\" that buyers foolishly insist on, so the company decides to save money by not actually having the robot bodies do any of those things that the the trial-run users think they do.  Instead, when you walk in for a trial they sedate you and, based on what they know about your just-scanned biological brain, <b>they predict what you <i>would </i>do if you were \"uploaded\" into a robotic body.  They then give you <i>false </i>memories of having done those things</b>.  You never actually do any of those things or have any of those thoughts during the time your biological body is sedated, but there is no way to know that introspectively after waking.  It would seem to you that the uploading worked and preserved your consciousness.<p>\n\nThere can be less malicious versions of this mistake.  Behavior and cognition during the trial might be insufficient for consciousness, or for full consciousness, while memory is nonetheless vivid enough to lead to retrospective attributions of full consciousness.<p>\n\nIn her talk, Schneider suggests that we could tell whether silicon chips can really host consciousness by trying them out and then checking whether consciousness disappears when we do so; but I'm not sure this test would work.  <b>If nonconscious systems (whether silicon chip or otherwise) can produce both (a.) outwardly plausible behavior, and (b.) false memories of having really experienced consciousness, then we might falsely conclude in retrospect that consciousness is preserved.</b>  (This could be so whether we are replacing the whole brain at once or only one subsystem at a time, as long as \"outward\" means \"outside of the subsystem, in terms of its influence on the rest of the brain\".)  We might then choose to replace conscious systems with nonconscious ones, accidentally transforming ourselves into zombies.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://lannyland.blogspot.com/2009/02/robot-of-day-geminoid-f-female-andriod.html\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Update June 27:<p></p></i>\n\nSusan Schneider <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/susan-schneider-on-how-to-prevent_27.html\">replies</a>!<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-to-accidentally-become-zombie-robot.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-06-23T10:59:00-07:00\">10:59 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2551089337465692193\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/artificial%20intelligence\" rel=\"tag\">artificial intelligence</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, April 21, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1767319577940060959\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/possible-cognitive-and-cultural-effects.html\">Possible Cognitive and Cultural Effects of Video Lifelogging</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Last week science fiction writer <a href=\"https://stories.californiasunday.com/2015-01-04/ted-chiang-scifi-perfectionist/\">Ted Chiang</a> came to Riverside to talk about the possible cognitive effects of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/lifelogging/\">video lifelogging</a>.  He also explores these issues in his 2013 story <a href=\"https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang\">The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling</a>.  It was an interesting talk!  Chiang focused, as he also does in the story, on the <b>transformative effects video lifelogging might have on our memories</b>, including the possible decline of our ability to remember life events unaided if we can instead just easily call up results from a lifelog.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FFuOOzZ0cw/VxkG3jBBa3I/AAAAAAAABVk/cyFn8z6i9IsoDB_Wr7fmEwu6vmyr932rACLcB/s1600/lifelog.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FFuOOzZ0cw/VxkG3jBBa3I/AAAAAAAABVk/cyFn8z6i9IsoDB_Wr7fmEwu6vmyr932rACLcB/s320/lifelog.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n<a href=\"http://lifestreamblog.com/lifelogging/\">Lifelogging</a> is a movement aimed at recording and monitoring the details of your everyday life.  Video lifelogging, which is just starting to become feasible, involves video-recording every moment of your waking day.<p>\n\nGood search technology will be crucial.  Imagine subvocalizing \"the name of that book Emmeline[<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/11/names-in-philosophical-examples.html\">1</a>] recommended at dinner last week\" or \"that time Taimur cracked a raw egg on his head\", then having the relevant audiovisual results show up on your palm or your Google glass.  The eventual effects on our minds, Chiang suggests, would be <b>comparable to the transformative effects of literacy.</b>  In his talk, Chiang emphasized the decline of unaided memory and the <b>ability to hold ourselves to higher standards of truthfulness about past deeds</b> (what did you <i>really </i>say in that argument last week?).<p>\n\nJust as early Chinese calligraphers could not have predicted quantitative textual analysis or the internet, I think we can assume that if video lifelogging is integrated deeply into our daily lives, it will change us in ways we can't fully anticipate.  I'd like to suggest two possible effects that Chiang didn't mention.<p>\n\nFirst: It is much easier to record audio and video than other sensory modalities.  The recording and recreation of taste, smell, touch, and somatic sensation are much more speculative and remote.  Most people already tend to privilege sight and hearing, but lifelogging could amplify that dominance -- perhaps so much that the other senses almost seem like a forgettable, buzzing distraction.  <b>Your memories of sex, for example, might focus much more on the audiovisual parts of the experience</b>, if those are what you can easily revisit and recall (esp. with decreases in unaided memory, as Chiang suggests would be likely) -- and that in turn might lead you to focus more on those senses than on other senses in your future encounters, <b>which in turn might substantially alter the cultural structures and expectations around sex</b>.  Similarly, perhaps, for the pleasures of eating.<p>\n\nSecond: Chiang had explicitly set aside privacy issues, and I will also do so (maybe <a href=\"http://craphound.com/bio/\">Cory Doctorow</a> will address these when he comes next fall), but <i>intentional sharing</i> raises interesting possibilities, especially if it's possible in real-time.  Suppose we can't all afford to go to the concert -- but if we pool our funds, <i>you</i> can go, and <b>we can all watch your lifelog in real-time</b> (perhaps in immersive virtual reality), which will then <b>be saved in our lifelogs</b>.  If our cognition and culture have shifted more toward the audiovisual, then it might seem closer to actually being there than it would seem to people now, and if our autobiographical memories have become dominated by lifelog results, then later it might feel more like a real memory of having been there than an analogous experience would seem to people now.  Pushed to the extreme, an emphasis on shared real-time and remembered experiences might begin to blur the boundaries of the experienced self, including <b>reducing how much we care about whether it was our own bodies that did something or someone else's.</b><p>\n\nJust for starters.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://petapixel.com/2014/11/12/heartwarming-project-uses-lifelogging-cameras-capture-bond-mother-baby/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/possible-cognitive-and-cultural-effects.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-04-21T10:47:00-07:00\">10:47 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1767319577940060959\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, November 18, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"872410558465760732\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/11/an-interview-on-ai-rights.html\">An Interview on AI Rights</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

A century ago in America, temperance was a moral crusade, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any mark of it now among the Labor Day beer coolers. Majority views on interracial and same-sex relationships have swung from one pole to the other within the lifetimes of many people reading this. So given what we know of the past, we can say this about the people of the future: their moral attitudes will not be the same as ours. Some ethical efforts that now belong to a minority \u2013 vegetarianism, perhaps \u2013 will become as ubiquitously upheld as tolerance for interracial partnerships. Other moral matters that seem urgent now will fade from thought just as surely as the temperance movement. We can\u2019t know which attitudes will change and how, but we do know that moral change will happen. Should we try to stop it \u2013 or even to control it?</p>\n<p>Every generation exercises some control over the moral attitudes of its children, through the natural indoctrination of parenting and the socialization of school. But emerging technologies now give us unprecedented scope to tailor what the future will care about. From social psychology and behavioral economics we increasingly grasp how to design institutions so that the \u2018easy\u2019 or \u2018default\u2019 choices people tend to adopt coincide with the ones that are socially valuable. And as gene-editing eventually becomes a normal part of reproduction, we will be able to influence the moral attitudes of generations far beyond our own children. Of course, it is not as simple as \u2018programming\u2019 a particular moral belief; genetics does not work that way. But we might genetically tinker with brain receptivity for neurotransmitters that affect a person\u2019s readiness to trust, or her preference for members of her own ethnic group. We won\u2019t get to decide precisely how our descendants come to find their moral balance \u2013 but we could certainly put our thumb on the scale.</p>\n<p>On one way of looking at it, it\u2019s obvious that if we can do this, we should. We are talking about morality here, the stuff made out of \u2018should\u2019s. If we can make future generations more caring, more disposed to virtue, more respectful of rational agency, more attentive to achieving the best outcomes \u2013 however morality works, we should help future people to do what they should do. That is what \u2018should\u2019 means. This thought is especially compelling when we realize that some of our moral goals, like ending racism or addressing the injustices climate change will bring, are necessarily intergenerational projects. The people of the future are the ones who will have to complete the moral journey we have begun. Why not give them a head start?</p>\n<p>But there are also reasons to think we should not interfere with whatever course the future of morality might take. For one thing, we ought to be extremely confident that our moral attitudes are the right ones before we risk crimping the possibilities for radical moral change. Perhaps we are that confident about some issues, but it would be unreasonable to be so sure across the board. Think, for example, about moral attitudes toward the idea of ownership of digital media: whether sampling, remixing, and curating count as forms of intellectual theft. Already there appear to be generational splits on this topic, driven by technology that emerged only in the last 30 years. Would you feel confident trying to preordain moral attitudes about forms of media that won\u2019t be invented for a century?</p>\n<p>More insidiously, there is the possibility that our existing moral attitudes already reflect the influence of problematic political ideologies and economic forces. If we decide to impose a shape on the moral attitudes of the future, then the technology that facilitates this patterning will likely be in the hands of those who benefit from existing power structures. We may end up creating generations of people less willing to question harmful or oppressive social norms. Finally, we should consider whether any attempt to direct the development of morality is disrespectful to the free agency of future people. They will see our thumbprint on their moral scale, and they may rightly resent our influence even as they cannot escape it.</p>\n<p>One thing these reflections bring out is that philosophers are mistaken when they attempt to cleanly separate metaethical questions (what morality is) from normative ethical questions (what we should do). If this clean separation was ever tenable, our technologically expanded control over the future makes it implausible now. We face imminent questions about what we should <i>do</i> \u2013 which policies and technologies to employ, to which ends \u2013 that depend upon our answers to questions about what morality <i>is</i>. Are there objective moral facts? Can we know them? What is the relationship between morality and human freedom? The idea that metaethical inquiry is for dusty scholars, disconnected from our ordinary social and political lives, is an idea that fades entirely from view when we look to the moral future.</p>\n\n--------------------------------------<p>\n<p><small>I\u2019ve drawn on several philosophers\u2019 work for some of the arguments above. For arguments in favor of using technology to direct the morality of future generations, see Thomas Douglas, \u201cMoral Enhancement\u201d in the <i>Journal of Practical Ethics</i>; and Ingmar Persson and Julian Savulescu, <i>Unfit for the Future</i>. For arguments against doing so, see Bernard Williams, <i>Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy</i> (chapter 9); and Jurgen Habermas, <i>The Future of Human Nature</i>.</small></p>\n<p><small><i>image credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/leader_maximo/2889103451/\">\u2019Hope in a better future\u2019 by Massimo Valiani</a></i></small></p>\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/09/ethics-metaethics-and-future-of-morality.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-09-11T10:27:00-07:00\">10:27 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=964662458620379034\" onclick=\"\">12\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Regina%20Rini\" rel=\"tag\">Regina Rini</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, September 01, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2569595178446156008\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/09/a-defense-of-rights-of-artificial.html\">A Defense of the Rights of Artificial Intelligences</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>... a new essay in draft, which I've done collaboratively with a student named <a href=\"http://narziss.net/\">Mara</a> (whose last name is currently in flux and not finally settled).<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-7ovyNMRxPQI/VeYHofguVjI/AAAAAAAABAk/YfWYs3kFL_I/s1600/robotrights.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-7ovyNMRxPQI/VeYHofguVjI/AAAAAAAABAk/YfWYs3kFL_I/s400/robotrights.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nThis essay draws together ideas from several past blog posts including:\n<li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/01/our-possible-imminent-divinity.html\">Our Possible Imminent Divinity</a> (Jan. 2, 2014)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/our-moral-duties-to-artificial.html\">Our Moral Duties to Artificial Intelligences</a> (Jan. 14, 2015)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/two-arguments-for-ai-or-robot-rights-no.html\">Two Arguments for AI (or Robot) Rights</a> (Jan. 16, 2015)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-robots-and-monsters-might-break.html\">How Robots and Monsters Might Break Human Moral Systems</a> (Feb. 3, 2015)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/cute-ai-and-asimo-problem.html\">Cute AI and the ASIMO Problem</a> (July 24, 2015)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/08/weird-minds-might-destabilize-human.html\">How Weird Minds Might Destabilize Ethics</a> (Aug. 3, 2015)</li>\n------------------------------------------<p>\n\nAbstract:<p>\n<b>There are possible artificially intelligent beings who do not differ in any morally relevant respect from human beings.</b>  Such possible beings would deserve moral consideration similar to that of human beings.  Our duties to them would not be appreciably reduced by the fact that they are non-human, nor by the fact that they owe their existence to us.  <b>Indeed, if they owe their existence to us, we would likely have additional moral obligations to them that we don\u2019t ordinarily owe to human strangers</b> \u2013 obligations similar to those of parent to child or god to creature.  Given our moral obligations to such AIs, two principles for ethical AI design recommend themselves: (1) design AIs that tend to provoke reactions from users that accurately reflect the AIs\u2019 real moral status, and (2) avoid designing AIs whose moral status is unclear.  Since human moral intuition and moral theory evolved and developed in contexts without AI, those intuitions and theories might break down or become destabilized when confronted with the wide range of weird minds that AI design might make possible.<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights.htm\">Full version available here</a>.<p>\n\nAs always, comments warmly welcomed -- either by email or on this blog post.

Heaven 1c is no place to live.  Earth is not your toy.<p>\n\nWe have had this conversation before, a theme with variations.<p>\n\nGod\u2019s argument 1: Without God, we wouldn\u2019t exist \u2013 at least not in these particular instantiations \u2013 and he wouldn\u2019t have installed my Earth if he couldn\u2019t goof around with it.  His fun is a fair price to keep the computational cycles going.  God\u2019s argument 2: Do I have some problem with a Heavenly life of constant bliss and musical achievement?  Is there, like, some superior project I have in mind?  Publishing more [sarcastic expletive] philosophy articles, maybe?<p>\n\nI ask God if he would sacrifice his life on original Earth to live in Heaven 1c.<p>\n\nIn a minute, says God.  In a [expletive-expletive-creative-compound-expletive] minute!  You guys are the lucky ones.  One week in Heaven 1c is more joy than any of us real people could feel in a lifetime.  So [expletive-your-unusual-sexual-practice].<p>\n\nThe Asian war continues; God likes to hijack and command the soldiers from one side or the other or to introduce new monsters and catastrophes.  I watch as God zooms to an Indian soldier who is screaming and bleeding to death from a bullet wound in his stomach, his friends desperately trying to save him.  God spawns a ball of carnivorous ants in the soldier\u2019s mouth.  Soon, God says, this guy will be praising my wisdom.<p>\n\nI am silent for a few minutes while God enjoys his army men.  Then I venture a new variation on the argumentative theme.  I say: If bliss is all you want, have you considered your mom\u2019s medicine cabinet?\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/08/a-philosophy-professor-discovers-hes-ai.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-08-27T11:26:00-07:00\">11:26 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6176057134723936445\" onclick=\"\">11\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/artificial%20intelligence\" rel=\"tag\">artificial intelligence</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, August 13, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3356922570886284332\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/08/weird-minds-might-destabilize-human.html\">Weird Minds Might Destabilize Human Ethics</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Intuitive physics works great for picking berries, throwing stones, and walking through light underbrush.  It's a complete disaster when applied to the very large, the very small, the very energetic, or the very fast.  Similarly for intuitive biology, intuitive cosmology, and intuitive mathematics: They succeed for practical purposes across long-familiar types of cases, but when extended too far they go wildly astray.<p>\n\nHow about intuitive ethics?<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-FPdqKV1IJUQ/VczLZIp3erI/AAAAAAAAA_U/7wbECoyo-Xw/s1600/MindParts.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-FPdqKV1IJUQ/VczLZIp3erI/AAAAAAAAA_U/7wbECoyo-Xw/s320/MindParts.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nI incline toward moral realism.  I think that there are moral facts that people can get right or wrong.  Hitler's moral attitudes were not just different from ours but actually mistaken.  The twentieth century \"rights revolutions\" weren't just change but real progress.  I worry that <b>if artificial intelligence research continues to progress, intuitive ethics might encounter a range of cases for which it is as ill prepared as intuitive physics was for quantum entanglement and relativistic time dilation.</b><p>\n\nIntuitive ethics was shaped in a context where the only species capable of human-grade practical and theoretical reasoning was humanity itself, and where human variation tended to stay within certain boundaries.  It would be unsurprising if intuitive ethics were unprepared for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster\">utility monsters</a> (capable of superhuman degrees of pleasure or pain), <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-robots-and-monsters-might-break.html\">fission-fusion monsters</a> (who can merge and divide at will), AIs of vastly superhuman intelligence, cheerfully suicidal AI slaves, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/cute-ai-and-asimo-problem.html\">conscious toys with features specifically designed to capture children's affection</a>, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/01/our-possible-imminent-divinity.html\">giant virtual sim-worlds containing genuinely conscious beings over which we have godlike power</a>, or entities with radically different value systems.  We might expect human moral judgment to be be baffled by such cases and to deliver wrong or contradictory or unstable verdicts.<p>\n<b>For physics and biology, we have pretty good scientific theories by which to correct our intuitive judgments,</b> so it's no problem if we leave ordinary judgment behind in such matters.  <b>However, it's not clear that we have, or will have, such a replacement in ethics.</b>  There are, of course, ambitious ethical theories -- \"maximize happiness\", \"act on that maxim that you can at the same time will to be a universal law\" -- but the development and adjudication of such theories depends, and might inevitably depend, on our intuitive judgments about such cases.  It's because we intuitively or pre-theoretically think we shouldn't give all our cookies to the utility monster or kill ourselves to tile the solar system with <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ig8/hedonium_promotion/\">hedonium</a> that we reject the straightforward extension of utilitarian happiness-maximizing theory to such cases and reach for a different solution.  But if our commonplace ethical judgments about such cases are not to be trusted, because these cases are too far beyond what we can reasonably expect human moral intuition to handle well, what then?  Maybe we <i>should </i>kill ourselves to tile the solar system with hedonium (the minimal collection of atoms capable of feeling pleasure), and we're just unable to appreciate this fact with moral theories shaped for our limited ancestral environments?<p>\n\nOr maybe morality is <i>constructed </i>from our judgments and folkways, so that whatever moral facts there are, they are just the moral facts that we (or idealized versions of ourselves) think there are?  Much like an object's being red, on a certain view of the nature of color, consists in its being such that ordinary human perceivers in normal conditions would experience it as red, maybe an action's being morally right just consists in its being such that ordinary human beings who considered the matter carefully would regard it as right?  (This is a huge, complicated topic in metaethics, e.g., <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fitting-attitude-theories/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-sentimentalism/#SubIdeDis\">here</a>.)  If we take this approach, then morality might change as our sense of the world changes -- and as who counts as \"we\" changes.  Maybe we could decide to give fission-fusion monsters some rights but not other rights, and shape future institutions accordingly.  <b>The unsettled nature of our intuitions about such cases, then, might present an opportunity for us to shape morality -- real morality, the real (or real enough) moral facts -- in one direction rather than another, by shaping our future reactions and habits.</b><p>\n\nMaybe different social groups would make different choices with different consequences for group survival, introducing cultural evolution into the mix.  Moral confusion might open into a range of choices for moral architecture.<p>\n<b>However, the range of legitimate choices is, I'm inclined to think, constrained by certain immovable moral facts</b>, such as that it would be a moral disaster if the most successful future society constructed human-grade AIs, as self-aware as we are, as anxious about their future, and as capable of joy and suffering, simply to torture, enslave, and kill them for no good reason.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\nRelated posts:\n<li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/two-arguments-for-ai-or-robot-rights-no.html\">Two Arguments for AI (or Robot) Rights</a> (Jan. 16, 2015)</li><li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-robots-and-monsters-might-break.html\">How Robots and Monsters Might Break Human Moral Systems</a> (Feb. 3, 2015)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/cute-ai-and-asimo-problem.html\">Cute AI and the ASIMO Problem</a> (Jul. 24, 2015)</li>\n<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------</p>\n\nThanks to Ever Eigengrau for extensive discussion.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-philosophy-of-mind-uploading-series.html\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/08/weird-minds-might-destabilize-human.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-08-13T11:21:00-07:00\">11:21 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3356922570886284332\" onclick=\"\">33\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/artificial%20intelligence\" rel=\"tag\">artificial intelligence</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, July 24, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4831718674600068255\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/cute-ai-and-asimo-problem.html\">Cute AI and the ASIMO Problem</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>A couple of years ago, I saw the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ceMnoFsxw8\">ASIMO show</a> at Disneyland.  <a href=\"http://asimo.honda.com/\">ASIMO</a> is a robot designed by Honda to walk bipedally with something like the human gait.  I'd entered the auditorium with a somewhat negative attitude about ASIMO, having read <a href=\"http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/routledge-lectures/clark-routledge\">Andy Clark's critique</a> of Honda's computationally-heavy approach to robotic locomotion (fuller treatment <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Supersizing-Mind-Embodiment-Cognitive-Philosophy/dp/0199773688\">here</a>); and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwJP5h2ESAg\">animatronic Mr. Lincoln</a> is no great shakes.<p>\n\nBut ASIMO is cute!  He's about four feet tall, humanoid, with big round dark eyes inside what looks a bit like an astronaut's helmet.  He talks, he dances, he kicks soccer balls, he makes funny hand gestures.  On the Disneyland stage, he keeps up a fun patter with a human actor.  ASIMO's gait isn't quite human, but his nervous-looking crouching run only makes him that much cuter.  By the end of the show I thought that if you gave me a shotgun and told me to blow off ASIMO's head, I'd be very reluctant to do so.  (In contrast, I might quite enjoy taking a shotgun to my darn glitchy laptop.)<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-MLPkf9sQ4FU/VbKJuC4AtCI/AAAAAAAAA9M/ZVPZKrfNDDg/s1600/ASIMO.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-MLPkf9sQ4FU/VbKJuC4AtCI/AAAAAAAAA9M/ZVPZKrfNDDg/s400/ASIMO.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nAnother case: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA\">ELIZA</a> was a simple computer program written in the 1960s that would chat with a user, using a small template of pre-programmed responses to imitate a non-directive psychotherapist (\u201cAre such questions on your mind often?\u201d, \u201cTell me more about your mother.\u201d)  Apparently, some users mistook it for human and spent long periods chatting with it.<p>\n\nI assume that ASIMO and ELIZA are not proper targets of substantial moral concern.  They have no more consciousness than a laptop computer, no more capacity for genuine joy and suffering.  However, because they share some of the superficial features of human beings, people might come improperly to regard them as targets of moral concern.  And future engineers could presumably create entities with an even better repertoire of superficial tricks.  Discussing this issue with my sister, she mentioned a friend who had been designing a laptop that would scream and cry when its battery runs low.  Imagine that!<p>\n\nConversely, suppose that it's someday possible to create an Artificial Intelligence so advanced that it has genuine consciousness, a genuine sense of self, real joy, and real suffering.  If that AI also happens to be ugly or boxy or poorly interfaced, it might tend to attract less moral concern than is warranted.<p>\n\nThus, our emotional responses to AIs might be misaligned with the moral status of those AIs, due to superficial features that are out of step with the AI's real cognitive and emotional capacities.<p>\n\nIn the <i>Star Trek</i> episode \"<a href=\"http://www.startrek.com/database_article/measure-of-a-man\">The Measure of a Man</a>\", a scientist who wants to disassemble the humanoid robot Data (sympathetically portrayed by a human actor) says of the robot, \"If it were a box on wheels, I would not be facing this opposition.\"  He also points out that people normally think nothing of upgrading the computer systems of a starship, though that means discarding a highly intelligent AI.<p>\n\nI have a cute stuffed teddy bear I bring to my philosophy of mind class on the day devoted to animal minds.  Students scream in shock when without warning in the middle of the class, I suddenly punch the teddy bear in the face.<p>\n\nEvidence from developmental and social psychology suggests that we are swift to attribute mental states to entities with eyes and movement patterns that look goal directed, much slower to attribute mentality to eyeless entities with inertial movement patterns.   But of course such superficial features needn\u2019t track underlying mentality very well in AI cases.<p>\n\nCall this <i>the ASIMO Problem</i>.<p>\n\nI draw two main lessons from the ASIMO Problem.<p>\n\nFirst is a methodological lesson: In thinking about the moral status of AI, we should be careful not to overweight emotional reactions and intuitive judgments that might be driven by such superficial features.  Low-quality science fiction -- especially low-quality science fiction films and television -- does often rely on audience reaction to such superficial features.  However, thoughtful science fiction sometimes challenges or even inverts these reactions.<p>\n\nThe second lesson is a bit of AI design advice.  As responsible creators of artificial entities, we should want people to neither over- nor under-attribute moral status to the entities with which they interact.  <b>Thus, we should generally try to avoid designing entities that don\u2019t deserve moral consideration but to which normal users are nonetheless inclined to give substantial moral consideration.</b>  This might be especially important in the design of children\u2019s toys: Manufacturers might understandably be tempted to create artificial pets or friends that children will love and attach to -- but we presumably don\u2019t want children to attach to a non-conscious toy instead of to parents or siblings.  Nor do we presumably want to invite situations in which users might choose to save an endangered toy over an an endangered human being!<p>\n\nOn the other hand, <b>if we do someday create genuinely human-grade AIs who merit substantial moral concern, it would probably be advisable to design them in a way that would evoke the proper range of moral emotional responses from normal users.</b><p>\n\nWe should embrace an <i>Emotional Alignment Design Policy:</i> Design the superficial features of AIs in such a way that they evoke the moral emotional reactions are appropriate to the real moral status of the AI, whatever it is, neither more nor less.<p>\n\n(What <i>is </i>the real moral status of AIs?

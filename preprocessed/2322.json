So it\u2019s for your own good, really, that for the third time in a row I will close out the year with a look back at The History Blog\u2019s 2013.</p>\n<p>First a little glimpse into the statistical man behind the curtain. This year we had 1,570,000 total pageviews, slightly short of last year\u2019s high of 1,650,546. That\u2019s actually way better than I expected, because earlier this year I experienced for the first time the frigid wrath of a Google denied. You might recall that towards the end of January <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/22964\" target=\"_blank\">the blog moved to a new server</a>. This was made necessary by my unquenchable thirst for large pictures taking up so much space that I finally had to ditch the old one and move to a plan that gave me room to grow. </p>\n<p>Or so I thought. In fact, it was a complete disaster, way too small to handle my bandwidth and even the overall hard drive space was larger, it was still pretty damn stingy in terms of file size maximums. As soon as the blog moved, it was taken down by an exceeded bandwidth error and remained down for what felt like an eternity but was actually something like eight hours. </p>\n<p>As far as Google\u2019s algorithms are concerned, those eight hours might as well have been an eternity. The high ranking I had built up over six years of daily blogging plummeted resulting in a dramatic drop in traffic. I watched, horrified, as my views per day plunged to levels not seen since the end of 2011, beginning of 2012, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do about it. A second bandwidth exceeded takedown <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24353\" target=\"_blank\">struck at the end of March</a> and that was the end of my dealings with that server company. I <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24661\" target=\"_blank\">moved to a new service</a> (hi <a href=\"http://www.westhost.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Westhost</a>! Love you guys!) in mid-April with unlimited everything and it\u2019s been smooth sailing ever since. </p>\n<p>Alas, the search engines weren\u2019t done punishing me. They still aren\u2019t done, in fact. The numbers only started to crawl back up in September, believe it or not, and even now we\u2019re tens of thousands of views away from the intoxicating highs of January. I am very much looking forward to the new year so I can draw a firm albeit arbitrary line after the Bad Days and usher in Better Days, daring even to hope they might be Best Days.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-28538\" height=\"77\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats-430x77.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats-430x77.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats-150x27.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats-200x36.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats.jpg 1231w\" title=\"Monthly stats\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The busiest new entry this year was the one about <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27678\" target=\"_blank\">the Seikilos epitaph</a>, the oldest ancient song to survive complete with lyrics and musical notation, sung by Newcastle University Classics professor Dr. David Creese. It got 7,811 views on November 3rd, most of them courtesy of <a href=\"http://io9.com/listen-to-performances-of-the-worlds-oldest-complete-s-1457475368\" target=\"_blank\">a link from io9</a>. Overall this year the Seikilos epitaph got 13,254 pageviews. That wasn\u2019t the most viewed entry of the year, however. That honor goes to last year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17003\" target=\"_blank\">Hatfields &amp; McCoys entry</a>, which continues to draw crazy traffic with 22,719 views in 2013. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-23336\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pauline Bonaparte's slippers, inscription on the bottom sole\" width=\"150\"/></a>My favorite incoming link of the year wasn\u2019t about bringing in the view numbers, though, which were tiny. It was from a Greek foot fetish forum in which the virtues of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23324\" target=\"_blank\">Napoleon\u2019s sister\u2019s tiny feet and shoes</a> were extolled. I loved it because it\u2019s the perfect niche audience to appreciate details like the memoirs describing Pauline Bonaparte\u2019s terribly risqu\u00e9e pedicures. </p>\n<p>It was a great year overall for the audio-visual arts. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24298\" target=\"_blank\">Notre Dame got some much-needed new bells for her 850th birthday</a> and on Palm Sunday they made a glorious noise along with the one surviving pre-Revolutionary bell, Emmanuel, installed in 1685. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27174\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Pickford\u2019s first star-billing film was restored</a> and shown after being found in barn. Orson Welles\u2019 long-lost second film, <em>Too Much Johnson</em> (yes I do snicker at that every time), debuted in theaters in Italy and the US after years of painstaking restoration. Meanwhile, in France, the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27511\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s oldest surviving movie theater reopened</a> after an extensive renovation.</p>\n<p>I found the rare sound recordings of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23732\" target=\"_blank\">Florence Nightingale, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Martin Leonard Lanfried, trumpeter of the 17th Lancers,</a> hauntingly beautiful. I loved hearing Florence Nightingale express hope in the recording itself that her voice might keep her cause alive long after her death. Audio recording technology was so new then, but her instincts were right on the money. We also got to enjoy the distinct privilege of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24871\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Graham Bell</a> ordering us to hear his voice. The first and only known recording of Alexander Graham Bell, it allows this great inventor of live voice transmission technology to finally transmit his own voice to us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26739\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Edith Russell's musical pig that saved her from the sinking of the Titanic\" width=\"150\"/></a>Advanced technology revived the music played by the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26734\" target=\"_blank\">the toy pig that saved its owner\u2019s life during the sinking of the <em>Titanic</em></a>, but to be honest the music was less important to me than the pig itself, which is adorable. I simply <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28309\" target=\"_blank\">cannot resist an adorable pig</a>.</p>\n<p>Nor can I resist a good, solid medical oddity, which is probably for the best because there\u2019s nothing like an <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/22944\" target=\"_blank\">ancient calcified teratoma from the pelvis of Roman woman</a> to counterbalance the cute piggies.

So many things that should not be touched due to condition issues will be able to be examined again thanks to the combination of laser scanning and 3D printing. It\u2019s Anna Maria\u2019s herculean efforts in saving the patrimony of her famous family, the greatest patrons of the some of the greatest art ever made, that should grant her an august place in history. She\u2019s nowhere near as well known as she should be, since she single-handedly ensured that the art that makes Florence a top tourist destination today remain in the city rather than get plundered and scattered around the courts of Europe after her death in 1743.</p>\n<p>Anna Maria\u2019s story was probably my favorite biographical post of the year.

Scott built the cabin during his ill-fated last expedition to the South Pole (the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910-1913) that would claim his life. He didn\u2019t leave the pictures behind, though. The photographs were taken during Ernest Shackleton\u2019s Ross Sea Party, part of the 1914-1917 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. The crew was there in advance of Shackleton on a depot-laying mission to ensure the explorer would have regular supply stops along his route to the South Pole. Ten of them wound up stranded on Ross Island after the team\u2019s ship, the <em>Aurora</em>, blew out to sea on an ice floe during a gale in May of 1915.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Peeling-apart-negatives.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-28524\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Peeling-apart-negatives-200x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Peeling-apart-negatives-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Peeling-apart-negatives-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Peeling-apart-negatives-430x282.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Peeling-apart-negatives.jpg 670w\" title=\"Peeling apart the negatives\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Antarctic Heritage Trust has been documenting and restoring Scott\u2019s hut, thus far conserving more than 10,000 objects.

Arnold Patrick Spencer-Smith was the Ross expedition\u2019s photographer, so in all likelihood it\u2019s his work. Unfortunately Spencer-Smith did not survive his stranding. The <em>Aurora</em> limped into Dunedin, New Zealand on April 3rd, 1916. It needed extensive repairs and refitting and there was no money to do it. Finally the Australian, New Zealand and British governments funded a rescue mission and the <em>Aurora</em> set off, with Shackleton himself on board albeit not in command, to recover its crew. By the time the <em>Aurora</em> returned to  Cape Evans in January of 1917, three of the ten crew members left behind had died, the photographer among them.

The rare couple burials are among 600 graves dating to between the 17th and 14th centuries B.C. from the Bronze Age Andronovo culture. Although some subsets of the nomadic Eurasian cultural family cremated their dead, others are well known for inhuming them in crouched positions. The discovery that gave them their modern name, in fact, was a number of burials found in the village of Andronovo, southern Siberia, in 1914.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Parents-with-children.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-28506\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Parents-with-children-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Parents-with-children-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Parents-with-children-200x248.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Parents-with-children-430x535.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Parents-with-children.jpg 720w\" title=\"Parents with children?\" width=\"120\"/></a>Unlike the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12797\" target=\"_blank\">Lovers of Valdaro</a> and the so-called <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24838\" target=\"_blank\">Romanian \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d</a>, these burials are not necessarily romantic pairings.

The women paired with men could have been sacrificed after the death of the man, for example, as in some Scythian burials. It could have been a form of posthumous or ghost marriage, a practice seen in many cultures from Asia (China, India) to Africa (Sudan) and Europe (France during World War I). Alternatively, bodies could have been added over time and carefully positioned with the previous resident(s) of the grave instead of interred simultaneously. The symbolism could be more familial than romantic, an homage to the burgeoning importance of the nuclear family unit.</p>\n<p>Researchers are hoping <a href=\"http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/features/modern-science-to-unlock-the-secrets-of-couples-holding-each-other-in-loving-embrace-for-3500-years/\" target=\"_blank\">DNA analysis may illuminate the relationships between the buried</a> and thus answer some of these questions.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Buried-couple.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-28501\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Buried-couple-137x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Buried-couple-137x150.jpg 137w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Buried-couple-200x218.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Buried-couple-430x469.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Buried-couple.jpg 720w\" title=\"Buried couple\" width=\"137\"/></a>\u201c[W]e need to firstly establish unequivocally the kinship of those who were buried,\u201d said Professor Molodin [of the Institute of Archeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences] referring to the necropolis close to the confluence of the rivers Tartas and Om. \u201cUntil recently archaeologists had no such opportunity, they could establish only the gender and age.

King Wen directly blames the Shang king\u2019s alcoholism for the fall of his dynasty:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI have heard it said likewise, that the last successor of those kings was addicted to drink, so that no charges came from him brightly before the people, and he was (as if) reverently and unchangingly bent on doing and cherishing what provoked resentment. Greatly abandoned to extraordinary lewdness and dissipation, for pleasure\u2019s sake he sacrificed all his majesty. The people were all sorely grieved and wounded in heart; but he gave himself wildly up to drink, not thinking of restraining himself. but continuing his excess, till his mind was frenzied, and he had no fear of death His crimes (accumulated) in the capital of Shang: and though the extinction of the dynasty (was imminent), this gave him no concern, and he wrought not that any sacrifices of fragrant virtue might ascend to Heaven. The rank odour of the people\u2019s resentments, and the drunkenness of his herd of creatures, went loudly up on high, so that Heaven sent down ruin on Yin, and showed no love for it \u2013 because of such excesses. There is not any cruel oppression of Heaven; people themselves accelerate their guilt, (and its punishment)).\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>He is very keen, therefore, to ensure his own people do not fall victim to the dangers of spirits. </p>\n<blockquote><p>King Wen admonished and instructed the young nobles, who were charged with office or in any employment, that they should not ordinarily use spirits; and throughout all the states, he required that such should drink spirits only on occasion of sacrifices, and that then virtue should preside so that there might be no drunkenness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And should admonishment not suffice, then sterner measures are in order.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIf you are informed that there are companies that drink together, do not fail to apprehend them all, and send them here to Zhou, where I may put them to death. As to the ministers and officers of Yin who were led to it and became addicted to drink, it is not necessary to put them to death (at once); let them be taught for a time. If they follow these (lessons of mine), I will give them bright distinction. If they disregard my lessons, then I, the One man, will show them no pity.

Zaballa is one of 300 rural settlements in the \u00c1lava region that were deserted hundreds of years ago. It\u2019s the one that has been most thoroughly excavated and published.</p>\n<p>Discovering the history of this remote, rural site is a challenge because there is very little written documentation and few surviving structures or archaeological materials. The only stone building was the 10th century church while peasant dwellings have long since disappeared. Not even pottery has been found because there was a general dearth of such daily use items in the archaeological record of the Basque Country during the early Middle Ages compared to other periods. Recent agricultural use of the land has also damaged the site.</p>\n<p>This discovery, therefore, is of particular interest to archaeologists since it provides new information about the way the land was used and provides a glimpse into the unrecorded social history of its occupation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cArchaeo-botanical studies of seed remains found in the excavations and pollen studies have provided material evidence of the existence of vine cultivation in a relatively early period like the 10th century,\u201d explained [Juan Antonio Quir\u00f3s-Castillo, director of the University\u2019s Cultural Heritage and Landscapes Research Group]. This evidence is also supported by the metal tools discovered and which had been destined for this very use, and the study of the agrarian spaces, \u201cwhich owing to the nature of the crop spaces built and the agrarian practices developed, they are not compatible with cereal crops but they are with vines,\u201d he added.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Zaballa was occupied beginning with one small farm in the 6th century. That developed into a peasant village in the 8th century. An aristocratic family appears to have taken control in the second half of the 10th century, marked by the construction of a stone church in the village center. This is confirmed by the scant documentary evidence we do have of Zaballa written in 1087 that describes a monastery, probably the nearby Saint Tirso monastery, founded by lordly Castilian family of Tello Mu\u00f1oz. The village was soon rebuilt in the neighboring valley while around the church large silos were built to collect the percentage of the peasants\u2019 agricultural product claimed by the ruling family. The silos suggest grain cultivation. The discovery of the earlier vineyards points to a major reorganization of Zaballa\u2019s planting culture.</p>\n<p>There are no other buildings found in the area that indicate the presence of the family in the area in the 11th and 12th centuries, just a hoard of 30 coins and some jewelry from the late 11th century, so it seems likely that the lords were absentee landowners. In the 13th century the village was partially abandoned as the aristocracy streamlined its agricultural output, possibly to increase revenues during an economic downturn. Some of the population probably moved to the new towns growing in the region. By the beginning of the 15th century, Zaballa was under the control of the monastery of Badaya and within a few decades the monks evicted the remaining villagers so they could reorganize the land under their own rules. That was basically the end of the human occupation of the settlement, except for a short spurt at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century.</p>\n<p>Almost all of this information is the result of archaeological study, and even though it seems like a relatively obscure pursuit given the tiny size of the settlement and its long-since abandonment, it paints a portrait of people who lived and worked in the area for nearly a thousand years but never made it into the historical record.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Quir\u00f3s\u2019 view, these microhistories constitute small windows into the past that allow one to analyse relatively complex historical processes directly, bottom upwards, \u201cin other words, to see how the peasant community itself gradually adapts to the political and economic changes that take place in the medieval era and later.\u201d</p>\n<p>What is more, the analytical study of these places of production allows one to abandon those more traditional points of view of history which \u201cconceptualize the high medieval periods as a time of technical simplification, as a meagre period in economic terms, since they point to considerable social and economic complexity. Specifically, it has been possible in these studies to see that there are various important moments in the Basque Country, 5th to 6th centuries and 10th to 11th centuries, which were decisive in the construction of our landscapes.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Aerial-view-of-the-deserted-Alavese-village-at-Zaballa.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-28473\" height=\"286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Aerial-view-of-the-deserted-Alavese-village-at-Zaballa-430x286.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Aerial-view-of-the-deserted-Alavese-village-at-Zaballa-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Aerial-view-of-the-deserted-Alavese-village-at-Zaballa-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Aerial-view-of-the-deserted-Alavese-village-at-Zaballa-200x133.jpg 200w\" title=\"Aerial view of the deserted Alavese village at Zaballa\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"1000-year-old vineyards found in Basque Country\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28465\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28465#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-28457\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28457\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to British Library releases 1 million images\">British Library releases 1 million images</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, December 26th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Poems-by-William-Mason-1764.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-28461\" height=\"166\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Poems-by-William-Mason-1764-200x166.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Poems-by-William-Mason-1764-200x166.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Poems-by-William-Mason-1764-150x124.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Poems-by-William-Mason-1764-430x357.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Poems-by-William-Mason-1764.jpg 1235w\" title='Images from \"Poems\" by William Mason, 1764' width=\"200\"/></a>The British Library has released more than one million high resolution images scanned from public domain books from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/\" target=\"_blank\">on their Flickr account</a>.

The final panorama was more than 21 feet long and 8 feet tall, made out of five poplar wood panels. Despite its unwieldiness, the painting has lived a peripatetic existence, moving around to various locations until in the early 19th century it settled in Florence\u2019s Basilica of Santa Croce. It was there that it met its greatest foe: the great flood of 1966. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Santa-Croce-during-1966-flood.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-28449\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Santa-Croce-during-1966-flood-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Santa-Croce-during-1966-flood-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Santa-Croce-during-1966-flood-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Santa-Croce-during-1966-flood-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Santa Croce during the 1966 flood\" width=\"150\"/></a>Just a few blocks from the banks of the Arno and at a lower elevation than much of the rest of the city, Santa Croce was hit first and hit hardest by the flood. The high point of the flood, more than 22 feet, was in the Santa Croce area. Water flooded the church\u2019s cloister, the crypt and the Museo dell\u2019 Opera in the refectory. In addition to the Vasari <em>Last Supper</em>, the museum held one of the great masterpieces of 13th century art, the <em>Crucifix</em> by Cimabue, one of only three surviving crucifixes by the artist whose break from the stylized conventions of Italo-Byzantine design was a major influence on the Renaissance humanists that would follow him. It was flooded to Christ\u2019s halo.</p>\n<p>Santa Croce remained under water for more than 12 hours, longer than anywhere else, saturating wood panel paintings like the Cimabue and Vasari\u2019s <em>Last Supper</em>. Things only got worse when the waters receded. The muddy water, thick with debris, diesel oil, naphtha and sewage, dragged paint off the surface of art works (the <em>Crucifix</em> lost 60% of its paint; staff literally sifted through the water and mud to recover any fragment of the original paint they could) and coated it with scum. The wood under Vasari\u2019s painting was the consistency of a sponge after its 12 hours underwater. The primer layer of gesso underlying the painted surface absorbed so much water that the paint lost adherence and began to peel and flake.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Positioning-the-panel-vertically-to-align-joint-margins.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-28446\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Positioning-the-panel-vertically-to-align-joint-margins-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Positioning-the-panel-vertically-to-align-joint-margins-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Positioning-the-panel-vertically-to-align-joint-margins-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Positioning-the-panel-vertically-to-align-joint-margins-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Positioning the panels vertically to align joint margins\" width=\"150\"/></a>In order to dry <em>The Last Supper</em> as quickly as possible, museum staff had to separate the five panels making up the piece and coat the surface with rice paper to keep the paint attached. Even so, the wood contracted as it dried and the surface cracked in multiple places. It took restorers 10 years to put the Cimabue back together again. The Vasari was so devastated they didn\u2019t even try. They stored it in a cool place with controlled humidity and just waited until the technology and funding made conservation possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ciro-Castelli-came-out-of-retirement-to-help-restore-the-work-and-train-younger-conservators.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-28450\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ciro-Castelli-came-out-of-retirement-to-help-restore-the-work-and-train-younger-conservators-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ciro-Castelli-came-out-of-retirement-to-help-restore-the-work-and-train-younger-conservators-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ciro-Castelli-came-out-of-retirement-to-help-restore-the-work-and-train-younger-conservators-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ciro-Castelli-came-out-of-retirement-to-help-restore-the-work-and-train-younger-conservators-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ciro Castelli and younger conservators work on structural supports\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was a long wait. A 44 year wait, to be precise. In 2010, the Getty Foundation awarded a $400,000 grant to Florence\u2019s prestigious restoration institute, the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, to conserve <em>The Last Supper</em> and train a new generation of panel-painting conservators to replace the current generation who are due to retire within a decade. Unlike canvas painting restorers, panel work requires a detailed understanding of carpentry and the function of wooden supports. Two experts, Ciro Castelli and Mauro Parri, came out of retirement to work on this project. The former began working as a conservator a few months after the flood and he personally participated in the efforts to stabilize and conserve some of the most damaged paintings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Vasari-Last-Supper-reassembled.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-28447\" height=\"168\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Vasari-Last-Supper-reassembled-200x168.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Vasari-Last-Supper-reassembled-200x168.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Vasari-Last-Supper-reassembled-150x126.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Vasari-Last-Supper-reassembled-430x361.jpg 430w\" title=\"Giorgio Vasari's Last Supper reassembled for the first time in nearly 50 years\" width=\"200\"/></a>Seven conservators of varying experience have been learning from and collaborating with the old pros. Together they worked out a structural solution based on Vasari\u2019s original innovative support structure. Because the cloistered sisters of the Murate Convent did not want Vasari and his assistants working among them for however long it would take them to finish the piece, Vasari was compelled to make the panels portable and joinable. One of his unusual cross-supports is still in place. This served as a model for the conservation team who were able to stabilize the panels and <a href=\"http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/giorgio-vasaris-monumental-painting-last-supper-reemerges-after-nearly-50-years/\" target=\"_blank\">rejoin them for the first time in almost 50 years</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Detached-paint-film-due-to-of-leaching-of-gesso-binder.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-28444\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Detached-paint-film-due-to-of-leaching-of-gesso-binder-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Detached-paint-film-due-to-of-leaching-of-gesso-binder-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Detached-paint-film-due-to-of-leaching-of-gesso-binder-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Detached-paint-film-due-to-of-leaching-of-gesso-binder-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detached paint film due to of leaching of gesso binder\" width=\"150\"/></a>The team also focused on removing the rice paper covering the surface and cleaning the disgusting flood detritus from the paint. They found much to their delight that most of the original paint had survived. The estimated paint loss is 20-30%, which while horrendous is nowhere near as bad as they feared it would be. Conservators even found a previously unknown inscription noting an earlier restoration, like much earlier, like 1594, less than 50 years after <em>The Last Supper</em> was painted.</p>\n<p>Superintendent of the OPD Marco Ciatti: </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe Vasari painting was the last major work damaged in the Florence flood to undergo treatment, and the conservation challenges were so complex that we only recently had the technology to begin treatment.

Thankfully, the University of Reading has done all the work for me. Classics professor Dr. Matthew Nicholls, developer of Virtual Rome, a digital model of the ancient city, has compiled a neat rundown of the ancient sources <a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR556505.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">on the Roman festival of Sigillaria</a>. Held on December 23rd, Sigillaria was the culmination of a week of Saturnalia celebrations, a day of gift-giving and quaffing the questionable wine combinations that Romans were so fond of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Quality of presents varied enormously. The traditional present for the Saturnalia was some nuts \u2013 not unlike old fashioned handful of walnuts in a Christmas stocking. Martial mentions \u2018gifts given and received\u2019 some of which sound rather familiar.</p>\n<p>\u201cFish-sauce, jars of honey, bottles of wine, toothpicks, a pencil case, perfume, a flask encased in wicker-work and clothing \u2013 even an item that sounds like an ugly but warm Christmas sweater\u2026a \u2018shaggy nursling of a weaver on the Seine, a barbarian garment \u2026 a thing uncouth but not to be despised in cold December \u2026 that searching cold may not pass into your limbs \u2026 you will laugh at rain and winds, clothed in this gift\u2019. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Uncouth compared to a toga, perhaps, but surely no worse than a tunic, albeit a fuzzy one. Besides, if it comes from the a weaver on the banks of the Seine, that makes it couture by default. Anyway it\u2019s the thought that counts, right? Right!</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s warming to hear that the festive spirit was alive 2000 years ago. Martial tells us that the quality of a friendship can\u2019t be measured by the value of the gifts, and even tells recipients of his cheap presents that he\u2019s been \u2018mean\u2019 to save them the expense of buying something expensive in return (Ep. 5.59: \u2018people who give much, want to receive much in return\u2019). Simple presents were a token of friendship. </p></blockquote>\n<p>In <em>Epigrams</em> <a href=\"http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book13.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Book 13</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book14.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Book 14</a>, Martial makes long lists of what presents to give during the winter festival. The range is vast, from knives to hatchets to nuts to toothpicks to letter-writing parchment to a golden hair pin to <em>pomatum</em>, a hair pomade (spot the etymology) the Germans used to redden their barbarous locks. That\u2019s not the only hair dye on the list either. There are plenty of items Martial would have given his friends that we give today. </p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s all the food. Did you put barley water and large-headed leeks under your tree for the kiddies this year? If you did, I hope you survive to tell the tale.</p>\n<p>Happy belated Sigillaria, all!</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/PXtcri5diuM&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Happy belated Sigillaria!\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28438\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28438#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-28418\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28418\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Thousand-year-old trepanned skulls of the Andes\">Thousand-year-old trepanned skulls of the Andes</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, December 23rd, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trepanation-over-inflamed-bone.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-28420\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trepanation-over-inflamed-bone-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trepanation-over-inflamed-bone-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trepanation-over-inflamed-bone-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trepanation-over-inflamed-bone-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trepanation-over-inflamed-bone.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Trepanation over inflamed bone\" width=\"150\"/></a>UC Santa Barbara archaeologists excavating the south-central Andean province of Andahuaylas, Peru, have unearthed the remains of 32 people whose skulls <a href=\"http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2013/013852/ancient-cranial-surgery\" target=\"_blank\">bear the tell-tale signs of 45 different trepanations</a>. Nine out of the 32 had more than one hole drilled or cut into their skulls. The burials date to the Late Intermediate Period (ca. 1,000-1,250 A.D.), a time of great upheaval following the collapse of the Wari Empire.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cFor about 400 years, from 600 to 1000 AD, the area where I work \u2014 the Andahuaylas \u2014 was living as a prosperous province within an enigmatic empire known as the Wari,\u201d [UC Santa Barbara bioarchaeologist Danielle Kurin] said. \u201cFor reasons still unknown, the empire suddenly collapsed.\u201d And the collapse of civilization, she noted, brings a lot of problems.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it is precisely during times of collapse that we see people\u2019s resilience and moxie coming to the fore,\u201d Kurin continued. \u201cIn the same way that new types of bullet wounds from the Civil War resulted in the development of better glass eyes, the same way IED\u2019s are propelling research in prosthetics in the military today, so, too, did these people in Peru employ trepanation to cope with new challenges like violence, disease and depravation 1,000 years ago.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Incomplete-trepanation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-28421\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Incomplete-trepanation-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Incomplete-trepanation-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Incomplete-trepanation-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Incomplete-trepanation-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Incomplete-trepanation.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Incomplete trepanation\" width=\"150\"/></a>Earlier studies have found that trepanation was frequently used in response to blunt force wounds. One noted that holes were drilled over or next radiating fractures from trauma in 44% of cases, and that figure may be low because the trepanation could easily obscure the evidence of blunt force trauma if the damaged bone was all removed. It follows, therefore, that times of conflict would see an increase in cranial surgery simply because there are more wounds to be treated.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that there blunt trauma was the only condition trepanation was prescribed for. Any cranial affliction from an infection to swelling to a persistent headache could be dealt with via skull drilling surgery. Not everyone was a candidate, however. There was a cultural taboo in the Andahuaylas against trepanning the skulls of women and children. Out of the 32 skulls found, 25 of them are male and only three female (there are four adults whose gender could not be established.)</p>\n<p>The skulls Kurin\u2019s team found displayed a variety of different trepanation techniques: scraping, cutting and hand drilling. In some cases they were administered post-mortem and are clearly experiments just like cadaver studies in med schools today.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAs bioarchaeologists, we can tell that they\u2019re experimenting on recently dead bodies because we can measure the location and depths of the holes they\u2019re drilling,\u201d [Kurin] continued. \u201cIn one example, each hole is drilled a little deeper than the last. So you can imagine a guy in his prehistoric Peruvian medical school practicing with his hand drill to know how many times he needs to turn it to nimbly and accurately penetrate the thickness of a skull.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s a fascinating picture:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Post-mortem-experiments.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-28424\" height=\"320\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Post-mortem-experiments-430x320.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Post-mortem-experiments-430x320.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Post-mortem-experiments-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Post-mortem-experiments-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Post-mortem-experiments.jpg 1077w\" title=\"Post-mortem experiments and successful trepanation (top inset)\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The top inset photograph is of the side of the skull where a previous trepanation had been successful enough to allow bone regrowth.

It has a scraped trepanation on the posterior right parietal bone that was in the process of healing at the time of death. This area has no long hair, unlike the rest of the scalp, and under a microscope it looks cleanly cut. The fellow shaved or was shaved to keep the wound site clean and free of infection. He also has a small second hole, this one bored into the bone, on his forehead. It\u2019s in an area associated with migraine pain, just the kind of thing you might to drill a hole in your skull to treat. There is no post-surgical bone growth, so either the patient did not survive the surgery or he too was a port-mortem experiment. There are, however, the remains of a dark substance over the bore hole, a thick sludge with a finger print embedded in it. Archaeologists believe it may be the leftovers of an herbal poultice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Old-adult-male-with-healing-scraped-trepanation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-28432\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Old-adult-male-with-healing-scraped-trepanation-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Old-adult-male-with-healing-scraped-trepanation-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Old-adult-male-with-healing-scraped-trepanation-430x520.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Old-adult-male-with-healing-scraped-trepanation.jpg 858w\" title=\"Old adult male with healing scraped trepanation and metal cranioplasty (inset)\" width=\"123\"/></a>The group of skulls has already proven a treasure trove of information, and will likely yield more in the years to come. It is the largest well-contextualized collection of trepanned skulls in the world. There are plenty of holey crania in museums and institutions, but they were gathered a century ago under conditions that would make any archaeologist today shudder. There is little information about the sites where they were discovered and all-important contextual issues weren\u2019t investigated or recorded.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But thanks to Kurin\u2019s careful archaeological excavation of intact tombs and methodical analysis of the human skeletons and mummies buried therein, she knows exactly where, when and how the remains she found were buried, as well as who and what was buried with them. She used radiocarbon dating and insect casings to determine how long the bodies were left out before they skeletonized or were mummified, and multi-isotopic testing to reconstruct what they ate and where they were born. \u201cThat gives us a lot more information,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese ancient people can\u2019t speak to us directly, but they do give us information that allows us to reconstruct some aspect of their lives and their deaths and even what happened after they died,\u201d she continued. \u201cImportantly, we shouldn\u2019t look at a state of collapse as the beginning of a \u2018dark age,\u2019 but rather view it as an era that breeds resilience and foments stunning innovation within the population.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Thousand-year-old trepanned skulls of the Andes\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28418\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28418#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-28426\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28426\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Terrifying new facial reconstruction of Robespierre\">Terrifying new facial reconstruction of Robespierre</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, December 22nd, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-ca-1790.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-28427\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-ca-1790-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-ca-1790-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-ca-1790-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-ca-1790-430x544.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-ca-1790.jpg 939w\" title=\"Robespierre portrait by unknown artist, ca. 1790\" width=\"118\"/></a>Philippe Charlier, forensic pathologist and indefatigable researcher of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/22944\" target=\"_blank\">historical</a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/4227\" target=\"_blank\">medical</a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23880\" target=\"_blank\">conundrums</a>, and Philippe Froesch, facial reconstruction specialist with Visual Forensic in Barcelona, Spain, have created an <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962694-X/fulltext#\" target=\"_blank\">intense facial reconstruction of French Revolutionary leader Maximilien de Robespierre</a>. The main source for the image is a plaster copy of a death mask Madame Tussaud claimed* to have made from his decapitated head after he was guillotined on July 28th, 1794. </p>\n<p>Froesch used a hand-held scanner to create a 3D computer model of the face. He then added details to the smooth-faced model, like the more than 100 pockmarks caused by a bad case of smallpox he suffered 30 years before his death when he was a boy of six. The eyes were a particular challenge because the closed eyelids didn\u2019t leave an impression in the plaster so they were drawn on. Using an FBI technique that allowed him to calculate the eye size and position from marks left on the mask by the corneas, he was able to correct the crude eyelid line. (There are some pictures of the eye work <a href=\"http://www.visualforensic.com/VisualforensicRobespierre.html\" target=\"_blank\">on the Visual Forensic website</a>.)</p>\n<p>The end result is very far from the mild face conveyed in his portraits:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-facial-reconstruction.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-28429\" height=\"408\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-facial-reconstruction-430x408.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-facial-reconstruction-430x408.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-facial-reconstruction-150x142.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-facial-reconstruction-200x189.jpg 200w\" title=\"Facial reconstruction of Maximilien Robespierre\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Portrait artists were then and are now notoriously heavy-handed with the painterly Photoshop, and the uncertainties of the French Revolution would have made it a very bad idea to cross someone who could easily have you decapitated, but damn yo, if this reconstruction is the real deal, I hope Robespierre paid those painters generously.</p>\n<p>Charlier and Froesch also studied contemporary accounts of Robespierre and those coupled with the newly reconstructed face, suggested a possible diagnosis for the illness known to have afflicted him. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Several clinical signs were described by contemporary witnesses: vision problems, nose bleeds (\u201che covered his pillow of fresh blood each night\u201d), jaundice (\u201cyellow coloured skin and eyes\u201d), asthenia (\u201ccontinuous tiredness\u201d), recurrent leg ulcers, and frequent facial skin disease associated with scars of a previous smallpox infection. He also had permanent eye and mouth twitching. The symptoms worsened between 1790 and 1794. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The retrospective diagnosis that includes all these symptoms is diffuse sarcoidosis with ophthalmic, upper-respiratory-tract (nose or sinus mucosa), and liver or pancreas involvement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sarcoidosis is a rare autoimmune syndrome where granulomas (collections of immune system cells) develop in any number of organs. Symptoms include all the ones mentioned above and a slew of others. The skin can be affected too, causing nodules or lesions that last several weeks. Treatment these days is corticosteroids, but Robespierre died 80 years before the disease was identified by Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and 160 years before the introduction of prednisone. His treatment would have been more along the lines of bleeding and dietary changes.</p>\n<p>The reconstruction <a href=\"http://news.msn.com/world/robespierre-gets-3d-makeover-possible-diagnosis-1\" target=\"_blank\">has not gone over well with Robespierre fans</a>, for some reason.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When the first 3D images emerged earlier this month, far left politicians denounced it as a plot to make their hero look evil.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese days, with 3D, heroes are derided and tyrant kings are magnified \u2026 A sad era,\u201d wrote Alexis Corbiere, a Paris official and member of the Leftist Front, which is among many to view Robespierre as a champion of social justice.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-death-mask.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-28428\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-death-mask-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-death-mask-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-death-mask-200x275.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robespierre-death-mask.jpg 1074w\" title=\"Robespierre death mask copy\" width=\"108\"/></a>*Some historians think Madame Toussaud lied about the authenticity of the mask to promote her work, that the Revolutionary authorities would have had no interest in preserving Robespierre\u2019s visage and would want to bury him and the rest of the daily pile of bodies as soon as possible. However, the Terror leaders did commission her to make death masks of King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and many other notable victims of Madame Guillotine. There\u2019s no reason to assume they\u2019d be inimical to the very idea of preserving the faces of whoever they deemed enemies of the Revolution. Masks of aristocrats and Terror victims were paraded through the streets.</p>\n<p>The original of the mask is in Madame Tussauds London.

inexorably on, devouring our precious remaining minutes, hours and days like Cronus did his children, and miring us in so many end-of-year retrospectives and best-of listicles that we can\u2019t help but embrace the new year if only for the novelty of it. So it\u2019s for your own good, really, that for the third time in a row I will close out the year with a look back at The History Blog\u2019s 2013.</p>\n<p>First a little glimpse into the statistical man behind the curtain. This year we had 1,570,000 total pageviews, slightly short of last year\u2019s high of 1,650,546. That\u2019s actually way better than I expected, because earlier this year I experienced for the first time the frigid wrath of a Google denied. You might recall that towards the end of January <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/22964\" target=\"_blank\">the blog moved to a new server</a>. This was made necessary by my unquenchable thirst for large pictures taking up so much space that I finally had to ditch the old one and move to a plan that gave me room to grow. </p>\n<p>Or so I thought. In fact, it was a complete disaster, way too small to handle my bandwidth and even the overall hard drive space was larger, it was still pretty damn stingy in terms of file size maximums. As soon as the blog moved, it was taken down by an exceeded bandwidth error and remained down for what felt like an eternity but was actually something like eight hours. </p>\n<p>As far as Google\u2019s algorithms are concerned, those eight hours might as well have been an eternity. The high ranking I had built up over six years of daily blogging plummeted resulting in a dramatic drop in traffic. I watched, horrified, as my views per day plunged to levels not seen since the end of 2011, beginning of 2012, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do about it. A second bandwidth exceeded takedown <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24353\" target=\"_blank\">struck at the end of March</a> and that was the end of my dealings with that server company. I <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24661\" target=\"_blank\">moved to a new service</a> (hi <a href=\"http://www.westhost.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Westhost</a>! Love you guys!) in mid-April with unlimited everything and it\u2019s been smooth sailing ever since. </p>\n<p>Alas, the search engines weren\u2019t done punishing me. They still aren\u2019t done, in fact. The numbers only started to crawl back up in September, believe it or not, and even now we\u2019re tens of thousands of views away from the intoxicating highs of January. I am very much looking forward to the new year so I can draw a firm albeit arbitrary line after the Bad Days and usher in Better Days, daring even to hope they might be Best Days.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-28538\" height=\"77\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats-430x77.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats-430x77.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats-150x27.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats-200x36.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Monthly-stats.jpg 1231w\" title=\"Monthly stats\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The busiest new entry this year was the one about <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27678\" target=\"_blank\">the Seikilos epitaph</a>, the oldest ancient song to survive complete with lyrics and musical notation, sung by Newcastle University Classics professor Dr. David Creese. It got 7,811 views on November 3rd, most of them courtesy of <a href=\"http://io9.com/listen-to-performances-of-the-worlds-oldest-complete-s-1457475368\" target=\"_blank\">a link from io9</a>. Overall this year the Seikilos epitaph got 13,254 pageviews. That wasn\u2019t the most viewed entry of the year, however. That honor goes to last year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17003\" target=\"_blank\">Hatfields &amp; McCoys entry</a>, which continues to draw crazy traffic with 22,719 views in 2013. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-23336\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paulina-slippers-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pauline Bonaparte's slippers, inscription on the bottom sole\" width=\"150\"/></a>My favorite incoming link of the year wasn\u2019t about bringing in the view numbers, though, which were tiny. It was from a Greek foot fetish forum in which the virtues of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23324\" target=\"_blank\">Napoleon\u2019s sister\u2019s tiny feet and shoes</a> were extolled. I loved it because it\u2019s the perfect niche audience to appreciate details like the memoirs describing Pauline Bonaparte\u2019s terribly risqu\u00e9e pedicures. </p>\n<p>It was a great year overall for the audio-visual arts. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24298\" target=\"_blank\">Notre Dame got some much-needed new bells for her 850th birthday</a> and on Palm Sunday they made a glorious noise along with the one surviving pre-Revolutionary bell, Emmanuel, installed in 1685. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27174\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Pickford\u2019s first star-billing film was restored</a> and shown after being found in barn. Orson Welles\u2019 long-lost second film, <em>Too Much Johnson</em> (yes I do snicker at that every time), debuted in theaters in Italy and the US after years of painstaking restoration. Meanwhile, in France, the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27511\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s oldest surviving movie theater reopened</a> after an extensive renovation.</p>\n<p>I found the rare sound recordings of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23732\" target=\"_blank\">Florence Nightingale, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Martin Leonard Lanfried, trumpeter of the 17th Lancers,</a> hauntingly beautiful. I loved hearing Florence Nightingale express hope in the recording itself that her voice might keep her cause alive long after her death. Audio recording technology was so new then, but her instincts were right on the money. We also got to enjoy the distinct privilege of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24871\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Graham Bell</a> ordering us to hear his voice. The first and only known recording of Alexander Graham Bell, it allows this great inventor of live voice transmission technology to finally transmit his own voice to us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26739\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Edith Russell's musical pig that saved her from the sinking of the Titanic\" width=\"150\"/></a>Advanced technology revived the music played by the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26734\" target=\"_blank\">the toy pig that saved its owner\u2019s life during the sinking of the <em>Titanic</em></a>, but to be honest the music was less important to me than the pig itself, which is adorable. I simply <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28309\" target=\"_blank\">cannot resist an adorable pig</a>.</p>\n<p>Nor can I resist a good, solid medical oddity, which is probably for the best because there\u2019s nothing like an <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/22944\" target=\"_blank\">ancient calcified teratoma from the pelvis of Roman woman</a> to counterbalance the cute piggies. The teeth alone are just so freaky. How could a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27354\" target=\"_blank\">brain boiled in its skull 4,000 years ago</a> compete? You\u2019d probably need a whole <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28258\" target=\"_blank\">online database of diseased medieval bones</a> to even begin to have a chance against it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Anna-Maria-Luisa-de\u2019-Medici-exhumed.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-23562\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Anna-Maria-Luisa-de\u2019-Medici-exhumed-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Anna-Maria-Luisa-de\u2019-Medici-exhumed-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Anna-Maria-Luisa-de\u2019-Medici-exhumed-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Anna-Maria-Luisa-de\u2019-Medici-exhumed-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Anna-Maria-Luisa-de\u2019-Medici-exhumed.jpg 1400w\" title=\"Anna Maria Luisa de\u2019 Medici exhumed\" width=\"150\"/></a>The 3D printed skull of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23537\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Maria Luisa de\u2019 Medici wearing her Electress Palatine crown</a> isn\u2019t gruesome at all, at least to my eyes, but it is a fascinating glimpse of where the technology could take archaeology going forward. So many things that should not be touched due to condition issues will be able to be examined again thanks to the combination of laser scanning and 3D printing. It\u2019s Anna Maria\u2019s herculean efforts in saving the patrimony of her famous family, the greatest patrons of the some of the greatest art ever made, that should grant her an august place in history. She\u2019s nowhere near as well known as she should be, since she single-handedly ensured that the art that makes Florence a top tourist destination today remain in the city rather than get plundered and scattered around the courts of Europe after her death in 1743.</p>\n<p>Anna Maria\u2019s story was probably my favorite biographical post of the year. Although, if the entry about <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25920\" target=\"_blank\">Michelangelo\u2019s time in hiding under the New Sacristy of San Lorenzo</a> and the astonishing charcoal sketches he drew on the walls to keep himself sane counts as biography, that one\u2019s a favorite of mine too. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27654\" target=\"_blank\">Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s early years</a> were great fun to delve into as well, because even though he felt he looked like a \u201cdissolute democrat of the fourth ward,\u201d he sure didn\u2019t act like one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Al-Smith-button-1928.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25567\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Al-Smith-button-1928-133x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Al-Smith-button-1928-133x150.jpg 133w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Al-Smith-button-1928-200x224.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Al-Smith-button-1928-430x483.jpg 430w\" title=\"Al Smith button from 1928 presidential campaign\" width=\"133\"/></a>Which reminds me, I must take a moment to give all proper praise to the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25561\" target=\"_blank\">best political button in history</a>. May all your wet dreams be of Al Smith. Oh, and quick update: the button ended up selling for $8,962.50 including the buyer\u2019s premium. It\u2019s a steal, if you ask me. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21816\" target=\"_blank\">original Batmobile</a> from the 1960s television series was a steal at any price, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/22906\" target=\"_blank\">even $4.62 million</a>, because of its unparalleled awesomeness. Even before it was the greatest of all Batmobiles it was already epic as a Lincoln Futura concept car. I loved researching that because it reminded me of Homer Simpson\u2019s dream car that bankrupted his long-lost half-brother Herb. (Most things remind me of <em>The Simpsons</em> in some way.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gygan-with-Windmill-girls.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26586\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gygan-with-Windmill-girls-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gygan-with-Windmill-girls-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gygan-with-Windmill-girls-200x297.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gygan-with-Windmill-girls-430x639.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Gygan-with-Windmill-girls.jpg 640w\" title=\"Cygan with Windmill girls\" width=\"100\"/></a>That Batmobile went to a private collector as did the Maltese Falcon (<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28056\" target=\"_blank\">sold for $4,085,000</a> including buyer\u2019s premium). The debonair 1950s robot <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26552\" target=\"_blank\">Cygan sold to a private collector</a>, but he has contacted me and he is restoring it most judiciously so huzzah! I love the Cygan entry even more now, incidentally, because I had to research the Windmill Girls to write it which means I was able to get the reference to them on the Christmas special of <em>Call the Midwife</em> that just aired on my local PBS station. (Nurse Lee reassured an overdue patient that the midwives are like the Windmill Girls: open all day. Naughty!) </p>\n<p>Museums won big this year too. The exquisite <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26043\" target=\"_blank\">lost golden chest of Cardinal Mazarin</a>, the largest known lacquer artifact in the world once used as a TV stand and bar, sold for $9,544,000 including buyer\u2019s premium to the Rijksmuseum. The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27896\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Museums Greenwich were able acquire the Gibson family shipwreck pictures</a> which will make this invaluable resource available to the public. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holmul-frieze.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26471\" height=\"45\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holmul-frieze-150x45.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holmul-frieze-150x45.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holmul-frieze-200x60.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holmul-frieze-430x129.jpg 430w\" title=\"Photomosaic of Holmul frieze, pictures by Alexandre Tokovinine, (c) Harvard University/Proyecto Arqueologico Holmul\" width=\"150\"/></a>My favorite discoveries of the year are both vast and modest in scope.

So it\u2019s for your own good, really, that for the third time in a row I will close out the year with a look back at The History Blog\u2019s 2013. First a little glimpse into the statistical man behind the curtain. This year we had 1,570,000 total pageviews, slightly short of last year\u2019s high of 1,650,546. That\u2019s actually way better than I expected, because earlier this year I experienced for the first time the frigid wrath of a Google denied. You might recall that towards the end of January the blog moved to a new server. This was made necessary by my unquenchable thirst for large pictures taking up so much space that I finally had to ditch the old one and move to a plan that gave me room to grow. Or so I thought. In fact, it was a complete disaster, way too small to handle my bandwidth and even the overall hard drive space was larger, it was still pretty damn stingy in terms of file size maximums. As soon as the blog moved, it was taken down by an exceeded bandwidth error and remained down for what felt like an eternity but was actually something like eight hours. As far as Google\u2019s algorithms are concerned, those eight hours might as well have been an eternity. The high ranking I had built up over six years of daily blogging plummeted resulting in a dramatic drop in traffic. I watched, horrified, as my views per day plunged to levels not seen since the end of 2011, beginning of 2012, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do about it. A second bandwidth exceeded takedown struck at the end of March and that was the end of my dealings with that server company. I moved to a new service (hi Westhost! Love you guys!) in mid-April with unlimited everything and it\u2019s been smooth sailing ever since. Alas, the search engines weren\u2019t done punishing me. They still aren\u2019t done, in fact. The numbers only started to crawl back up in September, believe it or not, and even now we\u2019re tens of thousands of views away from the intoxicating highs of January. I am very much looking forward to the new year so I can draw a firm albeit arbitrary line after the Bad Days and usher in Better Days, daring even to hope they might be Best Days. The busiest new entry this year was the one about the Seikilos epitaph, the oldest ancient song to survive complete with lyrics and musical notation, sung by Newcastle University Classics professor Dr. David Creese. It got 7,811 views on November 3rd, most of them courtesy of a link from io9. Overall this year the Seikilos epitaph got 13,254 pageviews. That wasn\u2019t the most viewed entry of the year, however. That honor goes to last year\u2019s Hatfields & McCoys entry, which continues to draw crazy traffic with 22,719 views in 2013. My favorite incoming link of the year wasn\u2019t about bringing in the view numbers, though, which were tiny. It was from a Greek foot fetish forum in which the virtues of Napoleon\u2019s sister\u2019s tiny feet and shoes were extolled. I loved it because it\u2019s the perfect niche audience to appreciate details like the memoirs describing Pauline Bonaparte\u2019s terribly risqu\u00e9e pedicures. It was a great year overall for the audio-visual arts. Notre Dame got some much-needed new bells for her 850th birthday and on Palm Sunday they made a glorious noise along with the one surviving pre-Revolutionary bell, Emmanuel, installed in 1685. Mary Pickford\u2019s first star-billing film was restored and shown after being found in barn. Orson Welles\u2019 long-lost second film, Too Much Johnson (yes I do snicker at that every time), debuted in theaters in Italy and the US after years of painstaking restoration. Meanwhile, in France, the world\u2019s oldest surviving movie theater reopened after an extensive renovation. I found the rare sound recordings of Florence Nightingale, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Martin Leonard Lanfried, trumpeter of the 17th Lancers, hauntingly beautiful. I loved hearing Florence Nightingale express hope in the recording itself that her voice might keep her cause alive long after her death. Audio recording technology was so new then, but her instincts were right on the money. We also got to enjoy the distinct privilege of Alexander Graham Bell ordering us to hear his voice. The first and only known recording of Alexander Graham Bell, it allows this great inventor of live voice transmission technology to finally transmit his own voice to us. Advanced technology revived the music played by the the toy pig that saved its owner\u2019s life during the sinking of the Titanic, but to be honest the music was less important to me than the pig itself, which is adorable. I simply cannot resist an adorable pig. Nor can I resist a good, solid medical oddity, which is probably for the best because there\u2019s nothing like an ancient calcified teratoma from the pelvis of Roman woman to counterbalance the cute piggies. The teeth alone are just so freaky. How could a brain boiled in its skull 4,000 years ago compete? You\u2019d probably need a whole online database of diseased medieval bones to even begin to have a chance against it. The 3D printed skull of Anna Maria Luisa de\u2019 Medici wearing her Electress Palatine crown isn\u2019t gruesome at all, at least to my eyes, but it is a fascinating glimpse of where the technology could take archaeology going forward. So many things that should not be touched due to condition issues will be able to be examined again thanks to the combination of laser scanning and 3D printing. It\u2019s Anna Maria\u2019s herculean efforts in saving the patrimony of her famous family, the greatest patrons of the some of the greatest art ever made, that should grant her an august place in history. She\u2019s nowhere near as well known as she should be, since she single-handedly ensured that the art that makes Florence a top tourist destination today remain in the city rather than get plundered and scattered around the courts of Europe after her death in 1743. Anna Maria\u2019s story was probably my favorite biographical post of the year. Although, if the entry about Michelangelo\u2019s time in hiding under the New Sacristy of San Lorenzo and the astonishing charcoal sketches he drew on the walls to keep himself sane counts as biography, that one\u2019s a favorite of mine too. Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s early years were great fun to delve into as well, because even though he felt he looked like a \u201cdissolute democrat of the fourth ward,\u201d he sure didn\u2019t act like one. Which reminds me, I must take a moment to give all proper praise to the best political button in history. May all your wet dreams be of Al Smith. Oh, and quick update: the button ended up selling for $8,962.50 including the buyer\u2019s premium. It\u2019s a steal, if you ask me. The original Batmobile from the 1960s television series was a steal at any price, even $4.62 million, because of its unparalleled awesomeness. Even before it was the greatest of all Batmobiles it was already epic as a Lincoln Futura concept car. I loved researching that because it reminded me of Homer Simpson\u2019s dream car that bankrupted his long-lost half-brother Herb. (Most things remind me of The Simpsons in some way.) That Batmobile went to a private collector as did the Maltese Falcon (sold for $4,085,000 including buyer\u2019s premium). The debonair 1950s robot Cygan sold to a private collector, but he has contacted me and he is restoring it most judiciously so huzzah! I love the Cygan entry even more now, incidentally, because I had to research the Windmill Girls to write it which means I was able to get the reference to them on the Christmas special of Call the Midwife that just aired on my local PBS station. (Nurse Lee reassured an overdue patient that the midwives are like the Windmill Girls: open all day. Naughty!) Museums won big this year too. The exquisite lost golden chest of Cardinal Mazarin, the largest known lacquer artifact in the world once used as a TV stand and bar, sold for $9,544,000 including buyer\u2019s premium to the Rijksmuseum. The Royal Museums Greenwich were able acquire the Gibson family shipwreck pictures which will make this invaluable resource available to the public. My favorite discoveries of the year are both vast and modest in scope. There are the ever so many would-be Pompeiis: the pre-construction excavation revealing 400 years of Roman London, the remains of a 5th century fort massacre on \u00d6land, the man in armor trapped by the eruption of Mount Haruna in the early 6th century A.D. and the slice of Thessaloniki\u2019s history from the Roman era through the 9th century. Thankfully nobody called the monumental 6th c. Maya frieze found in Guatemala a Pompeii; its enormous size, fine preservation and sheer beauty give it all the cachet it needs. Then there are the exceptional little local treasures like the medieval coins found buried in a shoe in Rotterdam, the first Earl of Sandwich\u2019s recipe for iced chocolate, the outline of a foot carved by a bored Viking on the deck of his ship 1100 years ago, the papyrus spreadsheet in hieroglyphics complete with headers in red and black gridlines, or the medieval leather peytrel found in Cork castle. Tiny in size but not in import is the ostrich egg globe that may be oldest globe to include the New World. I\u2019m also partial to the 18th c. wooden railway found in Newcastle shipyard which was standard gauge a century before there was a standard, and to what may be the first images of Native Americans drawn in Europe, found during restoration of a Pinturicchio fresco in the Vatican\u2019s Borgia Apartment. It was a good year for shiny things as well. The intensely beautiful Cheapside went on display for first time in all its glory. A modest farm in Denmark yielded a collection of elite Viking jewelry that was in part reminiscent of the oeuvre of H. R. Giger. Augustus Saint-Gaudens\u2019 golden statue of Diana the Huntress that once perched on one foot over the second Madison Square Garden, a fine vantage point for witnessing the scandalous murder of architect Stanford White, is being regilded after years in the elements stripped her of her original glitter. A 12th c. bishop\u2019s ring that was stolen from St. Peter\u2019s Cathedral in Bremen was found when the culprit voluntarily confessed because his conscience bothered him. If only the Norton Simon Art Foundation in Pasadena had the baseline honesty of a German drug-addicted thief, then Cambodia would have four of its invaluable statues looted from the Prasat Chen temple in Koh Ker during the chaos of the early 1970s. As it is, they have the two Kneeling Attendants, returned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Duryodhana, returned by Sotheby\u2019s after years of legal wrangling. Also returned this year were the lost artifacts of two World War II veterans. The ring pilot David C. Cox had to trade to survive his imprisonment Stalag VII-A was returned to his grateful son by Martin Kiss of Hohenberg, Bavaria, who asked for no remuneration at all, not even shipping costs.

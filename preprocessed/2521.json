The ship\u2019s foghorns awakened guests at the oceanfront Boynton Hotel who hastened to the waterside to see what the commotion was about. The <em>Coquimbo</em> was perched on a sandbar, not sinking, but there were 15 crew members stranded on board, all Scandinavian, including Captain I. Clausen. Locals crossed the canal on a skiff and built a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeches_buoy\" target=\"_blank\">breeches buoy</a> to rescue all 15 men. </p>\n<p>The crew couldn\u2019t afford to stay in the hotel so for the next two months they used the ship\u2019s sails to make tents and camped out on the beach while they waited for the steam tugboat that would attempt to dislodge the ship. The tugboat spent days trying to budge the <em>Coquimbo</em> but it wouldn\u2019t move an inch. It was destined to stay where it stood until the ocean waves tore the hull apart.</p>\n<p>In 1909 southern Florida was still pioneer country, sparsely populated with limited supplies. The town of Boynton was only 11 years old at the time with a population of less than 700 souls. A ship full of long-leaf pine lumber with beams as long as thirty feet was a figurative gold mine for the settlers. Residents collected the wood that had washed up on the beach, stacking it in piles that reached as high as fifty feet. The lumber, along with the ship\u2019s rigging, tackle, stores and provisions would be <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cRxVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fj0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4385%2C4550331\" target=\"_blank\">sold at auction</a> (scroll down to see the notice) on March 30th, 1909, but the U.S. Marshall who oversaw the sale allowed the Boynton residents to mark the piles they had made and buy them for bargain prices at the auction. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Coquimbo-wreck-1909.-Photo-courtesy-Boynton-Beach-City-Library.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-35067\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Coquimbo-wreck-1909.-Photo-courtesy-Boynton-Beach-City-Library-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Coquimbo-wreck-1909.-Photo-courtesy-Boynton-Beach-City-Library-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Coquimbo-wreck-1909.-Photo-courtesy-Boynton-Beach-City-Library-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Coquimbo-wreck-1909.-Photo-courtesy-Boynton-Beach-City-Library-430x291.jpg 430w\" title=\"People on the beach look at the wreck of the Coquimbo in early 1909.

DeVries has been actively searching for pictures of the wreck for the past 20 years and this is only the fourth she\u2019s ever found. That it also comes with a reference to the building boom that resulted from the harvesting of the <em>Coquimbo</em>\u2018s cargo makes it an even rarer historical gem. To flesh out the story behind the postcard, DeVries <a href=\"http://www.boyntonhistory.org/discovery-of-unusual-postcard-of-the-1909-shipwreck-coquimbo-and-the-tale-of-two-clydes/\" target=\"_blank\">tried to identify the \u201cClyde\u201d who had mailed it</a>. From her decades of historical research into the area, she knew that there were only two Clydes in Boynton Beach at that time. One of them was a carpenter who had helped build the hotel, so she thought he was the likely candidate. The dates didn\u2019t pan out, however, so she turned to the second Clyde.</p>\n<blockquote><p>C.O. Miller is best known for creating Boynton\u2019s most enduring and splendid roadside attraction, Rainbow Tropical Gardens. In addition, the master gardener designed the exquisite gardens of the famed Addison Mizner designed Cloister Inn.</p>\n<p>Born Clyde O\u2019Brien Miller in 1885, near Logansport, Indiana, Miller worked as a brakeman for the Pennsylvania Railroad before settling in Boynton in 1909.</p>\n<p>By following census records, news accounts and government documents, it seems Miller did indeed move about or travel often (as described in his 1909 postcard).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The recipient of the postcard was one Roger C. Middlekauff of Jacksonville, Florida. There\u2019s no further information about him at this time. Keep an eye on the <a href=\"http://www.boyntonhistory.org/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Boynton Beach Historical Society blog</a> for more about Clyde Miller. </p>\n<p>The postcard will be added to the documentation of the wreck that DeVries has been compiling for years in order to have the site recognized by the state. What\u2019s left of the <em>Coquimbo</em> was <a href=\"http://thecoastalstar.ning.com/profiles/blogs/history-revealed-sandy-uncovers-final-resting-spot-of-norwegian-f\" target=\"_blank\">discovered in January of 2013</a> by free-diver Steve Dennison. </p>\n<blockquote><p>His heart pounded when he saw it: The huge bow of a ghostly ship jutting from the sand as if rising from its watery grave. </p>\n<p>The hull that had looked black from the surface was reddish-brown close up, covered with marine organisms. He went down and grabbed the bow, and felt the cold metal underneath the barnacles.   </p>\n<p>He then saw a metal mast, then another mast, and about 200 feet from the bow he could see the stern and the steering mechanism. The hull was still buried underneath the sand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It had been exposed by the storm surge of Hurricane Sandy. You can see a slideshow of the wreck <a href=\"http://thecoastalstar.ning.com/photo/photo/slideshow?albumId=2331112:Album:99868\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and I\u2019m embedding video of it below. The ship was only visible for a brief three months. When Dennison returned in April it was completely covered in sand again. </p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/-7oo3-YpxGk&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Historian finds rare postcard of 1909 shipwreck on eBay\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35063\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35063#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-35042\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35042\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Tombstone of \u201cBodicacia\u201d found in Cirencester\">Tombstone of \u201cBodicacia\u201d found in Cirencester</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, February 27th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tom-Weavill-Marino-Cardelli-Noel-Boothroyd-with-stone-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35046\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tom-Weavill-Marino-Cardelli-Noel-Boothroyd-with-stone-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tom-Weavill-Marino-Cardelli-Noel-Boothroyd-with-stone-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tom-Weavill-Marino-Cardelli-Noel-Boothroyd-with-stone-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tom-Weavill-Marino-Cardelli-Noel-Boothroyd-with-stone-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-430x642.jpg 430w\" title=\"Tom Weavill, Marino Cardelli, Noel Boothroyd from Cotswold Archaeology with Bodicacia's headstone.

Roman gravestones are rare \u2014 less than 300 inscribed ones have been found in the UK, 10 in Cirencester \u2014 but this one is in very fine condition, with the pediment atop the stone unbroken and the inscription is still sharp and complete. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tombstone-cleaned.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35043\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tombstone-cleaned-126x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tombstone-cleaned-126x150.jpg 126w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tombstone-cleaned-200x237.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tombstone-cleaned-430x510.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tombstone-cleaned.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Tombstone cleaned \" width=\"126\"/></a>The inscription is five lines long and reads: \u201cDM BODICACIA CONIUNX VIXIT ANNO S XXVII.\u201d DM is an abbreviation for Dis Manibus, literally \u201cto the spirits of the dead,\u201d a frequently used dedication on tombstones, so the full inscription translates to \u201cTo the spirits of the dead, Bodicacia, wife, lived 27 years.\u201d It only fills the top half of the stone and there are horizontal lines on the bottom half that suggest it would be filled in with another inscription at a later date, perhaps when the husband died, but then it never happened. The tomstone is made out of Cotswold limestone and is elaborately decorated and impeccably carved. Bodicacia\u2019s husband must have been quite well off to be able to afford such an expensive piece.</p>\n<p>The Cotswold Archaeology team has been digging since January as a precursor to the construction of an addition to the St James Place Wealth Management structure that was built on the Bridges Garage site. They\u2019ve discovered a total of 55 graves and were almost finished with the excavation when they found the tombstone.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Inscription-det-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35045\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Inscription-det-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Inscription-det-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Inscription-det-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Inscription-det-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-430x642.jpg 430w\" title=\"Headstone lifted and turned over to reveal inscription.

We could already see the skull and the rest of the body were covered by only a thin layer of soil,\u201d [said Cliff Bateman, the Project Manager.]</p>\n<p>\u201cWe decided to dig a hole next to the grave and then gently roll the stone over onto a pallet set within the hole. This could then be lifted out by a crane and transported to a secure store.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cotswold Archaeology has a short timelapse video of the lifting of the headstone <a href=\"http://www.cotswoldarchaeology.co.uk/lifting-the-roman-tombstone-time-lapse/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and since the BBC filmed the event and broadcast it live, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-31610266\" target=\"_blank\">its article</a> has two videos, one of the lifting of the stone, and one interview with CA archaeologist Neil Holbrook after the stone was turned over to reveal the inscription.</p>\n<p>What makes this discovery all the more remarkable is that the tombstone survived at all. First it remained intact and virtually undamaged when it fell on top of the grave. Then it had to survive the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25669\" target=\"_blank\">stone foragers who looted graves</a> and buildings to use as masonry for new construction. Archaeologists think that the headstone fell over relatively soon after it was installed and then was covered by soil so later looters missed it.</p>\n<p>Then it had to outwit modern development. Before the Bridges Garage was built in the 1960s, the site was excavated by archaeologist Richard Reece who found 52 burials and an engraved headstone (not connected to any human remains). Then a building was constructed and an area large and deep enough to accommodate two huge underground fuel tanks was dug up, so archaeologists didn\u2019t expect to find much of anything intact when they surveyed the site in 2011 before new construction. Instead they found an extensive burial ground with intact artifacts and human remains. The tombstone and the fragile human remains just under it came within inches of destruction.</p>\n<blockquote><p>CA\u2019s Chief Executive Neil Holbrook said it was amazing the tombstone had survived \u201cWhen they built the garage in the 1960s they scraped across the top of the stone to put a beam in. If they\u2019d gone a couple of inches lower they\u2019d have smashed it to smithereens.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Skull-of-occupant-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-35044\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Skull-of-occupant-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Skull-of-occupant-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Skull-of-occupant-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Skull-of-occupant-Picture-by-Elliot-Cass-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skull of grave occupant, possibly the Bodicacia mentioned in the inscription.

This could very well be Bodicacia and her children buried in a family grave. If it does prove to be Bodicacia\u2019s grave, it will be the only of its kind ever found in Britain. Roman gravestones aren\u2019t often found with associated remains; finding one with a name engraved on it which identifies the remains is the kind of thing you find in exceptional preservation conditions like Pompeii.</p>\n<p>Experts will study the tombstone and remains in depth, a process that could take two or so years, in the hopes of answering some of these questions.

They saw some hair hanging from the top of a ravine on the right bank. At first they thought it was the remains of a reindeer, but they couldn\u2019t confirm or deny because the carcass was far out of their reach. When they returned to the spot in September, the ice had thawed and the section of frozen earth containing the remains had thawed enough to break off and fall onto the river bank. Although a section of the carcass sticking out of the ice had been devoured by wild animals (there are visible teeth marks), the head was intact and its two horns immediately identified it as a rhinoceros.</p>\n<p>Banderov and Ivanov retrieved the rhino and carried it home to their village where they placed it in a glacier to keep it frozen. Knowing that scientists would want to examine this remarkable find, they contacted Albert Protopopov, head of the Mammoth Fauna Department of the <a href=\"http://science.ykt.ru/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Sakha, Yakutia</a>. It took almost six months to get the carcass 1,800 miles away to Yakutia due to the challenges inherent in transporting anything across vast distances in the Siberian winter. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Press-conf-rhino.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-35051\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Press-conf-rhino-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Press-conf-rhino-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Press-conf-rhino-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Press-conf-rhino-430x284.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Press-conf-rhino.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Press conference at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Sakha, Yakutia, announcing discovery of Sasha \" width=\"200\"/></a>On February 25th, the Academy held a press conference announcing the discovery, its arrival in Yakutia and its name: Sasha, after one of the hunters who found it. Protopopov emphasized what a unique opportunity they have to study a baby woolly rhinoceros. Before now they hadn\u2019t even had the chance to examine a single tooth from a woolly rhino calf, never mind a complete skull and head with a surviving ear, eye, nostrils and mouth. There is also copious surviving wool and two legs with intact hooves. (The parts in the middle were eaten.)</p>\n<p>Although it will take several months to get dating results, Sasha has to be at least 10,000 years old because that\u2019s when the woolly rhinoceros became extinct. Scientists estimate the calf was about 18 months old at the time of death which was probably as a result of falling into a pit. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Protopopov explained: \u201cEven to find a skull of a baby rhino is very lucky indeed. The possible explanation to it is that rhinos bred very slowly. Mothers protected baby rhinos really well, so that cases of successful attacks on them were extremely rare and the mortality rate was very low. Woolly rhinos are less studied than mammoths.

As part of the project, the area around the cathedral including a graveyard was excavated. More than 700 skeletons dating from the Norman Conquest through the 19th century were unearthed between September of 2009 and May 2011, their bones providing a treasure trove of information about the lives and deaths of people from all walks of life over the course of nearly 1,000 years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/knight-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-35028\" height=\"266\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/knight-in-situ-200x266.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/knight-in-situ-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/knight-in-situ-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/knight-in-situ-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/knight-in-situ.jpg 675w\" title=\"Skeleton buried in cist grave outside east end of Hereford Cathedral.

If that is indeed the case, this skeleton is the first of its kind that we know of ever unearthed in the United Kingdom. He was found buried in the churchyard very near the east end of the Cathedral, prime spiritual real estate due to its proximity to the high altar.</p>\n<p>The skeleton is of a well-built adult man 5\u201910\u201d tall which puts him in the top 5% of men of his era in terms of height. He was at least 45 years old when he died sometime in the late 12th, early 13th century. Stable isotope analysis of his teeth found he was raised in Normandy. He was buried in a grave partially lined with stones, a sort of half-cist burial.</p>\n<p>His medical history is writ large on his bones. He had a badly fractured right shoulder blade which had fully healed by the time of his death and a serious break in the lower left leg that had also healed. It\u2019s a twisting fracture, possibly the consequence of a blow to the right side of the body (maybe that shoulder hit?) while on horseback. The twisting may have happened when, in reaction to that blow, the body spun around violently while the left foot remained caught in the stirrup.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fractured-unheeled-ribs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-35027\" height=\"261\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fractured-unheeled-ribs-200x261.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fractured-unheeled-ribs-200x261.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fractured-unheeled-ribs-114x150.jpg 114w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fractured-unheeled-ribs-430x561.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fractured-unheeled-ribs.jpg 689w\" title=\"Detail showing unhealed fractures in ribs. Image courtesy Headland Archaeology.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Recovery from such serious breaks doubtless took a long time. It suggests that he fought in tourneys for years before his eventual death. There is no fatal blow that osteologists could find, but there are injuries potentially connected to one. He sustained at least nine rib fractures on two different occasions. The second occasion was the bad one as the rib fracture only shows signs of several weeks worth of healing. The blow to the ribs wasn\u2019t fatal per se, but it was delivered along with the injuries that shortly thereafter claimed his life.</p>\n<p>Why couldn\u2019t these wounds have been inflicted during actual combat, you ask? Good question. They could have been, but there are no blade or arrow injuries to the bone. No sharp-force trauma of any kind is extant, although of course he could have been stabbed, speared, shot a million times in his soft tissues without that showing up on the bones. </p>\n<blockquote><p>[Regional Manager of Headland Archaeology] Andy Boucher said \u201cobviously we can never be sure how people came about their wounds, but in this case there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting this man was involved in some form of violent activity and the locations of his injuries do match quite closely what might be expected from taking part in mock battles. The fact that he was still doing this after he was 45 suggests he must have been very tough.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>If he did die as a result of tourney combat technically he was not allowed church burial. Jousts and its participants had been sternly condemned in the <a href=\"http://www.legionofmarytidewater.com/faith/ECUM10.HTM\" target=\"_blank\">Second Lateran Council</a> of 1139.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We entirely forbid, moreover, those abominable jousts and tournaments in which knights come together by agreement and rashly engage in showing off their physical prowess and daring, and which often result in human deaths and danger to souls. If any of them dies on these occasions, although penance and viaticum [communion] are not to be denied him when he requests them, he is to be deprived of a church burial.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hereford-Cathedral.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-35025\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hereford-Cathedral-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hereford-Cathedral-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hereford-Cathedral-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hereford-Cathedral-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Hereford Cathedral altar\" width=\"200\"/></a>Perhaps burial just outside the physical structure of the church was the loophole used to see that the Hereford knight got a proper Christian burial in a location near the high altar as would suit a man of status despite his death from abominable jousting. Anyway it\u2019s always easier to ask forgiveness after the transgression than permission before so the church\u2019s prohibition had little effect in practice. </p>\n<p>The Normans had introduced tourneys to England after the Conquest as bona fide war games. The use of heavy cavalry armed with lances to charge in formation developed in the second half of the 11th century, and those formation charges required a great deal of practice to work in a combat situation. These early tourneys were mock battles, not one horseback lancer against another Ivanhoe-style, staged on large fields and fought by dozens, sometimes hundreds, of men at arms. They were dangerous, sometimes fatal, and inflicted more injuries on knights than actual battlefield combat did.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heavy-cavalry-in-combat-illumination-from-Rochefoucault-Grail-1315-1323.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35032\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heavy-cavalry-in-combat-illumination-from-Rochefoucault-Grail-1315-1323-e1424870470390-150x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heavy-cavalry-in-combat-illumination-from-Rochefoucault-Grail-1315-1323-e1424870470390-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heavy-cavalry-in-combat-illumination-from-Rochefoucault-Grail-1315-1323-e1424870470390-200x159.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heavy-cavalry-in-combat-illumination-from-Rochefoucault-Grail-1315-1323-e1424870470390-430x342.jpg 430w\" title=\"Heavy cavalry in combat illumination from Rochefoucault Grail, 1315-1323\" width=\"150\"/></a>There were prizes to be won, however \u2014 ransom money, weapons, armour, horses \u2014 and there was always a steady supply of younger sons of nobility with skill at arms but no prospect of inheritance willing to fight their way to wealth and status. Richard the Lionheart attempted to regulate tourneys by issuing a charter on August 22nd, 1194, authorizing them in only five locations and requiring participants to pay hefty fees according to their titles (an earl had to pay 20 marks of silver, a baron 10, a landed knight four marks, a landless knight two) before receiving a license to fight in the tournament. This served the king\u2019s purpose in several ways. It dangled the prospect of profit to the knights, keeping them in the country and available to defend the realm while at the same time keeping them from constantly injuring each other in tourney after tourney. It also made the assembly of large numbers of heavy cavalry subject to monarchical approval, a mechanism that would only grow in importance after Richard\u2019s death and the subsequent clashes between crown and barons that famously resulted in Magna Carta. Last but certainly not least, it put significant coin in the king\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Codex-Manesse_052r_Walther_von_Klingen.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35031\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Codex-Manesse_052r_Walther_von_Klingen-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Codex-Manesse_052r_Walther_von_Klingen-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Codex-Manesse_052r_Walther_von_Klingen-200x298.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Codex-Manesse_052r_Walther_von_Klingen-430x641.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Codex-Manesse_052r_Walther_von_Klingen.jpg 1199w\" title=\"Joust illumination in the Codex Manesse, 1304.

One famous joust was held at Chepstow Castle on the Welsh side of the border 35 miles south of Hereford in 1227. The castle (called Striguil Castle by the Normans) had been home to William Marshal, dubbed \u201cthe greatest knight that ever lived\u201d by Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, in his eulogy for William after his death in 1219. His son, also named William, succeeded his father as Earl of Pembroke and Lord Marshal of England to King Henry III. It was the younger William who hosted the 1227 tourney without permission from the king. Knights attached to eight earls, including the Earl of Hereford, fought in the tournament, and at least one of them, Reimund de Burgh, relative of Hubert de Burgh, Henry\u2019s regent during his minority who the king had just that year made the 1st Earl of Kent, <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/annalschepstowc00maclgoog#page/n124/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">was heavily fined</a> for his participation. Thus the king profited financially even from the illicit tourneys.</p>\n<p>Given its proximity to Hereford and the date range of the cathedral\u2019s knight, it\u2019s conceivable that he could have fought in that very tournament. It could even have been the one to fell him, for that matter. I doubt we\u2019ll ever know.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Possible joust casualty found at Hereford Cathedral\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35023\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35023#comments\">13 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-34996\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34996\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Two uknown C\u00e9zanne sketches found on back of watercolors\">Two uknown C\u00e9zanne sketches found on back of watercolors</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, February 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Unfinished sketches have been <a href=\"http://www.barnesfoundation.org/about/press/media-info/pr-022015\" target=\"_blank\">discovered on the back of watercolors by Paul C\u00e9zanne</a> in the collection of the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.

Once the backing was entirely removed, an unfinished sketch of trees done in pencil and then accented with watercolors was revealed.

Given the probable dealer pencil markings on one of the sketches, it\u2019s likely that the backs of the watercolors had already been covered with paper before Stein bought them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-south-wall-2012.-Photo-\u00a9-2015-The-Barnes-Foundation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35010\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-south-wall-2012.-Photo-\u00a9-2015-The-Barnes-Foundation-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-south-wall-2012.-Photo-\u00a9-2015-The-Barnes-Foundation-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-south-wall-2012.-Photo-\u00a9-2015-The-Barnes-Foundation-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-south-wall-2012.-Photo-\u00a9-2015-The-Barnes-Foundation-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"South wall of Room 20 with watercolors on display in 2012.

This is an extremely rare opportunity to see anything at all from the Barnes collection not in its assigned location. Barnes left very strict, very specific instructions on the management of the art in Foundation\u2019s charter. One of the rules is all the works have to be displayed exactly where<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-with-placeholders-for-watercolors.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35008\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-with-placeholders-for-watercolors-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-with-placeholders-for-watercolors-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-with-placeholders-for-watercolors-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Room-20-with-placeholders-for-watercolors-430x282.jpg 430w\" title=\"Room 20 as it is now with placeholders for the two watercolors\" width=\"150\"/></a> Barnes chose to display them, never moved, never removed, never sold, never loaned. Even taking down works for conservation purposes requires the permission of the Pennsylvania Attorney General. Barnes arranged his art the way he liked it, a configuration he felt most in keeping with his Deweyite educational principles. The Foundation was to be an educational institution for students of art, not a museum for the general public.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dr.-Albert-C.-Barnes-in-main-gallery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35013\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 117px) 100vw, 117px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dr.-Albert-C.-Barnes-in-main-gallery-117x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dr.-Albert-C.-Barnes-in-main-gallery-117x150.jpg 117w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dr.-Albert-C.-Barnes-in-main-gallery-200x254.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dr.-Albert-C.-Barnes-in-main-gallery-430x547.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dr.-Albert-C.-Barnes-in-main-gallery.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Dr. Albert C.

Photograph by Jan van Esch.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Several news stories have incorrectly described the mummy as a shocking discovery, but it was known to be inside the statue all along. Not to state the obvious, but that\u2019s why it was sent to the Drents Museum in the first place as part of the <em>Mummies</em> exhibition. The research team did make one surprise find: the cavities where the organs once resided are stuffed with pieces of paper that have ancient Chinese characters written on them.</p>\n<p>The mummy is believed to be that of the Master Liuquan of the Chinese Meditation School, or Ch\u2019an (known as Zen in Japan) Buddhism. He died around 1100 A.D., which is the source of the date for the statue. The Drents Museum exhibited the statue as an example of self-mummification, a grueling, torturous, years-long process in which Buddhist monks gradually starved, dehydrated and poisoned themselves in the hope of attaining enlightenment and leaving an incorruptible corpse. It required an <a href=\"http://www.sonic.net/~anomaly/japan/dbuddha.htm\" target=\"_blank\">almost inconceivable degree of self-abnegation</a>. For the first 1,000 days they ate only nuts and seeds gleaned from the area around the temple. The next 1,000 days the diet was whittled down to small portions of pine bark and roots until the end of the period when they began to drink a tea made from the sap of urushi tree. This sap is what lacquer is made of; it is toxic to humans. The tea induced the release of fluids and made the body unappetizing to insects and microorganisms that would otherwise be inclined feast on the corpse. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Daijuku-Bosatsu-Shinnyokai-Shonin.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34992\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Daijuku-Bosatsu-Shinnyokai-Shonin-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Daijuku-Bosatsu-Shinnyokai-Shonin-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Daijuku-Bosatsu-Shinnyokai-Shonin-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Daijuku-Bosatsu-Shinnyokai-Shonin-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Daijuku-Bosatsu-Shinnyokai-Shonin.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Self-mummified monk Daijuku Bosatsu Shinnyokai Shonin, b. 1687, at Dainichibo Temple, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan\" width=\"150\"/></a>With no body fat or fluids left and poison in his tissues, the monk would then be walled alive in a room that gave him just enough space to sit lotus style. A tube let air into the tight space and the monk would ring a bell to let people know he was still alive. When the bell stopped ringing, the tube was removed and the space sealed for another three years. When the 1,000 days were up, the tomb would be opened to see if the body was in fact mummified. If it wasn\u2019t, and most of them weren\u2019t, it was buried with due respect for the unbelievable toughness and devotion of the priest who made the attempt. If it was, the deceased would no longer be considered dead but in a state of eternal meditation, removed from the cycle of Samsara. He was elevated to the rank of Buddha, his mummy dressed and decorated and placed on an altar.</p>\n<p>The practice as described above was codified by Kuukai of Mount Koya, Japan, founder of the Shingon sect of Buddhism. He is thought to have learned it while studying esoteric Buddhist practices in the T\u2019ang region of China. Most examples of self-mummification have been found in the Yamagata Prefecture in Japan, but there are instances <a href=\"http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0101-mummified-remains-of-200-year-old-man-in-lotus-position-found-in-mongolia/\" target=\"_blank\">in China</a> and India as well. The thing is, there is no removal of organs in this procedure. If the mummy in the Buddha statue did indeed self-mummify, his organs must have been removed after death, and I can\u2019t see how it could have been done three years later. There\u2019s a different process at work in the Buddha statue mummy. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Radiologist-Ben-Heggelman-Jan-van-Esch.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34979\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Radiologist-Ben-Heggelman-Jan-van-Esch-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Radiologist-Ben-Heggelman-Jan-van-Esch-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Radiologist-Ben-Heggelman-Jan-van-Esch-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Radiologist-Ben-Heggelman-Jan-van-Esch-430x296.jpg 430w\" title=\"Radiologist  Ben Heggelman takes bone samples.

The range of the ancient tribe was whittled down to a central core in the wake of the upheavals of the late Imperial period. By the 6th/7th century Ptolemy\u2019s Galindians survived as the Old Prussian clan of the Galindis. These artifacts, therefore, are from a significant transitional period in the history of the region.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brown-clasp-with-bar-on-the-end-of-the-stem.-Photo-by-Magdalena-Gorzkowska.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34957\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brown-clasp-with-bar-on-the-end-of-the-stem.-Photo-by-Magdalena-Gorzkowska-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brown-clasp-with-bar-on-the-end-of-the-stem.-Photo-by-Magdalena-Gorzkowska-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brown-clasp-with-bar-on-the-end-of-the-stem.-Photo-by-Magdalena-Gorzkowska-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brown-clasp-with-bar-on-the-end-of-the-stem.-Photo-by-Magdalena-Gorzkowska-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brown-clasp-with-bar-on-the-end-of-the-stem.-Photo-by-Magdalena-Gorzkowska.jpg 1552w\" title=\"Bronze clasp with bar on the end of the stem.

Last month the <a href=\"http://www.toledomuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Toledo Museum of Art</a> (TMA) announced it had acquired <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34222\" target=\"_blank\">Napoleon\u2019s brother\u2019s exquisite spiral chandelier</a> from a Hamburg art dealer. Two days ago the museum announced it would <a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2015/02/19/Toledo-museum-to-give-up-prized-German-artifact.html\" target=\"_blank\">voluntarily return an exquisite 16th century astronomical instrument</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.stiftungfriedenstein.de/historisches-museum\" target=\"_blank\">Gotha Museum</a> in Germany after being presented with evidence that the object had been stolen from the museum after World War II.</p>\n<p>The instrument is a multi-use device known as an astrological compendium made by Augsburg craftsman Christopher Schissler in 1567.<br/>\nSchissler was considered the greatest of Augsburg\u2019s instrument makers, crafting pieces of the highest quality from precious materials for the likes of August I, the Elector of Saxony, and Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. Only around 100 instruments made by Christopher Schissler are known to have survived. This particular one was made for the <a href=\"http://www.khm.at/en/visit/collections/kunstkammer-wien/history-of-the-collection/\" target=\"_blank\">Kunstkammer</a> of Rudolf\u2019s court in Prague. Rudolf was fascinated by mechanical devices and gave Schissler, along with other top instrument makers, access to court astronomers so they could be apprised of the latest research. He supported them financially and encouraged them to develop new designs and mechanisms.</p>\n<p>This device is very much a show-off piece, a showcase for its owner\u2019s wealth and scientific knowledge. Made from gilded bronze and enamel, it\u2019s an astrolabe, but it also has a variety of other functions. The outside cover is a sun dial, the inside cover a map of the world from which a plumb-bob can be hung to calculate angle of inclination. Interior compartments include a wind rose, a compass, a lunary (a device to calculate the time based on the moon), a perpetual calendar and a zodiac showing which signs govern which days. It is inscribed along its octagonal edges \u201cCHRISTOPHORUS SCHISSLER FACIEBAT AUGUSTAE VINDELICORUM \u2013 ANNO DOMINI 1567\u201d (Christopher Schissler made this, Augsburg \u2015 Anno Domini 1567).</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Astrolabe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-34926\" height=\"645\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Astrolabe-430x645.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Astrolabe-430x645.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Astrolabe-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Astrolabe-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Astrolabe.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Astrological compendium by Christopher Schissler, 1567.

It was taken to Munich. Twelve years later, it was plundered again, this time by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden who invaded Bavaria and in May of 1632, took Munich. Gustavus Adolphus died in battle later that year and after his ally Bernhard of Saxon-Weimar died in 1639, the spoils from Bavaria were divided among the survivors. The Schissler Compendium went to Bernhard\u2019s brother Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha, who installed it in his collection at Gotha.</p>\n<p>Inventory records from the 19th century indicate the instrument stayed put in the collection of the Dukes of Gotha at Friedenstein Castle for 300 years. When the palace was converted to a museum, the compendium went on display alongside a larger astrolabe by Schissler. Much of the collection was moved during World War II for safekeeping and returned after the war was over. Thuringia was occupied by American forces for a few months after the end of the war, and then the Soviets took over. They took many of the Gotha Museum treasures to the Soviet Union only to return them after the establishment of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1949. We know that the Schissler Compendium was not among the art and artifacts returned to the museum by the Soviets.</p>\n<p>So somewhere in the chaos of wars world and cold, the instrument made its way to New York art dealers and thence to Toledo, Ohio. The Toledo Museum of Art had no knowledge of its checkered past until May of 2013 when Dr. Martin Eberle, director of the Gotha Museum, wrote them a letter about the astrolabe. He included considerable documentary and photographic evidence that Toledo\u2019s Schissler Compendium and the Gotha Museum\u2019s Schissler Compendium were the same piece. After a couple of months spent reviewing the documentation, TMA Director Dr. Brian Kennedy wrote back to Dr. Eberle acknowledging that it seemed their astrolabe was the one stolen from the German museum.</p>\n<p>The institutions negotiated for a year after that, planning the repatriation of the object and the loan of artifacts from the Gotha collection to the Toledo Museum of Art in exchange. They still haven\u2019t decided which pieces will be loaned, but they\u2019ll sort that out in due course. Meanwhile, repatriation is nigh, tentatively scheduled for March or April of this year.</p>\n<p>Kudos to the TMA for returning the piece. There\u2019s no legal requirement that they do so. The UNESCO  Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property does not apply, nor do the protocols regarding Nazi loot. This was entirely an ethical choice they made because they think it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[U]nlike earlier cases, this is one that involves no government bureaucracy or complications raised by potential thieves or distributors awaiting trial. It is, as Mr. Kennedy noted, simply an agreement between two museums to get a historically valuable piece back to its rightful owner.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve recognized there\u2019s been a cultural shift in how museums conduct themselves,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cThere\u2019s much more scrutiny in how museums obtain their objects and transparency now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said the TMA had made it museum policy over the past 10 years to look harder into the ownership history of every piece.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis was a one-of-a-kind scientific device,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see it go, but it\u2019s not ours.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Ohio museum returns 16th c. astrolabe to Germany\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34925\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34925#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-34920\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34920\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Codex Calixtinus thief sentenced to 10 years\">Codex Calixtinus thief sentenced to 10 years</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, February 19th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Codex-Calixtinus-SantiagoCompostela.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-17955\" height=\"139\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Codex-Calixtinus-SantiagoCompostela-200x139.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Codex-Calixtinus-SantiagoCompostela-200x139.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Codex-Calixtinus-SantiagoCompostela-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Codex-Calixtinus-SantiagoCompostela-430x299.jpg 430w\" title=\"Medieval facsimile of the Codex Calixtinus kept on public display in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela\" width=\"200\"/></a>On Wednesday the Provincial Court of La Coru\u00f1a <a href=\"http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/440660/lifestyle/literature/man-gets-10-years-for-stealing-priceless-codex-manuscript-in-spain\" target=\"_blank\">convicted former electrician Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Casti\u00f1eiras</a> of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17932\" target=\"_blank\">stealing the Codex Calixtinus</a>, an invaluable 12th century manuscript that contains the first travel guide for pilgrims on their way to the shrine of St. James in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.

The total amount Casti\u00f1eiras stole in cash alone is 2.4 million euros ($2,735,000) in currency from 59 countries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Manuel-Fern\u00e1ndez-Casti\u00f1eiras-and-Carmen-Ventoso.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-34922\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Manuel-Fern\u00e1ndez-Casti\u00f1eiras-and-Carmen-Ventoso-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Manuel-Fern\u00e1ndez-Casti\u00f1eiras-and-Carmen-Ventoso-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Manuel-Fern\u00e1ndez-Casti\u00f1eiras-and-Carmen-Ventoso-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Manuel-Fern\u00e1ndez-Casti\u00f1eiras-and-Carmen-Ventoso-430x291.jpg 430w\" title=\"Convicted thief Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Casti\u00f1eiras with lawyer Carmen Ventoso\" width=\"200\"/></a>Defense counsel Carmen Ventoso tried the \u201cthis whole courtroom is out of order\u201d defense, calling the trial a \u201cprocedural Guantanamo\u201d in which the defendants\u2019 rights had been trampled from before they were even on trial. She claimed police had broken into the house and installed monitoring devices a month before the arrest, that the official police search exceeded the parameters of the warrant, that the first interview in which Casti\u00f1eiras admitted he had stolen the Codex at 12:00 AM on July 4th, 2011, was full of errors and invalidated by the interrogator\u2019s hardball tactics (\u201csuggestive,\u201d \u201cargumentative\u201d and \u201crepetitive\u201d questioning verging on duress), and that the Cathedral\u2019s security camera footage showing the defendant shoving stacks o\u2019 cash into his pockets was altered after the fact to incriminate her client. She wanted the search thrown out and all the evidence gathered as a result of it. </p>\n<p>The court, unsurprisingly, was not persuaded by this argument or by Ventoso\u2019s repeated imprecations against Judge Jos\u00e9 Antonio V\u00e1zquez Ta\u00edn who, according to her, is a sterling example of \u201cwhat shouldn\u2019t be done.\u201d The judge didn\u2019t buy her next defense \u2014 that Casti\u00f1eiras had OCD and was a hoarder \u2014 either, on account of he somehow managed to overcome this compulsion just fine when he invested his filthy lucre in property.</p>\n<p>On the stand last month, the first time he spoke publically about the theft, Casti\u00f1eiras admitted he had \u201cprobably\u201d stolen all that cash (different news stories put the amount at anywhere from 1.7 to 2.4 million euros) from the Cathedral safe before he had a stroke in 2004, but he stopped keeping his accounts after the stroke and couldn\u2019t remember if he kept stealing. When the magistrate asked him if he had stolen any other artworks or valuables from the church (a number of antiquities were also found in his home), the defendant replied that he woke up every day at 6:00 AM to work hard for the Cathedral. Because apparently early mornings and work entitle you to stuff millions in cash, art, church documents and whatever else into your pockets, seems to be the implication. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dean-with-Codex-replica.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34923\" height=\"139\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dean-with-Codex-replica-200x139.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dean-with-Codex-replica-200x139.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dean-with-Codex-replica-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dean-with-Codex-replica-430x299.jpg 430w\" title=\"Jose Maria Diaz, Dean of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, with replica Codex on display, July 11th, 2011\" width=\"200\"/></a>That fits with the disgruntled employee theory of the crime. He was let go in 2011, officially due to restructuring, but possibly because he was suspected of theft. That can\u2019t have been the source of his cleptorage, however. He may have stolen the Codex Calixtinus in July of 2011 out of pique, but he\u2019d been making off with huge fistfuls of cash regularly for something like a decade by then. In his confession he said he was acting against the institution that had failed to offer him permanent employment, but he also hinted darkly that the lack of poverty and chastity from certain Cathedral personnel his poor, traumatized eyes had witnessed during his many years on the job drove him to a decade of thievery. The lack of chastity was homosexual, gasp, and the lack of poverty consisted in staff taking money out of the offering bag and helping themselves to the best donations of silverware, hams and fine wines.</p>\n<p>The Codex is now back at the Cathedral. It was returned on July 8th, 2012, four days after it was found in a garbage bag under some newspapers in Casti\u00f1eiras\u2019 garage. It was on public display in the chapter house for the day, after which it was put in a safe location while the Cathedral looked into improving its obviously faulty security systems.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Codex Calixtinus thief sentenced to 10 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34920\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34920#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2015/02/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

It was the wreck of the Norwegian barkentine <em>Coquimbo</em> which ran aground on a reef off Boynton Beach on January 31st, 1909. The postcard had been sent and was postmarked Boynton, August 9th, 1909. The message on the back read:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Boynton Fl. 8/8/09 \u2013 Dear Roger.

The ship\u2019s foghorns awakened guests at the oceanfront Boynton Hotel who hastened to the waterside to see what the commotion was about. The <em>Coquimbo</em> was perched on a sandbar, not sinking, but there were 15 crew members stranded on board, all Scandinavian, including Captain I. Clausen.

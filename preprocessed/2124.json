{"content": "Facebook\u2019s CTO\u00a0Mike Schroepfer has just undergone almost five hours of often forensic and frequently awkward questions from members of a UK parliament committee that\u2019s investigating online disinformation, and whose members have been further fired up by misinformation they claim Facebook gave it. The veteran senior exec, who\u2019s clocked up a decade at the company, also as its VP of engineering, is the latest stand-in for CEO Mark Zuckerberg who keeps\u00a0 eschewing repeat requests to appear . The DCMS committee\u2019s enquiry began last year as a probe into \u2018fake news\u2019 but has snowballed in scope as the scale of concern around political disinformation has also mounted \u2014 including, most recently, fresh information being exposed by journalists about the scale of the misuse of Facebook data for political targeting purposes. During today\u2019s session committee chair Damian Collins again made a direct appeal for Zuckerberg to testify, pausing the flow of questions momentarily to cite news reports suggesting the Facebook founder has agreed to fly to Brussels to testify before European Union lawmakers in relation to the Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal. \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be renewing our request for him to give evidence,\u201d said Collins. \u201cWe still do need the opportunity to put some of these questions to him.\u201d Committee members displayed visible outrage during the session, accusing Facebook of concealing the truth or at very least concealing evidence from it at a prior hearing that took place in Washington in February \u2014 when the company sent its UK head of policy, Simon Milner, and its head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, to field questions. During questioning Milner and\u00a0Bickert failed to inform the committee about a legal agreement Facebook had made with Cambridge Analytica in December 2015 \u2014 after the company had learned (via an earlier Guardian article ) that Facebook user data had been passed to the company by the developer of an app running on its platform. Milner also told the committee that Cambridge Analytica could not have any Facebook data \u2014 yet last month the company admitted data on up to 87 million of its users had indeed been passed to the firm. Schroepfer said he wasn\u2019t sure whether Milner had been \u201cspecifically informed\u201d about the agreement Facebook already had with Cambridge Analytica \u2014 adding: \u201cI\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t know\u201d. He also claimed he had only himself become aware of it \u201cwithin the last month\u201d. \u201c Who knows? Who knows about what the position was with Cambridge Analytica in February of this year? Who was in charge of this?\u201d pressed one committee member. \u201cI don\u2019t know all of the names of the people who knew that specific information at the time,\u201d responded Schroepfer. \u201cWe are a parliamentary committee. We went to Washington for evidence and we raised the issue of Cambridge Analytica. And Facebook concealed evidence to us as an organization on that day. Isn\u2019t that the truth?\u201d rejoined the committee member, pushing past\u00a0Schroepfer\u2019s claim to be \u201cdoing my best\u201d to provide it with information. \u201cYou are doing your best but the buck doesn\u2019t stop with you does it? Where does the buck stop?\u201d \u201cIt stops with Mark,\u201d replied Schroepfer \u2014 leading to a quick fire exchange where he was pressed about (and avoided answering) what Zuckerberg knew and why the Facebook founder wouldn\u2019t come and answer the committee\u2019s questions himself. \u201cWhat we want is the truth. We didn\u2019t get the truth in February\u2026 Mr Schroepfer I remain to be convinced that your company has integrity,\u201d was the pointed conclusion after a lengthy exchange on this. \u201cWhat\u2019s been frustrating for us in this enquiry is a pattern of behavior from the company \u2014 an unwillingness to engage, and a desire to hold onto information and not disclose it,\u201d said Collins, returning to the theme at another stage of the hearing \u2014 and also accusing Facebook of not providing it with \u201cstraight answers\u201d in Washington. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion now if this information hadn\u2019t been brought into the light by investigative journalists,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd Facebook even tried to stop that happening as well [referring to a threat by the company to sue the Guardian ahead of publication of its Cambridge Analytica expos\u00e9]\u2026 It\u2019s a pattern of behavior, of seeking to pretend this isn\u2019t happening.\u201d The committee expressed further dissatisfaction with Facebook immediately following the session, emphasizing that Schroepfer had \u201cfailed to answer fully on nearly 40 separate points\u201d. \u201cMr Schroepfer, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s right hand man whom we were assured could represent his views, today failed to answer many specific and detailed questions about Facebook\u2019s business practices,\u201d said Collins in a statement after the hearing. \u201cWe will be asking him to respond in writing to the committee on these points; however, we are mindful that it took a global reputational crisis and three months for the company to follow up on questions we put to them in Washington D.C. on February 8 .\u00a0 \u201cWe believe that, given the large number of outstanding questions for Facebook to answer, Mark Zuckerberg should still appear in front of the Committee\u2026 and will request that he appears in front of the\u00a0DCMS\u00a0Committee before the\u00a0May 24.\u201d We reached out to Facebook for comment \u2014 but at the time of writing the company had not\u00a0responded. Schroepfer was questioned on a wide range of topics during today\u2019s session. And while he was fuzzy on many details, giving lots of partial answers and promises to \u201cfollow up\u201d, one thing he did confirm was that Facebook board member\u00a0 Peter Thiel\u2019s\u00a0 secretive big data analytics firm,\u00a0Palantir, is one of the companies Facebook is investigating as part of a historical audit of app developers\u2019 use of its platform. Have there ever been concerns raised about Palantir\u2019s activity, and about whether it has gained improper access to Facebook user data, asked Collins. \u201cI think we are looking at lots of different things now. Many people have raised that concern \u2014 and since it\u2019s in the public discourse it\u2019s obviously something we\u2019re looking into,\u201d said\u00a0Schroepfer. \u201cBut it\u2019s part of the review work that Facebook\u2019s doing?\u201d pressed Collins. \u201cCorrect,\u201d he responded. The historical app audit was announced in the wake of last month\u2019s revelations about how much Facebook data Cambridge Analytica was given by app developer (and Cambridge University academic), Dr Aleksandr Kogan \u2014 in what the company couched as a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d. However Kogan, who testified to the committee earlier this week , argues he was just using Facebook\u2019s platform as it was architected and intended to be used \u2014 going so far as to claim its developer terms are \u201cnot legally valid\u201d. (\u201cFor you to break a policy it has to exist. And really be their policy, The reality is Facebook\u2019s policy is unlikely to be their policy,\u201d was Kogan\u2019s construction, earning him a quip from a committee member that he \u201cshould be a professor of semantics\u201d.) Schroepfer said he disagreed with\u00a0Kogan\u2019s assessment that Facebook didn\u2019t have a policy, saying the goal of the platform has been to foster social experiences \u2014 and that \u201cthose same tools, because they\u2019re easy and great for the consumer, can go wrong\u201d. So he did at least indirectly confirm Kogan\u2019s general point that Facebook\u2019s developer and user terms are at loggerheads. \u201cThis is why we have gone through several iterations of the platform \u2014 where we have effectively locked down parts of the platform,\u201d continued Schroepfer. \u201cWhich increases friction and makes it less easy for the consumer to use these things but does safeguard that data more. And been a lot more proactive in the review and enforcement of these things. So this wasn\u2019t a lack of care\u2026 but I\u2019ll tell you that our primary product is designed to help people share safety with a limited audience. \u201cIf you want to say it to the world you can publish it on a blog or on Twitter. If you want to share it with your friends only, that\u2019s the primary thing Facebook does. We violate that trust \u2014 and that data goes somewhere else \u2014 we\u2019re sort of violating the core principles of our product. And that\u2019s a big problem. And this is why I wanted to come to you personally today to talk about this because this is a serious issue.\u201d The same committee member,\u00a0Paul Farrelly, who earlier pressed Kogan about why he hadn\u2019t bothered to find out which political candidates stood to be the beneficiary of his data harvesting and processing activities for Cambridge Analytica, put it to\u00a0Schroepfer that Facebook\u2019s own actions in how it manages its business activities \u2014 and specifically because it embeds its own staff with political campaigns to help them use its tools \u2014 amounts to the company being \u201cDr Kogan writ large\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re not just a neutral platform \u2014 you are players,\u201d said Farrelly. \u201cThe clear thing is we don\u2019t have an opinion on the outcome of these elections. That is not what we are trying to do. We are trying to offer services to any customer of ours who would like to know how to use our products better,\u201d Schroepfer responded. \u201cWe have never turned away a political party because we didn\u2019t want to help them win an election. \u201cWe believe in strong open political discourse and what we\u2019re trying to do is make sure that people can get their messages across.\u201d However in another exchange\u00a0the Facebook exec appeared not to be aware of a basic tenet of UK election law \u2014 which prohibits campaign spending by foreign entities. \u201cHow many UK Facebook users and Instagram users were contacted in the UK referendum by foreign, non-UK entities?\u201d asked committee member Julie Elliott. \u201cWe would have to understand and do the analysis of who \u2014 of all the ads run in that campaign \u2014 where is the location, the source of all of the different advertisers,\u201d said Schroepfer, tailing off with a \u201cso\u2026\u201d and without providing a figure.\u00a0 \u201cBut do you have that information?\u201d pressed Elliott. \u201cI don\u2019t have it on the top of my head. I can see if we can get you some more of it,\u201d he responded. \u201cOur elections are very heavily regulated, and income or monies from other countries can\u2019t be spent in our elections in any way shape or form,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I would have thought that you would have that information. Because your company will be aware of what our electoral law is.\u201d \u201cAgain I don\u2019t have that information on me,\u201d Schroepfer said \u2014 repeating the line that Facebook would \u201cfollow up with the relevant information\u201d. The Facebook CTO was also asked if the company could provide it with an archive of adverts that were run on its platform around the time of the Brexit referendum by Aggregate IQ \u2014 a Canadian data company that\u2019s been linked to Cambridge Analytica/SCL, and which received\u00a0 \u00a33.5M from leave campaign groups \u00a0in the run up to the 2016 referendum (and has also been described by leave campaigners as instrumental to securing their win). It\u2019s also under joint investigation by Canadian data watchdogs, along with Facebook. In written evidence provided to the committee today Facebook says it has been helping ongoing investigations into \u201cthe Cambridge Analytica issue\u201d that are being undertaken by the UK\u2019s Electoral Commission and its data protection watchdog, the ICO. Here it writes that its records show AIQ spent \u201capproximately $2M USD on ads from pages that appear to be associated with the 2016 Referendum\u201d. Schroepfer\u2019s responses on several requests by the committee for historical samples of the referendum ads AIQ had run amounted to \u2018we\u2019ll see what we can do\u2019 \u2014 with the exec cautioning that he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how much data might have been retained. \u201cI think specifically in Aggregate IQ and Cambridge Analytica related to the UK referendum I believe we are producing more extensive information for both the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner,\u201d he said at one point, adding it would also provide the committee with the same information if it\u2019s legally able to. \u201cI think we are trying to do \u2014 give them all the data we have on the ads and what they spent and what they\u2019re like.\u201d Collins asked what would happen if an organization or an individual had used a Facebook ad account to target dark ads during the referendum and then taken down the page as soon as the campaign was over. \u201cHow would you be able to identify that activity had ever taken place?\u201d he asked. \u201cI do believe, uh, we have \u2014 I would have to confirm, but there is a possibility that we have a separate system \u2014 a log of the ads that were run,\u201d said Schroepfer, displaying some of the fuzziness that irritated the committee. \u201cI know we would have the page itself if the page was still active. If they\u2019d run prior campaigns and deleted the page we may retain some information about those ads \u2014 I don\u2019t know the specifics, for example how detailed that information is, and how long retention is for that particular set of data.\u201d Collins pointed out that a big part of UK (and indeed US) election law relates to \u201cdeclaration of spent\u201d, before making the conjoined point that if someone is \u201chiding that spend\u201d \u2014 i.e. by placing dark ads that only the recipient sees, and which can be taken offline immediately after the campaign \u2014 it smells like a major risk to the democratic process. \u201cIf no one\u2019s got the ability to audit that, that is a major threat to democracy,\u201d warned Collins. \u201cAnd would be a license for a major breach of election law.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d responded\u00a0Schroepfer as if the risk had never crossed his mind before. \u201cWe can come back on the details on that.\u201d On the wider app audit that Facebook has committed to carrying out in the wake of the scandal,\u00a0Schroepfer was also asked how it can audit apps or entities that are no longer on the platform \u2014 and he admitted this is \u201ca challenge\u201d and said Facebook won\u2019t have \u201cperfect information or detail\u201d. \u201cThis is going to be a challenge again because we\u2019re dealing with historic events so we\u2019re not going to have perfect information or detail on any of these things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think where we start is \u2014 it very well may be that this company is defunct but we can look at how they used the platform. Maybe there\u2019s two people who used the app and they asked for relatively innocuous data \u2014 so the chance that that is a big issue is a lot lower than an app that was widely in circulation. So I think we can at least look at that sort of information. And try to chase down the trail. \u201cIf we have concerns about it even if the company is defunct it\u2019s possible we can find former employees of the company who might have more information about it. This starts with trying to identify where the issues might be and then run the trail down as much as we can. As you highlight, though, there are going to be limits to what we can find. But our goal is to understand this as best as we can.\u201d The committee also wanted to know if Facebook had set a deadline for completing the audit \u2014 but\u00a0Schroepfer would only say it\u2019s going \u201cas fast as we can\u201d. He claimed Facebook is sharing \u201ca tremendous amount of information\u201d with the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog \u2014 as it continues its (now) year-long investigation into the use of digital data for political purposes. \u201cI would guess we\u2019re sharing information on this too,\u201d he said in reference to app audit data. \u201cI know that I personally shared a bunch of details on a variety of things we\u2019re doing. And same with the Electoral Commission [which is investigating whether use of digital data and social media platforms broke campaign spending rules].\u201d In Schroepfer\u2019s written evidence to the committee Facebook says it has unearthed some suggestive links between Cambridge Analytica/SCL and Aggegrate IQ: \u201cIn the course of our ongoing review, we also found certain billing and administration connections between SCL/Cambridge Analytica and AIQ\u201d, it notes. Both entities continue to deny any link exists between them, claiming they are entirely separate entities \u2014 though the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, Chris Wylie, has described AIQ as essentially the Canadian arm of SCL. \u201cThe collaboration we saw was some billing and administrative contacts between the two of them, so you\u2019d see similar people show up in each of the accounts,\u201d said\u00a0Schroepfer, when asked for more detail about what it had found, before declining to say anything else in a public setting on account of ongoing investigations \u2014 despite the committee pointing out other witnesses it has heard from have not held back on that front. Another piece of information Facebook has included in the written evidence\u00a0is the claim that it does not believe AIQ used Facebook data obtained via Kogan\u2019s apps for targeting referendum ads \u2014 saying it used email address uploads for \u201cmany\u201d of its ad campaigns during the referendum. \u201c The data gathered through the TIYDL [Kogan\u2019s thisisyourdigitallife] app did not include the email addresses of app installers or their friends. This means that AIQ could not have obtained these email addresses from the data TIYDL gathered from Facebook,\u201d Facebook asserts.\u00a0 Schroepfer was questioned on this during the session and said that while there was some overlap in terms of individuals who had downloaded Kogan\u2019s app and who had been in the audiences targeted by AIQ this was only 3-4% \u2014 which he claimed was statistically insignificant, based on comparing with other Facebook apps of similar popularity to Kogan\u2019s. \u201cAIQ must have obtained these email addresses for British voters targeted in these campaigns from a different source,\u201d is the company\u2019s conclusion. The committee also asked several questions about Joseph Chancellor, the co-director of Kogan\u2019s app company, GSR, who became an employee of Facebook in 2015 after he had left GSR. Its questions included what Chancellor\u2019s exact role at Facebook is and why Kogan has been heavily criticized by the company yet his GSR co-director apparently remains gainfully employed by it. Schroepfer initially claimed Facebook hadn\u2019t known Chancellor was a director of GSR prior to employing him, in November 2015 \u2014 saying it had only become aware of that specific piece of his employment history in 2017. But after a break in the hearing he \u00a0 \u2018clarified\u2019 this answer \u2014 adding: \u201cIn the recruiting process, people hiring him probably saw a CV and may have known he was part of GSR. Had someone known that \u2014 had we connected all the dots to when this thing happened with Mr Kogan, later on had he been mentioned in the documents that we signed with the Kogan party \u2014 no. Is it possible that someone knew about this and the right other people in the organization didn\u2019t know about it, that is possible.\u201d A committee member then pressed him further. \u201cWe have evidence that shows that Facebook knew in November 2016 that Joseph Chancellor had formed the company, GSR, with Aleksandr Kogan which obviously then went on to provide the information to Cambridge Analytica. I\u2019m very unclear as to why Facebook have taken such a very direct and critical line\u2026 with Kogan but have completely ignored Joseph Chancellor.\u201d At that point\u00a0Schroepfer revealed Facebook is currently investigating Chancellor as a result of the data scandal. \u201cI understand your concern. We are investigating Mr Chancellor\u2019s role right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an employment investigation going on right now. In terms of the work Chancellor is doing for Facebook, Schroepfer said he thought\u00a0he had worked on VR for the company \u2014 but emphasized he has not been involved with \u201cthe platform\u201d. The issue of the NDA Kogan claimed Facebook had made him sign also came up. But\u00a0Schroepfer counter claimed that this was not an NDA but just a \u201cstandard confidentiality clause\u201d in the agreement to certify Kogan had deleted the Facebook data and its derivatives. \u201cWe want him to be able to be open. We\u2019re waiving any confidentiality there if that\u2019s not clear from a legal standpoint,\u201d he said later, clarifying it does not consider Kogan legally gagged. Schroepfer also confirmed this agreement was signed with Kogan in June 2016, and said the \u201ccore commitments\u201d were to confirm the deletion of data from himself and three others Kogan had passed it to: Former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix; Wylie, for a company he had set up after leaving Cambridge Analytica; and Dr Michael Inzlicht from the Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience (Kogan mentioned to the committee earlier this week he had also passed some of the Facebook data to a fellow academic in Canada). Asked whether any payments had been made between Facebook and Kogan as part of the contract, Schroepfer said: \u201cI believe there was no payment involved in this at all.\u201d Other issues raised by the committee included why Facebook does not provide an overall control or opt-out for political advertising; why it does not offer a separate feed for ads but chooses to embed them into the Newsfeed; how and why it gathers data on non-users; the addictiveness engineered into its product; what it does about fake accounts; why it hasn\u2019t recruited more humans to help with the \u201cchallenges\u201d of managing content on a platform that\u2019s scaled so large; and aspects of its approach to GDPR compliance. On the latter, Schroepfer was queried specifically on why Facebook had decided to shift the data controller of ~1.5BN non-EU international users from Ireland to the US. On this he claimed the GDPR\u2019s stipulation that there be a \u201clead regulator\u201d conflicts with Facebook\u2019s desire to be more responsive to local concerns in its non-EU international markets. \u201cUS law does not have a notion of a lead regulator so the US does not become the lead regulator \u2014 it opens up the opportunity for us to have local markets have them, regions, be the lead and final regulator for the users in that area,\u201d he claimed. Asked whether he thinks the time has come for \u201crobust regulation and empowerment of consumers over their information\u201d, Schroepfer demurred that new regulation is needed to control data flowing over consumer platforms. \u201cWhether, through regulation or not, making sure consumers have visibility, control and can access and take their information with you, I agree 100%,\u201d he said, agreeing only to further self-regulation not to the need for new laws. \u201cIn terms of regulation there are multiple laws and regulatory bodies that we are under the guise of right now. Obviously the GDPR is coming into effect just next month. We have been regulated in Europe by the Irish DPC whose done extensive audits of our systems over multiple years. In the US we\u2019re regulated by the FTC, Privacy Commissioner in Canada and others. So I think the question isn\u2019t \u2018if\u2019, the question is honestly how do we ensure the regulations and the practices achieve the goals you want. Which is consumers have safety, they have transparency, they understand how this stuff works, and they have control. \u201cAnd the details of implementing that is where all the really hard work is.\u201d His stock response to the committee\u2019s concerns about divisive political ads was that Facebook believes \u201cradical transparency\u201d is the fix \u2014 also dropping one tidbit of extra news on that front in his written testimony by saying Facebook will roll out an authentication process for political advertisers in the UK in time for the local elections in May 2019. Ads will also be required to be labeled as \u201cpolitical\u201d and disclose who paid for the ad. And there will be a searchable archive \u2014 available for seven years \u2014 which will include the ads themselves plus some associated data (such as\u00a0how many times an ad may have been seen, how much money was spent, and the kinds of people who saw it). Collins asked\u00a0Schroepfer whether Facebook\u2019s ad transparency measures will also include \u201ctargeting data\u201d \u2014 i.e. \u201cwill I understand not just who the advertiser was and what other adverts they\u2019d run but why they\u2019d chose to advertise to me\u201d? \u201cI believe among the things you\u2019ll see is spend (how much was spent on this ad); you will see who they were trying to advertise to (what is the audience they were trying to reach); and I believe you will also be able to see some basic information on how much it was viewed,\u201d Schroepfer replied \u2014 avoiding yet another straight answer.", "title_html": "<h1 class=\"article__title\">What we learned from Facebook\u2019s latest data misuse grilling</h1> ", "url":

committee that\u2019s investigating online disinformation, and whose members have been further fired up by misinformation they claim Facebook gave it.</p>\n<p>The veteran senior exec, who\u2019s clocked up a decade at the company, also as its VP of engineering, is the latest stand-in for CEO Mark Zuckerberg who keeps\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/zuckerberg-refuses-uk-parliament-summons-over-fb-data-misuse/\">eschewing repeat requests to appear</a>.</p>\n<p>The DCMS committee\u2019s enquiry began last year as a probe into \u2018fake news\u2019 but has snowballed in scope as the scale of concern around political disinformation has also mounted \u2014 including, most recently, fresh information being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\">exposed by journalists</a> about the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">scale of the misuse of Facebook data</a> for political targeting purposes.</p>\n<p>During today\u2019s session committee chair Damian Collins again made a direct appeal for Zuckerberg to testify, pausing the flow of questions momentarily to cite <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/mark-zuckerberg-to-come-to-brussels-parliament-official/\">news reports</a> suggesting the Facebook founder has agreed to fly to Brussels to testify before European Union lawmakers in relation to the Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be renewing our request for him to give evidence,\u201d said Collins. \u201cWe still do need the opportunity to put some of these questions to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Committee members displayed visible outrage during the session, accusing Facebook of concealing the truth or at very least concealing evidence from it at a prior hearing that took place in Washington in February \u2014 when the company sent its UK head of policy, Simon Milner, and its head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, to field questions.</p>\n<p>During questioning Milner and\u00a0Bickert failed to inform the committee about a legal agreement Facebook had made with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"cambridge-analytica\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge Analytica <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> in December 2015 \u2014 after the company had learned (via an earlier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data\">Guardian article</a>) that Facebook user data had been passed to the company by the developer of an app running on its platform.</p>\n<p>Milner also told the committee that Cambridge Analytica could not have any Facebook data \u2014 yet last month the company admitted data on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">up to 87 million</a> of its users had indeed been passed to the firm.</p>\n<p>Schroepfer said he wasn\u2019t sure whether Milner had been \u201cspecifically informed\u201d about the agreement Facebook already had with Cambridge Analytica \u2014 adding: \u201cI\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t know\u201d. He also claimed he had only himself become aware of it \u201cwithin the last month\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Who</em> knows? Who knows about what the position was with Cambridge Analytica in February of this year? Who was in charge of this?\u201d pressed one committee member.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know all of the names of the people who knew that specific information at the time,\u201d responded Schroepfer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are a parliamentary committee. We went to Washington for evidence and we raised the issue of Cambridge Analytica. And Facebook concealed evidence to us as an organization on that day. Isn\u2019t that the truth?\u201d rejoined the committee member, pushing past\u00a0Schroepfer\u2019s claim to be \u201cdoing my best\u201d to provide it with information.</p>\n<h2>A pattern of evasive behavior</h2>\n<p>\u201cYou are doing your best but the buck doesn\u2019t stop with you does it? Where does the buck stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt stops with Mark,\u201d replied Schroepfer \u2014 leading to a quick fire exchange where he was pressed about (and avoided answering) what Zuckerberg knew and why the Facebook founder wouldn\u2019t come and answer the committee\u2019s questions himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we want is the truth. We didn\u2019t get the truth in February\u2026 Mr Schroepfer I remain to be convinced that your company has integrity,\u201d was the pointed conclusion after a lengthy exchange on this.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been frustrating for us in this enquiry is a pattern of behavior from the company \u2014 an unwillingness to engage, and a desire to hold onto information and not disclose it,\u201d said Collins, returning to the theme at another stage of the hearing \u2014 and also accusing Facebook of not providing it with \u201cstraight answers\u201d in Washington.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion now if this information hadn\u2019t been brought into the light by investigative journalists,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd Facebook even tried to stop that happening as well [referring to a threat by the company to sue the Guardian ahead of publication of its Cambridge Analytica expos\u00e9]\u2026 It\u2019s a pattern of behavior, of seeking to pretend this isn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>The committee expressed further dissatisfaction with Facebook immediately following the session, emphasizing that Schroepfer had \u201cfailed to answer fully on nearly 40 separate points\u201d.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMr Schroepfer, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s right hand man whom we were assured could represent his views, today failed to answer many specific and detailed questions about Facebook\u2019s business practices,\u201d said Collins in a statement after the hearing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe will be asking him to respond in writing to the committee on these points; however, we are mindful that it took a global reputational crisis and three months for the company to follow up on questions we put to them in Washington D.C. on February 8<span style=\"font-size: 13.5px;\">.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe believe that, given the large number of outstanding questions for Facebook to answer, Mark Zuckerberg should still appear in front of the Committee\u2026 and will request that he appears in front of the\u00a0DCMS\u00a0Committee before the\u00a0May 24.\u201d</p>\n<p>We reached out to Facebook for comment \u2014 but at the time of writing the company had not\u00a0responded.</p>\n<h2>Palantir\u2019s data use under review</h2>\n<p>Schroepfer was questioned on a wide range of topics during today\u2019s session. And while he was fuzzy on many details, giving lots of partial answers and promises to \u201cfollow up\u201d, one thing he did confirm was that Facebook board member\u00a0<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"peter-thiel\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Thiel\u2019s\u00a0</a>secretive big data analytics firm,\u00a0Palantir, is one of the companies Facebook is investigating as part of a historical audit of app developers\u2019 use of its platform.</p>\n<p>Have there ever been concerns raised about Palantir\u2019s activity, and about whether it has gained improper access to Facebook user data, asked Collins.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we are looking at lots of different things now. Many people have raised that concern \u2014 and since it\u2019s in the public discourse it\u2019s obviously something we\u2019re looking into,\u201d said\u00a0Schroepfer.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s part of the review work that Facebook\u2019s doing?\u201d pressed Collins.</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d he responded.</p>\n<p>The historical app audit was announced in the wake of last month\u2019s revelations about how much Facebook data Cambridge Analytica was given by app developer (and Cambridge University academic), Dr <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"aleksandr-kogan\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/aleksandr-kogan\" target=\"_blank\">Aleksandr Kogan <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> \u2014 in what the company couched as a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d.</p>\n<p>However Kogan, who testified to the committee <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/kogan-i-dont-think-facebook-has-a-developer-policy-that-is-valid/\">earlier this week</a>, argues he was just using Facebook\u2019s platform as it was architected and intended to be used \u2014 going so far as to claim its developer terms are \u201cnot legally valid\u201d. (\u201cFor you to break a policy it has to exist. And really be their policy, The reality is Facebook\u2019s policy is unlikely to be their policy,\u201d was Kogan\u2019s construction, earning him a quip from a committee member that he \u201cshould be a professor of semantics\u201d.)</p>\n<p>Schroepfer said he disagreed with\u00a0Kogan\u2019s assessment that Facebook didn\u2019t have a policy, saying the goal of the platform has been to foster social experiences \u2014 and that \u201cthose same tools, because they\u2019re easy and great for the consumer, can go wrong\u201d. So he did at least indirectly confirm Kogan\u2019s general point that Facebook\u2019s developer and user terms are at loggerheads.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why we have gone through several iterations of the platform \u2014 where we have effectively locked down parts of the platform,\u201d continued Schroepfer. \u201cWhich increases friction and makes it less easy for the consumer to use these things but does safeguard that data more. And been a lot more proactive in the review and enforcement of these things. So this wasn\u2019t a lack of care\u2026 but I\u2019ll tell you that our primary product is designed to help people share safety with a limited audience.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to say it to the world you can publish it on a blog or on Twitter. If you want to share it with your friends only, that\u2019s the primary thing Facebook does. We violate that trust \u2014 and that data goes somewhere else \u2014 we\u2019re sort of violating the core principles of our product. And that\u2019s a big problem. And this is why I wanted to come to you personally today to talk about this because this is a serious issue.\u201d</p>\n<h2>\u201cYou\u2019re not just a neutral platform \u2014 you are players\u201d</h2>\n<p>The same committee member,\u00a0Paul Farrelly, who earlier pressed Kogan about why he hadn\u2019t bothered to find out which political candidates stood to be the beneficiary of his data harvesting and processing activities for Cambridge Analytica, put it to\u00a0Schroepfer that Facebook\u2019s own actions in how it manages its business activities \u2014 and specifically because it embeds its own staff with political campaigns to help them use its tools \u2014 amounts to the company being \u201cDr Kogan writ large\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just a neutral platform \u2014 you are players,\u201d said Farrelly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe clear thing is we don\u2019t have an opinion on the outcome of these elections. That is not what we are trying to do. We are trying to offer services to any customer of ours who would like to know how to use our products better,\u201d Schroepfer responded. \u201cWe have never turned away a political party because we didn\u2019t want to help them win an election.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe in strong open political discourse and what we\u2019re trying to do is make sure that people can get their messages across.\u201d</p>\n<p>However in another exchange\u00a0the Facebook exec appeared not to be aware of a basic tenet of UK election law \u2014 which prohibits campaign spending by foreign entities.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many UK Facebook users and Instagram users were contacted in the UK referendum by foreign, non-UK entities?\u201d asked committee member Julie Elliott.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u201cWe would have to understand and do the analysis of who \u2014 of all the ads run in that campaign \u2014 where is the location, the source of all of the different advertisers,\u201d said Schroepfer, tailing off with a \u201cso\u2026\u201d and without providing a figure.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBut do you have that information?\u201d pressed Elliott.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it on the top of my head. I can see if we can get you some more of it,\u201d he responded.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur elections are very heavily regulated, and income or monies from other countries can\u2019t be spent in our elections in any way shape or form,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I would have thought that you would have that information. Because your company will be aware of what our electoral law is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain I don\u2019t have that information on me,\u201d Schroepfer said \u2014 repeating the line that Facebook would \u201cfollow up with the relevant information\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Facebook CTO was also asked if the company could provide it with an archive of adverts that were run on its platform around the time of the Brexit referendum by Aggregate IQ \u2014 a Canadian data company that\u2019s been linked to Cambridge Analytica/SCL, and which received\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/24/exclusive-tiny-canadian-company-helped-swing-brexit-vote-leave/\">\u00a33.5M from leave campaign groups</a>\u00a0in the run up to the 2016 referendum (and has also been described by leave campaigners as instrumental to securing their win). It\u2019s also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/facebook-aggregateiq-now-being-jointly-probed-by-canada-b-c-data-watchdogs/\">under joint investigation</a> by Canadian data watchdogs, along with Facebook.</p>\n<p>In written evidence provided to the committee today Facebook says it has been helping ongoing investigations into \u201cthe Cambridge Analytica issue\u201d that are being undertaken by the UK\u2019s Electoral Commission and its data protection watchdog, the ICO. Here it writes that its records show AIQ spent \u201capproximately $2M USD on ads from pages that appear to be associated with the 2016 Referendum\u201d.</p>\n<p>Schroepfer\u2019s responses on several requests by the committee for historical samples of the referendum ads AIQ had run amounted to \u2018we\u2019ll see what we can do\u2019 \u2014 with the exec cautioning that he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how much data might have been retained.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think specifically in Aggregate IQ and Cambridge Analytica related to the UK referendum I believe we are producing more extensive information for both the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner,\u201d he said at one point, adding it would also provide the committee with the same information if it\u2019s legally able to. \u201cI think we are trying to do \u2014 give them all the data we have on the ads and what they spent and what they\u2019re like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Collins asked what would happen if an organization or an individual had used a Facebook ad account to target dark ads during the referendum and then taken down the page as soon as the campaign was over. \u201cHow would you be able to identify that activity had ever taken place?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do believe, uh, we have \u2014 I would have to confirm, but there is a possibility that we have a separate system \u2014 a log of the ads that were run,\u201d said Schroepfer, displaying some of the fuzziness that irritated the committee. \u201cI know we would have the page itself if the page was still active. If they\u2019d run prior campaigns and deleted the page we may retain some information about those ads \u2014 I don\u2019t know the specifics, for example how detailed that information is, and how long retention is for that particular set of data.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Dark ads a \u201cmajor threat to democracy\u201d</h2>\n<p>Collins pointed out that a big part of UK (and indeed US) election law relates to \u201cdeclaration of spent\u201d, before making the conjoined point that if someone is \u201chiding that spend\u201d \u2014 i.e. by placing dark ads that only the recipient sees, and which can be taken offline immediately after the campaign \u2014 it smells like a major risk to the democratic process.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf no one\u2019s got the ability to audit that, that is a major threat to democracy,\u201d warned Collins. \u201cAnd would be a license for a major breach of election law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d responded\u00a0Schroepfer as if the risk had never crossed his mind before. \u201cWe can come back on the details on that.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the wider app audit that Facebook has committed to carrying out in the wake of the scandal,\u00a0Schroepfer was also asked how it can audit apps or entities that are no longer on the platform \u2014 and he admitted this is \u201ca challenge\u201d and said Facebook won\u2019t have \u201cperfect information or detail\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is going to be a challenge again because we\u2019re dealing with historic events so we\u2019re not going to have perfect information or detail on any of these things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think where we start is \u2014 it very well may be that this company is defunct but we can look at how they used the platform. Maybe there\u2019s two people who used the app and they asked for relatively innocuous data \u2014 so the chance that that is a big issue is a lot lower than an app that was widely in circulation. So I think we can at least look at that sort of information. And try to chase down the trail.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we have concerns about it even if the company is defunct it\u2019s possible we can find former employees of the company who might have more information about it. This starts with trying to identify where the issues might be and then run the trail down as much as we can. As you highlight, though, there are going to be limits to what we can find. But our goal is to understand this as best as we can.\u201d</p>\n<p>The committee also wanted to know if Facebook had set a deadline for completing the audit \u2014 but\u00a0Schroepfer would only say it\u2019s going \u201cas fast as we can\u201d.</p>\n<p>He claimed Facebook is sharing \u201ca tremendous amount of information\u201d with the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog \u2014 as it continues its (now) year-long investigation into the use of digital data for political purposes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would guess we\u2019re sharing information on this too,\u201d he said in reference to app audit data. \u201cI know that I personally shared a bunch of details on a variety of things we\u2019re doing. And same with the Electoral Commission [which is investigating whether use of digital data and social media platforms broke campaign spending rules].\u201d</p>\n<p>In Schroepfer\u2019s written evidence to the committee Facebook says it has unearthed some suggestive links between Cambridge Analytica/SCL and Aggegrate IQ: \u201cIn the course of our ongoing review, we also found certain billing and administration connections between SCL/Cambridge Analytica and AIQ\u201d, it notes.</p>\n<p>Both entities continue to deny any link exists between them, claiming they are entirely separate entities \u2014 though the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, Chris Wylie, has described AIQ as essentially the Canadian arm of SCL.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe collaboration we saw was some billing and administrative contacts between the two of them, so you\u2019d see similar people show up in each of the accounts,\u201d said\u00a0Schroepfer, when asked for more detail about what it had found, before declining to say anything else in a public setting on account of ongoing investigations \u2014 despite the committee pointing out other witnesses it has heard from have not held back on that front.</p>\n<p>Another piece of information Facebook has included in the written evidence\u00a0is the claim that it does not believe AIQ used Facebook data obtained via Kogan\u2019s apps for targeting referendum ads \u2014 saying it used email address uploads for \u201cmany\u201d of its ad campaigns during the referendum.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The data gathered through the TIYDL [Kogan\u2019s thisisyourdigitallife] app did not include the email addresses of app installers or their friends. This means that AIQ could not have obtained these email addresses from the data TIYDL gathered from Facebook,\u201d Facebook asserts.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Schroepfer was questioned on this during the session and said that while there was some overlap in terms of individuals who had downloaded Kogan\u2019s app and who had been in the audiences targeted by AIQ this was only 3-4% \u2014 which he claimed was statistically insignificant, based on comparing with other Facebook apps of similar popularity to Kogan\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cAIQ must have obtained these email addresses for British voters targeted in these campaigns from a different source,\u201d is the company\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<h2>\u201cWe are investigating Mr Chancellor\u2019s role right now\u201d</h2>\n<p>The committee also asked several questions about Joseph Chancellor, the co-director of Kogan\u2019s app company, GSR, who became an employee of Facebook in 2015 after he had left GSR. Its questions included what Chancellor\u2019s exact role at Facebook is and why Kogan has been heavily criticized by the company yet his GSR co-director apparently remains gainfully employed by it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Schroepfer initially claimed Facebook hadn\u2019t known Chancellor was a director of GSR prior to employing him, in November 2015 \u2014 saying it had only become aware of that specific piece of his employment history in 2017.</span></p>\n<p>But after a break in the hearing he<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0</span>\u2018clarified\u2019 this answer \u2014 adding: \u201cIn the recruiting process, people hiring him probably saw a CV and may have known he was part of GSR. Had someone known that \u2014 had we connected all the dots to when this thing happened with Mr Kogan, later on had he been mentioned in the documents that we signed with the Kogan party \u2014 no. Is it possible that someone knew about this and the right other people in the organization didn\u2019t know about it, that is possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>A committee member then pressed him further. \u201cWe have evidence that shows that Facebook knew in November 2016 that Joseph Chancellor had formed the company, GSR, with Aleksandr Kogan which obviously then went on to provide the information to Cambridge Analytica. I\u2019m very unclear as to why Facebook have taken such a very direct and critical line\u2026 with Kogan but have completely ignored Joseph Chancellor.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that point\u00a0Schroepfer revealed Facebook is currently investigating Chancellor as a result of the data scandal.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand your concern. We are investigating Mr Chancellor\u2019s role right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an employment investigation going on right now.</p>\n<p>In terms of the work Chancellor is doing for Facebook, Schroepfer said he thought\u00a0he had worked on VR for the company \u2014 but emphasized he has not been involved with \u201cthe platform\u201d.</p>\n<p>The issue of the NDA Kogan claimed Facebook had made him sign also came up. But\u00a0Schroepfer counter claimed that this was not an NDA but just a \u201cstandard confidentiality clause\u201d in the agreement to certify Kogan had deleted the Facebook data and its derivatives.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe want him to be able to be open. We\u2019re waiving any confidentiality there if that\u2019s not clear from a legal standpoint,\u201d he said later, clarifying it does not consider Kogan legally gagged.</p>\n<p>Schroepfer also confirmed this agreement was signed with Kogan in June 2016, and said the \u201ccore commitments\u201d were to confirm the deletion of data from himself and three others Kogan had passed it to: Former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix; Wylie, for a company he had set up after leaving Cambridge Analytica; and Dr Michael Inzlicht from the Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience (Kogan mentioned to the committee earlier this week he had also passed some of the Facebook data to a fellow academic in Canada).</p>\n<p>Asked whether any payments had been made between Facebook and Kogan as part of the contract, Schroepfer said: \u201cI believe there was no payment involved in this at all.\u201d</p>\n<h2>\u2018Radical\u2019 transparency is its fix for regulation</h2>\n<p>Other issues raised by the committee included why Facebook does not provide an overall control or opt-out for political advertising; why it does not offer a separate feed for ads but chooses to embed them into the Newsfeed; how and why it gathers data on non-users; the addictiveness engineered into its product; what it does about fake accounts; why it hasn\u2019t recruited more humans to help with the \u201cchallenges\u201d of managing content on a platform that\u2019s scaled so large; and aspects of its approach to GDPR compliance.</p>\n<p>On the latter, Schroepfer was queried specifically on why Facebook had decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/19/facebook-moves-to-shrink-its-legal-liabilities-under-gdpr/\">shift the data controller of ~1.5BN non-EU international users</a> from Ireland to the US. On this he claimed the GDPR\u2019s stipulation that there be a \u201clead regulator\u201d conflicts with Facebook\u2019s desire to be more responsive to local concerns in its non-EU international markets.</p>\n<p>\u201cUS law does not have a notion of a lead regulator so the US does not become the lead regulator \u2014 it opens up the opportunity for us to have local markets have them, regions, be the lead and final regulator for the users in that area,\u201d he claimed.</p>\n<p>Asked whether he thinks the time has come for \u201crobust regulation and empowerment of consumers over their information\u201d, Schroepfer demurred that new regulation is needed to control data flowing over consumer platforms. \u201cWhether, through regulation or not, making sure consumers have visibility, control and can access and take their information with you, I agree 100%,\u201d he said, agreeing only to further self-regulation not to the need for new laws.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn terms of regulation there are multiple laws and regulatory bodies that we are under the guise of right now. Obviously the GDPR is coming into effect just next month. We have been regulated in Europe by the Irish DPC whose done extensive audits of our systems over multiple years. In the US we\u2019re regulated by the FTC, Privacy Commissioner in Canada and others. So I think the question isn\u2019t \u2018if\u2019, the question is honestly how do we ensure the regulations and the practices achieve the goals you want. Which is consumers have safety, they have transparency, they understand how this stuff works, and they have control.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the details of implementing that is where all the really hard work is.\u201d</p>\n<p>His stock response to the committee\u2019s concerns about divisive political ads was that Facebook believes \u201cradical transparency\u201d is the fix \u2014 also dropping one tidbit of extra news on that front in his written testimony by saying Facebook will roll out an authentication process for political advertisers in the UK in time for the local elections in May 2019.</p>\n<p>Ads will also be required to be labeled as \u201cpolitical\u201d and disclose who paid for the ad. And there will be a searchable archive \u2014 available for seven years \u2014 which will include the ads themselves plus some associated data (such as\u00a0how many times an ad may have been seen, how much money was spent, and the kinds of people who saw it).</p>\n<p>Collins asked\u00a0Schroepfer whether Facebook\u2019s ad transparency measures will also include \u201ctargeting data\u201d \u2014 i.e. \u201cwill I understand not just who the advertiser was and what other adverts they\u2019d run but why they\u2019d chose to advertise to me\u201d?</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe among the things you\u2019ll see is spend (how much was spent on this ad); you will see who they were trying to advertise to (what is the audience they were trying to reach); and I believe you will also be able to see some basic information on how much it was viewed,\u201d Schroepfer replied \u2014 avoiding yet another straight answer.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n<input class=\"shortlink\" readonly=\"\" title=\"Article Shortlink\" type=\"text\" value=\"\"/>\n</footer>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div><!-- end React-root duplication div -->\n</div><!--end #root-->\n<noscript style=\"display:none;\">\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&amp;ev=PageView&amp;noscript=1\" width=\"1\"/>\n</noscript>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t// Configure the PARSELY window global to disable auto-tracking.\n\t\t// Must load before the Parse.ly script itself.\n\t\twindow.PARSELY = {\n\t\t\tautotrack: false,\n\t\t\tonload:    this.onload,\n\t\t};\n\t</script>\n<script data-parsely-site=\"techcrunch.com\" id=\"parsely-cfg\" src=\"//d1z2jf7jlzjs58.cloudfront.net/keys/techcrunch.com/p.js\"></script>\n<!-- JSON-LD -->\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n\t\t{\"@context\":\"http:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"TechCrunch\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"imageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/themes\\/techcrunch-2017\\/images\\/logo-json-ld.png\",\"width\":\"600\",\"height\":\"60\"}},\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/04\\/26\\/what-we-learned-from-facebooks-latest-data-misuse-grilling\\/\"},\"headline\":\"What we learned from Facebook&#8217;s latest data misuse grilling\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2018\\/04\\/screen-shot-2018-04-26-at-9-00-15-pm.png?w=680\",\"width\":680,\"height\":379},\"datePublished\":\"2018-04-26T20:14:56+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2018-05-10T22:45:35+00:00\",\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Natasha Lomas\"}],\"description\":\"Facebook&#8217;s CTO\\u00a0Mike Schroepfer has just undergone almost five hours of often forensic and frequently awkward questions from members of a UK parliament committee that&#8217;s investigating online disinformation, and whose members have been further fired up by misinformation they claim Facebook gave it.

class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> CTO\\u00a0Mike Schroepfer has just undergone almost five hours of often forensic and frequently awkward questions from members of a UK parliament committee that&#8217;s investigating online disinformation, and whose members have been further fired up by misinformation they claim Facebook gave it.<\\/p>\\n<p>The veteran senior exec, who&#8217;s clocked up a decade at the company, also as its VP of engineering, is the latest stand-in for CEO Mark Zuckerberg who keeps\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/03\\/27\\/zuckerberg-refuses-uk-parliament-summons-over-fb-data-misuse\\/\\\">eschewing repeat requests to appear<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>The DCMS committee&#8217;s enquiry began last year as a probe into &#8216;fake news&#8217; but has snowballed in scope as the scale of concern around political disinformation has also mounted &#8212; including, most recently, fresh information being <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/news\\/2018\\/mar\\/17\\/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\\\">exposed by journalists<\\/a> about the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/04\\/04\\/cambridge-analytica-87-million\\/\\\">scale of the misuse of Facebook data<\\/a> for political targeting purposes.<\\/p>\\n<p>During today&#8217;s session committee chair Damian Collins again made a direct appeal for Zuckerberg to testify, pausing the flow of questions momentarily to cite <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.politico.eu\\/article\\/mark-zuckerberg-to-come-to-brussels-parliament-official\\/\\\">news reports<\\/a> suggesting the Facebook founder has agreed to fly to Brussels to testify before European Union lawmakers in relation to the Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll certainly be renewing our request for him to give evidence,&#8221; said Collins. &#8220;We still do need the opportunity to put some of these questions to him.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Committee members displayed visible outrage during the session, accusing Facebook of concealing the truth or at very least concealing evidence from it at a prior hearing that took place in Washington in February &#8212; when the company sent its UK head of policy, Simon Milner, and its head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, to field questions.<\\/p>\\n<p>During questioning Milner and\\u00a0Bickert failed to inform the committee about a legal agreement Facebook had made with <a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/cambridge-analytica\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-type=\\\"organization\\\" data-entity=\\\"cambridge-analytica\\\">Cambridge Analytica <span class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> in December 2015 &#8212; after the company had learned (via an earlier <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2015\\/dec\\/11\\/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data\\\">Guardian article<\\/a>) that Facebook user data had been passed to the company by the developer of an app running on its platform.<\\/p>\\n<p>Milner also told the committee that Cambridge Analytica could not have any Facebook data &#8212; yet last month the company admitted data on <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/04\\/04\\/cambridge-analytica-87-million\\/\\\">up to 87 million<\\/a> of its users had indeed been passed to the firm.<\\/p>\\n<p>Schroepfer said he wasn&#8217;t sure whether Milner had been &#8220;specifically informed&#8221; about the agreement Facebook already had with Cambridge Analytica &#8212; adding: &#8220;I&#8217;m guessing he didn&#8217;t know&#8221;. He also claimed he had only himself become aware of it &#8220;within the last month&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;<em>Who<\\/em> knows? Who knows about what the position was with Cambridge Analytica in February of this year? Who was in charge of this?&#8221; pressed one committee member.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know all of the names of the people who knew that specific information at the time,&#8221; responded Schroepfer.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We are a parliamentary committee. We went to Washington for evidence and we raised the issue of Cambridge Analytica. And Facebook concealed evidence to us as an organization on that day. Isn&#8217;t that the truth?&#8221; rejoined the committee member, pushing past\\u00a0Schroepfer&#8217;s claim to be &#8220;doing my best&#8221; to provide it with information.<\\/p>\\n<h2>A pattern of evasive behavior<\\/h2>\\n<p>&#8220;You are doing your best but the buck doesn&#8217;t stop with you does it? Where does the buck stop?&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;It stops with Mark,&#8221; replied Schroepfer &#8212; leading to a quick fire exchange where he was pressed about (and avoided answering) what Zuckerberg knew and why the Facebook founder wouldn&#8217;t come and answer the committee&#8217;s questions himself.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;What we want is the truth. We didn&#8217;t get the truth in February&#8230; Mr Schroepfer I remain to be convinced that your company has integrity,&#8221; was the pointed conclusion after a lengthy exchange on this.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s been frustrating for us in this enquiry is a pattern of behavior from the company &#8212; an unwillingness to engage, and a desire to hold onto information and not disclose it,&#8221; said Collins, returning to the theme at another stage of the hearing &#8212; and also accusing Facebook of not providing it with &#8220;straight answers&#8221; in Washington.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t be having this discussion now if this information hadn&#8217;t been brought into the light by investigative journalists,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And Facebook even tried to stop that happening as well [referring to a threat by the company to sue the Guardian ahead of publication of its Cambridge Analytica expos\\u00e9]&#8230; It&#8217;s a pattern of behavior, of seeking to pretend this isn&#8217;t happening.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The committee expressed further dissatisfaction with Facebook immediately following the session, emphasizing that Schroepfer had &#8220;failed to answer fully on nearly 40 separate points&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\\u201cMr Schroepfer, Mark Zuckerberg\\u2019s right hand man whom we were assured could represent his views, today failed to answer many specific and detailed questions about Facebook\\u2019s business practices,&#8221; said Collins in a statement after the hearing.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">&#8220;We will be asking him to respond in writing to the committee on these points; however, we are mindful that it took a global reputational crisis and three months for the company to follow up on questions we put to them in Washington D.C. on February 8<span style=\\\"font-size: 13.5px;\\\">.\\u00a0<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">&#8220;We believe that, given the large number of outstanding questions for Facebook to answer, Mark Zuckerberg should still appear in front of the Committee&#8230; and will request that he appears in front of the\\u00a0DCMS\\u00a0Committee before the\\u00a0May 24.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>We reached out to Facebook for comment &#8212; but at the time of writing the company had not\\u00a0responded.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Palantir&#8217;s data use under review<\\/h2>\\n<p>Schroepfer was questioned on a wide range of topics during today&#8217;s session. And while he was fuzzy on many details, giving lots of partial answers and promises to &#8220;follow up&#8221;, one thing he did confirm was that Facebook board member\\u00a0<a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/person\\/peter-thiel\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\" data-type=\\\"person\\\" data-entity=\\\"peter-thiel\\\">Peter Thiel\\u2019s\\u00a0<\\/a>secretive big data analytics firm,\\u00a0Palantir, is one of the companies Facebook is investigating as part of a historical audit of app developers&#8217; use of its platform.<\\/p>\\n<p>Have there ever been concerns raised about Palantir&#8217;s activity, and about whether it has gained improper access to Facebook user data, asked Collins.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think we are looking at lots of different things now. Many people have raised that concern &#8212; and since it&#8217;s in the public discourse it&#8217;s obviously something we&#8217;re looking into,&#8221; said\\u00a0Schroepfer.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s part of the review work that Facebook&#8217;s doing?&#8221; pressed Collins.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Correct,&#8221; he responded.<\\/p>\\n<p>The historical app audit was announced in the wake of last month&#8217;s revelations about how much Facebook data Cambridge Analytica was given by app developer (and Cambridge University academic), Dr <a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase.com\\/person\\/aleksandr-kogan\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-type=\\\"person\\\" data-entity=\\\"aleksandr-kogan\\\">Aleksandr Kogan <span class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> &#8212; in what the company couched as a &#8220;breach of trust&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>However Kogan, who testified to the committee <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/04\\/24\\/kogan-i-dont-think-facebook-has-a-developer-policy-that-is-valid\\/\\\">earlier this week<\\/a>, argues he was just using Facebook&#8217;s platform as it was architected and intended to be used &#8212; going so far as to claim its developer terms are &#8220;not legally valid&#8221;. (&#8220;For you to break a policy it has to exist. And really be their policy, The reality is Facebook\\u2019s policy is unlikely to be their policy,\\u201d was Kogan&#8217;s construction, earning him a quip from a committee member that he &#8220;should be a professor of semantics&#8221;.)<\\/p>\\n<p>Schroepfer said he disagreed with\\u00a0Kogan&#8217;s assessment that Facebook didn&#8217;t have a policy, saying the goal of the platform has been to foster social experiences &#8212; and that &#8220;those same tools, because they&#8217;re easy and great for the consumer, can go wrong&#8221;. So he did at least indirectly confirm Kogan&#8217;s general point that Facebook&#8217;s developer and user terms are at loggerheads.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;This is why we have gone through several iterations of the platform &#8212; where we have effectively locked down parts of the platform,&#8221; continued Schroepfer. &#8220;Which increases friction and makes it less easy for the consumer to use these things but does safeguard that data more. And been a lot more proactive in the review and enforcement of these things. So this wasn&#8217;t a lack of care&#8230; but I&#8217;ll tell you that our primary product is designed to help people share safety with a limited audience.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;If you want to say it to the world you can publish it on a blog or on Twitter. If you want to share it with your friends only, that&#8217;s the primary thing Facebook does. We violate that trust &#8212; and that data goes somewhere else &#8212; we&#8217;re sort of violating the core principles of our product. And that&#8217;s a big problem. And this is why I wanted to come to you personally today to talk about this because this is a serious issue.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<h2>&#8220;You&#8217;re not just a neutral platform &#8212; you are players&#8221;<\\/h2>\\n<p>The same committee member,\\u00a0Paul Farrelly, who earlier pressed Kogan about why he hadn&#8217;t bothered to find out which political candidates stood to be the beneficiary of his data harvesting and processing activities for Cambridge Analytica, put it to\\u00a0Schroepfer that Facebook&#8217;s own actions in how it manages its business activities &#8212; and specifically because it embeds its own staff with political campaigns to help them use its tools &#8212; amounts to the company being &#8220;Dr Kogan writ large&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not just a neutral platform &#8212; you are players,&#8221; said Farrelly.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;The clear thing is we don&#8217;t have an opinion on the outcome of these elections. That is not what we are trying to do. We are trying to offer services to any customer of ours who would like to know how to use our products better,&#8221; Schroepfer responded. &#8220;We have never turned away a political party because we didn&#8217;t want to help them win an election.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We believe in strong open political discourse and what we&#8217;re trying to do is make sure that people can get their messages across.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>However in another exchange\\u00a0the Facebook exec appeared not to be aware of a basic tenet of UK election law &#8212; which prohibits campaign spending by foreign entities.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;How many UK Facebook users and Instagram users were contacted in the UK referendum by foreign, non-UK entities?&#8221; asked committee member Julie Elliott.<\\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">&#8220;We would have to understand and do the analysis of who &#8212; of all the ads run in that campaign &#8212; where is the location, the source of all of the different advertisers,&#8221; said Schroepfer, tailing off with a &#8220;so&#8230;&#8221; and without providing a figure.\\u00a0<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;But do you have that information?&#8221; pressed Elliott.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have it on the top of my head. I can see if we can get you some more of it,&#8221; he responded.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our elections are very heavily regulated, and income or monies from other countries can&#8217;t be spent in our elections in any way shape or form,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;So I would have thought that you would have that information. Because your company will be aware of what our electoral law is.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Again I don&#8217;t have that information on me,&#8221; Schroepfer said &#8212; repeating the line that Facebook would &#8220;follow up with the relevant information&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Facebook CTO was also asked if the company could provide it with an archive of adverts that were run on its platform around the time of the Brexit referendum by Aggregate IQ &#8212; a Canadian data company that&#8217;s been linked to Cambridge Analytica\\/SCL, and which received\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.telegraph.co.uk\\/news\\/2017\\/02\\/24\\/exclusive-tiny-canadian-company-helped-swing-brexit-vote-leave\\/\\\">\\u00a33.5M from leave campaign groups<\\/a>\\u00a0in the run up to the 2016 referendum (and has also been described by leave campaigners as instrumental to securing their win). It&#8217;s also <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/04\\/06\\/facebook-aggregateiq-now-being-jointly-probed-by-canada-b-c-data-watchdogs\\/\\\">under joint investigation<\\/a> by Canadian data watchdogs, along with Facebook.<\\/p>\\n<p>In written evidence provided to the committee today Facebook says it has been helping ongoing investigations into &#8220;the Cambridge Analytica issue&#8221; that are being undertaken by the UK&#8217;s Electoral Commission and its data protection watchdog, the ICO. Here it writes that its records show AIQ spent &#8220;approximately $2M USD on ads from pages that appear to be associated with the 2016 Referendum&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>Schroepfer&#8217;s responses on several requests by the committee for historical samples of the referendum ads AIQ had run amounted to &#8216;we&#8217;ll see what we can do&#8217; &#8212; with the exec cautioning that he wasn&#8217;t entirely sure how much data might have been retained.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think specifically in Aggregate IQ and Cambridge Analytica related to the UK referendum I believe we are producing more extensive information for both the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner,&#8221; he said at one point, adding it would also provide the committee with the same information if it&#8217;s legally able to. &#8220;I think we are trying to do &#8212; give them all the data we have on the ads and what they spent and what they&#8217;re like.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Collins asked what would happen if an organization or an individual had used a Facebook ad account to target dark ads during the referendum and then taken down the page as soon as the campaign was over. &#8220;How would you be able to identify that activity had ever taken place?&#8221; he asked.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I do believe, uh, we have &#8212; I would have to confirm, but there is a possibility that we have a separate system &#8212; a log of the ads that were run,&#8221; said Schroepfer, displaying some of the fuzziness that irritated the committee. &#8220;I know we would have the page itself if the page was still active. If they&#8217;d run prior campaigns and deleted the page we may retain some information about those ads &#8212; I don&#8217;t know the specifics, for example how detailed that information is, and how long retention is for that particular set of data.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<h2>Dark ads a &#8220;major threat to democracy&#8221;<\\/h2>\\n<p>Collins pointed out that a big part of UK (and indeed US) election law relates to &#8220;declaration of spent&#8221;, before making the conjoined point that if someone is &#8220;hiding that spend&#8221; &#8212; i.e. by placing dark ads that only the recipient sees, and which can be taken offline immediately after the campaign &#8212; it smells like a major risk to the democratic process.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;If no one&#8217;s got the ability to audit that, that is a major threat to democracy,&#8221; warned Collins. &#8220;And would be a license for a major breach of election law.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; responded\\u00a0Schroepfer as if the risk had never crossed his mind before. &#8220;We can come back on the details on that.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>On the wider app audit that Facebook has committed to carrying out in the wake of the scandal,\\u00a0Schroepfer was also asked how it can audit apps or entities that are no longer on the platform &#8212; and he admitted this is &#8220;a challenge&#8221; and said Facebook won&#8217;t have &#8220;perfect information or detail&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;This is going to be a challenge again because we&#8217;re dealing with historic events so we&#8217;re not going to have perfect information or detail on any of these things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think where we start is &#8212; it very well may be that this company is defunct but we can look at how they used the platform. Maybe there&#8217;s two people who used the app and they asked for relatively innocuous data &#8212; so the chance that that is a big issue is a lot lower than an app that was widely in circulation. So I think we can at least look at that sort of information. And try to chase down the trail.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;If we have concerns about it even if the company is defunct it&#8217;s possible we can find former employees of the company who might have more information about it. This starts with trying to identify where the issues might be and then run the trail down as much as we can. As you highlight, though, there are going to be limits to what we can find. But our goal is to understand this as best as we can.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The committee also wanted to know if Facebook had set a deadline for completing the audit &#8212; but\\u00a0Schroepfer would only say it&#8217;s going &#8220;as fast as we can&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>He claimed Facebook is sharing &#8220;a tremendous amount of information&#8221; with the UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog &#8212; as it continues its (now) year-long investigation into the use of digital data for political purposes.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I would guess we&#8217;re sharing information on this too,&#8221; he said in reference to app audit data. &#8220;I know that I personally shared a bunch of details on a variety of things we&#8217;re doing. And same with the Electoral Commission [which is investigating whether use of digital data and social media platforms broke campaign spending rules].&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>In Schroepfer&#8217;s written evidence to the committee Facebook says it has unearthed some suggestive links between Cambridge Analytica\\/SCL and Aggegrate IQ: &#8220;In the course of our ongoing review, we also found certain billing and administration connections between SCL\\/Cambridge Analytica and AIQ&#8221;, it notes.<\\/p>\\n<p>Both entities continue to deny any link exists between them, claiming they are entirely separate entities &#8212; though the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, Chris Wylie, has described AIQ as essentially the Canadian arm of SCL.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;The collaboration we saw was some billing and administrative contacts between the two of them, so you&#8217;d see similar people show up in each of the accounts,&#8221; said\\u00a0Schroepfer, when asked for more detail about what it had found, before declining to say anything else in a public setting on account of ongoing investigations &#8212; despite the committee pointing out other witnesses it has heard from have not held back on that front.<\\/p>\\n<p>Another piece of information Facebook has included in the written evidence\\u00a0is the claim that it does not believe AIQ used Facebook data obtained via Kogan&#8217;s apps for targeting referendum ads &#8212; saying it used email address uploads for &#8220;many&#8221; of its ad campaigns during the referendum.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">The data gathered through the TIYDL [Kogan&#8217;s thisisyourdigitallife] app did not include the email addresses of app installers or their friends. This means that AIQ could not have obtained these email addresses from the data TIYDL gathered from Facebook,&#8221; Facebook asserts.\\u00a0<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p>Schroepfer was questioned on this during the session and said that while there was some overlap in terms of individuals who had downloaded Kogan&#8217;s app and who had been in the audiences targeted by AIQ this was only 3-4% &#8212; which he claimed was statistically insignificant, based on comparing with other Facebook apps of similar popularity to Kogan&#8217;s.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;AIQ must have obtained these email addresses for British voters targeted in these campaigns from a different source,&#8221; is the company&#8217;s conclusion.<\\/p>\\n<h2>&#8220;We are investigating Mr Chancellor&#8217;s role right now&#8221;<\\/h2>\\n<p>The committee also asked several questions about Joseph Chancellor, the co-director of Kogan&#8217;s app company, GSR, who became an employee of Facebook in 2015 after he had left GSR. Its questions included what Chancellor&#8217;s exact role at Facebook is and why Kogan has been heavily criticized by the company yet his GSR co-director apparently remains gainfully employed by it.<\\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">Schroepfer initially claimed Facebook hadn&#8217;t known Chancellor was a director of GSR prior to employing him, in November 2015 &#8212; saying it had only become aware of that specific piece of his employment history in 2017.<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p>But after a break in the hearing he<span style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">\\u00a0<\\/span>&#8216;clarified&#8217; this answer &#8212; adding: &#8220;In the recruiting process, people hiring him probably saw a CV and may have known he was part of GSR. Had someone known that &#8212; had we connected all the dots to when this thing happened with Mr Kogan, later on had he been mentioned in the documents that we signed with the Kogan party &#8212; no. Is it possible that someone knew about this and the right other people in the organization didn&#8217;t know about it, that is possible.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>A committee member then pressed him further. &#8220;We have evidence that shows that Facebook knew in November 2016 that Joseph Chancellor had formed the company, GSR, with Aleksandr Kogan which obviously then went on to provide the information to Cambridge Analytica. I&#8217;m very unclear as to why Facebook have taken such a very direct and critical line&#8230; with Kogan but have completely ignored Joseph Chancellor.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>At that point\\u00a0Schroepfer revealed Facebook is currently investigating Chancellor as a result of the data scandal.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I understand your concern. We are investigating Mr Chancellor&#8217;s role right now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s an employment investigation going on right now.<\\/p>\\n<p>In terms of the work Chancellor is doing for Facebook, Schroepfer said he thought\\u00a0he had worked on VR for the company &#8212; but emphasized he has not been involved with &#8220;the platform&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>The issue of the NDA Kogan claimed Facebook had made him sign also came up. But\\u00a0Schroepfer counter claimed that this was not an NDA but just a &#8220;standard confidentiality clause&#8221; in the agreement to certify Kogan had deleted the Facebook data and its derivatives.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We want him to be able to be open. We&#8217;re waiving any confidentiality there if that&#8217;s not clear from a legal standpoint,&#8221; he said later, clarifying it does not consider Kogan legally gagged.<\\/p>\\n<p>Schroepfer also confirmed this agreement was signed with Kogan in June 2016, and said the &#8220;core commitments&#8221; were to confirm the deletion of data from himself and three others Kogan had passed it to: Former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix; Wylie, for a company he had set up after leaving Cambridge Analytica; and Dr Michael Inzlicht from the Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience (Kogan mentioned to the committee earlier this week he had also passed some of the Facebook data to a fellow academic in Canada).<\\/p>\\n<p>Asked whether any payments had been made between Facebook and Kogan as part of the contract, Schroepfer said: &#8220;I believe there was no payment involved in this at all.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<h2>&#8216;Radical&#8217; transparency is its fix for regulation<\\/h2>\\n<p>Other issues raised by the committee included why Facebook does not provide an overall control or opt-out for political advertising; why it does not offer a separate feed for ads but chooses to embed them into the Newsfeed; how and why it gathers data on non-users; the addictiveness engineered into its product; what it does about fake accounts; why it hasn&#8217;t recruited more humans to help with the &#8220;challenges&#8221; of managing content on a platform that&#8217;s scaled so large; and aspects of its approach to GDPR compliance.<\\/p>\\n<p>On the latter, Schroepfer was queried specifically on why Facebook had decided to <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/04\\/19\\/facebook-moves-to-shrink-its-legal-liabilities-under-gdpr\\/\\\">shift the data controller of ~1.5BN non-EU international users<\\/a> from Ireland to the US. On this he claimed the GDPR&#8217;s stipulation that there be a &#8220;lead regulator&#8221; conflicts with Facebook&#8217;s desire to be more responsive to local concerns in its non-EU international markets.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;US law does not have a notion of a lead regulator so the US does not become the lead regulator &#8212; it opens up the opportunity for us to have local markets have them, regions, be the lead and final regulator for the users in that area,&#8221; he claimed.<\\/p>\\n<p>Asked whether he thinks the time has come for &#8220;robust regulation and empowerment of consumers over their information&#8221;, Schroepfer demurred that new regulation is needed to control data flowing over consumer platforms. &#8220;Whether, through regulation or not, making sure consumers have visibility, control and can access and take their information with you, I agree 100%,&#8221; he said, agreeing only to further self-regulation not to the need for new laws.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;In terms of regulation there are multiple laws and regulatory bodies that we are under the guise of right now. Obviously the GDPR is coming into effect just next month. We have been regulated in Europe by the Irish DPC whose done extensive audits of our systems over multiple years. In the US we&#8217;re regulated by the FTC, Privacy Commissioner in Canada and others. So I think the question isn&#8217;t &#8216;if&#8217;, the question is honestly how do we ensure the regulations and the practices achieve the goals you want. Which is consumers have safety, they have transparency, they understand how this stuff works, and they have control.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;And the details of implementing that is where all the really hard work is.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>His stock response to the committee&#8217;s concerns about divisive political ads was that Facebook believes &#8220;radical transparency&#8221; is the fix &#8212; also dropping one tidbit of extra news on that front in his written testimony by saying Facebook will roll out an authentication process for political advertisers in the UK in time for the local elections in May 2019.<\\/p>\\n<p>Ads will also be required to be labeled as \\u201cpolitical\\u201d and disclose who paid for the ad. And there will be a searchable archive &#8212; available for seven years &#8212; which will include the ads themselves plus some associated data (such as\\u00a0how many times an ad may have been seen, how much money was spent, and the kinds of people who saw it).<\\/p>\\n<p>Collins asked\\u00a0Schroepfer whether Facebook&#8217;s ad transparency measures will also include &#8220;targeting data&#8221; &#8212; i.e. &#8220;will I understand not just who the advertiser was and what other adverts they&#8217;d run but why they&#8217;d chose to advertise to me&#8221;?<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I believe among the things you&#8217;ll see is spend (how much was spent on this ad); you will see who they were trying to advertise to (what is the audience they were trying to reach); and I believe you will also be able to see some basic information on how much it was viewed,&#8221; Schroepfer replied &#8212; avoiding yet another straight answer.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Facebook&#8217;s CTO\\u00a0Mike Schroepfer has just undergone almost five hours of often forensic and frequently awkward questions from members of a UK parliament committee that&#8217;s investigating online disinformation, and whose members have been further fired up by misinformation they claim Facebook gave it.

id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"facebook\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> CTO\u00a0Mike Schroepfer has just undergone almost five hours of often forensic and frequently awkward questions from members of a UK parliament committee that\u2019s investigating online disinformation, and whose members have been further fired up by misinformation they claim Facebook gave it.</p> <p>The veteran senior exec, who\u2019s clocked up a decade at the company, also as its VP of engineering, is the latest stand-in for CEO Mark Zuckerberg who keeps\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/zuckerberg-refuses-uk-parliament-summons-over-fb-data-misuse/\">eschewing repeat requests to appear</a>.</p> <p>The DCMS committee\u2019s enquiry began last year as a probe into \u2018fake news\u2019 but has snowballed in scope as the scale of concern around political disinformation has also mounted \u2014 including, most recently, fresh information being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\">exposed by journalists</a> about the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">scale of the misuse of Facebook data</a> for political targeting purposes.</p> <p>During today\u2019s session committee chair Damian Collins again made a direct appeal for Zuckerberg to testify, pausing the flow of questions momentarily to cite <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/mark-zuckerberg-to-come-to-brussels-parliament-official/\">news reports</a> suggesting the Facebook founder has agreed to fly to Brussels to testify before European Union lawmakers in relation to the Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be renewing our request for him to give evidence,\u201d said Collins. \u201cWe still do need the opportunity to put some of these questions to him.\u201d</p> <p>Committee members displayed visible outrage during the session, accusing Facebook of concealing the truth or at very least concealing evidence from it at a prior hearing that took place in Washington in February \u2014 when the company sent its UK head of policy, Simon Milner, and its head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, to field questions.</p> <p>During questioning Milner and\u00a0Bickert failed to inform the committee about a legal agreement Facebook had made with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"cambridge-analytica\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge Analytica <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> in December 2015 \u2014 after the company had learned (via an earlier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data\">Guardian article</a>) that Facebook user data had been passed to the company by the developer of an app running on its platform.</p> <p>Milner also told the committee that Cambridge Analytica could not have any Facebook data \u2014 yet last month the company admitted data on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">up to 87 million</a> of its users had indeed been passed to the firm.</p> <p>Schroepfer said he wasn\u2019t sure whether Milner had been \u201cspecifically informed\u201d about the agreement Facebook already had with Cambridge Analytica \u2014 adding: \u201cI\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t know\u201d. He also claimed he had only himself become aware of it \u201cwithin the last month\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Who</em> knows? Who knows about what the position was with Cambridge Analytica in February of this year? Who was in charge of this?\u201d pressed one committee member.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know all of the names of the people who knew that specific information at the time,\u201d responded Schroepfer.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a parliamentary committee. We went to Washington for evidence and we raised the issue of Cambridge Analytica. And Facebook concealed evidence to us as an organization on that day. Isn\u2019t that the truth?\u201d rejoined the committee member, pushing past\u00a0Schroepfer\u2019s claim to be \u201cdoing my best\u201d to provide it with information.</p> <p>\u201cYou are doing your best but the buck doesn\u2019t stop with you does it? Where does the buck stop?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt stops with Mark,\u201d replied Schroepfer \u2014 leading to a quick fire exchange where he was pressed about (and avoided answering) what Zuckerberg knew and why the Facebook founder wouldn\u2019t come and answer the committee\u2019s questions himself.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we want is the truth. We didn\u2019t get the truth in February\u2026 Mr Schroepfer I remain to be convinced that your company has integrity,\u201d was the pointed conclusion after a lengthy exchange on this.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been frustrating for us in this enquiry is a pattern of behavior from the company \u2014 an unwillingness to engage, and a desire to hold onto information and not disclose it,\u201d said Collins, returning to the theme at another stage of the hearing \u2014 and also accusing Facebook of not providing it with \u201cstraight answers\u201d in Washington.</p> <p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion now if this information hadn\u2019t been brought into the light by investigative journalists,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd Facebook even tried to stop that happening as well [referring to a threat by the company to sue the Guardian ahead of publication of its Cambridge Analytica expos\u00e9]\u2026 It\u2019s a pattern of behavior, of seeking to pretend this isn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p> <p>The committee expressed further dissatisfaction with Facebook immediately following the session, emphasizing that Schroepfer had \u201cfailed to answer fully on nearly 40 separate points\u201d.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMr Schroepfer, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s right hand man whom we were assured could represent his views, today failed to answer many specific and detailed questions about Facebook\u2019s business practices,\u201d said Collins in a statement after the hearing.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe will be asking him to respond in writing to the committee on these points; however, we are mindful that it took a global reputational crisis and three months for the company to follow up on questions we put to them in Washington D.C. on February 8<span style=\"font-size: 13.5px;\">.\u00a0</span></p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe believe that, given the large number of outstanding questions for Facebook to answer, Mark Zuckerberg should still appear in front of the Committee\u2026 and will request that he appears in front of the\u00a0DCMS\u00a0Committee before the\u00a0May 24.\u201d</p> <p>We reached out to Facebook for comment \u2014 but at the time of writing the company had not\u00a0responded.</p> <p>Schroepfer was questioned on a wide range of topics during today\u2019s session. And while he was fuzzy on many details, giving lots of partial answers and promises to \u201cfollow up\u201d, one thing he did confirm was that Facebook board member\u00a0<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"peter-thiel\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Thiel\u2019s\u00a0</a>secretive big data analytics firm,\u00a0Palantir, is one of the companies Facebook is investigating as part of a historical audit of app developers\u2019 use of its platform.</p> <p>Have there ever been concerns raised about Palantir\u2019s activity, and about whether it has gained improper access to Facebook user data, asked Collins.</p> <p>\u201cI think we are looking at lots of different things now. Many people have raised that concern \u2014 and since it\u2019s in the public discourse it\u2019s obviously something we\u2019re looking into,\u201d said\u00a0Schroepfer.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s part of the review work that Facebook\u2019s doing?\u201d pressed Collins.</p> <p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d he responded.</p> <p>The historical app audit was announced in the wake of last month\u2019s revelations about how much Facebook data Cambridge Analytica was given by app developer (and Cambridge University academic), Dr <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"aleksandr-kogan\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/aleksandr-kogan\" target=\"_blank\">Aleksandr Kogan <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> \u2014 in what the company couched as a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d.</p> <p>However Kogan, who testified to the committee <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/kogan-i-dont-think-facebook-has-a-developer-policy-that-is-valid/\">earlier this week</a>, argues he was just using Facebook\u2019s platform as it was architected and intended to be used \u2014 going so far as to claim its developer terms are \u201cnot legally valid\u201d. (\u201cFor you to break a policy it has to exist. And really be their policy, The reality is Facebook\u2019s policy is unlikely to be their policy,\u201d was Kogan\u2019s construction, earning him a quip from a committee member that he \u201cshould be a professor of semantics\u201d.)</p> <p>Schroepfer said he disagreed with\u00a0Kogan\u2019s assessment that Facebook didn\u2019t have a policy, saying the goal of the platform has been to foster social experiences \u2014 and that \u201cthose same tools, because they\u2019re easy and great for the consumer, can go wrong\u201d. So he did at least indirectly confirm Kogan\u2019s general point that Facebook\u2019s developer and user terms are at loggerheads.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why we have gone through several iterations of the platform \u2014 where we have effectively locked down parts of the platform,\u201d continued Schroepfer. \u201cWhich increases friction and makes it less easy for the consumer to use these things but does safeguard that data more. And been a lot more proactive in the review and enforcement of these things. So this wasn\u2019t a lack of care\u2026 but I\u2019ll tell you that our primary product is designed to help people share safety with a limited audience.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to say it to the world you can publish it on a blog or on Twitter. If you want to share it with your friends only, that\u2019s the primary thing Facebook does. We violate that trust \u2014 and that data goes somewhere else \u2014 we\u2019re sort of violating the core principles of our product. And that\u2019s a big problem. And this is why I wanted to come to you personally today to talk about this because this is a serious issue.\u201d</p> <p>The same committee member,\u00a0Paul Farrelly, who earlier pressed Kogan about why he hadn\u2019t bothered to find out which political candidates stood to be the beneficiary of his data harvesting and processing activities for Cambridge Analytica, put it to\u00a0Schroepfer that Facebook\u2019s own actions in how it manages its business activities \u2014 and specifically because it embeds its own staff with political campaigns to help them use its tools \u2014 amounts to the company being \u201cDr Kogan writ large\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just a neutral platform \u2014 you are players,\u201d said Farrelly.</p> <p>\u201cThe clear thing is we don\u2019t have an opinion on the outcome of these elections. That is not what we are trying to do. We are trying to offer services to any customer of ours who would like to know how to use our products better,\u201d Schroepfer responded. \u201cWe have never turned away a political party because we didn\u2019t want to help them win an election.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe in strong open political discourse and what we\u2019re trying to do is make sure that people can get their messages across.\u201d</p> <p>However in another exchange\u00a0the Facebook exec appeared not to be aware of a basic tenet of UK election law \u2014 which prohibits campaign spending by foreign entities.</p> <p>\u201cHow many UK Facebook users and Instagram users were contacted in the UK referendum by foreign, non-UK entities?\u201d asked committee member Julie Elliott.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u201cWe would have to understand and do the analysis of who \u2014 of all the ads run in that campaign \u2014 where is the location, the source of all of the different advertisers,\u201d said Schroepfer, tailing off with a \u201cso\u2026\u201d and without providing a figure.\u00a0</span></p> <p>\u201cBut do you have that information?\u201d pressed Elliott.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it on the top of my head. I can see if we can get you some more of it,\u201d he responded.</p> <p>\u201cOur elections are very heavily regulated, and income or monies from other countries can\u2019t be spent in our elections in any way shape or form,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I would have thought that you would have that information. Because your company will be aware of what our electoral law is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain I don\u2019t have that information on me,\u201d Schroepfer said \u2014 repeating the line that Facebook would \u201cfollow up with the relevant information\u201d.</p> <p>The Facebook CTO was also asked if the company could provide it with an archive of adverts that were run on its platform around the time of the Brexit referendum by Aggregate IQ \u2014 a Canadian data company that\u2019s been linked to Cambridge Analytica/SCL, and which received\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/24/exclusive-tiny-canadian-company-helped-swing-brexit-vote-leave/\">\u00a33.5M from leave campaign groups</a>\u00a0in the run up to the 2016 referendum (and has also been described by leave campaigners as instrumental to securing their win). It\u2019s also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/facebook-aggregateiq-now-being-jointly-probed-by-canada-b-c-data-watchdogs/\">under joint investigation</a> by Canadian data watchdogs, along with Facebook.</p> <p>In written evidence provided to the committee today Facebook says it has been helping ongoing investigations into \u201cthe Cambridge Analytica issue\u201d that are being undertaken by the UK\u2019s Electoral Commission and its data protection watchdog, the ICO. Here it writes that its records show AIQ spent \u201capproximately $2M USD on ads from pages that appear to be associated with the 2016 Referendum\u201d.</p> <p>Schroepfer\u2019s responses on several requests by the committee for historical samples of the referendum ads AIQ had run amounted to \u2018we\u2019ll see what we can do\u2019 \u2014 with the exec cautioning that he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how much data might have been retained.</p> <p>\u201cI think specifically in Aggregate IQ and Cambridge Analytica related to the UK referendum I believe we are producing more extensive information for both the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner,\u201d he said at one point, adding it would also provide the committee with the same information if it\u2019s legally able to. \u201cI think we are trying to do \u2014 give them all the data we have on the ads and what they spent and what they\u2019re like.\u201d</p> <p>Collins asked what would happen if an organization or an individual had used a Facebook ad account to target dark ads during the referendum and then taken down the page as soon as the campaign was over. \u201cHow would you be able to identify that activity had ever taken place?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI do believe, uh, we have \u2014 I would have to confirm, but there is a possibility that we have a separate system \u2014 a log of the ads that were run,\u201d said Schroepfer, displaying some of the fuzziness that irritated the committee. \u201cI know we would have the page itself if the page was still active. If they\u2019d run prior campaigns and deleted the page we may retain some information about those ads \u2014 I don\u2019t know the specifics, for example how detailed that information is, and how long retention is for that particular set of data.\u201d</p> <p>Collins pointed out that a big part of UK (and indeed US) election law relates to \u201cdeclaration of spent\u201d, before making the conjoined point that if someone is \u201chiding that spend\u201d \u2014 i.e. by placing dark ads that only the recipient sees, and which can be taken offline immediately after the campaign \u2014 it smells like a major risk to the democratic process.</p> <p>\u201cIf no one\u2019s got the ability to audit that, that is a major threat to democracy,\u201d warned Collins. \u201cAnd would be a license for a major breach of election law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d responded\u00a0Schroepfer as if the risk had never crossed his mind before. \u201cWe can come back on the details on that.\u201d</p> <p>On the wider app audit that Facebook has committed to carrying out in the wake of the scandal,\u00a0Schroepfer was also asked how it can audit apps or entities that are no longer on the platform \u2014 and he admitted this is \u201ca challenge\u201d and said Facebook won\u2019t have \u201cperfect information or detail\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to be a challenge again because we\u2019re dealing with historic events so we\u2019re not going to have perfect information or detail on any of these things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think where we start is \u2014 it very well may be that this company is defunct but we can look at how they used the platform. Maybe there\u2019s two people who used the app and they asked for relatively innocuous data \u2014 so the chance that that is a big issue is a lot lower than an app that was widely in circulation. So I think we can at least look at that sort of information. And try to chase down the trail.</p> <p>\u201cIf we have concerns about it even if the company is defunct it\u2019s possible we can find former employees of the company who might have more information about it. This starts with trying to identify where the issues might be and then run the trail down as much as we can. As you highlight, though, there are going to be limits to what we can find. But our goal is to understand this as best as we can.\u201d</p> <p>The committee also wanted to know if Facebook had set a deadline for completing the audit \u2014 but\u00a0Schroepfer would only say it\u2019s going \u201cas fast as we can\u201d.</p> <p>He claimed Facebook is sharing \u201ca tremendous amount of information\u201d with the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog \u2014 as it continues its (now) year-long investigation into the use of digital data for political purposes.</p> <p>\u201cI would guess we\u2019re sharing information on this too,\u201d he said in reference to app audit data. \u201cI know that I personally shared a bunch of details on a variety of things we\u2019re doing. And same with the Electoral Commission [which is investigating whether use of digital data and social media platforms broke campaign spending rules].\u201d</p> <p>In Schroepfer\u2019s written evidence to the committee Facebook says it has unearthed some suggestive links between Cambridge Analytica/SCL and Aggegrate IQ: \u201cIn the course of our ongoing review, we also found certain billing and administration connections between SCL/Cambridge Analytica and AIQ\u201d, it notes.</p> <p>Both entities continue to deny any link exists between them, claiming they are entirely separate entities \u2014 though the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, Chris Wylie, has described AIQ as essentially the Canadian arm of SCL.</p> <p>\u201cThe collaboration we saw was some billing and administrative contacts between the two of them, so you\u2019d see similar people show up in each of the accounts,\u201d said\u00a0Schroepfer, when asked for more detail about what it had found, before declining to say anything else in a public setting on account of ongoing investigations \u2014 despite the committee pointing out other witnesses it has heard from have not held back on that front.</p> <p>Another piece of information Facebook has included in the written evidence\u00a0is the claim that it does not believe AIQ used Facebook data obtained via Kogan\u2019s apps for targeting referendum ads \u2014 saying it used email address uploads for \u201cmany\u201d of its ad campaigns during the referendum.</p> <p>\u201c<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The data gathered through the TIYDL [Kogan\u2019s thisisyourdigitallife] app did not include the email addresses of app installers or their friends. This means that AIQ could not have obtained these email addresses from the data TIYDL gathered from Facebook,\u201d Facebook asserts.\u00a0</span></p> <p>Schroepfer was questioned on this during the session and said that while there was some overlap in terms of individuals who had downloaded Kogan\u2019s app and who had been in the audiences targeted by AIQ this was only 3-4% \u2014 which he claimed was statistically insignificant, based on comparing with other Facebook apps of similar popularity to Kogan\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cAIQ must have obtained these email addresses for British voters targeted in these campaigns from a different source,\u201d is the company\u2019s conclusion.</p> <p>The committee also asked several questions about Joseph Chancellor, the co-director of Kogan\u2019s app company, GSR, who became an employee of Facebook in 2015 after he had left GSR. Its questions included what Chancellor\u2019s exact role at Facebook is and why Kogan has been heavily criticized by the company yet his GSR co-director apparently remains gainfully employed by it.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Schroepfer initially claimed Facebook hadn\u2019t known Chancellor was a director of GSR prior to employing him, in November 2015 \u2014 saying it had only become aware of that specific piece of his employment history in 2017.</span></p> <p>But after a break in the hearing he<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0</span>\u2018clarified\u2019 this answer \u2014 adding: \u201cIn the recruiting process, people hiring him probably saw a CV and may have known he was part of GSR. Had someone known that \u2014 had we connected all the dots to when this thing happened with Mr Kogan, later on had he been mentioned in the documents that we signed with the Kogan party \u2014 no. Is it possible that someone knew about this and the right other people in the organization didn\u2019t know about it, that is possible.\u201d</p> <p>A committee member then pressed him further. \u201cWe have evidence that shows that Facebook knew in November 2016 that Joseph Chancellor had formed the company, GSR, with Aleksandr Kogan which obviously then went on to provide the information to Cambridge Analytica. I\u2019m very unclear as to why Facebook have taken such a very direct and critical line\u2026 with Kogan but have completely ignored Joseph Chancellor.\u201d</p> <p>At that point\u00a0Schroepfer revealed Facebook is currently investigating Chancellor as a result of the data scandal.</p> <p>\u201cI understand your concern. We are investigating Mr Chancellor\u2019s role right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an employment investigation going on right now.</p> <p>In terms of the work Chancellor is doing for Facebook, Schroepfer said he thought\u00a0he had worked on VR for the company \u2014 but emphasized he has not been involved with \u201cthe platform\u201d.</p> <p>The issue of the NDA Kogan claimed Facebook had made him sign also came up. But\u00a0Schroepfer counter claimed that this was not an NDA but just a \u201cstandard confidentiality clause\u201d in the agreement to certify Kogan had deleted the Facebook data and its derivatives.</p> <p>\u201cWe want him to be able to be open. We\u2019re waiving any confidentiality there if that\u2019s not clear from a legal standpoint,\u201d he said later, clarifying it does not consider Kogan legally gagged.</p> <p>Schroepfer also confirmed this agreement was signed with Kogan in June 2016, and said the \u201ccore commitments\u201d were to confirm the deletion of data from himself and three others Kogan had passed it to: Former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix; Wylie, for a company he had set up after leaving Cambridge Analytica; and Dr Michael Inzlicht from the Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience (Kogan mentioned to the committee earlier this week he had also passed some of the Facebook data to a fellow academic in Canada).</p> <p>Asked whether any payments had been made between Facebook and Kogan as part of the contract, Schroepfer said: \u201cI believe there was no payment involved in this at all.\u201d</p> <p>Other issues raised by the committee included why Facebook does not provide an overall control or opt-out for political advertising; why it does not offer a separate feed for ads but chooses to embed them into the Newsfeed; how and why it gathers data on non-users; the addictiveness engineered into its product; what it does about fake accounts; why it hasn\u2019t recruited more humans to help with the \u201cchallenges\u201d of managing content on a platform that\u2019s scaled so large; and aspects of its approach to GDPR compliance.</p> <p>On the latter, Schroepfer was queried specifically on why Facebook had decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/19/facebook-moves-to-shrink-its-legal-liabilities-under-gdpr/\">shift the data controller of ~1.5BN non-EU international users</a> from Ireland to the US. On this he claimed the GDPR\u2019s stipulation that there be a \u201clead regulator\u201d conflicts with Facebook\u2019s desire to be more responsive to local concerns in its non-EU international markets.</p> <p>\u201cUS law does not have a notion of a lead regulator so the US does not become the lead regulator \u2014 it opens up the opportunity for us to have local markets have them, regions, be the lead and final regulator for the users in that area,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>Asked whether he thinks the time has come for \u201crobust regulation and empowerment of consumers over their information\u201d, Schroepfer demurred that new regulation is needed to control data flowing over consumer platforms. \u201cWhether, through regulation or not, making sure consumers have visibility, control and can access and take their information with you, I agree 100%,\u201d he said, agreeing only to further self-regulation not to the need for new laws.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of regulation there are multiple laws and regulatory bodies that we are under the guise of right now. Obviously the GDPR is coming into effect just next month. We have been regulated in Europe by the Irish DPC whose done extensive audits of our systems over multiple years. In the US we\u2019re regulated by the FTC, Privacy Commissioner in Canada and others. So I think the question isn\u2019t \u2018if\u2019, the question is honestly how do we ensure the regulations and the practices achieve the goals you want. Which is consumers have safety, they have transparency, they understand how this stuff works, and they have control.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the details of implementing that is where all the really hard work is.\u201d</p> <p>His stock response to the committee\u2019s concerns about divisive political ads was that Facebook believes \u201cradical transparency\u201d is the fix \u2014 also dropping one tidbit of extra news on that front in his written testimony by saying Facebook will roll out an authentication process for political advertisers in the UK in time for the local elections in May 2019.</p> <p>Ads will also be required to be labeled as \u201cpolitical\u201d and disclose who paid for the ad. And there will be a searchable archive \u2014 available for seven years \u2014 which will include the ads themselves plus some associated data (such as\u00a0how many times an ad may have been seen, how much money was spent, and the kinds of people who saw it).</p> <p>Collins asked\u00a0Schroepfer whether Facebook\u2019s ad transparency measures will also include \u201ctargeting data\u201d \u2014 i.e. \u201cwill I understand not just who the advertiser was and what other adverts they\u2019d run but why they\u2019d chose to advertise to me\u201d?</p> <p>\u201cI believe among the things you\u2019ll see is spend (how much was spent on this ad); you will see who they were trying to advertise to (what is the audience they were trying to reach); and I believe you will also be able to see some basic information on how much it was viewed,\u201d Schroepfer replied \u2014 avoiding yet another straight answer.</p> ", "website": "techcrunch"}

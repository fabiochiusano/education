Sullivan draw belt</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, July 31st, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Title belts in boxing today are the ostentatious displays of official victors, but it wasn\u2019t always thus. In the 19th century, before the rules for title championships were encoded, both the title and the waist accessory were more loosely assigned. John L. Sullivan was considered the first heavyweight champion of the world, even though any consistent standard would give English boxer Jem Mace that honor for his defeat of Tom Allen in 1870. Why not, then, have a belt made to celebrate one fighter\u2019s triumph even when said fight resulted in a draw?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37756\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882-200x290.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882-430x625.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882.jpg 1023w\" title=\"Heavyweight champion John L. Sullivan, 1882\" width=\"103\"/></a>The draw in question was a brutal contest between John L. Sullivan and English fighter Charles Mitchell. Nobody saw it coming. The opponents were evenly matched in some ways. They were close in age (Sullivan was 29, Mitchell 26) and close in height (Sullivan 5\u201910 1/2\u2033, Mitchell 5\u20199\u2033). Both had championship titles. Both had winning records, although only Sullivan was undefeated. The big difference was weight. Rarely weighing more than 160 pounds, Charley Mitchell was a welterweight, a middleweight on a good day. John L. Sullivan was a heavyweight who was 190 pounds at his leanest and who regularly crossed the 200-pound mark. (He weighed 238 pounds when he knocked out 170-pound middleweight Jack Burke in 1885.) </p>\n<p>The weight of his punch was in keeping with his physique. Sullivan had defeated Paddy Ryan in 1882 to claim the title heavyweight champion of America and kept it for a decade until Gentleman Jim Corbett relieved him of it by knock-out in 1892. Ryan would later describe being hit by Sullivan as feeling as if \u201ca telegraph pole had been shoved against me endways.\u201d Sullivan was expected to knock out Mitchell, who pound for pound was one of the hardest hitters in the ring. Pound for pound being the salient issue. Mitchell had a reputation for being fast and avoiding blows \u2014 <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=D_IWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA197\" target=\"_blank\">in his memoirs</a> Sullivan called Mitchell a \u201cbombastic sprinter boxer\u201d) \u2014 but despite his proven ability to hit and run, Mitchell was considered simply too puny to take out Sullivan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37557\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883-200x298.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883-430x640.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883.jpg 973w\" title=\"Charley Mitchell, ca. 1883\" width=\"100\"/></a>Mitchell wasn\u2019t intimidated. Not only did he want this fight, he actively picked it for five years. Mitchell and Sullivan first went at each other in a bout at Madison Square Garden in 1883. Police stopped the fight after the third round, three rounds that Sullivan dominated with one glaring exception: Mitchell had knocked him down in the first round with a left hook to the chin. Sullivan had never hit the floor before in his career and he didn\u2019t take kindly to it. Mitchell vociferously demanded a rematch and one was actually proposed for the next day but Sullivan would not accept it. A rematch was scheduled for June 30th, 1884, but it was cancelled when Sullivan turned up drunk. </p>\n<p>The beef was not squashed, only refrigerated. When Sullivan traveled to London in November of 1887 to fight in front of the Prince of Wales, Mitchell taunted him, telling the press that Sullivan was afraid to fight him because he\u2019d knocked him down four years earlier. One reporter described Mitchell as \u201csnarling out challenges to [Sullivan] by the dozen.\u201d Sullivan, who fought more than 50 exhibitions during his two months in England as Mitchell goaded him relentlessly, was livid. He agreed to fight Mitchell on March 10th, 1888. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37751\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ch\u00e2teau de Laversine today\" width=\"150\"/></a>When this fight took place, bare-knuckle prizefighting was illegal in all 38 states and several countries. Bouts had to be arranged in secret locations and even so were often broken up by the police. Fighters and promoters were regularly arrested and fined, sometimes sentenced to prison. Fleeing the state or country in disguise after a fight was commonplace. The thorny search for a location was resolved when Baron Gustave de Rothschild offered to host the fight on the grounds of his Ch\u00e2teau de Laversine, a stately home on the banks of the River Oise three miles north of Chantilly in the Picardy region of northern France. </p>\n<p>The 24-foot ring Mitchell had insisted on (as opposed to the 16-foot ring Sullivan wanted to help corral Mitchell\u2019s avoidance tactics) was erected outdoors near the stables. The fight began at 12:50 PM. At first it seemed to be going as expected, with Sullivan pummeling the bejesus out of Mitchell, knocking him down repeatedly in the first eight rounds. Mitchell landed some good ones, though, and as time passed, his running game served him well and he seemed to be getting stronger while Sullivan\u2019s strength faded. It started raining during the sixth round or so, and soon the rain turned torrential, transforming the ground to swampland which sapped Sullivan\u2019s energy all the more. Again from <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=D_IWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA200\" target=\"_blank\">John L.\u2019s memoirs</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Running and dropping was [Mitchell\u2019s] game, and to such an extent did he practise the former that, when the fight was over, a track like a sheep run was to be noticed all around the ring.

He had already had to deal with belt nonsense the year before when Richard K. Fox, editor of the <em>National Police Gazette</em> and holder of a very long grudge against Sullivan for having snubbed him in a saloon once, declared the undefeated Irish-American heavyweight Jake Kilrain the new world champion and gave him a silver championship belt on behalf of the <em>Gazette</em>. Sullivan\u2019s supporters responded by giving him a <a href=\"http://amhistory.si.edu/sports/exhibit/firsts/sullivan/#\" target=\"_blank\">championship belt of 14-carat gold</a> engraved \u201cPresented to the Champion of Champions, John L. Sullivan, by the Citizens of the United States.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s name was spelled in diamonds, 397 of them, no less. It was the most expensive belt ever given to a fighter. Mitchell\u2019s was the second most expensive. The latter has now sold at auction for $55,000, which is quite modest, really, considering it cost $10,000 to make.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37752\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889-200x121.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889-430x262.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889.jpg 1499w\" title=\"John L.

He had a great vantage point from Mitchell\u2019s corner, and Mitchell would be in his when Kilrain went up against Sullivan for the world heavyweight title in Richburg, Mississippi, in 1889. This would be the last title match fought with bare knuckles under <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/22691\" target=\"_blank\">London Prize Ring Rules</a> and it was one for the ages. Fought in the noon sun of a Mississippi July, the bout lasted two hours, 16 minutes and went 75 rounds. Kilrain had to be carried to his corner by the 17th round. Sullivan vomited in the 44th. Scheduled to run 80 rounds, the bout was finally stopped when Kilrain\u2019s cornerman Mike Donovan, very much against his fighter\u2019s wishes, threw in the towel because he was sure Kilrain, who could barely stand by this point, wouldn\u2019t survive a 76th round.</p>\n<p>John L. Sullivan and Charley Mitchell died the same year, 1918. Sullivan preceded his old rival by two months to the day, dying of a heart attack at age 59 on February 2nd. Mitchell died at the age of 56 suffering from locomotor ataxia, a progressive neurological disorder of the spinal column which causes jerky and unbalanced gait. Also known as tabes dorsalis, it is a symptom of late-stage syphilis but is not fatal on its own. It\u2019s the underlying condition that killed him. I wonder if he\u2019d have been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s or ALS today. Jake Kilrain outlived them both, dying of complications from diabetes in 1937 at 78 years old.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"The Charles Mitchell v.

It is one of the oldest human fossils ever found in Europe (the oldest is a 600,000-year-old jawbone found in Germany in 1907), and the oldest human body part ever found in France by 100,000 years. Its significance is bolstered by the scarcity of human remains in Europe from this period. There\u2019s something of a gap in the record between 500,000 and 800,000 years ago and very little new material has been found. This one tooth is therefore of outsized importance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Valentin-Loescher-holds-tooth-Camille-Jacquey-r-Photo-by-Denis-Dainat.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37742\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Valentin-Loescher-holds-tooth-Camille-Jacquey-r-Photo-by-Denis-Dainat-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Valentin-Loescher-holds-tooth-Camille-Jacquey-r-Photo-by-Denis-Dainat-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Valentin-Loescher-holds-tooth-Camille-Jacquey-r-Photo-by-Denis-Dainat-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Valentin-Loescher-holds-tooth-Camille-Jacquey-r-Photo-by-Denis-Dainat-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Valentin Loescher (l) and Camille Jacquey (r) display the tooth.

The volunteer digging next to him, Camille Jacquey, 16, was on a break when he found it. When she returned, they showed the find to Am\u00e9lie Vialet, the paleoanthropologist leading the excavation team, who identified it as an adult human incisor from a lower jaw. Its age was determined by stratigraphic analysis; the layer in which the tooth was found has been dated with a variety of methods to confirm its range, so researchers are satisfied that the tooth is at least 550,000 years old, and maybe as much as 580,000 years old.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tooth-found-at-Arago-\u00a9-Radio-France.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37741\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tooth-found-at-Arago-\u00a9-Radio-France-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tooth-found-at-Arago-\u00a9-Radio-France-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tooth-found-at-Arago-\u00a9-Radio-France-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tooth-found-at-Arago-\u00a9-Radio-France-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Prehistoric tooth found in Arago Cave. \u00a9 Radio France\" width=\"150\"/></a>Yves Coppens, professor of paleoanthropology and prehistory at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, who was part of the 1970s team that discovered the remains of the famous early human ancestor known as Lucy in Ethiopia, told France Info radio: \u201cA tooth can tell us a whole range of things.

They built <a href=\"http://historicjamestowne.org/archaeology/map-of-discoveries/\" target=\"_blank\">James Fort</a>, a triangular wooden palisade, within two weeks and the first Jamestown settlement was established inside its perimeter. It was small, but soon contained at least a storehouse, several houses and one church, the first Protestant church in the New World.</p>\n<p>Built in 1608, the church served the community for almost decade.  Secretary of the colony William Strachey described it as \u201cpretty chapel\u201d 60 feet long and 24 feet wide with a cedar wood chancel. In 1614 Pocahontas married tobacco planter John Rolfe there. Within three years of that wedding, the church had fallen into disrepair and was abandoned when <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26436\" target=\"_blank\">a new church was built nearby</a> as the settlement expanded eastward from the original confines of Fort James. Over time the location of the first fort and its church was lost.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Remains-of-Jamestown-leaders-Donald-E.-Hurlbert-Smithsonian-Institution.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37730\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Remains-of-Jamestown-leaders-Donald-E.-Hurlbert-Smithsonian-Institution-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Remains-of-Jamestown-leaders-Donald-E.-Hurlbert-Smithsonian-Institution-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Remains-of-Jamestown-leaders-Donald-E.-Hurlbert-Smithsonian-Institution-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Remains-of-Jamestown-leaders-Donald-E.-Hurlbert-Smithsonian-Institution-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Remains-of-Jamestown-leaders-Donald-E.-Hurlbert-Smithsonian-Institution.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Four graves under chancel of 1608 Jamestown church.

Hurlbert.\" width=\"200\"/></a>It was Strachey\u2019s description that helped archaeologists identify the remains of the church when they were discovered during a 2010 excavation of the rediscovered Fort James site. The structural posts matched the dimensions documented by Strachey, as did the structure\u2019s orientation in the middle of the fort. At the eastern end of the building, archaeologists found four graves. This space was the cedar chancel Strachey mentioned, the area in the front of the church with the altar which was reserved for the most important people during services. Only people of  very high status were honored with burial under the chancel.</p>\n<p>Since the archaeological site of Jamestown is open to visitors, the church remains were refilled for safety. Jamestown Rediscovery archaeologists, working with forensic anthropologists from the Smithsonian\u2019s Museum of Natural History, returned in November of 2013 to fully excavate the graves in the hopes they might be able to identify the people buried there. The remains were under threat, as is the entire Jamestown site, by rising sea levels, and one of the skeletons had been significantly damaged by workers in 1938 (when the location of the fort was still unknown) unwittingly dug a trench through the chancel to install electric cable. The excavation revealed one body had been buried only in a shroud (the others had wooden coffins) and two of the people were buried with artifacts that could help identify them.</p>\n<p>The team carefully unearthed and documented the graves, using a precision laser tool to record the positions of the graves, skeletons, coffin fragments and artifacts. Then the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36987\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian\u2019s outstanding 3D Digitization Program Office</a> did their magic, laser scanning the entire site, collecting millions of data points and high resolution photographs that would allow them to create an interactive 3D model of the burials.

Time and environment had not been kind to them \u2014 only 30% of each skeleton was recovered \u2014 but the bones could still speak through science. All four were men who were between their early 20s and their 40s when they died, and all four were found to have carbon and oxygen isotope values indicating they were raised in England. None of them show the tell-tale osteological signs of strenuous labor, but the teeth of two of them were in bad shape with numerous cavities and abscesses. That was a clue that those two men may have been in America longer than the other two and had thus been exposed to a potentially tooth-rotting sweet corn diet for a few more years. High levels of lead in the bones of two of the men suggested they were high-born since in the 17th century the wealthy and noble ingested more lead than the poor courtesy of lead-lined and pewter tableware.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scan-of-silver-cloth.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37731\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scan-of-silver-cloth-200x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scan-of-silver-cloth-200x91.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scan-of-silver-cloth-150x68.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scan-of-silver-cloth-430x197.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scan of William West's captain's sash silk with silver bullion fringe and spangles.

In the southernmost grave, archaeologists found a textile made of silk cloth, silver threads and silver spangles between the rib cage and left arm of the skeleton. A near-miraculous survival, the artifact was too fragile to be excavated and was removed in a soil block. X-rays found the hundreds of silver threads and spangles in the soil block.

One was an iron fragment three inches long that turned out to be the finial below the tip of a ceremonial spear known as a leading staff. The other was a silver box placed on top of the coffin. The box was corroded shut, so the research team turned to X-ray and CT scanning in the attempt to see what might be inside. With help from increasingly higher resolution microCT scanners, gradually the silver box gave up its secrets. It\u2019s a reliquary containing a lead <em>ampulla</em>, a vial used to hold holy water, oil or the blood of a saint, broken in two pieces and seven fragments of bone, also probably holy relics. Their final scans were so detailed they were able to 3D-print reproductions of the contents for examination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Silver-reliquary-and-3D-printed-replicas-of-contents.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37728\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Silver-reliquary-and-3D-printed-replicas-of-contents-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Silver-reliquary-and-3D-printed-replicas-of-contents-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Silver-reliquary-and-3D-printed-replicas-of-contents-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Silver-reliquary-and-3D-printed-replicas-of-contents-430x291.jpg 430w\" title=\"Silver reliquary and 3D-printed replicas of contents.

He died during the horrific \u201cstarving time\u201d in the winter of 1609-1610 at the age of 35. The reliquary is his, and since his parents were Catholics, once fined for non-attendance of Anglican services, he could very well have been as well, only on the downlow.</li>\n<li>Sir Ferdinando Wainman, the earliest English knight known to have been buried in the New World, arrived in June of 1610 with his relative, the first governor of Virginia Thomas West, Lord De La Warr. He was appointed Jamestown\u2019s master of the ordnance and cavalry, but he didn\u2019t have a chance to serve for long as he died between July and August of 1610. He was 34.</li>\n<li>Captain William West, another relative of Lord De La Warr\u2019s who arrived in June 1610 only to die within months. He was killed in battle against Powhatan warriors in the fall or winter of 1610. The glorious sash is his.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The two men with the high lead levels were Wainman and Archer.</p>\n<p>The Historic Jamestowne website is excellent, packed with information on the history of the site and its ongoing archaeology.

Its exhibition at the <a href=\"http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Princeton University Art Museum</a> is only the second time the painting has been on display since its rediscovery. It made its world debut at an <a href=\"http://www.fondazionecosso.com/2014/09/05/la-prossima-mostra-san-sebastiano/\" target=\"_blank\">exhibition dedicated to depictions of Saint Sebastian</a> at the Castello di Miradolo museum in Turin last October.

He was driving through Frankfurt in 2010 when a window filled with paintings caught his eye. It was the Dobritz auction house, a small local shop crammed with works scheduled to be sold at an auction in two weeks. In a stack of paintings on the staircase to the second floor of the shop, Castelluccio saw the Guercino. It immediately leapt out at him as the work of the Baroque master, the fine chiaroscuro belying the auction house manager\u2019s lackluster description of the piece as \u201can 18th-century Italian holy painting of Saint Sebastian.\u201d </p>\n<p>It was estimated to sell for between 1,000 and 1,500 Euros ($1,100 \u2013 1,657), which obviously Castelluccio was more than glad to pay on the spot, but the manager insisted that he attend the auction and bid for it like anyone else. When the actor actually showed up, flying back to Frankfurt from his home in New York specifically to bid on that Saint Sebastian, the manager got an inkling that they might have something a little more interesting than some anonymous 18th century holy painting. Someone else apparently had a similar inkling, because Castelluccio wound up in a duel with a phone bidder that drove the final hammer price up to 49,000 Euros ($54,000). Castelluccio and his business partner put in the winning bid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-ca-1630.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37714\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-ca-1630-133x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-ca-1630-133x150.jpg 133w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-ca-1630-200x225.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-ca-1630-430x484.jpg 430w\" title='\"Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian\" in its lovely new frame.  Image courtesy the Federico Castelluccio collection.' width=\"133\"/></a>Then came the hard work. Castelluccio instinctively believed the painting was an authentic Guercino, not the work of his studio or a later reproduction, but one man\u2019s good taste is not an accepted authentication standard. First the painting was cleaned, conserved and suitably framed. This painstaking process took years during which Castelluccio did assiduous research on the painting\u2019s history. Art historians and leading Guercino experts David Stone of the University of Delaware and Nicholas Turner, the former curator of drawings at the J. Paul Getty Museum, were enlisted to thoroughly examine the work. They used X-rays, infrared reflectography and chemical pigment testing to determine the painting\u2019s age and to compare its bones to those of known works by Guercino. They authenticated it as painted by Guercino\u2019s hand around 1632-34.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-1641-Pushkin-Museum-Moscow.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37715\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-1641-Pushkin-Museum-Moscow-121x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-1641-Pushkin-Museum-Moscow-121x150.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-1641-Pushkin-Museum-Moscow-200x247.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-1641-Pushkin-Museum-Moscow-430x532.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Martyrdowm-of-Saint-Sebastian-by-Guercino-1641-Pushkin-Museum-Moscow.jpg 969w\" title='\"Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian\" by Guercino, 1641.

The newly rediscovered one is the earliest of the three. While Castelluccio and his partner wound up spending about $140,000 total in acquiring, conserving, testing and researching the painting, if they were to sell it now it would certainly make millions. A King David by Guercino <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5339046\" target=\"_blank\">sold at Christie\u2019s in London for close to $8 million</a> (including buyer\u2019s premium) and that was in 2010. The <em>Christ and the Woman of Samaria</em> <a href=\"http://www.dfw.com/2010/04/29/270438/kimbell-art-museum-acquires-rare.html\" target=\"_blank\">bought privately by the Kimbell Art Museum</a> that same year is thought to have gone for more than $10 million.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He and the co-owner may eventually sell the portrait, [Castelluccio] said, ideally to a prestigious institution.</p>\n<p>A few of its previous owners have been identified, including the German countess Maria von Maltzan, a Resistance fighter during World War II who hid Jews and other escapees from the Nazis.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once the painting was authenticated, art dealer Robert Simon, to whom Castelluccio had shown the work before it was cleaned, arranged for its loan to the Castello di Miradolo where Guercino\u2019s <em>Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian</em> was seen in the public again after 350 years in obscurity. Castelluccio got it back after the exhibition closed in March and then Princeton reached out to him to see if he\u2019d be amenable to a more local exhibition. He was and now the painting is on display at the Princeton University Art Museum as a special installation until January of 2016.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Lost Guercino found by Sopranos actor on display in US\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37711\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37711#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-37667\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37667\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Remains of soldiers in mass grave show toll of Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign\">Remains of soldiers in mass grave show toll of Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, July 27th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37674\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mass grave of Napoleon's Grand Army, buried in Vilnius winter 1812, found in 2001\" width=\"200\"/></a>In late 2001, workers doing construction on the site of a former Soviet Army barracks in a northern suburb of Vilnius discovered a mass grave which fragments of military uniforms identified as the final resting place for more than 3,000 soldiers and support staff of Napoleon\u2019s Great Army who died during the horrific retreat from Russia in the winter of 1812. The grave was excavated in two stages in 2002 and the preliminary results of the study of the skeletons were published in <a href=\"http://www.helsinki.fi/arkeologia/kurssit/KAR331_Forensinen_sl2008/Jankauskas_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">February of 2004 (pdf)</a>.

I get emails all the time from people asking me to post their ostensibly history-related infographics and I decline because they tend to be marketing gimmicks that are very light on content. This one is different. Created in 1869 by French civil engineer Charles Joseph Minard, a pioneer of statistics relayed in graphic form, this chart plots the advance of the Great Army into Russia and its devastating retreat. The width of the line marks the size of the army at any given time. The beige line, obese with troops in the beginning, thins out to a quarter of its original size when the army reaches Moscow. The black line then shows the retreating army as it doubles back in the sadly vain attempt to make it out of the Russian winter alive. By the time the black line reaches where the beige line begins, it\u2019s pencil-thin.

Buttons found in the two trenches of the mass grave identified soldiers and officers from around 30 regiments, most of them infantry, some cavalry, dragoon and foot artillery. There were uniform remains from Italian, Polish and Bavarian regiments as well as the Imperial Guard. There are female skeletons in the mass grave because since 1805 the French army had an official cadre of women working as cooks, laundresses, nurses and sellers of goods like tobacco and alcohol which accompanied the Grand Army in every campaign. Archaeologists were able to determine the sex of 29 female skeletons, but there were probably more women buried with the men as the remains of 1317 individuals were impossible to sex.</p>\n<p>The two new studies by University of Central Florida researchers used stable isotope analysis to find out where some of Napoleon\u2019s dead came from and what, if anything, they ate. In <a href=\"http://etd.fcla.edu/CF/CFH0004822/Pelier_Serenela_M_201504_BA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">one of the studies (pdf)</a>, oxygen isotopes in the bones revealed that none of the dead tested were from Vilnius. Of the eight males and one female tested, five of the men were from central and western Europe, three from the Iberian peninsula. The woman was most likely from southern France. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Skeleton-excavated-from-mass-grave.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37673\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Skeleton-excavated-from-mass-grave-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Skeleton-excavated-from-mass-grave-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Skeleton-excavated-from-mass-grave-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Skeleton-excavated-from-mass-grave-430x574.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Skeleton-excavated-from-mass-grave.jpg 1440w\" title=\"Archaeologist excavates mass grave \" width=\"112\"/></a>The <a href=\"http://anthropology.cos.ucf.edu/main/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Holder_Sammantha.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">other study (pdf)</a> took specimens from the bones of 73 men and three women for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis. Carbon isotopes revealed that most of Napoleon\u2019s troops ate wheat in their youth and a few, perhaps from Italy, were raised more on millet. More than a third of the specimens were found to have exceptionally high nitrogen isotope values. While that\u2019s often an indication of a diet high in protein (Richard III, for instance, had a diet rich in game, meat and sea fish and the nitrogen values to prove it), it\u2019s also a reaction to the exact opposite: protein deprivation dramatically raises nitrogen isotope values. Disease can spike nitrogen values as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Napoleon\u2019s men were not in good health, even before their ill-fated stop in Vilnius. Research on the teeth of the soldiers in the mass grave showed rampant dental cavities and indications of stress during childhood, and over one-quarter of the dead had likely succumbed to epidemic typhus, a louse-borne disease. A febrile illness like typhus could cause increased loss of body water through urine, sweat, and diarrhea, which may also cause a rise in nitrogen isotopes. And, of course, historical accounts detail how troops fruitlessly scoured the countryside for food and how many of them ate their dead or dying horses.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37672\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-mass-grave-of-Napoleons-soldiers-Vilnius-Lithuania.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Archaeologists excavate mass grave of Napoleons soldiers in the Vilnius winter\" width=\"112\"/></a>Consumption of seafood is unlikely to be the cause of the high nitrogen since the frozen Vilnia River wasn\u2019t producing and there were no salted stores to be had. Canning was still in its infancy as French brewer Nicolas Appert had only devised a method to seal food in glass jars in 1809. He did so specifically for the French army, incidentally, after Napoleon offered a 12,000 franc reward to anyone who could solve the military\u2019s thorny supply problems. Glass doesn\u2019t transport well and while a metal can system was invented by Peter Durand in 1810, Durand was British and his patented food preservation products went straight to the Royal Navy, not the Grand Arm\u00e9e.</p>\n<p>The culprit is almost certainly prolonged nutritional stress.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Remains of soldiers in mass grave show toll of Napoleon\u2019s Russian campaign\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37667\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37667#comments\">16 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-37676\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37676\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Five oversized Bronze Age axes found in Jutland Christmas tree farm\">Five oversized Bronze Age axes found in Jutland Christmas tree farm</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, July 26th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Metal-detectorist-Bent-Rasmussen-with-axe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-37684\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Metal-detectorist-Bent-Rasmussen-with-axe-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Metal-detectorist-Bent-Rasmussen-with-axe-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Metal-detectorist-Bent-Rasmussen-with-axe-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Metal-detectorist-Bent-Rasmussen-with-axe-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Metal detectorist Bent Rasmussen with axe.

Bronze artifacts had been found on the field before, and Arildskov wanted to be sure any historic artifacts were recovered before he cleared the area for planting. That responsible choice proved prescient. Rasmussen\u2019s metal detector alerted to a large metal find and when he dug down, <a href=\"http://sciencenordic.com/five-massive-bronze-age-axes-unearthed-denmark\" target=\"_blank\">he found two large bronze axe heads</a>. He immediately stopped digging and notified experts at the <a href=\"http://www.museummidtjylland.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum Midtjylland</a> of the find.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Axes-excavated-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37682\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Axes-excavated-in-situ-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Axes-excavated-in-situ-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Axes-excavated-in-situ-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Axes-excavated-in-situ-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Axes exposed during excavation.

The larger one weighs almost a full kilo (980 grams, 2.16 pounds); the smaller weighs 650 grams (1.4 pounds). Bronze Age axes are usually half this size, so the museum\u2019s archaeologists were excited by the find. They examined the site and realized there was more to be found underneath the surface. They had to wait until after Easter to get started so on April 7th the official excavation began. Archaeologists, museum curators, journalists, neighbors and interested observers made the dig something of a party, complete with coffee and homemade cake. They had good cause to celebrate when three more oversized axes were unearthed. The axe hoard was painstakingly buried, each axe placed deliberately on top of the others inside a pit that was padded with grass.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologist-Constanze-Rassmann-with-one-of-the-axes.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-37678\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologist-Constanze-Rassmann-with-one-of-the-axes-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologist-Constanze-Rassmann-with-one-of-the-axes-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologist-Constanze-Rassmann-with-one-of-the-axes-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologist-Constanze-Rassmann-with-one-of-the-axes-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Archaeologist Constanze Rassmann with the largest axe.

This places them among the earliest bronze artifacts ever discovered in Denmark. </p>\n<p>Bronze axes from this era are so rare only five of them have been found before in Denmark, Sweden and northern Germany. That means the Boest find has in one fell swoop doubled the number of these Bronze Age axes in the archaeological record of northern Europe. When you consider that<br/>\nBent Rasmussen and his brother, enlisted by Bent during excavations to cover more ground with their metal detectors, found another four smaller axes and a spear tip, it\u2019s clear that this field in Boest was an important place during the early Bronze Age. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Diagram-of-processional-yellow-star-gold-deposit-green-star-axes-red-posts.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37686\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Diagram-of-processional-yellow-star-gold-deposit-green-star-axes-red-posts-200x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Diagram-of-processional-yellow-star-gold-deposit-green-star-axes-red-posts-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Diagram-of-processional-yellow-star-gold-deposit-green-star-axes-red-posts-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Diagram-of-processional-yellow-star-gold-deposit-green-star-axes-red-posts-430x256.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Diagram-of-processional-yellow-star-gold-deposit-green-star-axes-red-posts.jpg 642w\" title=\"Diagram of potential Bronze Age processional route.

Four parallel rows of holes so large the posts they held would have been at least the height of a man. At first archaeologists thought they might be the remains of a dwelling or a fence, but as they kept excavating they kept finding more postholes. Ultimately they were able to follow an uninterrupted path of postholes for 109 meters before it disappeared into the forest. Now they\u2019re thinking it may have been a processional route leading to burial mounds known to be on the property. This find is unique in Danish history, more akin to the pre-stone standing structures of Avebury and Stonehenge. Archaeologists hope to be able to excavate the entire processional in the near future, but first the funding has to be secured.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jewelry-found-at-axe-site.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-37677\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jewelry-found-at-axe-site-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jewelry-found-at-axe-site-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jewelry-found-at-axe-site-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jewelry-found-at-axe-site-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold bangles and heavy finger ringer found at Boest site.

According to Sunni Islam, Abu Bakr, Muhammad\u2019s father-in-law and after his death the first caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, fearing that the people who memorized the scripture would die before they could pass it down, ordered the verses written down. That text was then used by the third caliph, Uthman Ibn Affan, as the basis for the definitive version of the Qur\u2019an which was widely copied and distributed in 650 A.D., just 18 years after Muhammad died.

The pages have been in the library for decades, one of more than 3,000 of Middle Eastern manuscripts collected by Chaldean priest Alphonse Mingana in the 1920s at the behest of  Edward Cadbury, chocolate magnate in a long line of chocolate magnates who, when they weren\u2019t busy making delicious creme-filled confections, founded a consortium of colleges later absorbed by the University of Birmingham. The folios were mistakenly bound with the folios of another Qur\u2019an written 200 years later in a very similar hand. There are no records of where Mingana acquired these particular leaves, but the parchment and script look like Qur\u2019an fragments from the earliest mosque in Egypt (founded 642 A.D.) that are now in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France in Paris.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MS1572A-folio-1-verso-and-folio-2-recto.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37659\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MS1572A-folio-1-verso-and-folio-2-recto-200x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MS1572A-folio-1-verso-and-folio-2-recto-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MS1572A-folio-1-verso-and-folio-2-recto-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MS1572A-folio-1-verso-and-folio-2-recto-430x283.jpg 430w\" title=\"Folio 1, verso,  and Folio 2, recto.

While the handwriting on those two pages at first glance seemed identical to that on the rest of the manuscript, she saw that the content stuck out, that it didn\u2019t seem to fit with what came before and after. Fedeli pointed out the discrepancy to Susan Worrall, director of the library\u2019s special collections, who decided to have them carbon dated by experts at the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit. They were shocked by the results.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Muhammad Isa Waley, Lead Curator for Persian and Turkish Manuscripts at the British Library, said: \u201cThis is indeed an exciting discovery. We know now that these two folios, in a beautiful and surprisingly legible Hijazi hand, almost certainly date from the time of the first three Caliphs. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Muslim community was not wealthy enough to stockpile animal skins for decades, and to produce a complete Mushaf, or copy, of the Holy Qur\u2019an required a great many of them. The carbon dating evidence, then, indicates that Birmingham\u2019s Cadbury Research Library is home to some precious survivors that \u2013 in view of the Suras included \u2013 would once have been at the centre of a Mushaf from that period. And it seems to leave open the possibility that the Uthmanic redaction took place earlier than had been thought \u2013 or even, conceivably, that these folios predate that process. In any case, this \u2013 along with the sheer beauty of the content and the surprisingly clear Hijazi script \u2013 is news to rejoice Muslim hearts.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The folios will go on display at University of Birmingham\u2019s <a href=\"http://barber.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a> from October 2nd through October 25th.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/C-HDFiC2boQ&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Birmingham Qur\u2019an folio one of world\u2019s earliest\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37657\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37657#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-37633\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37633\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Floor of 4,000-year-old dwelling found in Ohio\">Floor of 4,000-year-old dwelling found in Ohio</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, July 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-Native-American-settlement-near-Black-River-in-Sheffield-Village.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37635\" height=\"102\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-Native-American-settlement-near-Black-River-in-Sheffield-Village-150x102.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-Native-American-settlement-near-Black-River-in-Sheffield-Village-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-Native-American-settlement-near-Black-River-in-Sheffield-Village-200x136.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-Native-American-settlement-near-Black-River-in-Sheffield-Village-430x292.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Archaeologists-excavate-Native-American-settlement-near-Black-River-in-Sheffield-Village.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Archaeologists excavate 4,000-year-old dwelling near Sheffield, Ohio.

Features were built into the floor, among them a basin, cooking pits, storage holes that held tools and food supplies like hickory nuts. Around the perimeter of the floor are post molds, spots of decayed organic material left in post holes that once held hickory saplings. Those saplings were tied together at the top and draped with mats of woven cattails to make a proto-wigwam.</p>\n<p>This is remarkably solid construction for nomadic hunter-gatherers. They didn\u2019t live here permanently, but rather visited the area to hunt and forage. It must have been an excellent spot for their purposes \u2014 productive, sheltered \u2014 because they stayed there for months before moving on only to return again over and over.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Deer-bone-awl.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37637\" height=\"104\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Deer-bone-awl-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Deer-bone-awl-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Deer-bone-awl-200x139.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Deer-bone-awl-430x299.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Deer-bone-awl.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Deer bone awl. Photo by Marvin Fong / The Plain Dealer.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Cleveland Museum of Natural History team under Dr. Redmond first explored the Burrell Orchard site in 2008 when they discovered multiple layers of middens \u2014 ancient refuse piles \u2014 under the surface. Flint flakes, broken weapons, fire-cracked rocks, butchered animal bones and the remains of many cooking pits were found in deposits as much as 1.6 feet deep. Shovel-test excavations pinpointed the perimeter of the buried midden deposit: it is more than an acre in surface area. So vast a trash collection indicates the site was used for centuries by dozens, possibly hundreds, of hunter-gatherer families as a food collecting and processing spot. </p>\n<p>The 2008 excavation also revealed the first of post molds. Some of them appeared to be the remnants of simple structures like food drying racks, but others were found in groups of three or more, which suggests the posts were used to make a more elaborate structure. They found layers of yellow-brown clay as well. While similar clay layers at archaeological sites in Illinois and Kentucky were found to be the floors of Late Archaic homes, at first the team thought the yellow clay might just be the natural subsoil underlying the middens. Digging underneath the layer revealed prehistoric artifacts, however, so either the clay was backdirt dug up from nearby pits that sank into the natural subsoil, or it was deliberately placed there to act as a floor or working surface. Now we know it\u2019s the latter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/house-floor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37649\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/house-floor-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/house-floor-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/house-floor-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/house-floor-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Floor unearthed in 2014 with yellow clay layer, red oxidized areas from burning, post molds marked by white spots.

One of the excavation pits found the yellow clay layer with an arc of post molds following the edge of the clay that penetrate through the layer. When they returned this year, they scanned the field with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and found a section that generated a very similar signal to the one caused by the 2014 floor discovery. The excavation turned up the same kinds of materials \u2014 flint flakes, fire-cracked rock, burned animal bones, burned soil, charcoal \u2014 found in the shallower layers of the 2014 find. Then the team struck gold: the yellow clay layer, this one less deep than the one from the year before. A core sample them revealed there was a second yellow clay layer at the same depth as the one found in 2014. It looks like the Late Archaic people using the site constructed a dwelling over the floor of an older one, which makes sense when you\u2019re returning to the same spot for generations.</p>\n<p>Dr. Redmond has blogged about the 2014 and 2105 excavations <a href=\"https://www.cmnh.org/blog?filter=Archaeology&amp;page=2\" target=\"_blank\">on the Cleveland Museum of Natural History\u2019s website</a>.

In the wake of the publication of that video of the future Queen <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/07/20/in-elizabeth-iis-childhood-nazi-salute-an-unsettling-reminder-of-how-we-misread-hitler/\" target=\"_blank\">being taught how to do the Nazi salute</a> in 1933 when she was seven years old, British Movietone put together <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYUZufl6UGR_L4PsUqQ9vy-Ebl_ULy2dN\" target=\"_blank\">a collection of videos</a> showcasing pre-World War II attitudes to Nazism and Fascism in England.

They\u2019ve had their video archives available <a href=\"http://www.aparchive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">on their own website</a> for some time, but only unembeddable, painfully low resolution previews. The good stuff had to be paid for, which left it the province of documentarians and big budget news outlets. It\u2019s nice to see the AP finally catch on to the fact that they\u2019ll get more licensing requests by opening up their archives to the place pretty much everyone goes to look for videos rather than by keeping them squirreled away on their website.</p>\n<p>Alright guys, smell ya later.

The so-called ingot is 95% lead and has no silver in it at all. It\u2019s just a large hunk of ballast. As for the so-called wreck, it\u2019s a pile of stones, probably rubble from a broken section of the port.</p>\n<p>Days after the putative discovery was made in the shallow waters of the bay of the island of Sainte Marie off the east coast of Madagascar, UNESCO\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Body (STAB) sent an emergency mission to the island at the behest of the Ministry of Culture and Crafts of Madagascar. A team composed of seven divers, archaeologists, curators and photographers was to report on the general condition of the historic wrecks in the bay and to evaluate Clifford\u2019s excavation project. They explored the site for four days, ultimately finding nothing that could be part of a ship, just stones. Team leader Dr. Michel L\u2019Hour, a French underwater archaeologist who has explored 150 wrecks in his career and is in his ninth year as Director of the Department of Underwater Archaeological Research of France\u2019s Ministry of Culture, thinks the stones may be all that\u2019s left of a jetty or the base of a sea wall.</p>\n<p>Determining that the bar wasn\u2019t silver was a simple matter of testing it. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ews/morning-mix/wp/2015/07/16/unesco-buried-explorer-barry-cliffords-captain-kidd-discovery-and-he-is-freaking-out/\" target=\"_blank\">Clifford admits</a> that he never did have the metal tested before announcing to the world it was the biggest silver ingot ever found on a shipwreck. He claims he was going by the word of his collaborator John de Bry, a historian who has worked with Clifford for 15 years, but de Bry says he never got a chance to examine it or touch it, that he only saw the piece from a distance. \u201cIt looked like a silver bar except the markings were unusual.\u201d Clifford persists in believing that it could still be silver despite UNESCO\u2019s results.</p>\n<p>John de Bry, who is not an archaeologist despite having been erroneously described as such in the media and by Clifford, was quoted at the time of the discovery saying that the underwater remains and the ingot were \u201cirrefutable proof</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html> that this is indeed the treasure of the <em>Adventure Gallery</em>.\u201d Yet, shortly thereafter he was cooperating with the UNESCO investigation very much against Clifford\u2019s wishes, sharing the expedition\u2019s research data which according to UNESCO Clifford refused in writing to provide. \n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Barry-Clifford-c-holds-lead-ballast-Martin-Vogl-AP.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-37627\" height=\"142\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Barry-Clifford-c-holds-lead-ballast-Martin-Vogl-AP-200x142.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Barry-Clifford-c-holds-lead-ballast-Martin-Vogl-AP-200x142.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Barry-Clifford-c-holds-lead-ballast-Martin-Vogl-AP-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Barry-Clifford-c-holds-lead-ballast-Martin-Vogl-AP-430x305.jpg 430w\" title=\"Barry Clifford (center) holds lead ballast he thought was a silver ingot from Captain Kidd's treasure, May 7th, 2015. Photo by Martin Vogl/AP.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Clifford has a history of UNESCO disputing his breathlessly announced finds. I didn\u2019t post about this story at the time because it was just so blatantly crap, but last May Clifford <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/13/world/americas/christopher-columbus-santa-maria/\" target=\"_blank\">claimed to have discovered</a> the wreck of Christopher Columbus\u2019 flagship the <em>Santa Maria</em> off the coast of Haiti. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/world/americas/un-columbus-santa-maria-claim/\" target=\"_blank\">Five months later</a> UNESCO announced their team had investigated the wreck and found bronze or copper fasteners which conclusively date the ship\u2019s construction to the 17th or 18th century. </p>\n<p>Now that they\u2019ve poured cold water on his Captain Kidd fantasies too, Clifford insists UNESCO is out to get him. The organization is only trying to besmirch his discoveries because it\u2019s opposed to all private archaeology, he says, and is \u201cheavily anti-American and anti-British.\u201d Sam Browne, producer of the documentary about the wreck for the History Channel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/15/film-maker-fires-broadside-unesco-row-captain-kidds-treasure-find\" target=\"_blank\">agrees that UNESCO is just hating on Clifford</a>. Apparently without a shred of irony, Browne decries UNESCO\u2019s \u201cfrankly shocking lack of transparency and impartiality throughout,\u201d which is pretty rich coming from the people who emerged out of the sea with a hunk of lead, called a press conference to announce without proof or even a single decent picture of the site that they\u2019d found Captain Kidd\u2019s treasure and then refused to share their research data with UNESCO. He insists that their methods were scientifically rigorous, that they conducted \u201cthe most comprehensive geophysical study ever done\u201d of Sainte Marie bay, that the UNESCO team wasn\u2019t even looking in the right place. </p>\n<p>Judging from <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CLT/pdf/Rapport_Madagascar_EN_public.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the UNESCO report (pdf)</a>, it\u2019s not Clifford\u2019s private funding and Americanness that irks them, but rather his shameless mediawhoring and lack of adherence to the strictures of its Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The work of the film team and its lead\u2010explorer, undertaken in spring 2015, as well as prior work by the same explorer, was distinguished by a media\u2010led approach, which has not respected the regulations of the 2001 Convention, and which jeopardized the scientific understanding of the sites concerned and the preservation of the artefacts recovered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UNESCO\u2019s 2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, ratified by Madagascar, requires, among other things, that any contact with the wrecks be led by a qualified underwater archaeologist. Clifford is not an archaeologist, nor is de Bry or the members of the film crew documenting the find. October Films, the production company shooting the documentary, said that \u201call the work was carried out by a team of experienced underwater explorers lead by a respected marine archaeologist,\u201d the last apparently being a reference to Clifford who is not in fact an archaeologist. </p>\n<p>It\u2019ll be interesting to see if this documentary ever sees the light of the day. They should just edit in an addendum questioning ominously whether the UNESCO team might be aliens. The History Channel will eat that right up, no questions asked.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Captain\u2019s Kidd treasure neither treasure nor Kidd\u2019s\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37626\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> \n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/37626#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2015/07/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

the ostentatious displays of official victors, but it wasn\u2019t always thus. In the 19th century, before the rules for title championships were encoded, both the title and the waist accessory were more loosely assigned. John L. Sullivan was considered the first heavyweight champion of the world, even though any consistent standard would give English boxer Jem Mace that honor for his defeat of Tom Allen in 1870. Why not, then, have a belt made to celebrate one fighter\u2019s triumph even when said fight resulted in a draw?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37756\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882-200x290.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882-430x625.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John_L._Sullivan_1882.jpg 1023w\" title=\"Heavyweight champion John L. Sullivan, 1882\" width=\"103\"/></a>The draw in question was a brutal contest between John L. Sullivan and English fighter Charles Mitchell. Nobody saw it coming. The opponents were evenly matched in some ways. They were close in age (Sullivan was 29, Mitchell 26) and close in height (Sullivan 5\u201910 1/2\u2033, Mitchell 5\u20199\u2033). Both had championship titles. Both had winning records, although only Sullivan was undefeated. The big difference was weight. Rarely weighing more than 160 pounds, Charley Mitchell was a welterweight, a middleweight on a good day. John L. Sullivan was a heavyweight who was 190 pounds at his leanest and who regularly crossed the 200-pound mark. (He weighed 238 pounds when he knocked out 170-pound middleweight Jack Burke in 1885.) </p>\n<p>The weight of his punch was in keeping with his physique. Sullivan had defeated Paddy Ryan in 1882 to claim the title heavyweight champion of America and kept it for a decade until Gentleman Jim Corbett relieved him of it by knock-out in 1892. Ryan would later describe being hit by Sullivan as feeling as if \u201ca telegraph pole had been shoved against me endways.\u201d Sullivan was expected to knock out Mitchell, who pound for pound was one of the hardest hitters in the ring. Pound for pound being the salient issue. Mitchell had a reputation for being fast and avoiding blows \u2014 <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=D_IWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA197\" target=\"_blank\">in his memoirs</a> Sullivan called Mitchell a \u201cbombastic sprinter boxer\u201d) \u2014 but despite his proven ability to hit and run, Mitchell was considered simply too puny to take out Sullivan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-37557\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883-200x298.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883-430x640.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charley_Mitchell_c1883.jpg 973w\" title=\"Charley Mitchell, ca. 1883\" width=\"100\"/></a>Mitchell wasn\u2019t intimidated. Not only did he want this fight, he actively picked it for five years. Mitchell and Sullivan first went at each other in a bout at Madison Square Garden in 1883. Police stopped the fight after the third round, three rounds that Sullivan dominated with one glaring exception: Mitchell had knocked him down in the first round with a left hook to the chin. Sullivan had never hit the floor before in his career and he didn\u2019t take kindly to it. Mitchell vociferously demanded a rematch and one was actually proposed for the next day but Sullivan would not accept it. A rematch was scheduled for June 30th, 1884, but it was cancelled when Sullivan turned up drunk. </p>\n<p>The beef was not squashed, only refrigerated. When Sullivan traveled to London in November of 1887 to fight in front of the Prince of Wales, Mitchell taunted him, telling the press that Sullivan was afraid to fight him because he\u2019d knocked him down four years earlier. One reporter described Mitchell as \u201csnarling out challenges to [Sullivan] by the dozen.\u201d Sullivan, who fought more than 50 exhibitions during his two months in England as Mitchell goaded him relentlessly, was livid. He agreed to fight Mitchell on March 10th, 1888. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37751\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch\u00e2teau-de-Laversine-today-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ch\u00e2teau de Laversine today\" width=\"150\"/></a>When this fight took place, bare-knuckle prizefighting was illegal in all 38 states and several countries. Bouts had to be arranged in secret locations and even so were often broken up by the police. Fighters and promoters were regularly arrested and fined, sometimes sentenced to prison. Fleeing the state or country in disguise after a fight was commonplace. The thorny search for a location was resolved when Baron Gustave de Rothschild offered to host the fight on the grounds of his Ch\u00e2teau de Laversine, a stately home on the banks of the River Oise three miles north of Chantilly in the Picardy region of northern France. </p>\n<p>The 24-foot ring Mitchell had insisted on (as opposed to the 16-foot ring Sullivan wanted to help corral Mitchell\u2019s avoidance tactics) was erected outdoors near the stables. The fight began at 12:50 PM. At first it seemed to be going as expected, with Sullivan pummeling the bejesus out of Mitchell, knocking him down repeatedly in the first eight rounds. Mitchell landed some good ones, though, and as time passed, his running game served him well and he seemed to be getting stronger while Sullivan\u2019s strength faded. It started raining during the sixth round or so, and soon the rain turned torrential, transforming the ground to swampland which sapped Sullivan\u2019s energy all the more. Again from <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=D_IWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA200\" target=\"_blank\">John L.\u2019s memoirs</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Running and dropping was [Mitchell\u2019s] game, and to such an extent did he practise the former that, when the fight was over, a track like a sheep run was to be noticed all around the ring. Once he dropped without a blow and received a caution, and after this he went down a number of times for a mere tap.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After three hours and 11 minutes and 39 rounds, both sides agreed to call it a draw, but the fact that the English fall-taking sprinter boxer held out so effectively against the Irish-American Boston Strong Boy felt a lot more like a stinging defeat to Sullivan and his fans. Reams of newsprint were dedicated to musings on how this could have happened. Back in England, Mitchell was hailed as a conquering hero. </p>\n<p>To show their appreciation for his having managed to avoid being beaten unconscious, a group of English supporters <a href=\"http://sports.ha.com/itm/boxing/1888-ornate-boxing-belt-presented-to-charley-mitchell-after-fighting-john-l-sullivan-to-a-famous-draw/a/7145-80041.s\" target=\"_blank\">presented Charley Mitchell with a championship belt</a>. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles-Mitchell-championship-belt-March-10-1888.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-37556\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles-Mitchell-championship-belt-March-10-1888-430x96.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles-Mitchell-championship-belt-March-10-1888-430x96.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles-Mitchell-championship-belt-March-10-1888-150x33.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles-Mitchell-championship-belt-March-10-1888-200x44.jpg 200w\" title=\"Charles Mitchell championship draw belt, 1888\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<blockquote><p>[A] truly breathtaking belt crafted from British sterling and velvet for presentation to Sullivan\u2019s plucky challenger.

He had already had to deal with belt nonsense the year before when Richard K. Fox, editor of the <em>National Police Gazette</em> and holder of a very long grudge against Sullivan for having snubbed him in a saloon once, declared the undefeated Irish-American heavyweight Jake Kilrain the new world champion and gave him a silver championship belt on behalf of the <em>Gazette</em>. Sullivan\u2019s supporters responded by giving him a <a href=\"http://amhistory.si.edu/sports/exhibit/firsts/sullivan/#\" target=\"_blank\">championship belt of 14-carat gold</a> engraved \u201cPresented to the Champion of Champions, John L. Sullivan, by the Citizens of the United States.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s name was spelled in diamonds, 397 of them, no less. It was the most expensive belt ever given to a fighter. Mitchell\u2019s was the second most expensive. The latter has now sold at auction for $55,000, which is quite modest, really, considering it cost $10,000 to make.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37752\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889-200x121.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889-430x262.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-L.-Sullivan-Jake-Kilrain-boxing-match-at-Richburg-Miss-1889.jpg 1499w\" title=\"John L.

He had a great vantage point from Mitchell\u2019s corner, and Mitchell would be in his when Kilrain went up against Sullivan for the world heavyweight title in Richburg, Mississippi, in 1889.

In the 19th century, before the rules for title championships were encoded, both the title and the waist accessory were more loosely assigned. John L. Sullivan was considered the first heavyweight champion of the world, even though any consistent standard would give English boxer Jem Mace that honor for his defeat of Tom Allen in 1870. Why not, then, have a belt made to celebrate one fighter\u2019s triumph even when said fight resulted in a draw? The draw in question was a brutal contest between John L. Sullivan and English fighter Charles Mitchell. Nobody saw it coming. The opponents were evenly matched in some ways. They were close in age (Sullivan was 29, Mitchell 26) and close in height (Sullivan 5\u201910 1/2\u2033, Mitchell 5\u20199\u2033). Both had championship titles. Both had winning records, although only Sullivan was undefeated. The big difference was weight. Rarely weighing more than 160 pounds, Charley Mitchell was a welterweight, a middleweight on a good day. John L. Sullivan was a heavyweight who was 190 pounds at his leanest and who regularly crossed the 200-pound mark. (He weighed 238 pounds when he knocked out 170-pound middleweight Jack Burke in 1885.) The weight of his punch was in keeping with his physique. Sullivan had defeated Paddy Ryan in 1882 to claim the title heavyweight champion of America and kept it for a decade until Gentleman Jim Corbett relieved him of it by knock-out in 1892. Ryan would later describe being hit by Sullivan as feeling as if \u201ca telegraph pole had been shoved against me endways.\u201d Sullivan was expected to knock out Mitchell, who pound for pound was one of the hardest hitters in the ring. Pound for pound being the salient issue. Mitchell had a reputation for being fast and avoiding blows \u2014 in his memoirs Sullivan called Mitchell a \u201cbombastic sprinter boxer\u201d) \u2014 but despite his proven ability to hit and run, Mitchell was considered simply too puny to take out Sullivan. Mitchell wasn\u2019t intimidated. Not only did he want this fight, he actively picked it for five years. Mitchell and Sullivan first went at each other in a bout at Madison Square Garden in 1883. Police stopped the fight after the third round, three rounds that Sullivan dominated with one glaring exception: Mitchell had knocked him down in the first round with a left hook to the chin. Sullivan had never hit the floor before in his career and he didn\u2019t take kindly to it. Mitchell vociferously demanded a rematch and one was actually proposed for the next day but Sullivan would not accept it. A rematch was scheduled for June 30th, 1884, but it was cancelled when Sullivan turned up drunk. The beef was not squashed, only refrigerated. When Sullivan traveled to London in November of 1887 to fight in front of the Prince of Wales, Mitchell taunted him, telling the press that Sullivan was afraid to fight him because he\u2019d knocked him down four years earlier. One reporter described Mitchell as \u201csnarling out challenges to [Sullivan] by the dozen.\u201d Sullivan, who fought more than 50 exhibitions during his two months in England as Mitchell goaded him relentlessly, was livid. He agreed to fight Mitchell on March 10th, 1888. When this fight took place, bare-knuckle prizefighting was illegal in all 38 states and several countries. Bouts had to be arranged in secret locations and even so were often broken up by the police. Fighters and promoters were regularly arrested and fined, sometimes sentenced to prison. Fleeing the state or country in disguise after a fight was commonplace. The thorny search for a location was resolved when Baron Gustave de Rothschild offered to host the fight on the grounds of his Ch\u00e2teau de Laversine, a stately home on the banks of the River Oise three miles north of Chantilly in the Picardy region of northern France. The 24-foot ring Mitchell had insisted on (as opposed to the 16-foot ring Sullivan wanted to help corral Mitchell\u2019s avoidance tactics) was erected outdoors near the stables. The fight began at 12:50 PM. At first it seemed to be going as expected, with Sullivan pummeling the bejesus out of Mitchell, knocking him down repeatedly in the first eight rounds. Mitchell landed some good ones, though, and as time passed, his running game served him well and he seemed to be getting stronger while Sullivan\u2019s strength faded. It started raining during the sixth round or so, and soon the rain turned torrential, transforming the ground to swampland which sapped Sullivan\u2019s energy all the more. Again from John L.\u2019s memoirs: Running and dropping was [Mitchell\u2019s] game, and to such an extent did he practise the former that, when the fight was over, a track like a sheep run was to be noticed all around the ring. Once he dropped without a blow and received a caution, and after this he went down a number of times for a mere tap. After three hours and 11 minutes and 39 rounds, both sides agreed to call it a draw, but the fact that the English fall-taking sprinter boxer held out so effectively against the Irish-American Boston Strong Boy felt a lot more like a stinging defeat to Sullivan and his fans. Reams of newsprint were dedicated to musings on how this could have happened. Back in England, Mitchell was hailed as a conquering hero. To show their appreciation for his having managed to avoid being beaten unconscious, a group of English supporters presented Charley Mitchell with a championship belt. [A] truly breathtaking belt crafted from British sterling and velvet for presentation to Sullivan\u2019s plucky challenger. The pertinent details are artfully printed on the center plate: \u201cPresented to Charles Mitchell to Commemorate His Gallant Fight with John L. Sullivan for the Championship of the World on March 10th 1888 near Paris Resulting in a Draw, 39 Rounds being Fought, in 3 Hours 11 Minutes.\u201d Framing this center plate are portraits of Mitchell and Sullivan in relief, followed by British and American flags topped by a figural lion and eagle respectively, and then further figural plates completing the design against a backing of royal red velvet. On the final plate on the left side, the interior is engraved with the names of the gentlemen who funded this quite clearly expensive token of esteem. A second such engraved plaque is affixed to interior of center panel, though we suspect it was originally attached to the final plate on right. The velvet is well worn and the silver exhibits some tarnishing and storage wear, but the aesthetics remain spectacular after nearly thirteen decades. This ornate trophy was a slap in Sullivan\u2019s face. He had already had to deal with belt nonsense the year before when Richard K. Fox, editor of the National Police Gazette and holder of a very long grudge against Sullivan for having snubbed him in a saloon once, declared the undefeated Irish-American heavyweight Jake Kilrain the new world champion and gave him a silver championship belt on behalf of the Gazette. Sullivan\u2019s supporters responded by giving him a championship belt of 14-carat gold engraved \u201cPresented to the Champion of Champions, John L. Sullivan, by the Citizens of the United States.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s name was spelled in diamonds, 397 of them, no less. It was the most expensive belt ever given to a fighter. Mitchell\u2019s was the second most expensive. The latter has now sold at auction for $55,000, which is quite modest, really, considering it cost $10,000 to make. Kilrain, incidentally, was a witness to the Mitchell-Sullivan fight in Chantilly. He had a great vantage point from Mitchell\u2019s corner, and Mitchell would be in his when Kilrain went up against Sullivan for the world heavyweight title in Richburg, Mississippi, in 1889. This would be the last title match fought with bare knuckles under London Prize Ring Rules and it was one for the ages. Fought in the noon sun of a Mississippi July, the bout lasted two hours, 16 minutes and went 75 rounds. Kilrain had to be carried to his corner by the 17th round. Sullivan vomited in the 44th. Scheduled to run 80 rounds, the bout was finally stopped when Kilrain\u2019s cornerman Mike Donovan, very much against his fighter\u2019s wishes, threw in the towel because he was sure Kilrain, who could barely stand by this point, wouldn\u2019t survive a 76th round.

Since he was anxious to see action, he volunteered to drive ambulances, a duty that he had heard would get him to the Western front the fastest. He was deployed in December of that year, sailing to England on the <em>Carpathia</em>, the ship that rescued the survivors of the <em>Titanic</em>, then going on to various places in France.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe little French children were hungry,\u201d Mr. Buckles recalled in a 2001 interview for the Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress. \u201cWe\u2019d feed the children. To me, that was a pretty sad sight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Buckles escorted German prisoners of war back to their homeland after the Armistice, then returned to America and later worked in the Toronto office of the White Star shipping line.</p>\n<p>He traveled widely over the years, working for steamship companies, and he was on business in Manila when the Japanese occupied it following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. He was imprisoned by the Japanese, losing more than 50 pounds, before being liberated by an American airborne unit in February 1945. </p></blockquote>\n<p>He worked for a steamship until he retired in the mid-1950s, then he ran a cattle farm for another 50 or so years. As one of very few remaining World War I veterans, Buckles was a frequent participant in parades and national memorial events during the past decade. He was extensively interviewed, relaying his unique memories of the Great War. For instance, he told an interviewer how he had seen veterans of the Crimean War in a ceremony in England. That\u2019s the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_of_the_light_brigade\" target=\"blank\">Charge of the Light Brigade</a> war, from the 1850s. One 110-year-old man connected us to so much history that seems so distant when we read about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/us/01buckles.html?_r=1&amp;src=mv\" target=\"blank\">He passed away on Sunday</a> at his home in Charles Town, West Virginia. In 2007, he was one of four U.S. World War I veterans still alive, two of whom served Stateside and one with Canadian forces in Britain, so even then Buckles was the only surviving veteran of the Western front. As of February 2010, he was the last US World War I veteran alive and only one of three people remaining in the world who had served in the war in any capacity.</p>\n<p>Now there are only two: Claude Choules, of the British Royal Navy, now living in Australia, and awesomely, Florence Green, of the British Women\u2019s Royal Air Force, now living in England. Florence joined the Women\u2019s Royal Air Force right at the end of the war, in September 1918, when she was 17. She worked in the mess halls of two Norfolk airbases. Choules saw much action from 1916 onwards, serving on the HMS <em>Revenge</em>, and witnessing the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow, Scotland, on June 21, 1919.</p>\n<p>The Veterans\u2019 History Project and the Library of Congress have an exceptional series of interviews with Frank Buckles, plus documents and pictures from his collection <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.01070/\" target=\"blank\">online</a>.

As you might have cleverly deduced from the title, what makes this volume special is that it was bound in the skin of executed murderer George Cudmore.</p>\n<p>George Cudmore, a short, humpbacked rat-catcher, was convicted in 1830 of poisoning his wife Grace by putting arsenic in food and medicine. He claimed to have been driven to the act by his lover Sarah Dunn. Dunn confessed that she had seen him messing around with a white powder, that she had told him not to poison his wife as he would be hanged. He put it in his wife\u2019s elder tea anyway and she saw him do it without stopping him. She said that even though she wasn\u2019t actively involved in the murder, she did let it happen and she did live \u201cin criminal intercourse\u201d with Cudmore, so she felt she was equally guilty. </p>\n<p>The jury disagreed. Dunn was acquitted and Cudmore convicted at the Lent Assizes in March, 1830. He was sentenced to hang, and to have his cadaver donated to the Devon and Exeter Hospital for dissection. On March 25th, George Cudmore was hanged from his neck until dead as Dunn watched. Cudmore\u2019s last request was that she be be kept in Devon County Gaol and made to witness his execution. For some reason that is unclear, they fulfilled his request even though she had been judged not guilty. She reportedly fell into hysterics and fainted when he dropped.</p>\n<p>His corpse was promptly sent to the Devon and Exeter Hospital where it was promptly dissected. It\u2019s unclear exactly how it got from the hospital onto a book, but it\u2019s thought that a portion of his skin fell into the hands of one Mr. W. Clifford, an Exeter bookseller, in 1853. He dressed it white (which I gather is some kind of tanning process) and bound Tegg\u2019s 1852 edition of Milton\u2019s <em>Works</em> with Cudmore\u2019s skin. From Clifford it entered into the collection of Ralph Sanders, Esq., who left it to Exeter\u2019s Albert Memorial Museum. Eventually it wound up in the Westcountry Studies Library where it remained in the rare book collection, out of public view, until a couple of days ago.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Senior assistant librarian Tony Rouse said: \u2018It is certainly an unusual and grisly thing, but if it weren\u2019t for the description, it would be difficult to discern its past.</p>\n<p>\u2018There is no hair or stray nipple or anything like that. It is outwardly unremarkable but a closer inspection reveals it to be a surprising artefact.\u2019 </p></blockquote>\n<p>No hair or stray nipple?! EVIL DEAD LIED TO ME!1</p>\n<p>The book is going on display this year because the theme of Local History Day is crime and punishment. There will be other talks and exhibits on the theme, including lectures on other Devon executions and witch trials.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Milton\u2019s poems bound in murderer skin on display\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9990\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9990#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-9977\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9977\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to A new old face for Otzi\">A new old face for Otzi</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, February 26th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of the discovery of Otzi the Iceman. On September 19, 1991, tourists Helmut and Erika Simon stumbled on a mummified corpse lying on his front embedded in the ice of the \u00d6tztal Alps, just 100 yards inside the Italian border. At first authorities thought he was recently deceased and thus dug him out in a slapdash manner, damaging him with jackhammers and allowing lookie-loos to collect pieces of his clothing and accessories. </p>\n<p>It was only after he was sent to the morgue that people realized he was 5,300 years old, Europe\u2019s oldest natural mummy. He\u2019s been on display in the <a href=\"http://www.iceman.it/\" target=\"blank\">South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology</a> since 1998, where a panoply of researchers study him, regularly releasing <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/2154\" target=\"blank\">new information</a> about <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/1225\" target=\"blank\">his life</a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/1728\" target=\"blank\">and death</a>.</p>\n<p>This year, the museum plans a variety of events and new exhibits to celebrate the 20th anniversary, including a new state-of-the-art reconstruction model of what Otzi might have looked like. There have been earlier attempts using anatomical data and measurements. In 1993, National Geographic <a href=\"http://blogs.ngm.com/blog_central/2008/09/neandertals-and-other-folks-wed-like-to-meet.html\" target=\"blank\">published a reconstruction</a> done by anthropologically-trained artist John Gurche, but he didn\u2019t have a 3D cast of the skull to work from, which is a major stumbling block to creating anything like an accurate facial reconstruction. Gurche had to use CT scans and pictures as the basis for his model.</p>\n<p>Now <a href=\"http://www.kenniskennis.com/index2.html\" target=\"blank\">Alfons and Adrie Kennis</a>, two Dutch experts in anthropological reconstruction models <a href=\"http://oetzi20.it/category/newoetzi-en/?lang=en\" target=\"blank\">have created a new model of Otzi</a> to display at the South Tyrol Museum\u2019s <a href=\"http://oetzi20.it/\" target=\"blank\">Otzi20 exhibit</a>. They used the latest scientific information and an exact 3D copy of the skull created from the most recent X-rays and CAT scans.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This latest work by these artists, famous for their reconstructions, shows a denizen of the Alps from the Stone Age, striking in the lifelike nature of every detail, from his skin colour down to the smallest wrinkle on his brow: of medium height, slight yet wiry, with narrow, sharp features, an unruly beard and tanned skin.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He looks much older than the earlier reconstructions. He was 40 when he died, so he was at first depicted as a strapping middle-aged man. However recent findings suggest that Otzi would have been weatherbeaten and prematurely aged by the harsh environment of the Copper Age Alps, and that his eyes were brown, not blue as previously thought.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the new reconstruction on the left, the early 90s version on the right:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-now-older.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"New reconstruction of Otzi the Iceman, courtesy National Geographic Germany\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9985\" height=\"243\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-now-older-247x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-now-older-247x300.jpg 247w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-now-older-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-now-older.jpg 825w\" title=\"New reconstruction of Otzi the Iceman, courtesy National Geographic Germany\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-1990-younger.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"1993 National Geographic reconstruction of Otzi\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9986\" height=\"239\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-1990-younger-251x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-1990-younger-251x300.jpg 251w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-1990-younger-125x150.jpg 125w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Otzi-1990-younger.jpg 435w\" title=\"1993 National Geographic reconstruction of Otzi\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"A new old face for Otzi\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9977\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9977#comments\">14 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-9958\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9958\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Nine Wari tombs found in Cuzco\">Nine Wari tombs found in Cuzco</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, February 25th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Archaeologists excavating one of the last standing Inca citadels in the Andean jungle region of Cuzco, Peru have discovered <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jknCVX8NZB_vuXK0JHP0z8-XFtPQ?docId=CNG.99868b1ecc4e65dad00cb9c958f4949c.c1\" target=\"blank\">nine tombs from the pre-Incan Wari culture</a>. Some Wari artifacts were first found last July; then over the next three months the tomb complex was discovered and finally announced to the public Wednesday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-noble-gold-and-silver-pieces.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Wari noble gold and silver pieces\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-9964\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-noble-gold-and-silver-pieces-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-noble-gold-and-silver-pieces-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-noble-gold-and-silver-pieces-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-noble-gold-and-silver-pieces.jpg 634w\" title=\"Wari noble gold and silver pieces\" width=\"100\"/></a>One of the tombs includes gold and silver burial goods which mark it as having belonged to a person of high status. Archaeologists have dubbed him the \u201cLord of Vilca\u201d in a nod to the Lord of Sip\u00e1n, the Moche aristocrat whose intact burial (from ca. 100 A.D.) was found in northern Peru in 1987 still full of jewelry, art and precious metals. The Lord of Vilca was buried with a large Y-shaped silver chestplate, a silver mask, two gold bracelets and two walking sticks laminated with silver.</p>\n<p>The Wari civilization flourished between 600 and 1100 A.D., 300 years before the Inca built the largest pre-Columbian empire on the continent. The Lord of Vilca\u2019s tomb dates to right in the middle of that range, around 1000 A.D.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The tombs are within the archaeological complex of Espiritu Pampa, in the Cuzco district of Vilcabamba, some 1,100 kilometers (680 miles) south-east of Lima.</p>\n<p>Vilcabamba was the last refuge of Inca resistance after Spanish conquistadors captured and executed the Inca emperor in 1532. The last resistance leader, Tupac Amaru I, was captured by the Spaniards after fleeing the site and executed in 1572.</p>\n<p>It is a \u201cspectacular, truly surprising\u201d discovery, said archaeologist Luis Lumbreras, former director of the National Cultural Institute (INC).</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will make us revise part of Inca history.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Historians previously thought the Wari civilization had reached Cuzco, but only up to the mountainous sierra. The Espiritu Pampa jungle region where Vilcabamba is found was thought to have been inhabited only by the Incas. It might suggest a closer link between the rise of the Inca Empire and its Wari predecessor.</p>\n<p>Wari burial complexes are always found inside cities and were part of complex formal funerary rites. They don\u2019t yet know the exact dates and extent of the citadel in which the tombs were found, but the burial complex covers an area of 450 square meters (about 4,844 square feet). </p>\n<p>Add this find to the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/12/16/us-peru-archeology-idUKTRE4BF7NY20081216\" target=\"blank\">2008 discovery</a> of a Wari city in Chiclayo, way up north, and the enormous reach of the culture becomes unmistakable. They covered almost the entire length of modern Peru and more than halfway inland.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-tombs-Andes-7-13th-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Nine Wari tombs found in Vilcabamba\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9966\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-tombs-Andes-7-13th-c-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-tombs-Andes-7-13th-c-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-tombs-Andes-7-13th-c-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-tombs-Andes-7-13th-c.jpg 956w\" title=\"Nine Wari tombs found in Vilcabamba\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-reach.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Wari reach\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9967\" height=\"246\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-reach-244x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-reach-244x300.jpg 244w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-reach-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-reach-833x1024.jpg 833w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wari-reach.jpg 938w\" title=\"Wari reach\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Nine Wari tombs found in Cuzco\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9958\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9958#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-9946\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9946\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Buy your own genuine historic Soviet space capsule\">Buy your own genuine historic Soviet space capsule</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, February 24th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>The first man in space, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, blasted out of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere on April 12, 1961 in a wee little sphere called the Vostok 3KA-3 Space Capsule.

Ivan Ivanovich ejected as planned before landing, and Zvezdochka emerged from the capsule unharmed. </p>\n<p>V.P. Efimoz, one of the people who worked on the pressurized spacesuit that kept Ivan and later Yuri intact, described its retrieval: \u201c[arriving] by sleigh, the rescue team reached the landing place of the descent capsule. Half scorched, slightly bent over the ground, it seemed an enormous animal driven too hard, lying in a narrow snow-covered gully, the snow melting around the charred and still hot body of the unit. Attached to it by slings, lay sprawling the voluminous canopy of the parachute.\u201d</p>\n<p>With the success of this test mission using an identical twin of the capsule Gagarin would stuff himself into, the historic mission to put a man in space got the final green light.</p>\n<p>Ivan Ivanovich is <a href=\"http://www.nasm.si.edu/imageDetail.cfm?imageID=1454\" target=\"blank\">on display at the Smithsonian</a> National Air &amp; Space Museum. Gagarin\u2019s Vostok 3KA-3, later renamed Vostok 1, is part of the permanent collection of Russian rocket company Rkk Energia\u2019s Museum outside Moscow.

Inside, the cramped space is littered with remains of old wires and the ejector seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese were very primitive,\u201d Redden said. \u201cThere was a good shot that whoever went into space was not coming back.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>And even if they did, just the fact of being shot into space in a 2.5 meter (8 feet) cabin would be challenge enough.</p>\n<p>Sotheby\u2019s estimates the sale price at $2-10 million. The seller is an anonymous American who bought it from Russia (thank you, post-Soviet cowboy capitalism) some years ago. Plutocrats with money to burn are major buyers on the Russian antiquities and collectibles market right now, so my guess is that this item will sell big and will end up back in Russia. Here\u2019s hoping it goes on public display instead of being squirreled away into another secret collection like the one it came from.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Buy your own genuine historic Soviet space capsule\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9946\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9946#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-9935\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9935\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rare color film of JFK\u2019s last night alive posted\">Rare color film of JFK\u2019s last night alive posted</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, February 23rd, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Rare color footage of John and Jackie Kennedy taken at the Rice Hotel in Houston just before 9:00 PM on Nov. 21, 1963, has been <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-22/us/texas.jfk.film_1_zapruder-film-abraham-zapruder-sixth-floor-museum?_s=PM:US\" target=\"blank\">restored and posted online</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.jfk.org/\" target=\"blank\">Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza</a>.</p>\n<p>The film was made by Roy Botello who was in town for a convention of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) held at the Rice.

Those 1,600 books he purchased in the last decade of his life are known as the retirement collection, and they were unfortunately scattered in 1829, three years after his death, when his relatives sold them at auction to pay his extensive debts. Researchers at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s estate and a National Historic Landmark, have been trying to track down the retirement collection since 2004 so it can be digitized and made available to the public in an online database called <a href=\"http://tjlibraries.monticello.org/about/introduction.html\" target=\"blank\">Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Libraries</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Plutarchs-Lives-with-handwritten-note-by-Thomas-Jefferson.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Plutarch's Lives with handwritten note by Thomas Jefferson\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-9929\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Plutarchs-Lives-with-handwritten-note-by-Thomas-Jefferson-300x199.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Plutarchs-Lives-with-handwritten-note-by-Thomas-Jefferson-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Plutarchs-Lives-with-handwritten-note-by-Thomas-Jefferson-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Plutarchs-Lives-with-handwritten-note-by-Thomas-Jefferson-1024x680.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Plutarch's Lives with handwritten note by Thomas Jefferson\" width=\"200\"/></a>Endrina Tay, the Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Libraries project manager, found a number of auction catalogs from the 1829 sale, but they didn\u2019t include the names of the buyers. Then she found a letter from Joseph Coolidge, the husband of one of Jefferson\u2019s granddaughters, asking the husband of another Jefferson granddaughter to secure some of the books for him at auction.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Coolidge wrote Nicholas Philip Trist, who married another Jefferson granddaughter, saying, \u201cIf there are any books which have T. J. notes or private marks, they would be interesting to me.\u201d He added, \u201cI beg you to interest yourself in my behalf in relation to the books; remember that his library will not be sold again, and that all the memorials of T. J. for myself and children, and friends, must be secured now! \u2014 this is the last chance!\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p>When Ms. Tay found the letter \u201cC\u201d next to some of the lots in one of the catalogs, she thought those volumes might have been successfully purchased by Coolidge. Then another piece of the puzzle snapped into place.</p>\n<blockquote><p>While [Tay] was tracking down the retirement library, one of her fellow Monticello scholars, Ann Lucas Birle, was researching a book about the Coolidges and, searching Google Books, found a reference in The Harvard Register to a gift in 1880 from a Coolidge son-in-law, Edmund Dwight, to a fellow Harvard alumnus and possible relative, William Greenleaf Eliot, a founder of Washington University.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt could have been his parents have died, he\u2019s left with 3,000 books, what should he do with these that would really do good?\u201d Dean Baker said. \u201cA great-uncle just founded a new university. If you send them to a university that doesn\u2019t even have 3,000 books, it could make a world of difference.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tay and Birle alerted Washington University to their find, and rare books curator Erin Davis and assistant archivist Miranda Rectenwald scoured the rare book collection for all the ones donated by the Coolidge family in 1880, which had long since been dispersed throughout the library\u2019s holdings with no particular indicators of their origin. They used a turn of the century ledger that included a listing of the Coolidge books for reference and were able to track down the Jefferson volumes.</p>\n<p>Their work isn\u2019t over yet, though. The curators will continue to examine the Coolidge collection for any more Jefferson books that have escaped notice. University officials are on cloud nine, needless to say. Shirley K. Baker, Washington University\u2019s vice chancellor for scholarly resources and dean of university libraries, enthuses: \u201cIt is particularly appropriate that these books should be here in Missouri. It was Jefferson who acquired this land in the Louisiana Purchase, and St. Louis was the jumping-off point for the expedition Jefferson sent to explore the new territory.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Trove of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s books found in St. Louis\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9920\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9920#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-9892\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9892\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Bust of James Watt cast from old mold and 3D scan\">Bust of James Watt cast from old mold and 3D scan</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, February 21st, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Watt-workshop-at-Heathfield.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Watt's garret workshop at his home near Birmingham\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9903\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Watt-workshop-at-Heathfield-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Watt-workshop-at-Heathfield-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Watt-workshop-at-Heathfield-300x227.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Watt-workshop-at-Heathfield.jpg 500w\" title=\"Watt's garret workshop at his home near Birmingham\" width=\"150\"/></a>When James Watt, inventor of the separate condenser (an essential improvement to the Newcomen steam engine that helped usher in the Industrial Revolution) retired to his home near Birmingham in 1800, his wife exiled him to the garret room where he could tinker loudly and make stinky messes far from the main living areas. He continued to make new inventions in that garret workshop, among them two machines for copying sculptures.</p>\n<p>He died in 1819, and his workshop was locked and left untouched until 1853 when his biographer J.P. Muirhead was allowed to view it. After that, visitors to Watt\u2019s home \u2014 he became something of an Industrial Revolution hero and his house was a pilgrimage site \u2014 would sometimes get a glimpse of the garret, but nothing was touched or moved. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/James_Watts_Workshop-Science-Museum-of-London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Watt's workshop at the Science Museum of London\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-9906\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/James_Watts_Workshop-Science-Museum-of-London-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/James_Watts_Workshop-Science-Museum-of-London-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/James_Watts_Workshop-Science-Museum-of-London-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/James_Watts_Workshop-Science-Museum-of-London-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Watt's workshop at the Science Museum of London\" width=\"150\"/></a>When the house was demolished in 1924, the entire workshop, including the door, window, skylight, floorboards and 6,500 objects used or created by Watt, was moved to London\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page52.asp\" target=\"blank\">Science Museum</a> where it was on display for years until the gallery it was in was closed.</p>\n<p>On March 23, the workshop will finally open again to visitors.

[\u2026]</p>\n<p>Andrew Nahum, Principal Curator of Technology and Engineering, said: \u201cFinding a new representation of a major national figure like Watt is a real discovery, a quite exceptional event. The bust is not in the historical record and its display in the gallery will be the first time it has ever been seen in public.</p>\n<p>\u201cAside from the scarcity of the image, the bust itself is of high artistic quality. In fact, Watt devoted much of his own time in later years to copying sculpture.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps surprisingly, as a result of his interest in this area, the Science Museum holds what may be Britain\u2019s largest collection of early 19th century sculpture moulds.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Science Museum has a wonderful blog with a <a href=\"http://sciencemuseumdiscovery.com/blogs/collections/category/watts-workshop/\" target=\"blank\">whole section about Watt\u2019s workshop</a>.

The construction was filmed for a Channel Four series called <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/rome-wasnt-built-in-a-day/episode-guide/series-1\" target=\"blank\">Rome Wasn\u2019t Built in a Day</a> (which you can watch online if you\u2019re in the UK or using a proxy). </p>\n<blockquote><p>It took a team of seven builders six months, 150 tonnes of sandstone bricks, 15 tonnes of lime mortar and 26 tonnes of plaster \u2013 all mixed by hand \u2013 1,500 hand-cut timber joints and 2,600 hand-cut roof tiles to create the house, based on a real building excavated at Wroxeter, which was once the fourth largest city in Roman Britain and is now an archaeology visitor attraction in the care of English Heritage.</p>\n<p>The workers, more used to plasterboard and plastic windows, had no experience of traditional techniques. A Channel 4 series, Rome Wasn\u2019t Built In A Day, tracked their steep learning curve \u2013 and the running battle of the wheelbarrow.</p>\n<p>The builders were incredulous when Evans insisted that, however advanced their plumbing and road-building, the Romans had no wheelbarrows, so everything had to be carried on to the site by hand. The builders kept smuggling in wheelbarrows; he kept throwing them out. When the roof boards were on, they wrote in giant letters \u201cRomans had wheelbarrows\u201d \u2013 now covered by the shingles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey absolutely did not have wheelbarrows,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of work on this now. They had wheelbarrows in China, but there is no record, drawing or evidence for a wheelbarrow anywhere in the Roman empire. The first reference I can find is Isidore of Seville, and that\u2019s in the seventh century \u2013 centuries after our house.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Think of all the massive construction projects all over the empire built with materials carried in baskets or one brick at a time. The mind boggles. </p>\n<p>The town house includes servants\u2019 quarters, small, dark, depressing bedrooms, and baths heated with the Roman hypocaust system of underfloor heating where a wood-burning furnace heated empty space left under the floors and inside the walls. This wouldn\u2019t have been used to heat the living quarters, though. That job was left to coal braziers, but when Evans\u2019 team tried it they had to douse the fires after just an hour because the carbon monoxide sensors were freaking out.</p>\n<p>There were a few other concessions made to modern sensibilities, like fire exits and wheelchair-accessible pathways. The builders also left one room unfinished so visitors can see the process of construction. One wall shows in different sections bare stonework at the base, then wooden posts joined horizontally, and lastly the wattle and daub filling inside the wooden frame to create a solid wall.</p>\n<p>The house officially <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/wroxeter-roman-city/wroxeter-roman-town-house/\" target=\"blank\">opened to the public yesterday</a>.

That turns out to have been false information since once museum curators did a complete inventory, 18 artifacts were found to have been stolen, including two gilded wood statues of King Tutankhamun and several other pieces from the Tutankhamun display. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The missing Heart Scarab of Yuya was recovered on the west side of the museum gardens, near the new bookshop. Wooden fragments belonging to the damaged New Kingdom coffin, still on the second floor of the museum, were also found in this area. The search team also found one of the eleven missing shabtis of Yuya and Thuya underneath a showcase. Fragments belonging to the statue of Tutankhamun being carried by the goddess Menkaret have been found; all the located fragments belong to the figure of Menkaret. The small figure of the king has not yet been found. </p>\n<p>Dr. Hawass said it seems the looters dropped objects as they fled, and every inch of the museum must be searched before the Registration, Collections Management, and Documentation Department, which is overseeing the inventory, can produce a complete and final report of exactly what is missing.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Statue-of-Akhenaten-found.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Statue of Akhenaten found in a trash can\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-9871\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Statue-of-Akhenaten-found-199x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Statue-of-Akhenaten-found-199x300.jpg 199w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Statue-of-Akhenaten-found-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Statue-of-Akhenaten-found-680x1024.jpg 680w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Statue-of-Akhenaten-found.jpg 800w\" title=\"Statue of Akhenaten found in a trash can\" width=\"199\"/></a>Thankfully four of the 18 have now been recovered, including the most valuable piece: a <a href=\"http://www.drhawass.com/blog/further-updates-state-egyptian-antiquities\" target=\"blank\">limestone statue of the Tut\u2019s father, Pharaoh Akhenaten</a> making offerings to the gods. Akhenaten was reviled after his death and his memory erased \u2014 cartouches with his name and statues with his likeness were destroyed \u2014 so this is a very rare surviving statue. </p>\n<p>It was found by a 16-year-old boy near a garbage can in Tahrir Square. He was there protesting against the Mubarak regime. When he found the statue, he brought it home and his mother called her brother, a professor at the American University in Cairo. The brother, Dr. Sabry Abdel Rahman, called the Ministry of State for Antiquities Affairs and returned the statue last Wednesday.</p>\n<p>It appears to be in good shape. Akhenaten was holding an offering table in his hands and that\u2019s been removed, but the table was found earlier still on museum premises. This statue is slated to be the first piece restored.</p>\n<p>Now for more bad news:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At Saqqara, the tomb of Hetepka was broken into, and the false door may have been stolen along with objects stored in the tomb. I have arranged for a committee to visit the tomb this coming Saturday to compare the alleged damage with earlier expedition photos. In Abusir, a portion of the false door was stolen from the tomb of Rahotep. In addition, break-ins have been confirmed at a number of storage magazines: these include ones in Saqqara, including one near the pyramid of Teti, and the magazine of Cairo University. I have created a committee to prepare reports to determine what, if anything, is missing from these magazines. The Egyptian Military caught and released thieves attempting to loot the site of Tell el Basta; the military also caught criminals trying to loot a tomb in Lisht. There have also been many reports of attacks on archaeological sites through the building of houses and illegal digging</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hawass is under a great deal of pressure right now, not just because of the damage and thefts, but also because there have been strikes demanding better jobs and decent pay, protests against his iron rule and corruption in the antiquities ministry.

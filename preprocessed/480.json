You're an institution of some sort: NSF, Templeton, MacArthur, a university's Committee on Research.  How do you decide who gets your money?<p>\n\nHere are two broad approaches:<p>\n<b>The Pretty Proposal Approach.</b>  Send out a call for applications.  Give the money to the researchers who make the best case that they have an awesome research plan.<p>\n<b>The Recent-Past-Results Approach.</b>  Figure out who in the field has recently been doing the best research of the sort you want to fund.  Give them money for more such research.<p>\n\n[ETA for clarity, 09:46] The ideal form of the Recent-Past-Results Approach is one in which the researcher does not even have to write a proposal!<p>\n\nOf course both models have advantages and disadvantages.  But on the whole, I'd suggest, too much funding is distributed based on the pretty proposal model and insufficient money based on the recent-past-result model.<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n\nI see three main advantages to the Pretty Proposal Approach:<p>\n\nFirst, and very importantly in my mind, the PPA is <i>egalitarian</i>.  It doesn't matter what you've done in the past.  If you have a great proposal, you deserve funding!<p>\n\nSecond, two researchers with equally good track records might have differently promising future plans, and this approach (if it goes well) will <i>reward the researcher with the more promising plans</i>.<p>\n\nThird, <i>the institution can more precisely control</i> exactly what research projects are funded (possibly an advantage from the perspective of the institution).<p></p></p></p></p>\n\nBut the Pretty Proposal Approach has some big downsides compared to the Recent-Past-Results Approach:<p>\n\nFirst, in my experience, researchers spend a <i>huge amount of time writing pretty proposals</i>, and the amount of time has been increasing sharply.  This is time they don't spend on research itself.  In the aggregate, this is a huge loss to academic research productivity (e.g., see <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3664356/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1503/1503.04201.pdf\">here</a>).  The Recent-Past-Results approach, in contrast, needn't involve any active asking by the researcher (if the granting agency does the work of finding promising recipients), or submission only of a cv and recent publications.  This would allow academics to deploy more of their skills and time on the research itself, rather than on constructing beautiful requests for money.<p>\n\nSecond, <i>past research performance probably better predicts future research performance</i> than do <i>promises</i> of future research performance.  I am unaware of data specifically on this question, but in general I find it better policy to anticipate what people will do based on what they've done in the past than based on the handsome promises they make when asking for money.  If this is correct, then better research is likely to be funded on a Recent-Past-Results approach.  (Caveat: Most grant proposals already require some evidence of your expertise and past work, which can help mitigate this disadvantage.) <p>\n\nThird, <i>the best researchers are often opportunistic and move fast</i>.  They will do better research if they can pursue emerging opportunities and inspirations than if they are tied to a proposal written a year or more before.<p>\n\nIn my view, the downsides of the dominant Pretty Proposal Approach are sufficiently large that we should shift a substantial proportion (not all) of our research funding toward the Recent-Past-Results Approach.<p></p></p></p></p></p>\n\nWhat about the three advantages of the Pretty Proposal Approach?<p>\n\nThe third advantage of the PPA -- increased institutional power -- is not clearly an all-things-considered advantage.  Researchers who have recently done good work in the eyes of grant evaluators might be better at deciding the specific best uses of future research resources than are those grant evaluators themselves.  Institutions understandably want some control; but they can exert this control by conditional granting: \"We offer you this money to spend on research on Topic X (meeting further Criteria Y and Z), if you wish to do more such research.\"<p>\n\nThe second advantage of the PPA -- more funding for similar researchers with differently promising plans -- can be partly accommodated by retaining the Pretty Proposal Approach as a substantial component of research funding.  I certainly wouldn't want to see <i>all</i> funding to be based on Recent Past Results!<p>\n\nThe first advantage of the PPA -- egalitarianism -- is the most concerning to me.  I don't think we want to see elite professors and friends of the granting committees getting ever more of the grant money in a self-reinforcing cycle.  A Recent-Past-Results Approach should implement stringent measures to reduce the risk of this outcome.  Here are a few possibilities:<p>\n<i>Prioritize researchers with less institutional support.</i>  If two researchers have similarly excellent past results but one has achieved those results with less institutional support -- a higher teaching load, less previous grant funding -- then prioritize the one with less support.  Especially prioritize funding research by people with decent track records and very little institutional support, perhaps even over those with very good track records and loads of institutional support.  This helps level the playing field, and it also might produce better results overall, since those with the least existing institutional support might be the ones who would most benefit from an increase in support.<p>\n<i>Low-threshold equal funding.</i>  Create some low bar, then fund everyone at the same small level once they cross that bar.  This might be good practice for universities funding small grants for faculty conference travel, for example (compared to faculty having to write detailed justifications for conference travel).<p>\n<i>Term limits.</i>  Require a five-year hiatus, for example, after five years of funding so that other researchers have a chance at showing what they can do when they receive funding.<p>\n\n[ETA 10:37] <b>In favoring more emphasis on the Recent-Past-Results Approach, I am <i>not</i> suggesting that everyone write Pretty Proposals with cvs attached and then the funding is decided mostly based on cv.</b>  That would combine the time disadvantage of writing Pretty Proposals with the inegalitarian disadvantage of the Recent-Past-Results Approach, and it would add misdirection since people would be invited to think that writing a good proposal is important.  (Any resemblance of the real grants process to this dystopian worst-of-all-worlds approach is purely coincidental.)  I am proposing either <i>no submission at all</i> by the grant recipient (models include MacArthur \"genius\" grants and automatic faculty start-up funds) or a <i>very minimal description of topic</i>, with no discussion of methods, impact, previous literature, etc.<p>\n\n[Still another ETA, 11:03] I hadn't considered <b>random funding</b>!  See <a href=\"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13369/7/Centralised-Funding-and-Epistemic-Exploration-Final-Revision-for-web.pdf\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2018/04/should-research-funding-be-allocated-at.html\">here</a> (HT Daniel Brunson).  An intriguing idea, perhaps in combination with a low threshold of some sort.<p>\n<i>Related Posts:</i><p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-to-give-1-million-year-to.html\">Related Posts: How to Give $1 Million a Year to Philosophers</a> (Mar 18, 2013).<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/12/against-increasing-power-of-grant_23.html\">Against Increasing the Power of Grant Agencies in Philosophy</a> (Dec 23, 2011).</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/research-funding-pretty-proposal.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-06-06T09:12:00-07:00\">9:12 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7093181549218841636\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, March 22, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6194529712020685860\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-meaning-of-life-quiz-as-learning.html\">The Meaning of Life Quiz as a Learning Outcomes Measure</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Somehow universities survived for centuries without any rigorous attempt to measure \"learning outcomes\".  Fortunately, those days are over!  Faculty must now prove to administrators that our students have learned something by taking our classes.  And that means rigorous quantitative assessments of learning outcomes, with internal and external validity, test-retest reliability, and other desirable psychometric properties.<p>\n\nThe aim of philosophy is to discover the meaning of life.  To properly assess whether students have in fact discovered the meaning of life by taking our classes, I propose a new <b>Meaning Of Life Outcome Measure (MOLOM)</b>.<p>\n\n[<i>Update Mar 23:</i> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/is-life-meaningful-or-is-world.html\">Poll results are in!</a>]\n\nPlease answer the following philosophical questions:<p>\n\n1. Every moment, every breath, every success and every failure is a treasure to be cherished.</p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n(strongly disagree - disagree - neither agree nor disagree - agree - strongly agree)<p>\n\n2. The world is a pointless cesspool of suffering and death.</p>\n(strongly disagree - disagree - neither agree nor disagree - agree - strongly agree)<p>\n\n3. There is value in living, either value that we can find if we search for it, or value that we ourselves can create.</p>\n(strongly disagree - disagree - neither agree nor disagree - agree - strongly agree)<p>\n\n4. All the uses of this world are weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable. Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p>\n(strongly disagree - disagree - neither agree nor disagree - agree - strongly agree)<p>\n\n5. Everything is just atoms bumping in the void, so nothing you do really matters.</p>\n(strongly disagree - disagree - neither agree nor disagree - agree - strongly agree)<p>\n\n6. It is better to have strived and struggled than never to have been.</p>\n(strongly disagree - disagree - neither agree nor disagree - agree - strongly agree)<p>\n\n7. How confident are you of your answers to the questions above?</p>\n(not at all confident - slightly confident - moderately confident - highly confident)<p>\n\n8. What is the meaning of life?  (Or if life is meaningless, explain why.)</p>\n\n(fill in the blank)<p>\n\nAlternatively, take the <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/R53GFPG\">SurveyMonkey version of the MOLOM</a>.<p>\n<i>Your Meaningfulness Score:<p></p></i>\n\nScore -2 to +2 points for strongly disagree to strongly agree on questions 1, 3, and 6.</p></p>\nScore +2 to -2 points for strongly disagree to strongly agree on questions 2, 4, and 5.<p>\n<i>\n\nInterpreting your Meaningfulness Score (revised March 23):<p></p></i>\n\n-12 to -2: Life is meaningless.</p>\n-1 to +1: Meh.\n+2 to +12: Life is meaningful.<p>\n<i>Recommended Usage as an Outcome Measure:<p></p></i>\n\nAdminister the test at the beginning of philosophy instruction, then re-administer the test at the end of philosophy instruction.<p>\n\nIf a student's Meaningfulness Score rises, this shows that the student has discovered that life has meaning (or at least is not as meaningless as they had previously thought).  If a student's Meaningfulness Score declines, this shows that the student has shed their foolish illusions (or at least that they have made progress toward shedding their illusions).<p>\n\nIf the student's confidence score rises, this shows that the student has solidified their understanding of the issues.  If the student's confidence score declines, this shows that the student has begun to challenge their earlier presuppositions.<p>\n\nIf the answer in the text box changes, this shows that the student has come to a new understanding of these fundamental issues.<p>\n\nAlso examine the standard deviation of the scores (after first reverse scoring questions 2, 4, and 5).  Compare the SD at the beginning of instruction with the SD at the end of instruction.  If a student's standard deviation increases, conclude that the student has learned to see nuanced distinctions between these various claims.  If a student's standard deviation decreases, conclude that the student has matured toward a more coherent worldview.<p>\n\nThe Meaning Of Life Outcome Measure is not yet fully validated, but I am optimistic that the MOLOM will prove to be the rigorously quantitative learning outcomes assessment tool that we need in philosophy.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m5aHnaA3mz4/WrMP_jiMEsI/AAAAAAAAAus/DolHiShaJaQP9mZ4gZHgD8S6LarUSWPUQCLcBGAs/s1600/MeaningOfLife.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"187\" data-original-width=\"270\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m5aHnaA3mz4/WrMP_jiMEsI/AAAAAAAAAus/DolHiShaJaQP9mZ4gZHgD8S6LarUSWPUQCLcBGAs/s320/MeaningOfLife.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-meaning-of-life-quiz-as-learning.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-03-22T10:36:00-07:00\">10:36 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6194529712020685860\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/humor\" rel=\"tag\">humor</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, February 14, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"9066991412849742287\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/philosophy-relies-on-those-double-majors.html\">Philosophy Relies on Those Double Majors</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Happy Valentine's Day!  Because I love you, here are some statistics.<p>\n\nFollowing a suggestion by <a href=\"https://www.winsberg.net/\">Eric Winsberg</a>, I decided to look at the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/\">IPEDS</a> database from the National Center for Education Statistics to see how commonly Philosophy is chosen as a second major, compared to as a first major, among Bachelor's degree recipients in the United States.<p>\n\nI examined data from all U.S. institutions in the database, over the three most recent available academic years (2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016), sorting completed majors by the IPEDS top-level major categories (2010 CIP two-digit classification), except replacing 38 \"Philosophy and Religious Studies\" with 38.01 \"Philosophy\".  Separately I downloaded the grand totals of completed first and second majors across the U.S.<p>\n\nIn all, across all institutions, 5,680,665 students completed a first major.  Of these, 289,639 (4.9%) also completed a second major.  Not many students earn second majors!<p>\n\nHowever, the ratios vary greatly by discipline.  In all, 24,542 students earned a Philosophy major, of which 5,015 (20.4%) earned it as a second major.  <b>At a minimum, then, 20% of Philosophy majors are double majors.  If half of those double majors choose to list Philosophy as their first major, then 40% of Philosophy majors in the U.S. are double majors.</b>  Unfortunately, the NCES database doesn't allow us to see how many of the people with first majors in Philosophy also had second majors in something else.  Forty percent might be too high an estimate, if double majors who have Philosophy as one of their majors disproportionately list Philosophy as their second major.  But even if 30%, rather than 40%, of Philosophy majors carry Philosophy along with some other major, that is still a substantial proportion.<p>\n\nHere's another way of looking at the data: 0.3% of students choose Philosophy as a first major, while among those who decide to take a second major, 1.7% choose Philosophy.<p>\n\nAcross all 37 top-level categories of major (excluding from analysis the top-level category Philosophy &amp; Religious Studies), only two had a higher percentage of students completing the major as a second major: Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics (28.5%), and Area, Ethnic, Cultural, Gender and Group Studies (26.2%).  Let's call this the Second Major Percentage.  In this respect, Philosophy is quite different from two of the other big humanities majors with which Philosophy is often compared: English Language and Literature (7.2%) and History (9.3%).  Interestingly, Mathematics, which is often regarded as a very different type of major, ranks fourth, with a Second Major Percentage of 14.4%.<p>\n\nHere's a breakdown among all top-level majors with at least 10,000 completed degrees in the three-year period:<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rf1qpkKbLSU/WoSiKQH8nCI/AAAAAAAAArY/BLvzw36tGsAgKLb4FAiJRSWivSHYCqtGwCLcBGAs/s1600/DoubleMajors2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"625\" data-original-width=\"714\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rf1qpkKbLSU/WoSiKQH8nCI/AAAAAAAAArY/BLvzw36tGsAgKLb4FAiJRSWivSHYCqtGwCLcBGAs/s400/DoubleMajors2.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n\n[apologies for the blurry rendering; click to enlarge; correction: the second \"Engineering Technologies\" should be simply \"Engineering\"]<p>\n\nLast fall, I presented <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/sharp-declines-in-philosophy-history.html\">data showing the precipitous decline in Philosophy majors in the past few years</a> -- from 0.58% of all graduates to 0.39% of all graduates.  One hypothesis, which I thought worth considering, is that Philosophy tends disproportionately to rely on double majors, and it is increasingly difficult for students to earn a second major.  <b>However, I now think that a decline in second majors can't be the primary explanation for the decline of the Philosophy major.</b>  First, although the percentage of students earning a second major has declined somewhat in the period -- from 5.4% in 2009-2010 to 5.1% in 2015-2016 -- that is small compared to the magnitude of the decline in Philosophy, where completions are down by 19% in absolute numbers and about a third in relative percentages.  Second, we saw similar declines in English and History, and those disciplines don't appear to be as reliant on students' declaring a second major.<p>\n<b>That said, Philosophy does appear to rely heavily on double majors, so we might expect policies that reduce the likelihood of double majoring to disproportionately harm Philosophy programs</b>.  Such policies might include increasing the requirements for other popular majors, increasing general education requirements (apart from G.E. requirements in Philosophy, of course), and increasing pressure to complete the degree quickly.<p>\n\nTo further explore the question, I divided the colleges and universities into two categories: those with a high rate of double majoring (&gt;= 10% of graduating students have two majors) vs those with a low-to-medium rate of double majoring (&lt; 10%), excluding institutions with &lt; 300 Bachelor's degree recipients over the three-year period.  As expected, <b>at institutions where students commonly complete second majors, about three times as high a percentage of students completed Philosophy degrees than at institutions where students less commonly complete second majors</b>: 9240/935419 (1.0%) vs. 14876/4656563 (0.3%; p &lt;&lt; .001).<p>\n\nDirection of causation is of course hard to know.  These groups of institutions will differ in many other respects too, and that is very likely to be part of the causal story, maybe most of the causal story.  And yet, the following fact is suggestive: The four majors that differ most in percentage between the two groups of universities, as measured by the ratio of percentage of students completing the major at the high-double-major schools to the percentage completing the major at the low-double major schools, those are exactly the same four majors that have the highest rate of second majors in the overall dataset.<p>\n\nThat's a little abstractly put, so let me give you the breakdown for the highest-ratio majors, so you can see where this is coming from:<p>\n\nArea, Ethnic, Cultural, Gender and Group Studies: 1.5% of majors at high-double-major schools vs. 0.4% at low-double-major schools, ratio 4.1.</p></p></p></p></p></p>\nPhilosophy: 1.0% vs. 0.3%, ratio 3.1\nForeign Languages and Literatures: 3.2% vs. 1.1%, ratio 3.0\nMathematics: 2.8% vs. 1.1%, ratio 2.7<p>\n\nI need a good name for this ratio, but I can't think of one, so let's just call it The Ratio.  Of course, the median Ratio is about 1.0.  History and English both have Ratios of 1.9, which is substantially above 1.0, but not as high as these other four.<p>\n\nIn other words, perhaps unsurprisingly, the four majors that students are disproportionately most likely to declare as second majors are exactly the same four majors that show the greatest difference in completions between schools where lots of students have double majors and schools where few do.<p>\n\nWith a few exceptions, most notably Biology (a Second Major Percentage of only 2.7%, but a Ratio of 1.7), the relationship is reasonably tidy.  The correlation between the natural log of each major's Ratio with each major's Second Major Percentage is r = .76 (p &lt; .001; excluding majors with &lt; 1000 completions in either group of universities; natural log to improve spread near zero).  Here it is as a scatterplot:<p>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NxDBYdAVsZo/WoSvDLU2r6I/AAAAAAAAArs/LuWSeiJINB0r707rF1avXNg5Abj00A_1gCLcBGAs/s1600/MajorsScatter.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"402\" data-original-width=\"518\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NxDBYdAVsZo/WoSvDLU2r6I/AAAAAAAAArs/LuWSeiJINB0r707rF1avXNg5Abj00A_1gCLcBGAs/s400/MajorsScatter.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></p></p></p></p>\n[click to enlarge]<p>\n\nSo although it seems unlikely that the recent sharp decline in Philosophy majors is due primarily to a decline in the overall proportion of students declaring two majors, it remains plausible that conditions that are good for double-majoring in general may be good for the Philosophy major in particular.<p>\n<i>\nRelated posts:<p></p></i>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/sharp-declines-in-philosophy-history.html\">Sharp Declines in Philosophy, History, and Language Majors Since 2010</a> (Dec 14, 2017)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/philosophy-undergraduate-majors-arent.html\">Philosophy Undergraduate Majors Aren't Very Black, but Neither Are They as White as You Might Have Thought</a> (Dec 21, 2017)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/women-have-been-earning-30-34-of.html\">Women Have Been Earning 30-34% of Philosophy BAs in the U.S. Since Approximately Forever*</a> (Dec 8, 2017).</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/philosophy-relies-on-those-double-majors.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-02-14T14:03:00-08:00\">2:03 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=9066991412849742287\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, October 17, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"246573937458765493\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/should-you-referee-same-paper-twice-for.html\">Should You Referee the Same Paper Twice, for Different Journals?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jI7YpUjyDmU/WeYbg7UOo9I/AAAAAAAAAb0/stbGYzB_GoEhWPVunNxdXHpaoCPsPv0FQCLcBGAs/s1600/paperpaper2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"480\" data-original-width=\"784\" height=\"122\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jI7YpUjyDmU/WeYbg7UOo9I/AAAAAAAAAb0/stbGYzB_GoEhWPVunNxdXHpaoCPsPv0FQCLcBGAs/s200/paperpaper2.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\nUh-oh, it happened again.  That paper I refereed for Journal X a few months ago -- it's back in my inbox.  Journal X rejected it, and now Journal Y wants to know what I think.  Would I be willing to referee it for Journal Y?<p>\n\nIn the past, I've tended to say no if I had previously recommended rejection, yes if I had previously recommended acceptance.<p>\n\nIf I'd previously recommended rejection, I've tended to reason thus: I could be mistaken in my negative view.  It would be a disservice both to the field in general and to the author in particular if a single stubborn referee prevented an excellent paper from being published by rejecting it again and again from different journals.  If the paper really doesn't merit publication, then another referee will presumably reach the same conclusion, and the paper will be rejected without my help.<p>\n\nIf I'd previously recommended acceptance (or encouraging R&amp;R), I've tended to just permit myself think that the other journal's decision was probably the wrong call, and it does no harm to the field or to the author for me to serve as referee again to help this promising paper find the home it deserves.<p>\n\nI've begun to wonder whether I should just generally refuse to referee the same paper more than once for different journals, even in positive cases.  Maybe if everyone followed my policy, that would overall tend to harm the field by skewing the referee pool too much toward the positive side?<p>\n\nI could also imagine arguments -- though I'm not as tempted by them -- that it's fine to reject the same paper multiple times from different journals.  After all, it's hard for journals to find expert referees, and if you're confident in your opinion, you might as well share it widely and save everyone's time.<p>\n\nI'd be curious to hear about others' practices, and their reasons for and against.<p>\n\n(Let's assume that anonymity isn't an issue, having been maintained throughout the process.)<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://dailynous.com/2017/10/17/referee-paper-twice-different-journals-guest-post-eric-schwitzgebel/\">Cross-posted</a> at Daily Nous]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/should-you-referee-same-paper-twice-for.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-10-17T08:04:00-07:00\">8:04 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=246573937458765493\" onclick=\"\">1 comments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, June 07, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3665670190405018690\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/academic-pyramids-academic-tubes.html\">Academic Pyramids, Academic Tubes</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Greetings from Cambridge!  Traveling around Europe and the UK, I am struck by the extent to which different countries have relatively pyramid-like vs relatively tube-like academic systems.  This has moved me to think, also, about the extent to which US academia has recently been becoming more pyramidal.<p>\n\nPlease forgive my ugly sketch of a pyramid and a tube:<p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xhrfP6HcIG0/WTfYj0IjttI/AAAAAAAAAM0/lsqtoGMf3181ZghtW47-We0-13HqTgv5wCLcB/s1600/PyramidTube.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"803\" data-original-width=\"1152\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xhrfP6HcIG0/WTfYj0IjttI/AAAAAAAAAM0/lsqtoGMf3181ZghtW47-We0-13HqTgv5wCLcB/s400/PyramidTube.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><p>\n\nThe German system is quite <b>pyramidal</b>: There is a small group of professors at the top, and <b>many stages between undergraduate and professor, at any one of which you might suddenly find yourself ejected from the system</b>: undergraduate, then masters, then PhD, then one or more postdocs and/or assistantships before moving up or out; and at each stage one needs to actively seek a position and typically move locations if successful.<p>\n\nIn contrast, the US system, as it stood about twenty years ago, was more <b>tubular</b>: <b>fewer transition stages requiring application and moving, with much sharper cutdowns between each stage</b>.  To a first approximation, undergraduates applied to PhD programs, very few got in, and then if they completed there was one more transition from completing the PhD to gaining a tenure-track job (and typically, though of course not always, tenure after 6-7 years on the tenure track).<p>\n\nPhilosophy in the US is becoming more pyramidal, I believe, with more people pursuing terminal Master's degrees before applying to PhD programs, and with the increasing number of adjunct positions and postdoctoral positions for newly-minted PhDs.  Instead of approximately three phases (undergrad, grad/PhD, tenure-track/tenured professor), we are moving closer to five-phase system (undergrad, MA, PhD, adjunct/post-doc, tenure-track/tenured).<p>\n<b>This more pyramidal system has some important advantages.  One advantage is that it provides more opportunities for people from nonelite backgrounds to advance through the system.</b>  It has always been difficult from students from nonelite undergraduate universities to gain acceptance to elite PhD programs (and it <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/sorry-cal-state-students-no-princeton.html\">still is</a>); similarly for students who struggled a bit in their undergraduate careers before finding philosophy.  With the increasing willingness of PhD programs to accept students with Master's degrees, a broader range of students can earn a shot at academia: They can compete to get into a Master's program (typically easier to do for people with nonelite backgrounds than being admitted to a comparably-ranked PhD program) and then possibly shine there, gaining admittance to a range of PhD programs that would otherwise have been closed to them.  A similar pattern sometimes occurs with postdocs.<p>\n\nThe other advantage of the pyramid is that being exposed to a variety of institutions, advisors, and academic subcultures has advantages both for the variety of perspectives it provides and for meeting more people in the academic community.  A Master's program or a postdoctoral fellowship can be a rewarding experience.<p>\n<b>But I am also struck by the downside of pyramidal structures.  In Europe, I met many excellent philosophers in their 30s or 40s, post-PhD, unsure whether they would make the next jump up the pyramid or not, unable to settle down securely into their careers.</b>  This used to be relatively uncommon in the US, though it has become more common.  It is hard on marriages and families; and it's hard to face the prospects of a major career change in mid-life after devoting a dozen or more years to academia.<p>\n\nThe sciences in the US have tended to be more pyramidal than philosophy, with one or more postdocs often expected before the tenure-track job.  This is partly, I suspect, just due to the money available in science.  There are lots of post-docs to be had, and it's easier to compete for professor positions with that extra postdoctoral experience.  One possibly unintended consequence of the increased flow of money into philosophical research projects, through the Templeton Foundation and government research funding organizations, is to increase the number of postdocs, and thus the pyramidality of the discipline.<p>\n\nOf course, the rise of inexpensive adjunct labor is a big part of this -- bigger, probably, than the rise of terminal Master's programs as a gateway to the PhD and the rise of the philosophy post-doc -- but all of these contribute in different ways to making our discipline more pyramidal than it was a few decades ago.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/academic-pyramids-academic-tubes.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-06-07T07:23:00-07:00\">7:23 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3665670190405018690\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, March 22, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2914026001555700454\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/03/what-kinds-of-universities-lack.html\">What Kinds of Universities Lack Philosophy Departments?

I pulled every ranked college and university from the famous <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges\">US News college ranking site</a>, sorting them into four categories: national universites, national liberal arts colleges, regional universities (combining the four US News categories for regional universities: north, south, midwest, and west), and regional colleges (again combining north, south, midwest, and west).  I randomly selected twenty schools from each of these four lists.  <b>Then I attempted to determine from the school's website whether it had a philosophy department and a philosophy major.</b> [See note 1 on \"departments\".]<p>\n\nSince some schools combine philosophy with another department (e.g. \"Philosophy and Religion\") I distinguished <i>standalone</i> philosophy departments from <i>combined</i> departments that explicitly mention \"philosophy\" in the department name along with something else.<p>\n\nI welcome corrections!  The websites are sometimes a little confusing, so it's likely that I've made an error or two.<p>\n\n***************************************************<p>\n<b>Results<p></p></b>\n<i>National Universities:<p></p></i>\n<b>Eighteen of the twenty sampled \"national universities\" have standalone philosophy departments (or equivalent: note 1) and majors.  The only two that do not are institutes of technology: Georgia Tech (ranked #34) and Florida Tech (#171).</b><p>\n\nVirginia Tech (#74), however, does have a Department of Philosophy and a philosophy major -- as do Stanford, Duke, Rice, Rochester, Penn State, UT Austin, Rutgers-New Brunswick, Baylor, U Mass Amherst, Florida State, Auburn, Kansas, Biola, Wyoming (<a href=\"http://dailynous.com/2016/05/26/philosophy-at-university-of-wyoming-threatened/\">for now</a>), North Carolina-Charlotte, Missouri-St Louis, and U Mass Boston.<p>\n<i>National Liberal Arts Colleges:</i><p>\n<b>Similarly, seventeen of the twenty sampled \"national liberal arts colleges\" have standalone philosophy departments, and eighteen offer the philosophy major.</b>  Offering neither department nor major are Virginia Military Institute (#72) and the very small science/engineering college Harvey Mudd (#21) (circa 735 students, part of the Claremont consortium).  Beloit College (#62, circa 1358 students) offers the philosophy major within a \"Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies\".<p>\n\nThe seventeen sampled schools with both major and standalone department are: Swarthmore, Carleton, Hamilton, Wesleyan, Richmond, DePauw, Puget Sound, Westmont, Hollins, Lake Forest, Stonehill, Hanover, Guilford, Carthage, Oglethorpe, Franklin (not to be confused with Franklin &amp; Marshall), and Georgetown College (not to be confused with Georgetown University).<p>\n<b>Some of these colleges are very small.</b>  According to Wikipedia estimates, two have fewer than a thousand students: Hollins (639) and Georgetown (984).  Another four are below 1300: Franklin (1087), Hanover (1133), Oglethorpe (1155), and Westmont (1298).<p>\n<i>Regional Universities:<p></p></i>\n<b>Nine of the twenty sampled regional universities have standalone philosophy departments, and another three have a combined department with philosophy in its name.  Twelve offer the philosophy major (not exactly the same twelve).</b>  Seven offer neither major nor department: Ramapo College of New Jersey, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Delaware Valley University, Stephens College, Mount St Joseph, Elizabeth City State, and Robert Morris.  Two of these are specialty schools: Wentworth is a technical institute, and Stephens specializes in arts and fashion.<p>\n\nOffering major and/or standalone or combined department: Simmons, Whitworth, Mansfield of Pennsylvania, Rosemont, U of Northwestern-St Paul, Central Washington, Towson, Ganon, North Park, Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Northern Michigan, Mount Mary, and Appalachian State.<p>\n<i>Regional Colleges:<p></p></i>\n<b>Seven of the twenty sampled regional colleges have a standalone philosophy department, and another four have a combined department with philosophy in its name.  Seven offer a philosophy major, and one (Brevard) has a \"Philosophy and Religion\" major.</b>  Offering neither major nor department: California Maritime Academy, Marymount California U (not to be confused with Loyola Marymount), Paul Smith's College (not to be confused with Smith College), Alderson Broaddus, Dickinson State, North Carolina Wesleyan, Crown College, and Iowa Wesleyan.  Four of these are specialty schools: California Maritime Academy and Marymount California each offer only six majors total, Paul Smith's focuses on tourism and service industries, and Iowa Wesleyan offers only three Humanities majors: Christian Studies, Digital Media Design, and Music.<p>\n\nOffering major and/or standalone or combined department: Carroll, Mount Union, Belmont Abbey, La Roche, St Joseph's, Blackburn, Messiah, Tabor, Ottawa University (not to be confused with University of Ottawa), Northwestern College (not to be confused with Northwestern University), and Cazenovia College.<p>\n<b>Summary<p></p></b>\n\nIn my sample of forty nationally ranked universities and liberal arts colleges, each one has a standalone philosophy department and offers a philosophy major, with the following exceptions: three science/engineering specialty schools, one military institute, and one school offering a philosophy major within a department of \"Philosophy and Religious Studies\".<p>\n\nEven among the smallest nationally ranked liberal arts colleges, with 1300 or fewer students, all have philosophy majors and standalone philosophy departments (or similar administrative units), with the exception of one science/engineering speciality college.<p>\n\nThe schools that US News describes as \"regional\" are mixed.  In this sample of forty, about half offer philosophy majors and about half have standalone philosophy departments.  Among the fifteen with neither department nor major in philosophy, six are specialty schools.<p>\n\nI'll refrain from drawing causal or normative conclusions here.<p>\n\n***************************************************<p>\n<i>Update 8:53 a.m.: Expanding the Sample:<p></p></i>\n<b>I'm tempted to conclude that, with the exception of specialty schools, almost every nationally ranked university and liberal arts college, no matter how small, has a philosophy major and a large majority have a standalone philosophy department.</b>  But maybe that's too strong a claim to draw from a sample of forty?  So I've doubled the sample.<p>\n\nDoubling the sample supports this claim.  Among the additional twenty universities sampled, nineteen offer the philosophy major, and the one that does not, UC Merced, is a new campus that plans to add the philosophy major soon.  Sixteen have standalone Philosophy Departments, and three have combined departments: Philosophy and Religion at Northeastern and Tulsa, Politics and Philosophy at University of Idaho.  The sampled universities with both standalone philosophy departments and the philosophy major are Tennessee, Nevada-Reno, Colorado State, South Dakota, New Mexico, Dartmouth, UC San Diego, U of Oregon, Columbia, Indiana-Bloomington, Kentucky, Alabama-Huntsville, Brandeis, George Washington, Azusa Pacific, and UC Riverside.<p>\n\nAdding twenty more nationally ranked liberal arts colleges also confirms my initial results.  Nineteen offer the major, with the only exception being Thomas Aquinas College, which appears to offer only one major to all students (Liberal Arts).  Three colleges have combined departments, all with religion: Washington College, Wartburg, and College of Idaho.  Sixteen have both major and standalone department: Wooster, Wheaton, Hampton-Sydney, Muhlenberg, Houghton, Colgate, Middlebury, Washington &amp; Lee, New College of Florida, Transylvania, Sweet Briar, Knox College, Colorado College, Oberlin, Luther, and Pomona.<p>\n\n***************************************************<p>\n\nNote 1: Some schools don't appear to have \"departments\" or have very broad \"departments\" that encompass many majors.  If a school had fewer than fifteen \"departments\" I attempted to assess whether it had a department-like administrative unit for philosophy, or if that assessment wasn't possible, whether it hosted a philosophy major apparently on administrative par with popular majors like psychology and biology.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/emeritus.html\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/03/what-kinds-of-universities-lack.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-03-22T07:46:00-07:00\">7:46 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2914026001555700454\" onclick=\"\">2\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, October 21, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6439298227310179116\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/storytelling-in-philosophy-class.html\">Storytelling in Philosophy Class</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ifxpWRlqAGQ/WAj2nF1WLaI/AAAAAAAABmM/rE_92s0mTG05mxU4mCOM1f9zNHhsmNP4QCLcB/s1600/storytime.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ifxpWRlqAGQ/WAj2nF1WLaI/AAAAAAAABmM/rE_92s0mTG05mxU4mCOM1f9zNHhsmNP4QCLcB/s1600/storytime.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nOne of my regular TAs, <a href=\"http://philosophy.ucr.edu/chris-mcvey/\">Chris McVey</a>, uses a lot of storytelling in his teaching.  About once a week, he'll spend ten minutes sharing a personal story from his life, relevant to the class material.  He'll talk about a family crisis or about his time in the U.S. Navy, connecting it back to the readings from the class.<p>\n\nAt last weekend's meeting of the <a href=\"https://uchv.princeton.edu/events/minorities-and-philosophy-conference-implicit-biasesstereotype-threat-and-pedagogy\">Minorities And Philosophy group at Princeton</a>, I was thinking about what teaching techniques philosophers might use to appeal to a broader diversity of students, and \"storytime with Chris\" came to mind.  The more I think about it, the more I find to like about it.<p>\n\nHere are some thoughts.<p>\n\n* <b>Students are hungry for stories, and rightly so</b>.  Philosophy class is usually abstract and impersonal, or when not abstract focused on toy examples or remote issues of public policy.  A good story, especially one that is <b>personally meaningful to the teacher</b>, leaps out and captures attention.  People in general love stories and are especially ready for them after long dry abstractions and policy discussions.  So why not harness that?  But furthermore, storytelling gives shape and flesh to the stick figures of philosophical abstraction.  <b>Most abstract principles only get their full meaning when we see how they play out in real cases</b>.  Kant might say \"act on that maxim that you can will to be a universal law\" or Mengzi might say \"human nature is good\" -- but what do such claims really amount to?  Students rightly feel at sea unless they are pulled away from toy examples and into the complexity of real life.  Although it's tempting to think that the real philosophical force is in the abstract principles and that storytelling is just needless frill and packaging, I think that the reverse might be closer to the truth: The heart of philosophy is in how we engage our minds when given real, messy examples, and the abstractions we derive from cases always partly miss the point.<p>\n\n* <b>Personal stories vividly display the relevance of philosophy.</b>  Many -- maybe most -- students are understandably turned off by philosophy because it seems so remote from anything of practical value.  What's the point, they wonder, in discussing <a href=\"http://homepages.wmich.edu/~baldner/qualities.htm\">Locke's view of primary and secondary qualities</a>, or semi-comical far-fetched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">problems about runaway trolleys</a>, or under what conditions you \"know\" something is a barn in <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/#FakBarCas\">Fake Barn Country</a>?  It takes a certain kind of beautiful, nerdy, impractical mind to love these questions for their own sake.  Too much focus on such issues can mislead students into thinking that philosophy is irrelevant to their lives.  However (I hope you'll agree), nothing is more relevant to our lives than philosophy.  Every choice we make expresses our values.  Every controversial opinion we form depends upon our general worldview and our implicit or explicit sense of what people or institutions or methods deserve our trust.  <b>Most students will understandably fail to see the connection between academic philosophy and the philosophy they personally live through their choices and opinions unless we vividly show how these are connected.</b>  Through storytelling, you model your struggle with Kant's hard line against lying, or with how far to trust purported scientific experts, or with your fading faith in an immaterial soul -- and students can see that philosophy is not just a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game\">Glass Bead Game</a>.<p>\n\n* <b>Personal stories shift the locus of academic capital.</b>  We might think of <b>\"academic capital\" as the resources students bring to class</b> which help them succeed.  In philosophy class, important capital includes skill at reading and evaluating abstract arguments and, in class discussion, skill at working up passable pro and con arguments on the spot.  Academic capital of this sort also includes knowledge of the philosophical tradition, comfort in a classroom environment, confidence that one knows how this game is played.  These are terrific skills to have of course; and some students have more of them than others, or at least believe they do.  Those students tend to dominate class discussion.  If you tell a personally meaningful story, however, you can make a different set of skills and experiences suddenly important.  Students who might have had similar stories from their own lives now have something unique to contribute.  <b>Students who are good at storytelling, students who have the social and emotional intelligence to evaluate what might have really happened in your family fight, students with cultural knowledge of the kind of situation you describe -- they now have some of the capital</b>.  And they might be a very different group from the ones who are so good at the argumentative pro-and-con.  In my experience, good philosophical storytelling engages and draws out discussion from a larger and more diverse group of students than does abstract argument and toy example.<p>\n\nIf philosophers were more serious about engaged, personal storytelling in class, we would I think have a different and broader range of students who loved our courses and appreciated the importance and interest of our discipline.<p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://auglaize.oplin.org/content/its-story-time-your-library-0\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/storytelling-in-philosophy-class.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-10-21T08:27:00-07:00\">8:27 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6439298227310179116\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, October 04, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6471931634138269181\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/french-german-greek-latin-but-not.html\">French, German, Greek, Latin, but Not Arabic, Chinese, or Sanskrit?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xMecEEm6ywY/V_PmrzfvzjI/AAAAAAAABk4/q9KjcoslyR4KPBvIrNS86cB_cpLMkpjJwCLcB/s1600/EpicRapBattle.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xMecEEm6ywY/V_PmrzfvzjI/AAAAAAAABk4/q9KjcoslyR4KPBvIrNS86cB_cpLMkpjJwCLcB/s200/EpicRapBattle.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2016/10/04/french-german-greek-latin-but-not-arabic-chinese-or-sanskrit/\">cross-posted</a> at the <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/\">Blog of the APA</a>]<p>\n\nWhen I was graduate student in Berkeley in the 1990s, philosophy PhD students were required to pass exams in two of the following four languages: <b>French, German, Greek, or Latin</b>.  I already knew German.  I argued that Spanish should count (I had read Unamuno in the original as an undergrad), but my petition was denied since I didn\u2019t plan to do further work in Spanish.  I argued that a psychological methods course would be more useful than a second foreign language, given that my dissertation was in philosophy of psychology, but that was not treated as a serious suggestion.  I'd learned some classical Chinese, but I thought it would be pointless to attempt 600 characters in two hours as required (much more daunting than 600 words in a European language).  So I crammed French for a few weeks and passed the exam.<p>\n\nI have recently become interested in <b>mainstream Anglophone philosophers\u2019 tendency to privilege certain languages</b> and traditions in the history of philosophy.  If we think globally, considering large, robust traditions of written work treating recognizably philosophical topics with argumentative sophistication and scholarly detail, it seems clear that <b><i>at least</i> Arabic, classical Chinese, and Sanskrit merit inclusion alongside French, German, Greek, and Latin</b> as languages of major philosophical importance.<p>\n\nThe exclusion of Arabic, Chinese, and Sanskrit from Berkeley\u2019s standard language requirements could not, I think, have been mere ignorance.  Rather, <b>the focus on French, German, Greek, and Latin appeared to express a <i>value judgment:</i> that these four languages are more central to philosophy as it <i>ought</i> to be studied.</b><p>\n\nThe language requirements of philosophy PhD programs have loosened over the years, but French, German, Latin, and Greek still form the core language requirements in departments that have language requirements.  Students therefore continue to receive the message that these languages are the most important ones for philosophers to know.<p>\n<b>I examined the language requirements of a sample of PhD programs in the United States.</b>  Because of their sociological importance in the discipline, I started with the top twelve ranked programs in the <a href=\"http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/\">Philosophical Gourmet Report</a>.  I then expanded the sample by considering a group of strong PhD programs that are not as sociologically central to the discipline \u2013 the programs ranked 40-50 in the U.S.<p>\n\nAmong the top twelve programs (corrections welcome):<p>\n\n* Four appeared to have no foreign language requirement (Michigan, NYU, Rutgers, Stanford).<p>\n\n* Seven (Berkeley, Columbia, Harvard, Pitt, UCLA, USC, Yale) had some version of a language requirement, requiring one of French, German, Greek or Latin -- always exactly that list. Some programs explicitly allowed another language and/or another relevant research skill by petition or consultation.<p>\n\n* <b>Only Princeton had a language requirement that did not appear to privilege French, German, Greek, and Latin.</b>  Princeton only requires a language \u201crelevant to the student\u2019s proposed course of study\u201d (or alternatively \u201ca unit of advanced work in another department\u201d or \u201ccompletion of an additional unit of work in any area of philosophy\u201d).<p>\n\nYou might think that, practically speaking, Arabic or classical Chinese would be a fine language to choose.  Students can always petition; maybe such petitions are almost always granted.  This response, however, ignores the fact that something is communicated by other languages\u2019 non-inclusion on the privileged list.  For a tendentious comparison \u2013 maybe too tendentious! \u2013 consider an admissions form that said \u201cwe admit men, but also women by petition\u201d.  One thing is treated as a norm and the other as an exception.<p>\n\nInterestingly, <b>the PhD programs ranked less highly by the Philosophical Gourmet had more relaxed language requirements overall.</b>  In the 40-50 group, only two of the eleven mentioned a language requirement or list of languages.  <b>Still, the privileged languages were from the same set</b>: \u201cFrench, German, or other\u201d at Saint Louis University, and optional certification in French, German, Greek, or Latin at Rochester.<p>\n\nI do not believe that we should be sending students the message that French, German, Greek, and Latin are more important than other languages in which there is a body of interesting philosophical work.  It is too Eurocentric a vision of the history of philosophy.  Let\u2019s change this.<p>\n\n------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Related Op-Eds:</i><p>\n<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0913-schwitzgebel-chinese-philosophy-20150913-story.html\">What\u2019s missing in college philosophy classes?

They survey is anonymous and the data will be shared.</blockquote><p>\n\nSurvey <a href=\"http://z.umn.edu/PhilosophySurvey\">here</a>.<p>\n\nThis is an important topic, and the results might have some impact on APA policy and general perceptions of the field.  It takes about 15 minutes to complete.  I would encourage readers to complete it, regardless of their degree of formal connection with the field.  In fact, <b>I would <i>especially </i>encourage non-philosophers to express their perceptions of the field</b>, since I expect non-philosophers will not be well represented among survey respondents, and it would be valuable for the APA to get a sense of their views about what is important in philosophy.  (At the end of the survey there are demographic questions so that the responses of people with different degrees of philosophical training can be distinguished.)\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/08/survey-on-what-is-important-in.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-08-02T12:18:00-07:00\">12:18 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6805759798695082068\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/announcements\" rel=\"tag\">announcements</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, July 28, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3673552146699480325\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-ethics-of-gauging-interest-of-phd.html\">The Ethics of Gauging the Interest of PhD Applicants Before Offering Admission or Financial Support</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Here's one way philosophy PhD admissions could go: Your program offers admissions to the N top-rated applicants, figuring that X% will accept.  If the acceptance rate looks like it will be unexpectedly low, then you expand admissions to the N+M top-rated applicants.  Financial support packages could be done in a similarly neat way.<p>\n \nOften, things aren't quite that neat.<p>\n \nOne way that they can be less than neat involves a department's <b>gauging the interest of an applicant before offering admission or financial support</b>.  Here's an experience I had as an applicant in the 1990s: A professor called me from one of the schools to which I'd been admitted, and he told me that they had only a few \"top tier\" financial support packages to offer to prospective graduate students.  He said they would be happy to offer me one of those packages if I was likely to come, but they didn't want to waste it on me if I was likely to go somewhere else.  I told him I hadn't ruled out his school yet, but that I had a greater level of initial interest in a couple of other schools.  I did not receive that financial support package and decided not the visit the school.<p>\n \nThat was a fine outcome for me.  I'd kind of thought of the school as a \"safety\" school anyway.  The professor correctly guessed that my application was strong enough that I'd been admitted to higher prestige programs than his.  It would have been unusual for an applicant in my position to choose his school over those others.<p>\n \nAlthough that was a couple of decades ago, I think the practice isn't unusual.  Recently the APA's <a href=\"http://www.apaonline.org/group/statusandfuture\">Committee on the Status and Future of the Profession</a>, of which I am a member, discussed an email from a former PhD applicant suggesting that the APA adopt a policy against departments' contacting applicants to gauge their level of interest before making offers. Apparently she had been contacted by the Director of Graduate Studies at a department to which she had applied but to which she hadn't yet been admitted.  Her sense of the conversation was that <b>the DGS was prepared to offer the student admission if the student committed in advance to accepting the offer</b>.  She felt that this constituted illegitimate pressure to decide about a school before the conventional April 15 deadline.<p>\n\nIn general, it seems to be in the interest of the profession if applicants can see the full range of offers and then choose the offer that fits their interests best rather than being pressured into accepting early offers out of fear, possibly at schools that are relatively poor matches for them.  (Here's <a href=\"http://www.apaonline.org/?aid_offers\">the official APA statement on the April 15th deadline</a> for accepting graduate student aid offers.)<p>\n \nI, and some other members of the Status and Future Committee, are interested in others' thoughts about this issue.  The APA might be willing consider clarifying or revising the APA's April 15 deadline policy, if that seems desirable.<p>\n \nThe official wording of the APA policy is that \"Students are under <b>no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15</b>\".  Situations of the sort described above don't appear to violate the letter of this policy, since support has not been formally offered.  However, it could be argued that informal conditional offers violate the spirit.<p>\n \nOn the other hand, we might use hiring as a model, and it's <b>common in both academic and non-academic hiring for the hiring department to gauge applicant interest</b> before making an offer.  Also, practically speaking, some departments have \"hard caps\" on enrollment or funding so that they cannot make more than N offers for N slots.  <b>Departments with hard caps will be in a difficult situation if several candidates who are unlikely to accept wait until April 15</b> to decide.  Other departments, even with softer caps, still might not be able to rely on higher-level administration to return the slots to them if applicants decline.  Departments in either of these positions might understandably want to reserve some of their primary offers or waiting-list offers for applicants they think are likely to accept; and part of this process might involve informally asking applicants about their about likelihood of accepting an offer if one were to be made.<p>\n\nDiscussion welcomed below.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2016/07/27/the-ethics-of-gauging-phd-applicants-interest-before-offering-admission-or-financial-support/\">cross-posted at the Blog of the APA</a>]\n </p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-ethics-of-gauging-interest-of-phd.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-07-28T16:36:00-07:00\">4:36 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3673552146699480325\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, March 23, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4944775466142159094\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/03/my-workday-as-philosophy-professor.html\">My Workday as a Philosophy Professor</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[cross-posted from The Philosophers' Cocoon, \"<a href=\"http://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2016/03/real-jobs-in-philosophy-part-3-eric-schwitzgebel-uc-riverside.html\">Real Philosophy Jobs Part 3</a>\"]<p>\n\nHow hard does the typical tenured professor work, and on what?  Good information is hard to come by.  I will describe my own workload and typical workday, as one data point.<p>\n\nI am a full professor of philosophy, with a six-digit salary and tenure at UC Riverside, whose philosophy PhD program is ranked 28th in the US by the Philosophical Gourmet.  Our normal teaching load is four 10-week courses (plus final exams) spread over three \u201cquarters\u201d (hence 1-2-1), plus independent supervision of graduate students.<p>\n\nUnlike most of my colleagues, I try to work regular workdays \u2013 about 8:00 to 5:30 Monday to Friday, with evenings and weekends reserved for home life (below, I\u2019ll add some caveats to that).  I also try to have relatively normal holidays: the official US holidays, a couple weeks for family vacation during the summer, about a week over winter break, and a smattering of other days off.<p>\n<b>My typical day:<p></p></b>\n<b>Email:<p></p></b>\n\nEmail is a major part of the job.  After arriving at the office around 8:00, I\u2019ll usually spend my first hour reading and answering email.  I\u2019ll also check and answer email through the rest of the day.  The distinction between \u201canswering email\u201d and \u201cdoing tasks that were precipitated by receiving an email\u201d is vague, but I\u2019d estimate that I spend about two hours a day reading and answering emails.  Last week I received 359 email messages, almost none of which were junk mail from corporations.  (I use a separate email account for that.)  Approximately one half were group emails that I could skim or ignore.  The other half I had to actually read.  About half of those, I replied to.  I of course also send emails that are not simply replies.  Last week, I sent 107 email messages.  That\u2019s an average of 36 substantive incoming and 21 outgoing messages per weekday.  If I spend one minute per message, that\u2019s already an hour a day right there.  Of course some messages require less time, others substantially more.<p>\n\nHere\u2019s a Monday morning sample, which includes Friday evening through 10:00 a.m. Monday: a few emails discussing dinner plans after a talk at the APA; two submitted blog comments which I approved (including one where I followed a link to an interesting article that I\u2019d already read); an email from a potential coauthor about an op-ed piece we\u2019re considering writing together; A-V information about an upcoming talk; three emails in a four-way philosophical discussion about Asian philosophy and oneness; an undergraduate request for me to write a letter of recommendation, which I replied to with substantial advice; a reminder about some written interview questions that I got last week and haven\u2019t yet managed to answer; a question from another philosopher about my data collection methods from a recent paper; an email trying to coordinate a meeting with a colleague at the coming APA; two requests to referee articles for journals (one accepted, one declined); three emails of thanks for reference letters I wrote last week; an email confirming that my request for $10,000 to organize a mini-conference has been approved, precipitating a message to my collaborator about next steps; a link to a recently published article citing one of my articles, interesting enough that I read the abstract, downloaded, and quickly skimmed for possible later reading; two emails from my wife with info about getting my son organized for applying to colleges next year; a couple emails about arranging the hotels for my trip to Hong Kong in May; an email from a speaker I\u2019ve invited to talk at UCR next year who is unsure whether he\u2019ll be able to fit it into his schedule; and two emails concerning getting the overhead lights in my office fixed.  That gives you the flavor, I think!<p>\n<b>\nClassroom teaching:<p></p></b>\n \nMost of my undergraduate classes are already prepped from previous years.  I\u2019ll spend about 60-90 minutes refreshing myself on the material and reviewing and tweaking my overheads.  (If it\u2019s material I haven\u2019t taught before, it takes several hours.)  Then I\u2019ll spend 50 minutes on a lecture stage in front of hundreds of students (for a lower-division class), 80 minutes in lecture-and-informal discussion with about 30 students (for an upper-division class), or three hours in focused discussion with about 8 students (for a grad seminar).<p>\n\nTeaching the giant lecture classes is stressful, but also a thrill when it goes well.  When I switched from the ordinary \u201cIntroduction to Philosophy\u201d material to material that more students cared about, with real emotional resonance \u2013 lynching, the Holocaust, sex and death, the role of cognition and emotion in moral development, starvation amid wealth \u2013 I found my passion for the lower division teaching.   One time, the two hundred students were so still in the lecture hall that the motion sensors decided the classroom was empty and the lights turned themselves off.  Whoa.  When I can bring that intensity to students on topics like these, that feels meaningful and worthwhile.<p>\n\nIn upper-division courses and grad seminars, I rely on more from the students.  Classes become a mix of semi-structured mini-lectures, freewheeling tangents, and informal debate among students.  UCR students are strong enough that their discussions are reliably interesting as long as I can do two things: (a.) draw out the best in students\u2019 sometimes half-baked ideas, and (b.) succeed in expanding the conversation away from just the most assertive talkers.<p>\n<b>\nResearch:<p></p></b>\n\nOn days when I\u2019m not teaching, probably about half of my time is research.  On teaching days, research is sometimes squeezed out altogether.  Research is mostly reading and writing, but I also (unusually for a philosopher) also do some experimental work and data analysis.<p>\n<i>Reading.</i>  I don\u2019t read many books cover to cover.  I read a mix of happenstance material and targeted material.  The happenstance will be recent articles from journal tables of contents, articles or books or book chapters that people have mentioned or emailed to me as possibly of interest (including their own work), work that cites my own, and other work that catches my eye for whatever reason.  The targeted material will be current or classic or historical work that is relevant to an article or blog post that I am currently writing or thinking about.  For example, for my recent paper on rationalization with Jon Ellis, I read through bunches of relevant psychological literature, some fun classic work from the history of psychology, a whole bunch of Habermas (which I ended up only barely citing but seemed worth knowing anyway), relevant work by philosophers on rationalization and on self-knowledge, and various tangentially related material.<p>\n<i>Writing: Blog.</i>  I have an active blog, The Splintered Mind, where I try to post at least once a week, usually about 500-1000 words with a fresh idea about something I\u2019ve been working on recently.  Typically this takes me a few hours, plus maybe another hour replying to comments on the blog or on social media sites where I\u2019ve linked to the blog.  I find it good discipline to get my ideas out there in some sort of comprehensible shape on a regular basis, and to get some feedback about them.  I usually try not to spend more than five hours blogging per week.<p>\n<i>Writing: Articles.</i>  I am always bursting with writing ideas \u2013 far more stuff than I can actually write up.  (The blog is a good vent for ideas that won\u2019t make it into articles.)  A first draft will normally take me about an hour a page.  Most of my non-empirical articles go through one to five top-to-bottom rewrites from beginning to end, plus multiple smaller-scale revisions and rereadings.  For me, a typical full-length published article reflects about 100-200 hours of writing and revising.  I try to write always for two audiences simultaneously: the fast skimming reader who just wants the big picture and the careful nitpicking reader who is looking to critique me on details.  I care about prose style.  I care about trying to draw the reader in, about revealing the importance of the issues, about being fun and accessible rather than dry and technical, to the extent that\u2019s compatible with rigorously covering the issues.  I love the craft of writing.<p>\n<i>Writing: Other.</i>  I\u2019ve also recently started writing science fiction and op-eds.  Because why not?  These can, of course, take a lot of time, and it\u2019s a challenge to acquire the relevant skills.  (I rather enjoy the challenge.)  It helps that I\u2019ve recently been getting grant money for teaching release, so that I don\u2019t have to compromise my other research to do these things.<p>\n\nOne of the things I love about this job, especially now that I\u2019m tenured, is the enormous freedom I have to read and write whatever I feel like reading and writing, at whatever pace and schedule I feel like doing so.  Especially during the summer, my office is a playground for my mind.  Of course, it\u2019s not always like that \u2013 when I commit to particular writing projects with deadlines and/or co-authors, I have to prioritize them on a schedule I might not prefer, and there are the frequent scheduled demands of teaching and meetings that can feel like they get in the way of my passionate desire to think and read and write, and of course there\u2019s always the stack of email which if I ignore for even one day becomes quite daunting by the next.<p>\n<b>Other Stuff:<p></p></b>\n<i>Meetings.</i>  During the term, I probably average about 1-2 hours in meetings per day.  This includes university committee meetings, faculty meetings, departmental talks and receptions, graduate student oral exams, open-door office hours, and one-on-one meetings in person or by phone or Skype with students, collaborators, and colleagues.<p>\n<i>Grading.</i>  Grading undergraduate exams and essays is a pretty tough slog, and probably my least favorite part of the job \u2013 though those occasional \u201cA\u201d papers are like lights in the mist.  When I\u2019m teaching upper-division without TAs, this will be several hours a week several weeks of the term.  Evaluating graduate student essays and dissertations is not as grueling, but is still quite a bit of work \u2013 in combination amounting to hundreds of comments over hundreds of pages.<p>\n<i>Miscellaneous Tasks.</i>  These typically come via email \u2013 things I can\u2019t just respond to with a quick email in reply.  They include: writing letters of recommendation; writing referee reports on articles submitted to journals; organizing events; organizing travel and financial matters (including applying for and managing grants); dealing with students with special issues; keeping up to some extent with what\u2019s going on in the philosophical corners of social media and the popular press; evaluating research proposals as part of a committee or review board or as an outside evaluator; planning new courses or course material; evaluating graduate admissions applications if I\u2019m on the admissions committee or job applications if I\u2019m on a hiring committee; evaluating the promotion and merit files of my colleagues; completing well-intentioned administrative forms; and other such \u2013 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve forgotten some.<p>\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t conceptualize this \u201cother stuff\u201d as research, most of it does expose me, in one way or another, to work going on in the field.<p>\n\nI\u2019ll take about 15 minutes for lunch (walk to the student cafeteria then walk back, often eating en route) and maybe another 30 minutes over the day for non-philosophy stuff like internet news, humor items, non-philosophy social media, and family-related things.<p>\n<b>When I\u2019m Not in the Office:<p></p></b>\n<i>Morning walks.</i>  I walk an hour every morning \u2013 often my favorite part of the day.  I\u2019ll let my mind drift.  Maybe a third of the time I\u2019m drifting off into philosophical thoughts, things I\u2019d like to write or revise, blog post ideas, project plans, etc.  Sometimes I\u2019ll listen to a podcast or a text-to-speech article (philosophy, science fiction, or otherwise), or I\u2019ll look a bit at social media.  When I\u2019ve slept well and in a good mood, I\u2019m just bursting with enthusiasm and fun ideas \u2013 sometimes ideas that seem a bit too silly in my more sober moods later.<p>\n<i>\nEvenings and weekends. </i> Evenings and weekends, I prioritize family.  I\u2019ll check social media a bit, sometimes reading or commenting on philosophical things, but always in a light way \u2013 never in a concentrated-this-feels-like-work way.  I won\u2019t check email, except maybe to scan headers if I think there might be something urgent.  I always read before going to sleep \u2013 about half an hour, often something related to philosophy but which doesn\u2019t feel workish, such as a popular book of history or psychology or some speculative science fiction.<p>\n<i>Travel.</i>  I have a deal with my family: four out-of-town trips per year, one of which is overseas.  The overseas trip will usually be about two weeks, and I\u2019ll try to string together a bunch of talks at different places, in quick succession.  The other three will normally be 2-4 nights, and I\u2019ll try to string together two or three talks in nearby places if it can be arranged.<p>\n<b>So How Much Do I Work and on What?<p></p></b>\n\nIf we figure that the travel approximately cancels out the arbitrary days I take off, that leaves me with about 49 weeks per year, at about (9:30 minus 0:45) x 5 = 43.75 hours per week, plus some hard-to-count off-the-clock stuff like light reading at night and philosophical thinking during my morning walks.  Maybe about 40% my work time is reading and writing with research ends in mind, about 25% of it teaching related, and 35% everything else.<p>\n\nBut all this task-and-hour-counting omits something essential: the extent to which my work has shaped my sense of who I am and what I value.  I could not simply cut it away.  As my children will attest, I am a philosopher even in my light-hearted play with them.  I have become what my work has made me.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/03/my-workday-as-philosophy-professor.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-03-23T09:48:00-07:00\">9:48 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4944775466142159094\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Sunday, July 19, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2537804536828049138\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/philosophy-via-facebook-why-not.html\">Philosophy Via Facebook?

Hiring, tenure, promotion and prestige depend mainly on one's ability to produce journal articles in a particular theoretical, abstract style, mostly in reaction to a small group of canonical and 20th century figures, for a small readership of specialists. We should broaden our vision.<p>\n\nConsider the historical contingency of the journal article, a late-19th century invention. Even as recently as the middle of the 20th century, leading philosophers in Western Europe and North America did important work in a much broader range of genres: the fictions and difficult-to-classify reflections of Sartre, Camus and Unamuno; Wittgenstein's cryptic fragments; the peace activism and popular writings of Bertrand Russell; John Dewey's work on educational reform.<p>\n\nPopular essays, fictions, aphorisms, dialogues, autobiographical reflections and personal letters have historically played a central role in philosophy. So also have public acts of direct confrontation with the structures of one's society: Socrates' trial and acceptance of the hemlock; Confucius' inspiring personal correctness.<p>\n\nIt was really only with the generation hired to teach the baby boomers in the 1960s and '70s that academic philosophers' conception of philosophical work became narrowly focused on the technical journal article.<p>\n\ncontinued <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0719-schwitzgebel-philosophy-articles-20150717-story.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/philosophy-via-facebook-why-not.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-07-19T10:45:00-07:00\">10:45 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2537804536828049138\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, February 25, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7333552212746866849\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/depressive-thinking-styles-and.html\">Depressive Thinking Styles and Philosophy</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Recently I read two interesting pieces that I'd like to connect with each other.  One is Peter Railton's <a href=\"http://leiterreports.typepad.com/files/dewey-lecture-drs.pdf\">Dewey Lecture</a> to the American Philosophical Association, in which he describes his history of depression.  The other is Oliver Sacks's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/oliver-sacks-on-learning-he-has-terminal-cancer.html\">New York Times column</a> about facing his own imminent death.<p>\n\nOne of the inspiring things about Sacks's work is that he shows how people with (usually neurological) disabilities can lead productive, interesting, happy lives incorporating their disabilities and often even turning aspects of those disabilities into assets.  (In his recent column, Sacks relates how imminent death has helped give him focus and perspective.)  It has also always struck me that depression -- not only major, clinical depression but perhaps even more so subclinical depressive thinking styles -- is common among philosophers.  (For an informal poll, see <a href=\"http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2015/02/mental-illness-in-academic-philosophy.html\">Leiter's latest</a>.)  I wonder if this prevalence of depression among philosophers is non-accidental.  <b>I wonder whether perhaps the thinking styles characteristic of mild depression can become, Sacks-style, an asset for one's work as a philosopher.</b><p>\n\nHere's the thought (suggested to me first by <a href=\"http://philosophy.ucr.edu/john-m-fischer/\">John Fischer</a>): Among the non-depressed, there's a tendency toward glib self-confidence in one's theoretical views.  (On positive illusions in general among the non-depressed see <a href=\"http://humancond.org/_media/papers/taylor_brown_88_illusion_and_well_being.pdf\">this classic article</a>.)  Normally, conscious human reasoning works like this: First, you find yourself intuitively drawn to Position A.  Second, you rummage around for some seemingly good argument or consideration in favor of Position A.  Finally, you relax into the comfortable feeling that you've got it figured out.  No need to think more about it!  (See <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/\">Kahneman</a>, <a href=\"http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/\">Haidt</a>, etc.)<p>\n\nDepressive thinking styles are, perhaps, the opposite of this blithe and easy self-confidence. <b> People with mild depression will tend, I suspect, to be less easily satisfied with their first thought,</b> at least on matters of importance to them.  Before taking a public stand, they might spend more time <b>imagining critics attacking Position A, and how they might respond</b>.  Inclined toward self-doubt, they might be <b>more likely to check and recheck</b> their arguments with anxious care, <b>more carefully weigh up the pros and cons</b>, worry that their initial impressions are off-base or too simple, discard the less-than-perfect, <b>worry that there are important objections that they haven't yet considered</b>.  Although one needn't be inclined toward depression to reflect in this manner, I suspect that this self-doubting style will tend to come more naturally to those with mild to moderate depressive tendencies, deepening their thought about the topic at hand.<p>\n<b>I don't want to downplay the seriousness of depression, its often negative consequences for one's life including often for one's academic career, and the counterproductive nature of repetitive dysphoric rumination (see <a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/snhlab/Health%20Consequences_files/Nolen-Hoeksema,%202000b.pdf\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://drsonja.net/wp-content/themes/drsonja/papers/LKZ2003.pdf\">here</a>), which is probably a different cognitive process</b> than the kind of self-critical reflection that I'm hypothesizing here to be its correlate and cousin.  [Update, Feb. 26: I want to emphasize the qualifications of that previous sentence.  I am <i>not</i> endorsing the counterproductive thinking styles of severe, acute depression.  See also Dirk Koppelberg's comment below and my reply.]  However, I do suspect that mildly depressive thinking styles can be recruited toward philosophical goals and, if managed correctly, can fit into, and even benefit, one's philosophical work.  <b>And among academic disciplines, philosophy in particular might be well-suited for people who tend toward this style of thought,</b> since philosophy seems to be proportionately less demanding than many other disciplines in tasks that benefit from confident, high-energy extraversion (such as laboratory management and people skills) and proportionately more demanding of careful consideration of the pros and cons of complex, abstract arguments and of precise ways of formulating positions to shield them from critique.<p>\n\nRelated posts:</p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2006/07/depression-and-philosophy.html\">Depression and Philosophy</a> (July 28, 2006)\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/08/sep-citation-analysis-continued-jewish.html\">SEP Citation Analysis Continued: Jewish, Non-Anglophone, Queer, and Disabled Philosophers</a> (August 14, 2014)<p>\n<i>Update April 23:</i><p>\nThe <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DeathSelfZZ.htm\">full-length circulating draft</a> is now up on my academic website.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/depressive-thinking-styles-and.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-02-25T10:51:00-08:00\">10:51 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7333552212746866849\" onclick=\"\">61\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">psychology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, January 07, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6589484992776502736\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/psychology-research-in-age-of-social.html\">Psychology Research in the Age of Social Media</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Popular summaries of fun psychology articles regularly float to the top of my Facebook feed.  I was particularly struck by this fact on Monday when these two links popped up:\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/274046/what-wealth-does-to-your-soul\n\">What Wealth Does to Your Soul</a> (The Week)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/opinion/why-are-some-cultures-more-individualistic-than-others.html\">Wheat People vs. Rice People</a> (New York Times)</li></ul>\n\nThe links were striking to me because both of the articles reported studies that I regarded as methodologically rather weak, though interesting and fun.  It occurred to me to wonder whether <b>social media might be seriously aggravating the perennial plague of sexy but dubious psychological research</b>.<p>\n\nBelow, I will present some dubious data on this very issue!<p>\n\nBut first, why think these two studies are methodologically dubious?  [Skip the next two paragraphs if you like.]<p>\n<i>The first article</i>, on whether the rich are jerks, is based largely on a study I critiqued <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/03/on-whether-rich-are-jerks.html\">here</a>.  Among that study's methodological oddities: The researchers set up a jar of candy in their lab, ostensibly for children in another laboratory, and then measured whether wealthy participants took more candy from the jar than less-wealthy participants.  Cute!  Clever!  But here's the weird thing.  <b>Despite the fact that the jar was in their own lab, they measured candy-stealing by <em>asking</em> participants whether they had taken candy rather than by directly observing how much candy was taken.</b>  What could possibly justify this methodological decision, which puts the researchers at a needless remove from the behavior being measured and conflates honesty with theft?  The linked news article also mentions a study suggesting that expensive cars are more likely to be double-parked.  Therefore, see, the rich really are jerks!  Of course, another possibility is that the wealthy are just more willing to risk the cost of a parking ticket.<p>\n<i>The second article</i> highlights a study that examines a few recently-popular measures of \"individualistic\" vs. \"collectivistic\" thinking, such as the \"triad\" task (e.g., whether the participant pairs trains with buses [because of their category membership, supposedly individualistic] or with tracks [because of their functional relation, supposedly collectivistic] when given the three and asked to group two together).  According to the study, the northern Chinese, from wheat-farming regions, are more likely to score as individualistic than are the southern Chinese, from rice-farming regions.  A clever theory is advanced: wheat farming is individualistic, rice farming communal!  (I admit, this is a cool theory.)  How do we know <i>that difference </i>is the source of the different performance on the cognitive tasks?  Well, two alternative hypotheses are tested and found to be less predictive of \"individualistic\" performance: pathogen prevalence and regional GDP per capita.  Now, the wheat vs. rice difference is almost a perfect north-south split.  <b>Other things also differ between northern and southern China -- other aspects of cultural history, even the spoken language.</b>  So although the data fit nicely with the wheat-rice theory, many other possible explanations of the data remain unexplored.  A natural starting place might be to look at rice vs. wheat regions in other countries to see if they show the same pattern.  At best, the conclusion is premature.<p>\n\nI see the appeal of this type of work: It's fun to think that the rich are jerks, or that there are major social and cognitive differences between people based on the agricultural methods of their ancestors.  Maybe, even, the theories are true.  But it's a problem if the process by which these kinds of studies trickle into social media has much more do to with how fun the results are than with the quality of the work.  <b>I suspect the problem is especially serious if academic researchers who are not specialists in the area take the reports at face value, and if these reports then become a major part of their background sense of what psychological research has recently revealed.</b><p>\n\nHypothetically, suppose a researcher measured whether poor people are jerks by judging whether people in more or less expensive clothing were more or less likely to walk into a fast-food restaurant with a used cup and steal soda.  This would not survive peer review, and if it did get published, objections would be swift and angry.  It wouldn't propagate through Facebook, except perhaps as the butt of critical comments.  It's methodologically similar, but the social filters would be against it.  I conjecture that we should expect to find studies arguing that the rich are morally worse, or finding no difference between rich and poor, but not studies arguing that the poor are morally worse (though they might be found to have more criminal convictions or other \"bad outcomes\").  (For evidence of such a filtering effect on studies of the relationship between religion and morality, see <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/meta-analysis-of-effect-of-religion-on.html\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nNow I suspect that in the bad old days before Facebook and Twitter, popular media reports about psychology had less influence on philosophers' and psychologists' thinking about areas outside their speciality than they do now.  I don't know how to prove this, but I thought it would be interesting to look at the usage statistics on the 25 <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/reports/most-read\">most-downloaded <i>Psychological Science</i> articles</a> in December 2014 (excluding seven brief articles without links to their summary abstracts).<p>\n\nThe article with the most views of its abstracted summary was <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract\">The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand over Laptop Note Taking</a>.  Fun!  Useful!  The article had 22,389 abstract views in December, 2014.  It also had 1,320 full text or PDF downloads.  <b>Thus, it looks like at most 6% of the abstract viewers bothered to glance at the methodology. </b> (I say \"at most\" because some viewers might go straight through to the full text without viewing the abstract separately.  See below for evidence that this happens with other articles.)  Thirty-seven news outlets picked up the article, according to <i>Psychological Science</i>, tied for highest with <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/07/15/0956797614534694.abstract\">Sleep Deprivation and False Memories</a>, which had 4,786 abstract views and 645 full text or PDF downloads (at most 13% clicking through).<p>\n\nContrast these articles with the \"boring\" articles (not boring to specialists!).  The single most downloaded article was <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/11/07/0956797613504966\">The New Statistics: Why and How</a>: 1,870 abstract views, 4,717 full-text and PDF views -- more than twice as many full views as abstract views.  <i>Psychological Science </i>reports no media outlets picking this one up.  I guess people interested in statistical methods want to see the details of the articles about statistical methods.  One other article had more full views than abstract views: the ponderously titled <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/03/16/0956797611400615\">Retraining Automatic Action Tendencies Changes Alcoholic Patients\u2019 Approach Bias for Alcohol and Improves Treatment Outcome</a>: 164 abstract views and 274 full views (67% more full views than abstract views).  That article was only picked up by one media outlet.  Overall, I found a r = -.49 (p = .01) correlation between the number of news-media pickups and the log of the ratio of full-text views to abstract views.<p>\n\nI suppose it's not surprising that articles picked up by the media attract more casual readers who will view the abstract only.  I have no way of knowing that many of these readers are fellow academics in philosophy, psychology, and the other humanities and social sciences.  But <i>if</i> so, and <b>if my hypothesis is correct that academic researchers are increasingly exposed to psychological research based on Tweetability rather than methodological quality, that's bad news for the humanities and social sciences.  Even if the rich really are jerks.</b></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/psychology-research-in-age-of-social.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-01-07T12:31:00-08:00\">12:31 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6589484992776502736\" onclick=\"\">12\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods\" rel=\"tag\">psychological methods</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, October 29, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"638387740620562453\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/10/why-i-will-be-contributing-rankings-to.html\">Why I Will Be Contributing Rankings to the Gourmet Report</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I have been asked to be an evaluator for the 2014-2015 edition of the <a href=\"http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/\">Philosophical Gourmet Report</a>.  Contrary to what seems to be a widespread sentiment in the philosophical blogosphere, I support the rankings and will participate.<p>\n\nThe PGR rankings have at least three related downsides:<p>\n1. They <strong>perpetuate privilege</strong>, including the privilege of people with social power in the discipline, the privilege of people in PhD-granting institutions over other types of institutions, and the general privilege of Anglophone philosophy and philosophers.</p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n2. They <strong>reinforce mainstream (\"<a href=\"http://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2014/07/philosophy-rankings-experts-and-markets-part-i.html\">Gourmet ecology</a>\") valuations</strong> of topics and approaches, in a discipline where the mainstream needs no help and it would probably be productive to push against the mainstream.\n3. They <strong>risk blurring the distinction between second-hand impressions about reputation</strong> (especially outside evaluators' own subareas) <strong>and genuine quality</strong>.<p>\n\nIn light of these downsides, I understand people's hesitation to support the enterprise.<p>\n\nI view the rankings as an exercise in the <strong>sociology of philosophy</strong>.  The rankings are valuable insofar as they reveal sociological facts about how departments, and to some extent individuals (especially in the specialty rankings) are viewed by the social elite in Anglophone philosophy -- by the people who publish articles in journals like <em><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1468-0068\">Nous</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://philreview.dukejournals.org/\">Philosophical Review</a></em>, by the people who write and are written about in <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/\"><em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em></a> entries, by the people who teach at renowned British and U.S. universities like Oxford, Harvard, and Berkeley.  As a part-time <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\">sociologist of philosophy</a> interested in patterns of esteem, I am curious how people in this social group view the field, and I regard the PGR as an important source of data.<p>\n\nThe PGR is thus valuable in part because <strong>sociological and historical knowledge about academia in general is valuable</strong>.  It is sociologically interesting, and of historical interest, to know what sort of esteem Australian universities have in mainstream Anglophone philosophy.  It is sociologically interesting, and of historical interest, to see the shifting patterns of social power among Ivy League universities and large public U.S. universities that are able to hire renowned professors.<p>\n<strong>The PGR is also practically valuable because knowledge of the centers of social power is practically valuable</strong>.  To the extent a student wishes to tap into the centers of social power to increase her likelihood of finding a research-oriented job, she should know where those centers of power are; and students and their advisors who are not currently near centers of power might not find it at all obvious where those centers are.  <strong>By empowering outsiders with knowledge</strong> -- especially the knowledge that renowned universities like Harvard, Oxford, and Yale might not be the best universities in their subfield -- <strong>the PGR to some extent works against the perpetuation of privilege</strong>, despite the fact that it reinforces privilege in other ways.  Also, to the extent one wishes to fight against mainstream perceptions of the discipline, it is of interest to track what those perceptions are and how they are changing over time -- though if this were one's primary motivation, one would probably oppose the PGR.  Finally, to the extent one respects the judgment of philosophers in the Anglophone philosophy mainstream, one might infer differences in real quality from differences in reputation.<p>\n\nOn the last point: If you think that Anglophone philosophy mainstream judgment is grossly erroneous in general, you might reasonably infer that the PGR does more harm than good; but I don't hold that view myself.  In philosophy of mind, for example -- my own specialty -- I think that the best-regarded philosophers tend in fact to be excellent philosophers who deserve their good reputations.<p>\n<strong>One area in which I think mainstream philosophical judgment is ill-tuned is in its disregard of non-Western traditions.  However, I believe that the PGR has the potential to be progressive on this issue.</strong>  For example, in treating Chinese philosophy as an area worth special remark, despite the small number of PhD-granting philosophy departments in Anglophone countries who have specialists in the area, it gives the subarea more visibility than it otherwise would have.  And were there sufficient hiring in other non-Western traditions, I suspect the PGR would adapt to reflect that.<p>\n\nDespite my support of the PGR rankings, I think it is important that the rankings be viewed critically, as a rough tool for revealing certain sociological patterns in the discipline.  I would very much like to see other approaches to evaluation, which would help put the PGR rankings in context as only <em>one</em> way to think about the social structures that drive academic philosophy.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.newappsblog.com/2014/10/why-i-will-be-contributing-rankings-to-the-gourmet-report.html\">Cross-posted</a> at <a href=\"http://www.newappsblog.com/\">New APPS</a>.]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/10/why-i-will-be-contributing-rankings-to.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2014-10-29T09:18:00-07:00\">9:18 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=638387740620562453\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, September 17, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1180847894779618018\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-macarthur-drought-in-philosophy.html\">The MacArthur Drought in Philosophy</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><p>See <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/fellows/search/?area=philosophy\" target=\"_self\">here</a>. \u00a0The last MacArthur \"genius\" fellowship awarded to someone they classified as philosopher was in 1993.</p>\n<p>On the whole, scholars outside of philosophy tend, I think, not to see much value in what most professional philosophers do. \u00a0The MacArthur drought is one reflection and measure of that.</p>\n<p>Not that prizes matter. \u00a0Sheesh. \u00a0We're too busy thinking about important stuff like <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/XWorld.htm\" target=\"_self\">whether the external world exists</a>\u00a0(82% of <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl\" target=\"_self\">target faculty</a> agree that it does). \u00a0The MacArthur folks probably think that <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/fellows/910/\" target=\"_self\">climate change</a>\u00a0is a more important topic. \u00a0But if the external world doesn't exist then the climate <em>can't</em> change, can it now?

Issued as the campus approaches the 50th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement, Chancellor Dirks' statement, with its evocation of civility, echoes language recently used by the Chancellor of the University of Illinois, Urbana and the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (especially its Chair Christopher Kennedy) concerning the refused appointment of Steven Salaita. It also mirrors language in the effort by the University of Kansas Board of Regents to regulate social media speech and the Penn State administration's new statement on civility. Although each of these administrative statements have responded to specific local events, the repetitive invocation of \"civil\" and \"civility\" to set limits to acceptable speech bespeaks a broader and deeper challenge to intellectual freedom on college and university campuses.<p>\n\nCUCFA Board has been gravely concerned about the rise of this discourse on civility in the past few months, but we never expected it to come from the Chancellor of UC Berkeley, the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement. To define \u201cfree speech and civility\u201d as \u201ctwo sides of the same coin,\u201d and to distinguish between \u201cfree speech and political advocacy\u201d as Chancellor Dirk does in his text, not only turns things upside down, but it does so in keeping with a relentless erosion of shared governance in the UC system, and the systemic downgrading of faculty\u2019s rights and prerogatives. Chancellor Dirks errs when he conflates free speech and civility because, while civility and the exercise of free speech may coexist harmoniously, the right to free speech not only permits, but is designed to protect uncivil speech. Similarly, Chancellor Dirks is also wrong when he affirms that there exists a boundary between \u201cfree speech and political advocacy\u201d because political advocacy is the apotheosis of free speech, and there is no \u201cdemagoguery\u201d exception to the First Amendment.<p>\n\nBefore the slippery slope of civility discourse we remark that the right to free speech is not limited to allowing the act of speaking or engaging in communicative actions to express ideas publicly, nor is it contingent on the notion that anyone else needs to listen, agree, speak back, or \u201cfeel safe.\u201d The right to free speech is constituted through prohibitions on the infringement of speech by the state and other public institutions and officials. Moreover, while civility is an ideal\u2014and a good one\u2014free speech is a right. The right to free speech does not dissipate because it is exercised in un-ideal (un-civil) ways.<p>\n\nSecond, we underline that the right to freely speak on public and institutional issues is one of the three pillars of academic freedom. Academic freedom is a specific\u2014though not exclusive\u2014right of professors. The three pillars of academic freedom that extend to individual members of the professorate are: (1) the freedom to conduct and disseminate scholarly research; (2) the freedom to design courses and teach students in the areas of their expertise; and (3) the right to free speech as laid out in the 1940 Statement of Principles of Tenure and Academic Freedom which in this context prohibits the professional penalization of professors for extramural speech. Ensuing from academic freedom is the right and duty of faculty to decide, collaboratively and individually, standards and thresholds for teaching and research, without interference from administrators, alumni, or donors. Those determinations are based on standards of scholarly excellence and achievement, which manifest through hiring, academic publishing, and peer review processes in which an individual\u2019s academic record is judged by peers. Those who administer institutions of higher learning bear a responsibility for the protection of academic freedom, which includes free speech in the ways described here.<p>\n\nThe University of California bears an especial burden to respect these rights. For the rights of academic freedom and the 1st Amendment right to free speech cohere in a way peculiar to a public university. As a public university the University of California is called upon to affirm not only the guild rights of Academic Freedom but the more expansive rights of the 1st Amendment\u2014which after all, are possessed by students and staff as well as faculty.<p>\n\nOn the basis of all of the above, CUCFA Board deems necessary to release the following declaration and to ask its members, and all UC faculty to press their Senates to pass it as a resolution:\n<p>\n<i>Taking note of the concurrent rapid growth in non-academic administrative positions in most colleges and universities and the significant reductions in state/government funding for public universities during the last decade,<p>\n\nConcerned by numerous accounts across the United States of senior administrators, management, boards of trustees, regents and other non-academic bodies attempting to influence, supervise and in some cases over-rule academic hiring, tenure and promotion decisions, as well as policy and evaluatory decisions traditionally under the purview of Academic Senate and other faculty bodies,<p>\n\nConcerned further by the attempts of senior administrators in the UC system and at many universities across the United States to narrow the boundaries of academic freedom and permissible speech by faculty, students and other members of the university community, and, in particular by the inappropriate and misleading appeal to concepts like \u201ccivility\u201d and \u201ccollegiality,\u201d deceptively used to limit the \u201cright\u201d to free speech, and as criteria for hiring, tenure, promotion and even disciplinary procedures,<p>\n\nWe reaffirm,<p>\n\nThat all professional evaluations related to hiring, tenure, and promotions of either present or potential faculty are the sole purview of designated committees composed of faculty members, department chairs, and deans as peers and/or academic supervisors of anyone under review and/or evaluation, <p>\n\nThat senior campus and University/system-wide administrators, as well as Regents and other governing boards, or donors to the university and/or its foundation(s), do not have any right to interfere in these processes, and that final decisions on appointment and promotion must be based solely on information in the candidate's file that is related to established categories of teaching, research, and service and that has been added by established procedures of peer academic review. <p>\n\nThat we oppose any insinuation that civility, per se, be added either formally or informally as a valid category in the academic personnel process, as well as any attempt by external parties, including donors to the university, government officials, or other forces, to interfere in any personnel decisions, especially through the threat of withholding donations or investments should certain academic policies or personnel decisions be made.<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></i>\n\n------------------------------------<p>\n\n(CUCFA -- The Council of University of California Faculty Associations -- is a coordinating and service agency for the several individual Faculty Associations -- associations of UC Senate faculty -- on the separate campuses of the University of California, and it represents them to all state- or university-wide agencies on issues of common concern. It gathers and disseminates information on issues before the legislative and executive branches of California's government, other relevant state units dealing with higher education, the University administration, and the Board of Regents.)<p>\n\n------------------------------------<p>\n\nPersonal note: I [ES] think the final clause is too strongly put, if it's intended to express the view that civility should never be a factor in hiring decisions.  In my view, it's sometimes reasonable, in hiring, to consider factors like collegiality and the type of classroom atmosphere that a professor encourages, and civility can sometimes be a factor in that.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/09/council-of-uc-faculty-associations.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2014-09-12T08:08:00-07:00\">8:08 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=8778656337185721904\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy?updated-max=2014-09-12T08:08:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=17&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

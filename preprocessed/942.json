{"content": "How Much My Novel Cost\u00a0Me Writing my first book got me into debt. To finish the next one, I had to become\u00a0solvent. Emily Gould Blocked Unblock Follow Following Feb 24, 2014 Illustrations\u00a0: Leah\u00a0Goran I t\u2019s hard to write about being broke because brokeness is so relative; \u201cbroke\u201d people run the gamut from the trust-funded jerk whose drinks you buy because she\u2019s \u201cso broke right now\u201d to the people who sleep outside the bar where she\u2019s whining. But by summer 2012 I was broke, and in debt, and it was no one\u2019s fault but mine. Besides a couple of freelance writing assignments, my only source of income for more than a year had come from teaching yoga, for which I got paid $40 a class. In 2011 I made $7,000. During that $7,000 year I also routinely read from my work in front of crowds of people, spoke on panels and at colleges, and got hit up for advice by young people who were interested in emulating my career path, whose coffee I usually ended up buying after they made a halfhearted feint toward their tote bag\u2013purses. I felt some weird obligation to them and to anyone else who might be paying attention to pretend that I wasn\u2019t poor. Keeping up appearances, of course, only made me poorer. I\u2019m not sure what the point of admitting all this might be, because I know that anyone who experiences a career peak in his mid-twenties will likely make the same mistakes I did, and it\u2019s not even clear to me that they were all mistakes, unless writing a book is always a mistake, which in some sense it must be. In 2008 I sold a book-in-progress for $200,000 ($170,000 after commission, to be paid in four installments), which still seems to me like a lot of money. At the time, though, it seemed infinite. The resulting book\u2014a \u201cpaperback original,\u201d as they\u2019re called\u2014has sold around 8,000 copies, which is about a fifth of what it needed to sell not to be considered a flop. This essentially guarantees that no one will ever pay me that kind of money to write a book again. It took me a while to realize that my book had failed. No one ever told me point-blank that it\u00a0had. It was more like the failure occurred in tiny increments over the course of two years, after which it was too late to develop a solid Plan B. I spent some of the advance on clothes that no longer fit my body/life, but mostly I spent it on taxes\u2014New York even has a city tax, on top of the state and federal kind\u2014and rent. I lived alone for three years in Brooklyn, paying $1,700 a month ($61,200 all told) for a pretty but small one-bedroom within eyeshot of the Brooklyn\u2013Queens Expressway. I also spent $400 a month on health insurance. At one point I thought I would find another full-time job after finishing the book, but then I must have convinced myself that teaching yoga part time would better enable my writing. I also thought that I would immediately start another book, which I would sell, like the first, before I\u2019d written half of it. In order to believe this I had to cut myself off from all kinds of practical realities; considering these realities seemed like planning for failure. In retrospect it seems clear that I should never have bought health insurance, nor lived by myself. For many years I have been spending a lot of time on the internet. In fact, I can\u2019t really remember anything else I did in 2010. I tumbld, I tweeted, and I scrolled. This didn\u2019t earn me any money but it felt like work. I justified my habits to myself in various ways. I was building my brand. Blogging was a creative act\u2014even \u201ccurating\u201d by reblogging someone else\u2019s post was a creative act, if you squinted. It was also the only creative thing I was doing. While some people, mostly young women, embraced my book the way I\u2019d dreamed they might, much of the reaction had been vehemently negative\u2014not just critically, but among my family and friends. In the fall that followed the summer of my book\u2019s publication, my entire immediate family briefly stopped speaking to me. No one would acknowledge that this was because of the book\u2014officially, the last straw was a stupid fight that happened during the two-day car ride home from a family vacation. I\u2019d spent the whole vacation whining about my bad reviews and jonesing for the internet. Whenever I took out my computer, trying to write something, anything, to prove to myself that I still could, my mom suspected\u2014as she later confessed\u2014that I was blogging about how miserable our vacation was, and specifically about her. I wasn\u2019t, and I felt her suspicions were irrational, but they weren\u2019t. She\u2019d hated the way I\u2019d portrayed her in the book, and I owed her an apology but couldn\u2019t muster one that would satisfy her. No one wants to hear you say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I might do it, or something like it, again.\u201d But in the months that followed I discovered that, even when I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t write well in the first person anymore. I tried, but what came out read as self-conscious, self-censored, chastened\u2014and worst of all, insincere. Then I tried to write straightforward critical essays, but without that dose of \u201cI\u201d I\u2019d reliably been able to inject before, they were dry and boring, and suddenly my lack of real expertise or research skills was glaring\u2014I\u2019d always been able to fudge it before, compensating with feelings and observations when facts weren\u2019t at my fingertips. I started to feel like I\u2019d been fired from the only job I\u2019d ever been good at. In a way, I had. I knew I needed to train for another line of work, but I had no idea what it might be, or what form that training might take. Instead I deadened my anxiety and sadness with an unending litany of jokes and observations and news briefs and petty complaints: the real-time collective unconscious that\u2019s reliably unspooling on Twitter, even as I type (with my computer\u2019s internet access disabled) these words. Eventually I started writing in the third person as an exercise. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m writing a novel,\u201d I thought at times, but this seemed far-fetched. How could someone who had been so mistaken about the narrative structure of her own life hope to write a\u00a0novel? B summer 2012 I\u2019d been working on the third-person exercise for two years, and it had become a novel, or part of one, but it somehow wasn\u2019t getting longer or better. With the exception of yoga earnings and freelance assignments, I mostly lived on money I borrowed from my boyfriend, Keith. (We\u2019d moved in together in fall 2010, in part because we liked each other and in larger part because I couldn\u2019t afford to pay rent.) We kept track of what I owed him at first, but at some point we stopped writing down the amounts; it was clear the total was greater than I could hope to repay anytime soon. He paid off one credit card so that I wouldn\u2019t have to keep paying the monthly penalty. When I wanted to cancel my health insurance he insisted I keep it, and paid for it. He was patient when my attempts to get a job more remunerative than teaching yoga failed; he didn\u2019t call me out on how much harder I could have tried. Without questioning my choices, he supported me, emotionally, creatively, and financially. I hated that he had to. At times he was stretched thin financially himself and I knew that our precarious money situation weighed heavily on his mind, even though he never complained. \u201cYou\u2019ll sell your book for a million dollars,\u201d he said, over and over again. But there was one thing he wouldn\u2019t tolerate, and that was all the time I spent clicking and scrolling. He didn\u2019t buy the line about it being a form of creativity. He called it an addiction. I said, \u201cIt soothes me.\u201d He said, \u201cIt agitates you.\u201d Being a blogger was a part of my identity I couldn\u2019t relinquish, but I knew I would have to quit dispersing my energies if I hoped to finish my book and pay him back. I hatched a plan. Keith was going to the Arctic to report for an article, and before he left we made a deal: if I did the work of cleaning our apartment, finding a subletter for August, and finding a cheaper housing arrangement, I could keep the money we saved. I ended up renting a cottage upstate from an easygoing touring musician named Heather. Heather sent two blurry photos and I said yes, even though all I could tell from the photos was that the house had wood floors and a piano. I don\u2019t play piano but it seemed like a nice thing to have. Keith wouldn\u2019t be back till mid-August, so I would have two weeks there completely alone; my friend Bennett agreed to help me move in. I planned to stay off the internet, except email. This seemed terrifying but perfect, the exact kind of bored loneliness that could force me to finish a draft of the book. The house was located, as Bennett and I discovered, on a campground, whose\u2014owner? manager?\u2014Heather warned me about. She said he watched TV all day and night and was \u201ca real character.\u201d This detail came back to me as he waved a flashlight at us and glowered, his long, scraggly white beard flashing in the moonlight. He looked like a very specific character, the one who appears fifteen minutes into every horror movie about dumb city kids who drive into the country to party in an isolated cabin. \u201cWho ARE YOU?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I\u2019m staying in Heather\u2019s house?\u201d I said. \u201cFor August?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s over there,\u201d the bad omen said, pointing to a saggy, vinyl-sided structure about twenty feet from the parking lot, facing the road. He shrugged and went back inside, trailing his stale-cig aroma. In my memory it was raining but it may not actually have been raining. We dragged what we needed for the night toward the door of what was apparently Heather\u2019s house, and then I fumbled with the lock and we were inside. When I look at my bank and credit card statements from 2010 it\u2019s easy to see what happened, but at the time it was so hard to know which decisions were good and which were stupid. And even had I known, when I received the last quarter of my book advance, that it would be my last substantial paycheck for the next few years, I don\u2019t think I would have spent it more slowly. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to. So much of the money we spend\u2014or I spend, anyway\u2014is predicated on decisions made once and then forgotten, payments that are automated or habits so ingrained they may as well be automated. You think you\u2019ll tackle the habits first\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll stop buying bottled water and fancy cups of coffee\u201d\u2014but actually the habits are the last to go. I only stopped buying bottled water when I literally did not have any cash in my wallet at any time. In the meantime, I canceled my recurring charitable donations (all two of them), my cable, my Netflix, all my subscriptions. I moved in with Keith. I stopped seeing my doesn\u2019t-take-anybody\u2019s-insurance therapist, but only after I owed her $1,760. I regret the bottled water, I regret the cappuccinos, but mostly I regret not realizing that I needed to stop therapy\u00a0sooner. I think about the money I owe AmEx a lot, but I think about the ruined relationship with Dr. Susan (who was a great therapist) and the money I owe Keith every day. I don\u2019t regret spending thousands of dollars on my cat Raffles, though he has been a pricey liability for years now. He has been threatening to die on a regular basis since the summer of my twenty-second year, when my parents brought him to New York because he\u2019d been getting beaten up all over their neighborhood by cats, dogs, and maybe raccoons, coming home with infected wounds, which became abscesses, which required surgery. It was clear how he got into these situations: he approaches everyone and everything with an open-hearted friendliness, head-butting legs and outstretched palms and furniture in ecstasies of delirious affection. It\u2019s easy to imagine this not going over well with raccoons. Raffles contracted feline immunodeficiency virus from the fights, but that latent condition would turn out to be the least of his woes. In 2007 he became diabetic, requiring insulin shots at precise twelve-hour intervals and expensive, foul-smelling prescription cat food. He recovered from the diabetes, but soon developed a host of other expensive conditions: dental problems to rival Martin Amis\u2019s, thyroid and gastric disorders, mysterious and terrible fits of projectile vomiting. He became so finicky that after trying all the healthy cat food brands with their cutesy flavor names (\u201cThanksgiving Dinner\u201d) I gave up and started feeding him Fancy Feast, feeling the way I imagine parents feel when they give in to their toddlers\u2019 desires to eat mac and cheese for every meal\u2014guilty and slightly relieved, because at least it\u2019s cheap. The most costly of Raff\u2019s medical misfortunes wasn\u2019t related to any of these chronic conditions. I\u2019d been babysitting my friend\u2019s dog, an elderly lab-mix mutt who took daily doses of arthritis medication, when I noticed Raffles wasn\u2019t his usual needy, sociable self. Instead, he was sitting stockstill and open-eyed with pinned pupils. The vet confirmed my suspicion. \u201cHe\u2019s stoned out of his little cat mind,\u201d she said. \u201cCould he have accidentally eaten any medication that was lying around?\u201d The dog must have spat out her dose. Raffles had his stomach pumped and stayed overnight in the veterinary ER, to the tune of $1,500 or so. They\u2019d given me an estimate along these lines before they pumped his stomach, and I wondered if anyone ever said no. \u201cLet my cat die. I can\u2019t afford this.\u201d Probably a lot of people did. Possibly I should have. Of course, I didn\u2019t. This was when I was still living alone and paying $1,700 in rent every month, still thinking that because I had once been able to use writing to make the kind of money you can live on in New York, I would inevitably do so again. Right before we went upstate, Raffles got an abdominal ultrasound ($380, charged to a nearly maxed-out credit card) that revealed he has lymphoma. I thought he wouldn\u2019t survive the trip, but a year later it seems to be killing him very slowly; he\u2019s thin but not in obvious pain, holding steady on $40-a month steroid pills. \u201c I \u2019m afraid to leave you here,\u201d Bennett told me Sunday night. He\u2019d stayed for the weekend, settling me in, chauffeuring me to neighboring towns to stockpile food and supplies. Another friend would arrive on Friday, and Keith the Friday after that, so I wouldn\u2019t be completely alone. But I would be alone a lot. I don\u2019t know how to drive. There was a clunky old bike in the basement that could take me to Rosendale\u2019s main street, but not the ten miles to Kingston or New Paltz. I would mostly be trapped in Heather\u2019s small, slightly decrepit house, with no one around for miles but the campground-guarding troll and whatever vacationing serial killers were attracted to his campground. For a certain kind of highly disciplined, possibly Swedish person, the day comes naturally segmented into task-length periods of productivity the way citrus fruit comes segmented into slices: waking, making breakfast, eating, working, exercising, making lunch, eating, working, reading, making dinner, eating, sleeping, all of these activities taking place at their assigned times, for their allotted increments. I decided to become this kind of person. I would rise at eight, eat, work for two hours, practice yoga, eat lunch, check email or work for another hour (okay, check email), go outside, eat dinner, go to bed. And mostly that is what I did. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking a lot, but I think that\u2019s actually okay,\u201d I wrote in my notebook. I also wrote that I had been spending a lot of time petting Raffles, crying, and quietly saying \u201cDon\u2019t die,\u201d and that it was nice to be able to do this unobserved. When I first sat down to write this essay, I thought I would spend a lot of time describing the scenic beauty of the Shawangunk valley and the sense of deep stillness and isolation that surrounded me there, as contrasted with my everyday life, which mostly takes place in my apartment above a bar. But everyone has been to the country, everyone knows what that\u2019s about. Trees, screaming cicadas, sweet-smelling air, routine doses of astonishing ordinary loveliness that exhilarate and revive you like a drug. The white spot that resolves into a bald eagle as you focus your binoculars. The precious sense of being just deliciously exhausted enough that your brain can\u2019t create its usual whirl of thoughts. Et cetera. A week and a half into my Rosendale month, I returned to the city to see the musical Into the Woods in Central Park. (I left my friend Sari with instructions about how to feed Raffles his steroid pills.) I hadn\u2019t been off the bus long when I realized how much ten days away had affected me. The subway contained too many people, too much information: I looked around constantly, trying to figure out everyone\u2019s deal. I stopped at the Strand to buy the fourth Game of Thrones book. Two girls around my age were hovering by the bestsellers table, leafing through Fifty Shades of Grey . \u201cI hear it\u2019s incredibly bad,\u201d one of them said. \u201cIt is. You can\u2019t even imagine how bad. Worse, it\u2019s boring. Bad and boring,\u201d I said, though neither of them had even glanced in my direction. They exchanged bitch-is-crazy looks, but for some reason I continued. \u201cLook, I\u2019m reading these Game of Thrones books\u2014I\u2019m not a snob! But there\u2019s trash and then there\u2019s crap, and that\u2019s crap.\u201d The one who\u2019d spoken said, not really to me, \u201cWell, I want to find out for myself what all the fuss is about,\u201d and picked it up and got in line. \u201cOkay, but don\u2019t say no one warned you!\u201d I called brightly after them. They walked away fast. I didn\u2019t feel good about how this went down, which might be why, on exiting the Strand, I made eye contact with a sunburned gentleman who was begging for change. \u201cPlease, Miss, help me get something to eat,\u201d he said, an entreaty I\u2019ve heard thousands of times and never once responded to. \u201cOkay,\u201d I told him, \u201cBut I have to buy it for you so I know you\u2019re getting food.\u201d He eagerly accepted, and we walked to a kebab cart, where he placed a finicky, exacting order. After I\u2019d paid for the kebab and waved away his thanks, he launched into a more complicated sob story, but I was already halfway down the steps into the Union Square subway station. What , I thought, as I waited for the uptown 6, was that ? I began to worry about being normal for my friend who\u2019d landed us the highly coveted tickets. I liked this friend a lot but didn\u2019t know her terribly well, despite which I had sort of invited myself to spend the night at her house. I didn\u2019t want to alienate her by crying or acting strange or giving money to homeless people. Into the Woods is a clever, appealing show\u2014appealing to me, anyway\u2014 because it\u2019s not afraid to be completely obvious. \u201cGoing into the woods\u201d is the beginning of everyone\u2019s story, and \u201cthe woods\u201d are wherever your story begins. While you\u2019re there, you encounter monsters and beautiful maidens and princes. Then you get what you want, and find out it\u2019s nothing like what you imagined. The monsters turn out to be cool, the maidens to be weird losers, the princes to be dicks. You lose everything you have that can be lost, and find out who you are when you have to live without\u00a0it. In the first act, the characters\u2014standard storybook types like Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Jack of beanstalk fame\u2014go through the motions of the stories we know, overcoming obstacles we know they\u2019ll encounter and accomplishing goals they\u2019d announced at the show\u2019s outset. But in act 2, which reviewers tend to think is a mess, the curtain rises on a post\u2013\u201cever after\u201d world that no one, especially not the characters, has ever imagined. There\u2019s betrayal and poverty and failure. There\u2019s also plenty of death, because that\u2019s the foremost thing no one imagines will be part of his story. When the closing song (\u201cNo One Is Alone\u201d) came I teared up, as I\u2019d feared, but didn\u2019t humiliate myself by sobbing. We made our way back to my friend\u2019s apartment without incident, and I surprised myself by falling asleep almost instantly. We woke up early and rode the subway together to 42nd and Eighth. My friend headed toward her impressive glass office building and I went down into the bowels of Port Authority, where I boarded a bus for my temporary home. My first clue that my book would not be a bestseller came in a marketing meeting about six months prior to publication. Actually there were several clues in that meeting. The first came when a marketing assistant suggested that I start a blog, and I had to explain that her bosses had acquired my book in part because I was a well-known blogger. The second came when my publicist asked how I thought they should position my book. She rattled off a short list of commercially successful essay collections by funny, quirky female writers like Sloane Crosley, Laurie Notaro, and Julie Klam. Books with \u201cCake\u201d and \u201cGirls\u201d in the title and jokey subtitles. Having worked at a publishing house, I know that it\u2019s not possible for everyone who works at a publishing house to read all the books coming out that season, or even parts of them, or even the descriptions of them in the catalog or in-house \u201ctip sheets.\u201d But I also know that if a book is supposed to be a \u201cbig\u201d book, everyone in the office will read it. I was a young woman, so of course they had lumped me in with the cake-girl books. But my book was not cakey. I had no idea how to explain this to people. I clearly still don\u2019t. Knowing how obnoxious it would sound, but feeling I had to say it anyway, if only to have said it, I told them that they had to \u201cgo all out.\u201d \u201cSay that I\u2019m the voice of my generation,\u201d I told them. They looked at me like I\u2019d emitted a long, loud, smelly fart. And so\u2014swear to god\u2014I amended what I\u2019d said: \u201cOkay, say I\u2019m a voice of my generation.\u201d Imagine me three years later, watching the premiere of Girls for free on YouTube and reaching the scene in which Lena Dunham, whose character is writing a book of autobiographical essays and trying to convince her parents that she needs to stay on the teat to finish it. \u201cI think that I may be the voice of my generation,\u201d Dunham says, bravely and unconvincingly, and then amends herself: \u201cor at least a voice of a generation.\u201d It\u2019s a great scene, the elevator pitch for the whole groundbreaking show. She turned her life into art\u2014award-winning, apartment-buying, wildly popular art\u2014which is something I\u2019m still trying to do. Watching her do it has been excruciating. That could have been me, I catch myself thinking, but of course it couldn\u2019t have been, or at least it isn\u2019t. Dunham isn\u2019t the only person living the life I\u2019d once felt entitled to. Or maybe the problem\u2014well, a problem\u2014was that I felt entitled to several different lives. In one of these lives, my book has made me famous as a pundit and wit, the kind of person who\u2019s constantly consulted on everything from what feminists should be enraged about to what jeans to buy. This person writes a great book every few years and travels and whips up impressionistic little essays for classy magazines when she feels like it, not because she has to. She\u2019s single, or maybe she has a glamorous artist boyfriend. She is beautiful, but not professionally beautiful\u2014beautiful like a French person. Like Charlotte Gainsbourg. In another of these lives, my writing has given me the wherewithal to live within a bourgeois coziness I\u2019ve fantasized about for years (my feminist, socialist education making me feel guilty all the while). In this fantasy I\u2019m married to my true love Keith, we own a brownstone and my books pay the mortgage, we have children, and I write novels while they\u2019re at school and cook delicious meals every night and the importance of the world\u2019s approval recedes into insignificance because I have the much more solid and gratifying love of my family. But I still have it\u2014the approval. Of course. Like Jennifer Egan (though I don\u2019t know if she cooks). Like Laurie Colwin, but not dead. The ridiculousness of wanting to have a baby when you\u2019re struggling to afford to feed your cat (and yourself) notwithstanding, I nevertheless felt terrible about turning 30 without having had a baby. Unfortunately this feeling was becoming increasingly unignorable at around the exact same time that Keith admitted to me that he\u2019d donated sperm to his lesbian sister\u2019s partner, and she was now pregnant.I knew I had no right to be as livid as I was, but I was livid and could think of nothing else for days that became weeks. I caught myself wishing everyone involved into nonexistence, especially myself. \u201c J ust write your way out of it,\u201d someone once told me. This is terrible advice, as I confirmed when I tried to write my way out of my brokeness and toxic feelings about Keith\u2019s gestating biological son/nephew by agreeing to describe the situation, under a pseudonym, for a women\u2019s magazine. This meant trying to shape my irrational, evil feelings into an essay featuring a \u201cme\u201d character who is sane, likeable, and relatable, and to make events that were still happening into a story with a satisfying beginning, middle, and end. It soon became apparent that the only way to do this was to pretend Keith\u2019s revelation about the baby had forced a painful but necessary reckoning that would lead, I implied, to increased trust, closeness, and understanding in our relationship. The editors at the women\u2019s magazine wouldn\u2019t let the story alone until it suggested that, as a result of Keith\u2019s weird quasi-betrayal, we had sorted through our issues and were now on the verge of getting married and having our own children. This couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth, and while I didn\u2019t exactly want it to be true at that particular moment, it was still painful to borrow those feelings in order to try to write as though they were mine. I worked on the essay for six months, which included several all-day email volleys from the editor, who seemed constantly ready to kill the piece. I couldn\u2019t let that happen; I needed the money so badly. I was incredibly relieved when the issue finally closed. Around the same time, the baby was born. I tortured myself by looking at photos of him on Facebook. He was beautiful and healthy, and even as a tiny infant he smiled constantly. He looked a lot like Keith. The money, meanwhile, disappeared into the maw of my debt without making a discernible dent in it, or any palpable difference in my everyday life. T wo weeks into my Rosendale trip I\u2019d discovered a secret I wished I could share with the world, but it was hard to share it without sounding like the worst kind of judgmental asshole. It was miraculous, I wanted to shout into the wind, how much space opened up in your brain when you stopped filling it with a steady stream of other people\u2019s thoughts! Twitter and Tumblr and even email\u2014anything that rewards constant vigilance and creates repetitive cycles of need based on intermittent reinforcement\u2014were the bitterest foes of the sustained concentration that\u2019s necessary to making worthwhile art! DUH! How had I been so blind?! How had I lived such a debased life for so long? How would I ever go back to New York? I was determined to preserve my monastic habits when I left Rosendale, for as long as I lived. When Keith joined me at the cabin I was happy to see him, but I also worried that he would jeopardize my weird solitude and the blithe, happy creativity I\u2019d begun to cultivate. Just having to talk to another person on a regular basis could enable a worm of self-doubt to slither into my Edenic lifestyle. In other words: having him around could lead me to realize everything I\u2019d been writing was terrible. (When I got back to New York, I did realize a lot of it was terrible, but that didn\u2019t matter: the draft existed, and so could be revised into not-terribleness.) Anyway, I greeted him by being a huge territorial bitch. Luckily Keith is so oblivious when he\u2019s writing an article that he barely noticed. He buried himself in a pile of books about the Arctic and generally made himself inconspicuous. Soon we were back to the patterns of happy coworking we\u2019ve been cultivating for years, sharing time in Heather\u2019s orange-painted office in the mornings and going for hikes in the afternoons. Also it was nice to have regular access to a car. Then one afternoon he told me that his sister and her partner and all their children, plus his young half-brothers, would be coming through New York State on the last leg of a cross-country road trip. Could they crash with us for a night? I said no. I was rude about it, too. I accused Keith of \u201calways putting her needs before mine,\u201d which in fact he has only ever done once (the baby). He pretended to agree with me and gently brought me around by reminding me how much I love his sister\u2019s older kids and his half-brothers, and how rare it is for us to see them, and how special it would be for the kids to camp out on our floor. I finally gave in, then spent the day before their arrival dreading the moment when I\u2019d first see the baby. What if I burst out crying or otherwise embarrassed myself? What if they wanted me to hold him? I didn\u2019t think I could handle it. That afternoon Raffles pooped outside his litter box, then dragged his butt across the bathroom and living room, smearing poop everywhere. The vet had warned me that the cancer was affecting his intestines, but this was the first evidence I\u2019d seen. The cleanup was disgusting, and the worst part was that I had to pick Raffles up and wash his butt. He whined, clearly hating this affront to his dignity, but he didn\u2019t try to escape. Either he saw the necessity of what I was doing or he lacked the energy to fight. Either way it seemed like a bad sign. When it\u2019s time, I hope he dies in his sleep, both for his own sake and because I can\u2019t afford the final few hundred dollars that euthanization costs. The next day, I held my breath as the car arrived. The kids piled out, rambunctious from being cooped up, and I was too busy greeting them to worry about what seeing the baby would be like, and soon it had happened without my really noticing. We went into the little house and busied our selves making sleeping-bag beds on the floor. The baby passed around from kid to kid, and then I was holding him. I registered his adorableness and shocking docility. I didn\u2019t feel a gutpunch or an ovary-twinge or a heartbreaking tightness in my chest. No part of my torso or spirit ached. I felt nothing, but that \u201cnothing\u201d wasn\u2019t numbness, it was just\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. nothing. Seeing this child with his parents\u2014and those two women, not Keith, were unquestionably his parents\u2014undid my possessive, paranoid fantasies in an instant. I didn\u2019t even look for his resemblance to Keith. The problem with the dumb article I\u2019d written, besides being full of made-up feelings and lies, was that I was wrong to think I was that story\u2019s protagonist. I am this story\u2019s protagonist, but I was also wrong to assume, three years ago, that my story would move predictably toward its perfect happy ending. I don\u2019t know if I will ever have any of the things I once considered necessary and automatic parts of a complete adult life. I might never get married, or have children, or own a home. I will pay back the money I owe Keith, though, and my novel will be published\u2014I sold it that December, for $30,000. In January 2013 I began a full-time job that, while it leaves me no time to write, is helping me slowly repay the debts I incurred by imagining that writing was my livelihood. Act 1 is over\u2014it\u2019s been over for a while\u2014and I\u2019m headed back into the woods.

\u201cbroke\u201d people run the gamut from the trust-funded jerk whose drinks you buy because she\u2019s \u201cso broke right now\u201d to the people who sleep outside the bar where she\u2019s whining. But by summer 2012 I was broke, and in debt, and it was no one\u2019s fault but mine. Besides a couple of freelance writing assignments, my only source of income for more than a year had come from teaching yoga, for which I got paid $40 a class. In 2011 I made $7,000.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d8c6\" name=\"d8c6\">During that $7,000 year I also routinely read from my work in front of crowds of people, spoke on panels and at colleges, and got hit up for advice by young people who were interested in emulating my career path, whose coffee I usually ended up buying after they made a halfhearted feint toward their tote bag\u2013purses. I felt some weird obligation to them and to anyone else who might be paying attention to pretend that I wasn\u2019t poor. Keeping up appearances, of course, only made me poorer. I\u2019m not sure what the point of admitting all this might be, because I know that anyone who experiences a career peak in his mid-twenties will likely make the same mistakes I did, and it\u2019s not even clear to me that they were all mistakes, unless writing a book is always a mistake, which in some sense it must be.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6436\" name=\"6436\">In 2008 I sold a book-in-progress for $200,000 ($170,000 after commission, to be paid in four installments), which still seems to me like a lot of money. At the time, though, it seemed infinite. The resulting book\u2014a \u201cpaperback original,\u201d as they\u2019re called\u2014has sold around 8,000 copies, which is about a fifth of what it needed to sell not to be considered a flop. This essentially guarantees that no one will ever pay me that kind of money to write a book again.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"4757\" name=\"4757\">It took me a while to realize that my book had failed. No one ever told me point-blank that it\u00a0had.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"9748\" name=\"9748\">It was more like the failure occurred in tiny increments over the course of two years, after which it was too late to develop a solid Plan B.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b42b\" name=\"b42b\">I spent some of the advance on clothes that no longer fit my body/life, but mostly I spent it on taxes\u2014New York even has a city tax, on top of the state and federal kind\u2014and rent. I lived alone for three years in Brooklyn, paying $1,700 a month ($61,200 all told) for a pretty but small one-bedroom within eyeshot of the Brooklyn\u2013Queens Expressway. I also spent $400 a month on health insurance. At one point I thought I would find another full-time job after finishing the book, but then I must have convinced myself that teaching yoga part time would better enable my writing. I also thought that I would immediately start another book, which I would sell, like the first, before I\u2019d written half of it. In order to believe this I had to cut myself off from all kinds of practical realities; considering these realities seemed like planning for failure. In retrospect it seems clear that I should never have bought health insurance, nor lived by myself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d709\" name=\"d709\">For many years I have been spending a lot of time on the internet. In fact, I can\u2019t really remember anything else I did in 2010. I tumbld, I tweeted, and I scrolled. This didn\u2019t earn me any money but it felt like work. I justified my habits to myself in various ways. I was building my brand. Blogging was a creative act\u2014even \u201ccurating\u201d by reblogging someone else\u2019s post was a creative act, if you squinted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b932\" name=\"b932\">It was also the only creative thing I was doing. While some people, mostly young women, embraced my book the way I\u2019d dreamed they might, much of the reaction had been vehemently negative\u2014not just critically, but among my family and friends. In the fall that followed the summer of my book\u2019s publication, my entire immediate family briefly stopped speaking to me. No one would acknowledge that this was because of the book\u2014officially, the last straw was a stupid fight that happened during the two-day car ride home from a family vacation. I\u2019d spent the whole vacation whining about my bad reviews and jonesing for the internet. Whenever I took out my computer, trying to write something, anything, to prove to myself that I still could, my mom suspected\u2014as she later confessed\u2014that I was blogging about how miserable our vacation was, and specifically about her. I wasn\u2019t, and I felt her suspicions were irrational, but they weren\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5e6\" name=\"c5e6\">She\u2019d hated the way I\u2019d portrayed her in the book, and I owed her an apology but couldn\u2019t muster one that would satisfy her. No one wants to hear you say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I might do it, or something like it, again.\u201d But in the months that followed I discovered that, even when I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t write well in the first person anymore. I tried, but what came out read as self-conscious, self-censored, chastened\u2014and worst of all, insincere. Then I tried to write straightforward critical essays, but without that dose of \u201cI\u201d I\u2019d reliably been able to inject before, they were dry and boring, and suddenly my lack of real expertise or research skills was glaring\u2014I\u2019d always been able to fudge it before, compensating with feelings and observations when facts weren\u2019t at my fingertips. I started to feel like I\u2019d been fired from the only job I\u2019d ever been good at. In a way, I had. I knew I needed to train for another line of work, but I had no idea what it might be, or what form that training might take. Instead I deadened my anxiety and sadness with an unending litany of jokes and observations and news briefs and petty complaints: the real-time collective unconscious that\u2019s reliably unspooling on Twitter, even as I type (with my computer\u2019s internet access disabled) these words.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45db\" name=\"45db\">Eventually I started writing in the third person as an exercise. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m writing a novel,\u201d I thought at times, but this seemed far-fetched.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"e1d4\" name=\"e1d4\">How could someone who had been so mistaken about the narrative structure of her own life hope to write a\u00a0novel?</blockquote></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"f8fd\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--leading\" id=\"0542\" name=\"0542\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 115px; height: 111px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 96.7%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"500\" data-image-id=\"1*TdN4psCduwVQhbSGg7qHsQ.png\" data-width=\"517\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TdN4psCduwVQhbSGg7qHsQ.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">B</span></span>summer 2012 I\u2019d been working on the third-person exercise for two years, and it had become a novel, or part of one, but it somehow wasn\u2019t getting longer or better. With the exception of yoga earnings and freelance assignments, I mostly lived on money I borrowed from my boyfriend, Keith. (We\u2019d moved in together in fall 2010, in part because we liked each other and in larger part because I couldn\u2019t afford to pay rent.) We kept track of what I owed him at first, but at some point we stopped writing down the amounts; it was clear the total was greater than I could hope to repay anytime soon. He paid off one credit card so that I wouldn\u2019t have to keep paying the monthly penalty. When I wanted to cancel my health insurance he insisted I keep it, and paid for it. He was patient when my attempts to get a job more remunerative than teaching yoga failed; he didn\u2019t call me out on how much harder I could have tried. Without questioning my choices, he supported me, emotionally, creatively, and financially. I hated that he had to. At times he was stretched thin financially himself and I knew that our precarious money situation weighed heavily on his mind, even though he never complained. \u201cYou\u2019ll sell your book for a million dollars,\u201d he said, over and over again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad0c\" name=\"ad0c\">But there was one thing he wouldn\u2019t tolerate, and that was all the time I spent clicking and scrolling. He didn\u2019t buy the line about it being a form of creativity. He called it an addiction. I said, \u201cIt soothes me.\u201d He said, \u201cIt agitates you.\u201d Being a blogger was a part of my identity I couldn\u2019t relinquish, but I knew I would have to quit dispersing my energies if I hoped to finish my book and pay him back. I hatched a plan. Keith was going to the Arctic to report for an article, and before he left we made a deal: if I did the work of cleaning our apartment, finding a subletter for August, and finding a cheaper housing arrangement, I could keep the money we saved. I ended up renting a cottage upstate from an easygoing touring musician named Heather. Heather sent two blurry photos and I said yes, even though all I could tell from the photos was that the house had wood floors and a piano. I don\u2019t play piano but it seemed like a nice thing to have. Keith wouldn\u2019t be back till mid-August, so I would have two weeks there completely alone; my friend Bennett agreed to help me move in. I planned to stay off the internet, except email. This seemed terrifying but perfect, the exact kind of bored loneliness that could force me to finish a draft of the book.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f10f\" name=\"f10f\">The house was located, as Bennett and I discovered, on a campground, whose\u2014owner? manager?\u2014Heather warned me about. She said he watched TV all day and night and was \u201ca real character.\u201d This detail came back to me as he waved a flashlight at us and glowered, his long, scraggly white beard flashing in the moonlight. He looked like a very specific character, the one who appears fifteen minutes into every horror movie about dumb city kids who drive into the country to party in an isolated cabin.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6632\" name=\"6632\">\u201cWho ARE YOU?\u201d he shouted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e7b6\" name=\"e7b6\">\u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

He shrugged and went back inside, trailing his stale-cig aroma. In my memory it was raining but it may not actually have been raining. We dragged what we needed for the night toward the door of what was apparently Heather\u2019s house, and then I fumbled with the lock and we were inside.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"3e9d\" name=\"3e9d\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 900px; max-height: 772px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 85.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-height=\"772\" data-image-id=\"1*q3J_FrkzNCyk0zKZEFivVg.jpeg\" data-width=\"900\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*q3J_FrkzNCyk0zKZEFivVg.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*q3J_FrkzNCyk0zKZEFivVg.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*q3J_FrkzNCyk0zKZEFivVg.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"0645\" name=\"0645\">When I look at my bank and credit card statements from 2010 it\u2019s easy to see what happened, but at the time it was so hard to know which decisions were good and which were stupid. And even had I known, when I received the last quarter of my book advance, that it would be my last substantial paycheck for the next few years, I don\u2019t think I would have spent it more slowly. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to. So much of the money we spend\u2014or I spend, anyway\u2014is predicated on decisions made once and then forgotten, payments that are automated or habits so ingrained they may as well be automated. You think you\u2019ll tackle the habits first\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll stop buying bottled water and fancy cups of coffee\u201d\u2014but actually the habits are the last to go. I only stopped buying bottled water when I literally did not have any cash in my wallet at any time. In the meantime, I canceled my recurring charitable donations (all two of them), my cable, my Netflix, all my subscriptions. I moved in with Keith. I stopped seeing my doesn\u2019t-take-anybody\u2019s-insurance therapist, but only after I owed her $1,760.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"8a85\" name=\"8a85\">I regret the bottled water, I regret the cappuccinos, but mostly I regret not realizing that I needed to stop therapy\u00a0sooner.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"ece6\" name=\"ece6\">I think about the money I owe AmEx a lot, but I think about the ruined relationship with Dr. Susan (who was a great therapist) and the money I owe Keith every day.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4ef5\" name=\"4ef5\">I don\u2019t regret spending thousands of dollars on my cat Raffles, though he has been a pricey liability for years now. He has been threatening to die on a regular basis since the summer of my twenty-second year, when my parents brought him to New York because he\u2019d been getting beaten up all over their neighborhood by cats, dogs, and maybe raccoons, coming home with infected wounds, which became abscesses, which required surgery. It was clear how he got into these situations: he approaches everyone and everything with an open-hearted friendliness, head-butting legs and outstretched palms and furniture in ecstasies of delirious affection. It\u2019s easy to imagine this not going over well with raccoons.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"98e3\" name=\"98e3\">Raffles contracted feline immunodeficiency virus from the fights, but that latent condition would turn out to be the least of his woes. In 2007 he became diabetic, requiring insulin shots at precise twelve-hour intervals and expensive, foul-smelling prescription cat food. He recovered from the diabetes, but soon developed a host of other expensive conditions: dental problems to rival Martin Amis\u2019s, thyroid and gastric disorders, mysterious and terrible fits of projectile vomiting. He became so finicky that after trying all the healthy cat food brands with their cutesy flavor names (\u201cThanksgiving Dinner\u201d) I gave up and started feeding him Fancy Feast, feeling the way I imagine parents feel when they give in to their toddlers\u2019 desires to eat mac and cheese for every meal\u2014guilty and slightly relieved, because at least it\u2019s cheap.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"53c9\" name=\"53c9\">The most costly of Raff\u2019s medical misfortunes wasn\u2019t related to any of these chronic conditions. I\u2019d been babysitting my friend\u2019s dog, an elderly lab-mix mutt who took daily doses of arthritis medication, when I noticed Raffles wasn\u2019t his usual needy, sociable self. Instead, he was sitting stockstill and open-eyed with pinned pupils. The vet confirmed my suspicion. \u201cHe\u2019s stoned out of his little cat mind,\u201d she said. \u201cCould he have accidentally eaten any medication that was lying around?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5c97\" name=\"5c97\">The dog must have spat out her dose. Raffles had his stomach pumped and stayed overnight in the veterinary ER, to the tune of $1,500 or so. They\u2019d given me an estimate along these lines before they pumped his stomach, and I wondered if anyone ever said no. \u201cLet my cat die. I can\u2019t afford this.\u201d Probably a lot of people did. Possibly I should have. Of course, I didn\u2019t. This was when I was still living alone and paying $1,700 in rent every month, still thinking that because I had once been able to use writing to make the kind of money you can live on in New York, I would inevitably do so again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"094a\" name=\"094a\">Right before we went upstate, Raffles got an abdominal ultrasound ($380, charged to a nearly maxed-out credit card) that revealed he has lymphoma. I thought he wouldn\u2019t survive the trip, but a year later it seems to be killing him very slowly; he\u2019s thin but not in obvious pain, holding steady on $40-a month steroid pills.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"18c4\" name=\"18c4\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 900px; max-height: 514px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 57.099999999999994%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-height=\"514\" data-image-id=\"1*BVYNmo8UPAY3pf4eiPRJKg.jpeg\" data-width=\"900\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*BVYNmo8UPAY3pf4eiPRJKg.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*BVYNmo8UPAY3pf4eiPRJKg.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*BVYNmo8UPAY3pf4eiPRJKg.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure\" id=\"b9c9\" name=\"b9c9\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 111px; height: 111px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"500\" data-image-id=\"1*oxsNnvzEFNqEK8l-ISnsiA.png\" data-width=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oxsNnvzEFNqEK8l-ISnsiA.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\"><span class=\"graf-dropCapQuote\">\u201c</span>I</span></span>\u2019m afraid to leave you here,\u201d<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>Bennett told me Sunday night. He\u2019d stayed for the weekend, settling me in, chauffeuring me to neighboring towns to stockpile food and supplies. Another friend would arrive on Friday, and Keith the Friday after that, so I wouldn\u2019t be completely alone. But I would be alone a lot. I don\u2019t know how to drive. There was a clunky old bike in the basement that could take me to Rosendale\u2019s main street, but not the ten miles to Kingston or New Paltz. I would mostly be trapped in Heather\u2019s small, slightly decrepit house, with no one around for miles but the campground-guarding troll and whatever vacationing serial killers were attracted to his campground.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"94e8\" name=\"94e8\">For a certain kind of highly disciplined, possibly Swedish person, the day comes naturally segmented into task-length periods of productivity the way citrus fruit comes segmented into slices: waking, making breakfast, eating, working, exercising, making lunch, eating, working, reading, making dinner, eating, sleeping, all of these activities taking place at their assigned times, for their allotted increments. I decided to become this kind of person. I would rise at eight, eat, work for two hours, practice yoga, eat lunch, check email or work for another hour (okay, check email), go outside, eat dinner, go to bed. And mostly that is what I did. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking a lot, but I think that\u2019s actually okay,\u201d I wrote in my notebook. I also wrote that I had been spending a lot of time petting Raffles, crying, and quietly saying \u201cDon\u2019t die,\u201d and that it was nice to be able to do this unobserved.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e4f8\" name=\"e4f8\">When I first sat down to write this essay, I thought I would spend a lot of time describing the scenic beauty of the Shawangunk valley and the sense of deep stillness and isolation that surrounded me there, as contrasted with my everyday life, which mostly takes place in my apartment above a bar. But everyone has been to the country, everyone knows what that\u2019s about. Trees, screaming cicadas, sweet-smelling air, routine doses of astonishing ordinary loveliness that exhilarate and revive you like a drug. The white spot that resolves into a bald eagle as you focus your binoculars. The precious sense of being just deliciously exhausted enough that your brain can\u2019t create its usual whirl of thoughts. Et cetera.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"833f\" name=\"833f\">A week and a half into my Rosendale month, I returned to the city to see the musical <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Into the Woods</em> in Central Park. (I left my friend Sari with instructions about how to feed Raffles his steroid pills.) I hadn\u2019t been off the bus long when I realized how much ten days away had affected me. The subway contained too many people, too much information: I looked around constantly, trying to figure out everyone\u2019s deal. I stopped at the Strand to buy the fourth <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Game of Thrones</em> book. Two girls around my age were hovering by the bestsellers table, leafing through <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Fifty Shades of Grey</em>. \u201cI hear it\u2019s incredibly bad,\u201d one of them said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e84\" name=\"7e84\">\u201cIt is. You can\u2019t even imagine how bad. Worse, it\u2019s boring. Bad and boring,\u201d I said, though neither of them had even glanced in my direction. They exchanged bitch-is-crazy looks, but for some reason I continued. \u201cLook, I\u2019m reading these <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Game of Thrones</em> books\u2014I\u2019m not a snob! But there\u2019s trash and then there\u2019s crap, and that\u2019s crap.\u201d The one who\u2019d spoken said, not really to me, \u201cWell, I want to find out for myself what all the fuss is about,\u201d and picked it up and got in line. \u201cOkay, but don\u2019t say no one warned you!\u201d I called brightly after them. They walked away fast.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f3b1\" name=\"f3b1\">I didn\u2019t feel good about how this went down, which might be why, on exiting the Strand, I made eye contact with a sunburned gentleman who was begging for change. \u201cPlease, Miss, help me get something to eat,\u201d he said, an entreaty I\u2019ve heard thousands of times and never once responded to. \u201cOkay,\u201d I told him, \u201cBut I have to buy it for you so I know you\u2019re getting food.\u201d He eagerly accepted, and we walked to a kebab cart, where he placed a finicky, exacting order. After I\u2019d paid for the kebab and waved away his thanks, he launched into a more complicated sob story, but I was already halfway down the steps into the Union Square subway station.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05e1\" name=\"05e1\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">What</em>, I thought, as I waited for the uptown 6, was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that</em>? I began to worry about being normal for my friend who\u2019d landed us the highly coveted tickets. I liked this friend a lot but didn\u2019t know her terribly well, despite which I had sort of invited myself to spend the night at her house. I didn\u2019t want to alienate her by crying or acting strange or giving money to homeless people.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5674\" name=\"5674\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Into the Woods</em> is a clever, appealing show\u2014appealing to me, anyway\u2014 because it\u2019s not afraid to be completely obvious. \u201cGoing into the woods\u201d is the beginning of everyone\u2019s story, and \u201cthe woods\u201d are wherever your story begins. While you\u2019re there, you encounter monsters and beautiful maidens and princes. Then you get what you want, and find out it\u2019s nothing like what you imagined. The monsters turn out to be cool, the maidens to be weird losers, the princes to be dicks.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"8d9b\" name=\"8d9b\">You lose everything you have that can be lost, and find out who you are when you have to live without\u00a0it.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"0eff\" name=\"0eff\">In the first act, the characters\u2014standard storybook types like Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Jack of beanstalk fame\u2014go through the motions of the stories we know, overcoming obstacles we know they\u2019ll encounter and accomplishing goals they\u2019d announced at the show\u2019s outset. But in act 2, which reviewers tend to think is a mess, the curtain rises on a post\u2013\u201cever after\u201d world that no one, especially not the characters, has ever imagined. There\u2019s betrayal and poverty and failure. There\u2019s also plenty of death, because that\u2019s the foremost thing no one imagines will be part of his story.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"df1f\" name=\"df1f\">When the closing song (\u201cNo One Is Alone\u201d) came I teared up, as I\u2019d feared, but didn\u2019t humiliate myself by sobbing. We made our way back to my friend\u2019s apartment without incident, and I surprised myself by falling asleep almost instantly. We woke up early and rode the subway together to 42nd and Eighth. My friend headed toward her impressive glass office building and I went down into the bowels of Port Authority, where I boarded a bus for my temporary home.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"b598\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--leading\" id=\"67ef\" name=\"67ef\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 153px; height: 111px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 72.8%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"500\" data-image-id=\"1*7MUHta2mf42vA7Qfphghww.png\" data-width=\"687\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7MUHta2mf42vA7Qfphghww.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">My</span></span> first clue that my book would not be a bestseller came in a marketing meeting about six months prior to publication.

The second came when my publicist asked how I thought they should position my book.

I was a young woman, so of course they had lumped me in with the cake-girl books. But my book was not cakey. I had no idea how to explain this to people. I clearly still don\u2019t. Knowing how obnoxious it would sound, but feeling I had to say it anyway, if only to have said it, I told them that they had to \u201cgo all out.\u201d \u201cSay that I\u2019m the voice of my generation,\u201d I told them. They looked at me like I\u2019d emitted a long, loud, smelly fart. And so\u2014swear to god\u2014I amended what I\u2019d said:</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fa09\" name=\"fa09\">\u201cOkay, say I\u2019m a voice of my generation.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"0884\" name=\"0884\">Imagine me three years later, watching the premiere of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Girls</em> for free on YouTube and reaching the scene in which Lena Dunham, whose character is writing a book of autobiographical essays and trying to convince her parents that she needs to stay on the teat to finish it. \u201cI think that I may be the voice of my generation,\u201d Dunham says, bravely and unconvincingly, and then amends herself: \u201cor at least <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a</em> voice of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a</em> generation.\u201d It\u2019s a great scene, the elevator pitch for the whole groundbreaking show. She turned her life into art\u2014award-winning, apartment-buying, wildly popular art\u2014which is something I\u2019m still trying to do. Watching her do it has been excruciating. That could have been me, I catch myself thinking, but of course it couldn\u2019t have been, or at least it isn\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c95f\" name=\"c95f\">Dunham isn\u2019t the only person living the life I\u2019d once felt entitled to. Or maybe the problem\u2014well, a problem\u2014was that I felt entitled to several different lives. In one of these lives, my book has made me famous as a pundit and wit, the kind of person who\u2019s constantly consulted on everything from what feminists should be enraged about to what jeans to buy. This person writes a great book every few years and travels and whips up impressionistic little essays for classy magazines when she feels like it, not because she has to. She\u2019s single, or maybe she has a glamorous artist boyfriend. She is beautiful, but not professionally beautiful\u2014beautiful like a French person. Like Charlotte Gainsbourg.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f29\" name=\"8f29\">In another of these lives, my writing has given me the wherewithal to live within a bourgeois coziness I\u2019ve fantasized about for years (my feminist, socialist education making me feel guilty all the while). In this fantasy I\u2019m married to my true love Keith, we own a brownstone and my books pay the mortgage, we have children, and I write novels while they\u2019re at school and cook delicious meals every night and the importance of the world\u2019s approval recedes into insignificance because I have the much more solid and gratifying love of my family. But I still have it\u2014the approval. Of course. Like Jennifer Egan (though I don\u2019t know if she cooks).

This is terrible advice, as I confirmed when I tried to write my way out of my brokeness and toxic feelings about Keith\u2019s gestating biological son/nephew by agreeing to describe the situation, under a pseudonym, for a women\u2019s magazine. This meant trying to shape my irrational, evil feelings into an essay featuring a \u201cme\u201d character who is sane, likeable, and relatable, and to make events that were still happening into a story with a satisfying beginning, middle, and end. It soon became apparent that the only way to do this was to pretend Keith\u2019s revelation about the baby had forced a painful but necessary reckoning that would lead, I implied, to increased trust, closeness, and understanding in our relationship. The editors at the women\u2019s magazine wouldn\u2019t let the story alone until it suggested that, as a result of Keith\u2019s weird quasi-betrayal, we had sorted through our issues and were now on the verge of getting married and having our own children.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8ebc\" name=\"8ebc\">This couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth, and while I didn\u2019t <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">exactly </em>want it to be true at that particular moment, it was still painful to borrow those feelings in order to try to write as though they were mine. I worked on the essay for six months, which included several all-day email volleys from the editor, who seemed constantly ready to kill the piece. I couldn\u2019t let that happen; I needed the money so badly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"6795\" name=\"6795\">I was incredibly relieved when the issue finally closed. Around the same time, the baby was born. I tortured myself by looking at photos of him on Facebook. He was beautiful and healthy, and even as a tiny infant he smiled constantly. He looked a lot like Keith. The money, meanwhile, disappeared into the maw of my debt without making a discernible dent in it, or any palpable difference in my everyday life.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"0d24\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--leading\" id=\"4ae7\" name=\"4ae7\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 111px; height: 111px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"500\" data-image-id=\"1*hmbR3cAqCXzMFsaRAPguvw.png\" data-width=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hmbR3cAqCXzMFsaRAPguvw.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">T</span></span>wo weeks into my Rosendale trip<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>I\u2019d discovered a secret I wished I could share with the world, but it was hard to share it without sounding like the worst kind of judgmental asshole.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"f82c\" name=\"f82c\">It was miraculous, I wanted to shout into the wind, how much space opened up in your brain when you stopped filling it with a steady stream of other people\u2019s thoughts!</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"77ec\" name=\"77ec\">Twitter and Tumblr and even email\u2014anything that rewards constant vigilance and creates repetitive cycles of need based on intermittent reinforcement\u2014were the bitterest foes of the sustained concentration that\u2019s necessary to making worthwhile art! DUH! How had I been so blind?! How had I lived such a debased life for so long? How would I ever go back to New York? I was determined to preserve my monastic habits when I left Rosendale, for as long as I lived.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8b1e\" name=\"8b1e\">When Keith joined me at the cabin I was happy to see him, but I also worried that he would jeopardize my weird solitude and the blithe, happy creativity I\u2019d begun to cultivate. Just having to talk to another person on a regular basis could enable a worm of self-doubt to slither into my Edenic lifestyle. In other words: having him around could lead me to realize everything I\u2019d been writing was terrible. (When I got back to New York, I did realize a lot of it was terrible, but that didn\u2019t matter: the draft existed, and so could be revised into not-terribleness.) Anyway, I greeted him by being a huge territorial bitch. Luckily Keith is so oblivious when he\u2019s writing an article that he barely noticed. He buried himself in a pile of books about the Arctic and generally made himself inconspicuous. Soon we were back to the patterns of happy coworking we\u2019ve been cultivating for years, sharing time in Heather\u2019s orange-painted office in the mornings and going for hikes in the afternoons. Also it was nice to have regular access to a car.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"322f\" name=\"322f\">Then one afternoon he told me that his sister and her partner and all their children, plus his young half-brothers, would be coming through New York State on the last leg of a cross-country road trip. Could they crash with us for a night?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"da60\" name=\"da60\">I said no. I was rude about it, too. I accused Keith of \u201calways putting her needs before mine,\u201d which in fact he has only ever done once (the baby). He pretended to agree with me and gently brought me around by reminding me how much I love his sister\u2019s older kids and his half-brothers, and how rare it is for us to see them, and how special it would be for the kids to camp out on our floor. I finally gave in, then spent the day before their arrival dreading the moment when I\u2019d first see the baby. What if I burst out crying or otherwise embarrassed myself? What if they wanted me to hold him? I didn\u2019t think I could handle it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"76d6\" name=\"76d6\">That afternoon Raffles pooped outside his litter box, then dragged his butt across the bathroom and living room, smearing poop everywhere. The vet had warned me that the cancer was affecting his intestines, but this was the first evidence I\u2019d seen. The cleanup was disgusting, and the worst part was that I had to pick Raffles up and wash his butt. He whined, clearly hating this affront to his dignity, but he didn\u2019t try to escape. Either he saw the necessity of what I was doing or he lacked the energy to fight. Either way it seemed like a bad sign. When it\u2019s time, I hope he dies in his sleep, both for his own sake and because I can\u2019t afford the final few hundred dollars that euthanization costs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e10f\" name=\"e10f\">The next day, I held my breath as the car arrived. The kids piled out, rambunctious from being cooped up, and I was too busy greeting them to worry about what seeing the baby would be like, and soon it had happened without my really noticing. We went into the little house and busied our selves making sleeping-bag beds on the floor. The baby passed around from kid to kid, and then I was holding him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d0d1\" name=\"d0d1\">I registered his adorableness and shocking docility. I didn\u2019t feel a gutpunch or an ovary-twinge or a heartbreaking tightness in my chest. No part of my torso or spirit ached. I felt nothing, but that \u201cnothing\u201d wasn\u2019t numbness, it was just\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. nothing. Seeing this child with his parents\u2014and those two women, not Keith, were unquestionably his parents\u2014undid my possessive, paranoid fantasies in an instant. I didn\u2019t even look for his resemblance to Keith. The problem with the dumb article I\u2019d written, besides being full of made-up feelings and lies, was that I was wrong to think I was that story\u2019s protagonist. I am <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">this</em> story\u2019s protagonist, but I was also wrong to assume, three years ago, that my story would move predictably toward its perfect happy ending.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"5f6a\" name=\"5f6a\">I don\u2019t know if I will ever have any of the things I once considered necessary and automatic parts of a complete adult life. I might never get married, or have children, or own a home. I will pay back the money I owe Keith, though, and my novel will be published\u2014I sold it that December, for $30,000. In January 2013 I began a full-time job that, while it leaves me no time to write, is helping me slowly repay the debts I incurred by imagining that writing was my livelihood. Act 1 is over\u2014it\u2019s been over for a while\u2014and I\u2019m headed back into the woods.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\" name=\"a02c\"><div

\u201cbroke\u201d people run the gamut from the trust-funded jerk whose drinks you buy because she\u2019s \u201cso broke right now\u201d to the people who sleep outside the bar where she\u2019s whining. But by summer 2012 I was broke, and in debt, and it was no one\u2019s fault but mine. Besides a couple of freelance writing assignments, my only source of income for more than a year had come from teaching yoga, for which I got paid $40 a class. In 2011 I made $7,000.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d8c6\" name=\"d8c6\">During that $7,000 year I also routinely read from my work in front of crowds of people, spoke on panels and at colleges, and got hit up for advice by young people who were interested in emulating my career path, whose coffee I usually ended up buying after they made a halfhearted feint toward their tote bag\u2013purses. I felt some weird obligation to them and to anyone else who might be paying attention to pretend that I wasn\u2019t poor. Keeping up appearances, of course, only made me poorer. I\u2019m not sure what the point of admitting all this might be, because I know that anyone who experiences a career peak in his mid-twenties will likely make the same mistakes I did, and it\u2019s not even clear to me that they were all mistakes, unless writing a book is always a mistake, which in some sense it must be.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6436\" name=\"6436\">In 2008 I sold a book-in-progress for $200,000 ($170,000 after commission, to be paid in four installments), which still seems to me like a lot of money. At the time, though, it seemed infinite. The resulting book\u2014a \u201cpaperback original,\u201d as they\u2019re called\u2014has sold around 8,000 copies, which is about a fifth of what it needed to sell not to be considered a flop. This essentially guarantees that no one will ever pay me that kind of money to write a book again.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"4757\" name=\"4757\">It took me a while to realize that my book had failed. No one ever told me point-blank that it\u00a0had.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"9748\" name=\"9748\">It was more like the failure occurred in tiny increments over the course of two years, after which it was too late to develop a solid Plan B.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b42b\" name=\"b42b\">I spent some of the advance on clothes that no longer fit my body/life, but mostly I spent it on taxes\u2014New York even has a city tax, on top of the state and federal kind\u2014and rent. I lived alone for three years in Brooklyn, paying $1,700 a month ($61,200 all told) for a pretty but small one-bedroom within eyeshot of the Brooklyn\u2013Queens Expressway. I also spent $400 a month on health insurance. At one point I thought I would find another full-time job after finishing the book, but then I must have convinced myself that teaching yoga part time would better enable my writing. I also thought that I would immediately start another book, which I would sell, like the first, before I\u2019d written half of it. In order to believe this I had to cut myself off from all kinds of practical realities; considering these realities seemed like planning for failure. In retrospect it seems clear that I should never have bought health insurance, nor lived by myself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d709\" name=\"d709\">For many years I have been spending a lot of time on the internet. In fact, I can\u2019t really remember anything else I did in 2010. I tumbld, I tweeted, and I scrolled. This didn\u2019t earn me any money but it felt like work. I justified my habits to myself in various ways. I was building my brand. Blogging was a creative act\u2014even \u201ccurating\u201d by reblogging someone else\u2019s post was a creative act, if you squinted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b932\" name=\"b932\">It was also the only creative thing I was doing. While some people, mostly young women, embraced my book the way I\u2019d dreamed they might, much of the reaction had been vehemently negative\u2014not just critically, but among my family and friends. In the fall that followed the summer of my book\u2019s publication, my entire immediate family briefly stopped speaking to me. No one would acknowledge that this was because of the book\u2014officially, the last straw was a stupid fight that happened during the two-day car ride home from a family vacation. I\u2019d spent the whole vacation whining about my bad reviews and jonesing for the internet. Whenever I took out my computer, trying to write something, anything, to prove to myself that I still could, my mom suspected\u2014as she later confessed\u2014that I was blogging about how miserable our vacation was, and specifically about her. I wasn\u2019t, and I felt her suspicions were irrational, but they weren\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5e6\" name=\"c5e6\">She\u2019d hated the way I\u2019d portrayed her in the book, and I owed her an apology but couldn\u2019t muster one that would satisfy her. No one wants to hear you say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I might do it, or something like it, again.\u201d But in the months that followed I discovered that, even when I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t write well in the first person anymore. I tried, but what came out read as self-conscious, self-censored, chastened\u2014and worst of all, insincere. Then I tried to write straightforward critical essays, but without that dose of \u201cI\u201d I\u2019d reliably been able to inject before, they were dry and boring, and suddenly my lack of real expertise or research skills was glaring\u2014I\u2019d always been able to fudge it before, compensating with feelings and observations when facts weren\u2019t at my fingertips. I started to feel like I\u2019d been fired from the only job I\u2019d ever been good at. In a way, I had. I knew I needed to train for another line of work, but I had no idea what it might be, or what form that training might take. Instead I deadened my anxiety and sadness with an unending litany of jokes and observations and news briefs and petty complaints: the real-time collective unconscious that\u2019s reliably unspooling on Twitter, even as I type (with my computer\u2019s internet access disabled) these words.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45db\" name=\"45db\">Eventually I started writing in the third person as an exercise. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m writing a novel,\u201d I thought at times, but this seemed far-fetched.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"e1d4\" name=\"e1d4\">How could someone who had been so mistaken about the narrative structure of her own life hope to write a\u00a0novel?</blockquote></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--leading\" id=\"0542\" name=\"0542\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 115px; height: 111px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 96.7%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"500\" data-image-id=\"1*TdN4psCduwVQhbSGg7qHsQ.png\" data-width=\"517\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TdN4psCduwVQhbSGg7qHsQ.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">B</span></span>summer 2012 I\u2019d been working on the third-person exercise for two years, and it had become a novel, or part of one, but it somehow wasn\u2019t getting longer or better. With the exception of yoga earnings and freelance assignments, I mostly lived on money I borrowed from my boyfriend, Keith. (We\u2019d moved in together in fall 2010, in part because we liked each other and in larger part because I couldn\u2019t afford to pay rent.) We kept track of what I owed him at first, but at some point we stopped writing down the amounts; it was clear the total was greater than I could hope to repay anytime soon. He paid off one credit card so that I wouldn\u2019t have to keep paying the monthly penalty. When I wanted to cancel my health insurance he insisted I keep it, and paid for it. He was patient when my attempts to get a job more remunerative than teaching yoga failed; he didn\u2019t call me out on how much harder I could have tried. Without questioning my choices, he supported me, emotionally, creatively, and financially. I hated that he had to. At times he was stretched thin financially himself and I knew that our precarious money situation weighed heavily on his mind, even though he never complained. \u201cYou\u2019ll sell your book for a million dollars,\u201d he said, over and over again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad0c\" name=\"ad0c\">But there was one thing he wouldn\u2019t tolerate, and that was all the time I spent clicking and scrolling. He didn\u2019t buy the line about it being a form of creativity. He called it an addiction. I said, \u201cIt soothes me.\u201d He said, \u201cIt agitates you.\u201d Being a blogger was a part of my identity I couldn\u2019t relinquish, but I knew I would have to quit dispersing my energies if I hoped to finish my book and pay him back. I hatched a plan. Keith was going to the Arctic to report for an article, and before he left we made a deal: if I did the work of cleaning our apartment, finding a subletter for August, and finding a cheaper housing arrangement, I could keep the money we saved. I ended up renting a cottage upstate from an easygoing touring musician named Heather. Heather sent two blurry photos and I said yes, even though all I could tell from the photos was that the house had wood floors and a piano. I don\u2019t play piano but it seemed like a nice thing to have. Keith wouldn\u2019t be back till mid-August, so I would have two weeks there completely alone; my friend Bennett agreed to help me move in. I planned to stay off the internet, except email. This seemed terrifying but perfect, the exact kind of bored loneliness that could force me to finish a draft of the book.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f10f\" name=\"f10f\">The house was located, as Bennett and I discovered, on a campground, whose\u2014owner? manager?\u2014Heather warned me about. She said he watched TV all day and night and was \u201ca real character.\u201d This detail came back to me as he waved a flashlight at us and glowered, his long, scraggly white beard flashing in the moonlight. He looked like a very specific character, the one who appears fifteen minutes into every horror movie about dumb city kids who drive into the country to party in an isolated cabin.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6632\" name=\"6632\">\u201cWho ARE YOU?\u201d he shouted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e7b6\" name=\"e7b6\">\u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

He shrugged and went back inside, trailing his stale-cig aroma. In my memory it was raining but it may not actually have been raining. We dragged what we needed for the night toward the door of what was apparently Heather\u2019s house, and then I fumbled with the lock and we were inside.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"3e9d\" name=\"3e9d\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 900px; max-height: 772px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 85.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-height=\"772\" data-image-id=\"1*q3J_FrkzNCyk0zKZEFivVg.jpeg\" data-width=\"900\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*q3J_FrkzNCyk0zKZEFivVg.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*q3J_FrkzNCyk0zKZEFivVg.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*q3J_FrkzNCyk0zKZEFivVg.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"0645\" name=\"0645\">When I look at my bank and credit card statements from 2010 it\u2019s easy to see what happened, but at the time it was so hard to know which decisions were good and which were stupid. And even had I known, when I received the last quarter of my book advance, that it would be my last substantial paycheck for the next few years, I don\u2019t think I would have spent it more slowly. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to. So much of the money we spend\u2014or I spend, anyway\u2014is predicated on decisions made once and then forgotten, payments that are automated or habits so ingrained they may as well be automated. You think you\u2019ll tackle the habits first\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll stop buying bottled water and fancy cups of coffee\u201d\u2014but actually the habits are the last to go. I only stopped buying bottled water when I literally did not have any cash in my wallet at any time. In the meantime, I canceled my recurring charitable donations (all two of them), my cable, my Netflix, all my subscriptions. I moved in with Keith. I stopped seeing my doesn\u2019t-take-anybody\u2019s-insurance therapist, but only after I owed her $1,760.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"8a85\" name=\"8a85\">I regret the bottled water, I regret the cappuccinos, but mostly I regret not realizing that I needed to stop therapy\u00a0sooner.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"ece6\" name=\"ece6\">I think about the money I owe AmEx a lot, but I think about the ruined relationship with Dr. Susan (who was a great therapist) and the money I owe Keith every day.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4ef5\" name=\"4ef5\">I don\u2019t regret spending thousands of dollars on my cat Raffles, though he has been a pricey liability for years now. He has been threatening to die on a regular basis since the summer of my twenty-second year, when my parents brought him to New York because he\u2019d been getting beaten up all over their neighborhood by cats, dogs, and maybe raccoons, coming home with infected wounds, which became abscesses, which required surgery. It was clear how he got into these situations: he approaches everyone and everything with an open-hearted friendliness, head-butting legs and outstretched palms and furniture in ecstasies of delirious affection. It\u2019s easy to imagine this not going over well with raccoons.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"98e3\" name=\"98e3\">Raffles contracted feline immunodeficiency virus from the fights, but that latent condition would turn out to be the least of his woes. In 2007 he became diabetic, requiring insulin shots at precise twelve-hour intervals and expensive, foul-smelling prescription cat food. He recovered from the diabetes, but soon developed a host of other expensive conditions: dental problems to rival Martin Amis\u2019s, thyroid and gastric disorders, mysterious and terrible fits of projectile vomiting. He became so finicky that after trying all the healthy cat food brands with their cutesy flavor names (\u201cThanksgiving Dinner\u201d) I gave up and started feeding him Fancy Feast, feeling the way I imagine parents feel when they give in to their toddlers\u2019 desires to eat mac and cheese for every meal\u2014guilty and slightly relieved, because at least it\u2019s cheap.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"53c9\" name=\"53c9\">The most costly of Raff\u2019s medical misfortunes wasn\u2019t related to any of these chronic conditions. I\u2019d been babysitting my friend\u2019s dog, an elderly lab-mix mutt who took daily doses of arthritis medication, when I noticed Raffles wasn\u2019t his usual needy, sociable self. Instead, he was sitting stockstill and open-eyed with pinned pupils. The vet confirmed my suspicion. \u201cHe\u2019s stoned out of his little cat mind,\u201d she said. \u201cCould he have accidentally eaten any medication that was lying around?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5c97\" name=\"5c97\">The dog must have spat out her dose. Raffles had his stomach pumped and stayed overnight in the veterinary ER, to the tune of $1,500 or so. They\u2019d given me an estimate along these lines before they pumped his stomach, and I wondered if anyone ever said no. \u201cLet my cat die.

He\u2019d stayed for the weekend, settling me in, chauffeuring me to neighboring towns to stockpile food and supplies. Another friend would arrive on Friday, and Keith the Friday after that, so I wouldn\u2019t be completely alone. But I would be alone a lot. I don\u2019t know how to drive. There was a clunky old bike in the basement that could take me to Rosendale\u2019s main street, but not the ten miles to Kingston or New Paltz. I would mostly be trapped in Heather\u2019s small, slightly decrepit house, with no one around for miles but the campground-guarding troll and whatever vacationing serial killers were attracted to his campground.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"94e8\" name=\"94e8\">For a certain kind of highly disciplined, possibly Swedish person, the day comes naturally segmented into task-length periods of productivity the way citrus fruit comes segmented into slices: waking, making breakfast, eating, working, exercising, making lunch, eating, working, reading, making dinner, eating, sleeping, all of these activities taking place at their assigned times, for their allotted increments. I decided to become this kind of person. I would rise at eight, eat, work for two hours, practice yoga, eat lunch, check email or work for another hour (okay, check email), go outside, eat dinner, go to bed. And mostly that is what I did. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking a lot, but I think that\u2019s actually okay,\u201d I wrote in my notebook. I also wrote that I had been spending a lot of time petting Raffles, crying, and quietly saying \u201cDon\u2019t die,\u201d and that it was nice to be able to do this unobserved.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e4f8\" name=\"e4f8\">When I first sat down to write this essay, I thought I would spend a lot of time describing the scenic beauty of the Shawangunk valley and the sense of deep stillness and isolation that surrounded me there, as contrasted with my everyday life, which mostly takes place in my apartment above a bar. But everyone has been to the country, everyone knows what that\u2019s about. Trees, screaming cicadas, sweet-smelling air, routine doses of astonishing ordinary loveliness that exhilarate and revive you like a drug. The white spot that resolves into a bald eagle as you focus your binoculars. The precious sense of being just deliciously exhausted enough that your brain can\u2019t create its usual whirl of thoughts. Et cetera.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"833f\" name=\"833f\">A week and a half into my Rosendale month, I returned to the city to see the musical <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Into the Woods</em> in Central Park. (I left my friend Sari with instructions about how to feed Raffles his steroid pills.) I hadn\u2019t been off the bus long when I realized how much ten days away had affected me. The subway contained too many people, too much information: I looked around constantly, trying to figure out everyone\u2019s deal. I stopped at the Strand to buy the fourth <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Game of Thrones</em> book. Two girls around my age were hovering by the bestsellers table, leafing through <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Fifty Shades of Grey</em>. \u201cI hear it\u2019s incredibly bad,\u201d one of them said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e84\" name=\"7e84\">\u201cIt is. You can\u2019t even imagine how bad. Worse, it\u2019s boring. Bad and boring,\u201d I said, though neither of them had even glanced in my direction. They exchanged bitch-is-crazy looks, but for some reason I continued. \u201cLook, I\u2019m reading these <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Game of Thrones</em> books\u2014I\u2019m not a snob! But there\u2019s trash and then there\u2019s crap, and that\u2019s crap.\u201d The one who\u2019d spoken said, not really to me, \u201cWell, I want to find out for myself what all the fuss is about,\u201d and picked it up and got in line. \u201cOkay, but don\u2019t say no one warned you!\u201d I called brightly after them. They walked away fast.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f3b1\" name=\"f3b1\">I didn\u2019t feel good about how this went down, which might be why, on exiting the Strand, I made eye contact with a sunburned gentleman who was begging for change. \u201cPlease, Miss, help me get something to eat,\u201d he said, an entreaty I\u2019ve heard thousands of times and never once responded to. \u201cOkay,\u201d I told him, \u201cBut I have to buy it for you so I know you\u2019re getting food.\u201d He eagerly accepted, and we walked to a kebab cart, where he placed a finicky, exacting order. After I\u2019d paid for the kebab and waved away his thanks, he launched into a more complicated sob story, but I was already halfway down the steps into the Union Square subway station.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05e1\" name=\"05e1\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">What</em>, I thought, as I waited for the uptown 6, was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that</em>? I began to worry about being normal for my friend who\u2019d landed us the highly coveted tickets. I liked this friend a lot but didn\u2019t know her terribly well, despite which I had sort of invited myself to spend the night at her house. I didn\u2019t want to alienate her by crying or acting strange or giving money to homeless people.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5674\" name=\"5674\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Into the Woods</em> is a clever, appealing show\u2014appealing to me, anyway\u2014 because it\u2019s not afraid to be completely obvious. \u201cGoing into the woods\u201d is the beginning of everyone\u2019s story, and \u201cthe woods\u201d are wherever your story begins. While you\u2019re there, you encounter monsters and beautiful maidens and princes. Then you get what you want, and find out it\u2019s nothing like what you imagined.

But in act 2, which reviewers tend to think is a mess, the curtain rises on a post\u2013\u201cever after\u201d world that no one, especially not the characters, has ever imagined. There\u2019s betrayal and poverty and failure.

We made our way back to my friend\u2019s apartment without incident, and I surprised myself by falling asleep almost instantly. We woke up early and rode the subway together to 42nd and Eighth. My friend headed toward her impressive glass office building and I went down into the bowels of Port Authority, where I boarded a bus for my temporary home.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--leading\" id=\"67ef\" name=\"67ef\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 153px; height: 111px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 72.8%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"500\" data-image-id=\"1*7MUHta2mf42vA7Qfphghww.png\" data-width=\"687\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7MUHta2mf42vA7Qfphghww.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">My</span></span> first clue that my book would not be a bestseller came in a marketing meeting about six months prior to publication.

The second came when my publicist asked how I thought they should position my book.

I was a young woman, so of course they had lumped me in with the cake-girl books. But my book was not cakey. I had no idea how to explain this to people. I clearly still don\u2019t. Knowing how obnoxious it would sound, but feeling I had to say it anyway, if only to have said it, I told them that they had to \u201cgo all out.\u201d \u201cSay that I\u2019m the voice of my generation,\u201d I told them. They looked at me like I\u2019d emitted a long, loud, smelly fart. And so\u2014swear to god\u2014I amended what I\u2019d said:</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fa09\" name=\"fa09\">\u201cOkay, say I\u2019m a voice of my generation.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"0884\" name=\"0884\">Imagine me three years later, watching the premiere of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Girls</em> for free on YouTube and reaching the scene in which Lena Dunham, whose character is writing a book of autobiographical essays and trying to convince her parents that she needs to stay on the teat to finish it. \u201cI think that I may be the voice of my generation,\u201d Dunham says, bravely and unconvincingly, and then amends herself: \u201cor at least <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a</em> voice of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">a</em> generation.\u201d It\u2019s a great scene, the elevator pitch for the whole groundbreaking show. She turned her life into art\u2014award-winning, apartment-buying, wildly popular art\u2014which is something I\u2019m still trying to do. Watching her do it has been excruciating. That could have been me, I catch myself thinking, but of course it couldn\u2019t have been, or at least it isn\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c95f\" name=\"c95f\">Dunham isn\u2019t the only person living the life I\u2019d once felt entitled to. Or maybe the problem\u2014well, a problem\u2014was that I felt entitled to several different lives. In one of these lives, my book has made me famous as a pundit and wit, the kind of person who\u2019s constantly consulted on everything from what feminists should be enraged about to what jeans to buy. This person writes a great book every few years and travels and whips up impressionistic little essays for classy magazines when she feels like it, not because she has to. She\u2019s single, or maybe she has a glamorous artist boyfriend. She is beautiful, but not professionally beautiful\u2014beautiful like a French person. Like Charlotte Gainsbourg.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f29\" name=\"8f29\">In another of these lives, my writing has given me the wherewithal to live within a bourgeois coziness I\u2019ve fantasized about for years (my feminist, socialist education making me feel guilty all the while). In this fantasy I\u2019m married to my true love Keith, we own a brownstone and my books pay the mortgage, we have children, and I write novels while they\u2019re at school and cook delicious meals every night and the importance of the world\u2019s approval recedes into insignificance because I have the much more solid and gratifying love of my family. But I still have it\u2014the approval. Of course. Like Jennifer Egan (though I don\u2019t know if she cooks). Like Laurie Colwin, but not dead.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"2653\" name=\"2653\">The ridiculousness of wanting to have a baby when you\u2019re struggling to afford to feed your cat (and yourself) notwithstanding, I nevertheless felt terrible about turning 30 without having had a baby.

This is terrible advice, as I confirmed when I tried to write my way out of my brokeness and toxic feelings about Keith\u2019s gestating biological son/nephew by agreeing to describe the situation, under a pseudonym, for a women\u2019s magazine. This meant trying to shape my irrational, evil feelings into an essay featuring a \u201cme\u201d character who is sane, likeable, and relatable, and to make events that were still happening into a story with a satisfying beginning, middle, and end. It soon became apparent that the only way to do this was to pretend Keith\u2019s revelation about the baby had forced a painful but necessary reckoning that would lead, I implied, to increased trust, closeness, and understanding in our relationship. The editors at the women\u2019s magazine wouldn\u2019t let the story alone until it suggested that, as a result of Keith\u2019s weird quasi-betrayal, we had sorted through our issues and were now on the verge of getting married and having our own children.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8ebc\" name=\"8ebc\">This couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth, and while I didn\u2019t <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">exactly </em>want it to be true at that particular moment, it was still painful to borrow those feelings in order to try to write as though they were mine. I worked on the essay for six months, which included several all-day email volleys from the editor, who seemed constantly ready to kill the piece. I couldn\u2019t let that happen; I needed the money so badly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"6795\" name=\"6795\">I was incredibly relieved when the issue finally closed. Around the same time, the baby was born. I tortured myself by looking at photos of him on Facebook. He was beautiful and healthy, and even as a tiny infant he smiled constantly. He looked a lot like Keith. The money, meanwhile, disappeared into the maw of my debt without making a discernible dent in it, or any palpable difference in my everyday life.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf--leading\" id=\"4ae7\" name=\"4ae7\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 111px; height: 111px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"500\" data-image-id=\"1*hmbR3cAqCXzMFsaRAPguvw.png\" data-width=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hmbR3cAqCXzMFsaRAPguvw.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">T</span></span>wo weeks into my Rosendale trip<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>I\u2019d discovered a secret I wished I could share with the world, but it was hard to share it without sounding like the worst kind of judgmental asshole.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"f82c\" name=\"f82c\">It was miraculous, I wanted to shout into the wind, how much space opened up in your brain when you stopped filling it with a steady stream of other people\u2019s thoughts!</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"77ec\" name=\"77ec\">Twitter and Tumblr and even email\u2014anything that rewards constant vigilance and creates repetitive cycles of need based on intermittent reinforcement\u2014were the bitterest foes of the sustained concentration that\u2019s necessary to making worthwhile art! DUH! How had I been so blind?! How had I lived such a debased life for so long? How would I ever go back to New York? I was determined to preserve my monastic habits when I left Rosendale, for as long as I lived.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8b1e\" name=\"8b1e\">When Keith joined me at the cabin I was happy to see him, but I also worried that he would jeopardize my weird solitude and the blithe, happy creativity I\u2019d begun to cultivate. Just having to talk to another person on a regular basis could enable a worm of self-doubt to slither into my Edenic lifestyle. In other words: having him around could lead me to realize everything I\u2019d been writing was terrible. (When I got back to New York, I did realize a lot of it was terrible, but that didn\u2019t matter: the draft existed, and so could be revised into not-terribleness.) Anyway, I greeted him by being a huge territorial bitch. Luckily Keith is so oblivious when he\u2019s writing an article that he barely noticed. He buried himself in a pile of books about the Arctic and generally made himself inconspicuous. Soon we were back to the patterns of happy coworking we\u2019ve been cultivating for years, sharing time in Heather\u2019s orange-painted office in the mornings and going for hikes in the afternoons. Also it was nice to have regular access to a car.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"322f\" name=\"322f\">Then one afternoon he told me that his sister and her partner and all their children, plus his young half-brothers, would be coming through New York State on the last leg of a cross-country road trip. Could they crash with us for a night?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"da60\" name=\"da60\">I said no. I was rude about it, too. I accused Keith of \u201calways putting her needs before mine,\u201d which in fact he has only ever done once (the baby). He pretended to agree with me and gently brought me around by reminding me how much I love his sister\u2019s older kids and his half-brothers, and how rare it is for us to see them, and how special it would be for the kids to camp out on our floor. I finally gave in, then spent the day before their arrival dreading the moment when I\u2019d first see the baby. What if I burst out crying or otherwise embarrassed myself? What if they wanted me to hold him? I didn\u2019t think I could handle it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"76d6\" name=\"76d6\">That afternoon Raffles pooped outside his litter box, then dragged his butt across the bathroom and living room, smearing poop everywhere. The vet had warned me that the cancer was affecting his intestines, but this was the first evidence I\u2019d seen. The cleanup was disgusting, and the worst part was that I had to pick Raffles up and wash his butt. He whined, clearly hating this affront to his dignity, but he didn\u2019t try to escape. Either he saw the necessity of what I was doing or he lacked the energy to fight. Either way it seemed like a bad sign. When it\u2019s time, I hope he dies in his sleep, both for his own sake and because I can\u2019t afford the final few hundred dollars that euthanization costs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e10f\" name=\"e10f\">The next day, I held my breath as the car arrived. The kids piled out, rambunctious from being cooped up, and I was too busy greeting them to worry about what seeing the baby would be like, and soon it had happened without my really noticing. We went into the little house and busied our selves making sleeping-bag beds on the floor. The baby passed around from kid to kid, and then I was holding him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d0d1\" name=\"d0d1\">I registered his adorableness and shocking docility. I didn\u2019t feel a gutpunch or an ovary-twinge or a heartbreaking tightness in my chest. No part of my torso or spirit ached. I felt nothing, but that \u201cnothing\u201d wasn\u2019t numbness, it was just\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. nothing. Seeing this child with his parents\u2014and those two women, not Keith, were unquestionably his parents\u2014undid my possessive, paranoid fantasies in an instant. I didn\u2019t even look for his resemblance to Keith. The problem with the dumb article I\u2019d written, besides being full of made-up feelings and lies, was that I was wrong to think I was that story\u2019s protagonist. I am <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">this</em> story\u2019s protagonist, but I was also wrong to assume, three years ago, that my story would move predictably toward its perfect happy ending.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"5f6a\" name=\"5f6a\">I don\u2019t know if I will ever have any of the things I once considered necessary and automatic parts of a complete adult life. I might never get married, or have children, or own a home. I will pay back the money I owe Keith, though, and my novel will be published\u2014I sold it that December, for $30,000. In January 2013 I began a full-time job that, while it leaves me no time to write, is helping me slowly repay the debts I incurred by imagining that writing was my livelihood.

{"content": "The European Commission has fined Google a record-breaking \u20ac2.42 billion \u00a0(~$2.73BN) for antitrust violations pertaining to its\u00a0 Google\u2019s Shopping search comparison service \u2014 in what is widely considered the most significant antitrust ruling in Europe since the 2004 Microsoft decision . For some context on the size of the fine, Google\u2019s (Alphabet\u2019s) full year revenue for 2016 was almost $90BN . The Commission said the fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of Google\u2019s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 EEA (European Economic Area) countries concerned. Its finding states that: As a result, the EC said it found Google\u2019s comparison shopping service is much more visible to consumers in Google\u2019s search results, while rival comparison shopping services are much less visible. Speaking during a press conference about the ruling, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: \u201cGoogle has given its own comparison shopping service an illegal advantage by abusing its dominance in general Internet search. It has promoted its own service, and demoted rival services. It has harmed competition and consumers. That\u2019s illegal under EU antitrust rules.\u201d \u201cThis decision requires Google to change the way it operates, and to face the consequences of its actions,\u201d she added. Google must end the censured conduct within 90 days \u2014 or face additional penalty payments of up to 5 per cent of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, its parent company, for each day of non-compliance. (Although any such fine for non-compliance would require a separate Commission decision \u2014 but would be backdated to the date of when the non-compliance started). In an official statement on the decision, Vestager noted: \u201cGoogle has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing. But Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors.\u201d \u00a0 Vestager confirmed it will be up to Google to come up with a remedy to comply with the Commission\u2019s decision \u2014 although it will also face (likely years of) being closely monitored by regulators for compliance. \u201cThe decision requires Google to stop its illegal conduct within 90 days. And Google must respect a simple principle \u2014 it has to give equal treatment to rival comparison shopping services and to its own. It has to apply the same method and processes to position and display its own and rival comparison shopping services in its search results,\u201d she added. \u201cThis means that Google cannot simply stop dong what it\u2019s doing now and replace it with other practices that have the same or an equivalent anticompetitive effect. It is Google\u2019s sole responsibility to ensure compliance. And it is for Google to explain how it intends to do so. I have no reason to believe that Google will not comply.\u201d Commenting on the Commission decision in a statement, Google\u2019s Kent Walker, SVP and general counsel, said: \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case.\u201d \u201cWhen you shop online, you want to find the products you\u2019re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. That\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,\u201d he added. The company said it will \u201creview the Commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal\u201d. Vestager further noted that \u201canyone who has suffered damage from Google\u2019s illegal behavior can claim compensation from Google before national courts\u201d. Another key additional point of today\u2019s decision is that the Commission has found Google to be a dominant company in Internet search \u2014 a finding which will now feed into any additional EU antitrust investigations into its behavior. Not just other existing formal investigations, such as pertaining to Google\u2019s search advertising; during the press conference Vestager noted that her department is also aware of complaints pertaining to other Google products, such as image search, maps and travel search. Although she stressed there are no formal investigations into those products at this point. \u201cA few words on concerns that Google may have abused its dominance as a search engine to give an illegal advantage to Google products other than Google Shopping,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking into this \u2014 and today\u2019s decision is a precedent. A precedent which can be used as a framework to analyze the legality of such conduct.\u201d Her department would, however, be looking closely at the particular \u201ccharacteristics, detail and difference\u201d \u2014 as well as \u201cthe facts\u201d \u2014 in each additional market where concerns are held about a Google product, she added. \u201cToday\u2019s decision shows that in Europe companies must compete on their merits,\u201d said Vestager. \u201cRegardless of whether they operate online or on high streets, regardless of whether they\u2019re European or not. We invite you to make the most out of the European market, and the potential of 500 million citizens \u2014 and therefore 500 million potential customers. And we congratulate you for being successful. \u201cBut the applause stops when you stop competing on the merits. You\u2019ll never get a free pass to stop competing on the merits \u2014 neither in the market you dominate, nor in other markets.\u201d Dominant companies, as Google has now been formally judged, \u201cneed to be more vigilant\u201d and have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to ensure they are not in breach of antitrust rules, she added, stressing this applied both \u201cin the market where it\u2019s dominant\u201d and \u201cin any other market\u201d. Welcoming the Commission\u2019s decision, Shivaun Raff, CEO and co-founder of Foundem, the lead complainant in the case, said: \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s announcement that the European Commission has adopted a Prohibition Decision in the Google Search case.\u00a0Although the record-breaking \u20ac2.42BN fine is likely to dominate the headlines, the prohibition of Google\u2019s immensely harmful search manipulation practices is far more important.\u00a0 There can\u2019t have been many Competition cases where the stakes for consumers, businesses, and innovation were any higher. \u201cFor well over a decade, Google\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online. Left unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power. Google can deploy its insidious search manipulation practices to commandeer the lion\u2019s share of traffic and revenues in virtually any online sector of its choosing, quietly crushing competition, innovation, and consumer choice in the process.\u201d The Commission still has two outstanding formal investigations into Google\u2019s business \u2014 into its search advertising practices, and how it bundles other Google products with its Android mobile OS (which in some European markets has around an 80 per cent marketshare ). On these ongoing investigations, Vestager had chilling words for Google \u2014 suggesting it is also inclining towards a conclusion of anticompetitive behavior. Although she emphasized no final decision has been made. She said: \u201cWe are also making good progress with our two other pending enquiries into certain Google practices concerning Android, as well as search advertising. Our preliminary \u2014 and this is of course important, these are preliminary \u2014 conclusions in relation to both practices is that they breach EU antitrust rules.\u201d \u00a0 Froogle > Google Product Search > Google Shopping\u00a0 The Europe Union\u2019s investigation into\u00a0complaints about the Google\u00a0Shopping service (previously called \u2018Froogle\u2019 and then \u2018Google Product Search\u2019) dates back more than six years, although the Commission only issued a formal Statement of Objections (SO) in April 2015 , extending that in July last year \u00a0with further objections \u2014 when it also issued objections against\u00a0AdSense. A third EC antitrust investigation pertains to Google\u2019s mobile OS, Android , and also remains ongoing. The bloc\u2019s law puts a special obligation on dominant companies not to abuse their power to try to harm existing competitors or block new entrants. And, in Google\u2019s case, its search engine is massively dominant in the region \u2014 accounting for more than\u00a0 90 per cent of the search market in Europe . The complainants in the Google Shopping case have accused the company of demoting rival vertical search services in its general search results, and thereby depriving their businesses of scale and market access. It has also been accused of positioning its own shopping service prominently in search results. The original complaint \u00a0to the EC that Google had manipulated search results was made to the Commission by shopping comparison site, Foundem, in 2009 \u2014 who said its service effectively vanished from Google search results weeks after launch in 2006, and was not reindexed until years later \u2014 to the evident detriment of the business. A formal investigation into this complaint was opened by the EU in 2012, under the prior competition commissioner, who went on to reject three proposed settlements from Google. Current competition commissioner Vestager took up the post in 2014 \u2014 by which time complainants relating to the case numbered more than two dozen. She went on to issue formal charges \u00a0against Google Shopping in 2015, and supplemental charges in 2016. Last fall the Commission gave Google a series of extensions to respond to these charges. The company\u2019s formal response finally came in November \u00a0\u2014 when it argued: \u201cThere is simply no meaningful correlation between the evolution of our search services and the performance of price comparison sites.\u201d Evidently the Commission disagreed with Google\u2019s defense of its behavior. Vestager touched on some of the company\u2019s arguments in a Q&A during the press conference \u2014 saying it had analyzed and dismissed the notion that general Internet search is in competition with search within the \u201cAmazon universe\u201d, for example, as Google has tried to argue. \u201cExactly this line of thinking and these argument was looked into in depth before we sent the supplementary statement of objection. And there we say we do not find that Google Shopping is in competition with Amazon and eBay and the like,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the reason is because they are different. In Amazon and eBay you can search within the Amazon and eBay universe of different retailers. \u201cOne of the things that you find in Google Shopping is, for instance, some of the major brands that you do not find in Amazon. Because these brands they would like themselves to have the consumer contact \u2014 their search pattern, their payment information, the information about what they have bought lately. You can find them on Google Shopping, you cannot find them in the Amazon universe. You also see that in the relationship with other shopping comparison services. Amazon could be a customer of Google Shopping but another comparison shopping service cannot be a customer of Google Shopping.\u201d \u201cThe competition that should be fierce should be the competition between shopping comparison services \u2014 and this is exactly the point of this case, that Google has used its dominant position in general Internet search to promote itself and demote its rivals of shopping comparison services in this particular market,\u201d she added. In a blog post responding to the Commission\u2019s ruling at greater length today, Google continues to dispute the Commission\u2019s analysis \u2014 with Walker arguing that consumers shopping online want to find products \u201cquickly and easily\u201d, and that\u2019s why it links directly to products rather than to shopping comparison services. \u201cThat\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe believe the European Commission\u2019s online shopping decision underestimates the value of those\u00a0kinds of fast and easy connections. While some comparison shopping sites naturally want Google to show them more prominently, our data show that people usually prefer links that take them directly to the products they want, not to websites where they have to repeat their searches.\u201d \u201cWe think our current shopping results are useful and are a much-improved version of the text-only ads we showed a decade ago. Showing ads that include pictures, ratings, and prices benefits us, our advertisers, and most of all, our users. And we show them only when your feedback tells us they are relevant. Thousands of European merchants use these ads to compete with larger companies like Amazon and eBay,\u201d he adds. During today\u2019s press conference Vestager spent some time detailing her approach to the case, which she inherited from prior commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia , \u00a0after his attempts at reaching settlement solutions with Google had failed. \u201cI chose to take the case forward in a different way,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore reaching today\u2019s conclusion we have analyzed huge quantities of data. This includes 5.2TB of actual search results from Google \u2014 that is more or less the equivalent of 1.7BN search queries. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of data. And it is of course needed \u2014 because our decision has to be based on firm evidence. We have to prove our points, even if they may seem intuitive.\u201d She noted, for example, that the Commission looked at the impact of having a prominent place in Google\u2019s search results \u2014 first analyzing studies on user click behavior, which she said \u201cindicated there is a link\u201d (i.e. between a prominent placement and more traffic). But also running further tests to determine whether users are clicking on the top result because it\u2019s more relevant, rather than because it\u2019s most prominent. \u201cWe simulated what happens when you swap the ranking of generic results \u2014 and this confirmed that the same result receives significantly more traffic when ranked higher up,\u201d she noted. And while she said the EC had not found specific evidence of intent by Google \u201cwhen it comes to demoting rivals\u201d, it has evidently found enough evidence of the impact of systematic demotions of rival services by Google\u2019s algorithms, and the contrary promotion of its own services, to conclude that Google\u2019s behavior breaches EU antitrust law. \u201cThe Commission found evidence of sudden drops in clicks on certain rival websites of more than 90 per cent after Google applied demotions,\u201d noted Vestager. \u201cSome of them adapted and managed to recover some of the traffic, but never in full.\u201d \u201cThere are high barriers to entry in the market. The more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. The profit generated in term can be used to attract even more consumers, similarly the more data a search engine gathers from consumers, well, the better equipped it is to improve its results,\u201d she added. She said Google has implemented its \u201cillegal practices\u201d pertaining to price comparison services everywhere it offers its own comparison shopping service \u2014 starting as early as 2008, in Germany and the UK, followed by France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the Czech Republic and finally Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden; an area which she said has some 418 million citizens. \u201cGoogle\u2019s practices have deprived millions of European consumers of the full benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation,\u201d she added. The Commission\u2019s full decision will be published online in due course, according to Vestager, after it has agreed with Google and third parties involved in the case on any confidential \u201cbusiness secrets\u201d that need to be redacted.", "title_html": "<h1 class=\"article__title\">Google fined $2.7BN for EU antitrust violations over shopping searches</h1> ", "url":

target=\"_blank\">European Commission <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has fined <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1784_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google a record-breaking \u20ac2.42 billion</a>\u00a0(~$2.73BN) for antitrust violations pertaining to its\u00a0<a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4780_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s Shopping</a> search comparison service \u2014 in what is widely considered the most significant antitrust ruling in Europe since the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp_v_Commission\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2004 Microsoft decision</a>.</p>\n<p>For some context on the size of the fine, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"google\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> (Alphabet\u2019s) full year revenue for 2016 was <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266206/googles-annual-global-revenue/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">almost $90BN</a>. The Commission said the fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of Google\u2019s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 EEA (European Economic Area) countries concerned.</p>\n<p>Its finding states that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google has systematically given prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service</strong>: when a consumer enters a query into the Google search engine in relation to which Google\u2019s comparison shopping service wants to show results, these are displayed at or near the top of the search results.</li>\n<li><strong>Google has demoted rival comparison shopping services in its search results</strong>: rival comparison shopping services appear in Google\u2019s search results on the basis of Google\u2019s generic search algorithms. Google has included a number of criteria in these algorithms, as a result of which rival comparison shopping services are demoted. Evidence shows that even the most highly ranked rival service appears on average only on page four of Google\u2019s search results, and others appear even further down. Google\u2019s own comparison shopping service is not subject to Google\u2019s generic search algorithms, including such demotions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, the EC said it found Google\u2019s comparison shopping service is much more visible to consumers in Google\u2019s search results, while rival comparison shopping services are much less visible.</p>\n<p>Speaking during a press conference about the ruling, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: \u201cGoogle has given its own comparison shopping service an illegal advantage by abusing its dominance in general Internet search. It has promoted its own service, and demoted rival services. It has harmed competition and consumers. That\u2019s illegal under EU antitrust rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis decision requires Google to change the way it operates, and to face the consequences of its actions,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>Google must end the censured conduct within 90 days \u2014 or face additional penalty payments of up to 5 per cent of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, its parent company, for each day of non-compliance. (Although any such fine for non-compliance would require a separate Commission decision \u2014 but would be backdated to the date of when the non-compliance started).</p>\n<p>In an official statement on the decision, Vestager noted: \u201cGoogle has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing. But Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vestager confirmed it will be up to Google to come up with a remedy to comply with the Commission\u2019s decision \u2014 although it will also face (likely years of) being closely monitored by regulators for compliance.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe decision requires Google to stop its illegal conduct within 90 days. And Google must respect a simple principle \u2014 it has to give equal treatment to rival comparison shopping services and to its own. It has to apply the same method and processes to position and display its own and rival comparison shopping services in its search results,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis means that Google cannot simply stop dong what it\u2019s doing now and replace it with other practices that have the same or an equivalent anticompetitive effect. It is Google\u2019s sole responsibility to ensure compliance. And it is for Google to explain how it intends to do so. I have no reason to believe that Google will not comply.\u201d</p>\n<p>Commenting on the Commission decision in a statement, Google\u2019s Kent Walker, SVP and general counsel, said: \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you shop online, you want to find the products you\u2019re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. That\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>The company said it will \u201creview the Commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal\u201d.</p>\n<p>Vestager further noted that \u201canyone who has suffered damage from Google\u2019s illegal behavior can claim compensation from Google before national courts\u201d.</p>\n<p>Another key additional point of today\u2019s decision is that the Commission has found Google to be a dominant company in Internet search \u2014 a finding which will now feed into any additional EU antitrust investigations into its behavior.</p>\n<p>Not just other existing formal investigations, such as pertaining to Google\u2019s search advertising; during the press conference Vestager noted that her department is also aware of complaints pertaining to other Google products, such as image search, maps and travel search. Although she stressed there are no formal investigations into those products at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cA few words on concerns that Google may have abused its dominance as a search engine to give an illegal advantage to Google products other than Google Shopping,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking into this \u2014 and today\u2019s decision is a precedent. A precedent which can be used as a framework to analyze the legality of such conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her department would, however, be looking closely at the particular \u201ccharacteristics, detail and difference\u201d \u2014 as well as \u201cthe facts\u201d \u2014 in each additional market where concerns are held about a Google product, she added.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s decision shows that in Europe companies must compete on their merits,\u201d said Vestager. \u201cRegardless of whether they operate online or on high streets, regardless of whether they\u2019re European or not. We invite you to make the most out of the European market, and the potential of 500 million citizens \u2014 and therefore 500 million potential customers. And we congratulate you for being successful.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the applause stops when you stop competing on the merits. You\u2019ll never get a free pass to stop competing on the merits \u2014 neither in the market you dominate, nor in other markets.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1508542\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508542\" height=\"374\" sizes=\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\" src=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png 667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=50,28 50w\" width=\"667\"/></a></p>\n<p>Dominant companies, as Google has now been formally judged, \u201cneed to be more vigilant\u201d and have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to ensure they are not in breach of antitrust rules, she added, stressing this applied both \u201cin the market where it\u2019s dominant\u201d and \u201cin any other market\u201d.</p>\n<p>Welcoming the Commission\u2019s decision, Shivaun Raff, CEO and co-founder of Foundem, the lead complainant in the case, said: \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s announcement that the European Commission has adopted a Prohibition Decision in the Google Search case.\u00a0Although the record-breaking \u20ac2.42BN fine is likely to dominate the headlines, the prohibition of Google\u2019s immensely harmful search manipulation practices is far more important.\u00a0 There can\u2019t have been many Competition cases where the stakes for consumers, businesses, and innovation were any higher.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor well over a decade, Google\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online. Left unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power. Google can deploy its insidious search manipulation practices to commandeer the lion\u2019s share of traffic and revenues in virtually any online sector of its choosing, quietly crushing competition, innovation, and consumer choice in the process.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Commission still has two outstanding formal investigations into Google\u2019s business \u2014 into its search advertising practices, and how it bundles other Google products with its Android mobile OS (which in some European markets has around an <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/260419/market-share-held-by-smartphone-operating-systems-in-spain/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">80 per cent marketshare</a>).</p>\n<p>On these ongoing investigations, Vestager had chilling words for Google \u2014 suggesting it is also inclining towards a conclusion of anticompetitive behavior. Although she emphasized no final decision has been made.</p>\n<p>She said: \u201cWe are also making good progress with our two other pending enquiries into certain Google practices concerning Android, as well as search advertising. Our preliminary \u2014 and this is of course important, these are preliminary \u2014 conclusions in relation to both practices is that they breach EU antitrust rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Froogle &gt; Google Product Search &gt; Google Shopping\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The Europe Union\u2019s investigation into\u00a0complaints about the Google\u00a0Shopping service (previously called \u2018Froogle\u2019 and then \u2018Google Product Search\u2019) dates back more than six years, although the Commission only issued a formal Statement of Objections (SO) in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/04/15/google-shopping-so-android-probe/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">April 2015</a>, extending that in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/google-under-fire-again-from-europes-antitrust-regulator-over-adsense-comparison-shopping/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">July last year</a>\u00a0with further objections \u2014 when it also issued objections against\u00a0AdSense.</p>\n<p>A third EC antitrust investigation pertains to <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/europes-antitrust-chief-confirms-android-objections/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s mobile OS, Android</a>, and also remains ongoing.</p>\n<p>The bloc\u2019s law puts a special obligation on dominant companies not to abuse their power to try to harm existing competitors or block new entrants. And, in Google\u2019s case, its search engine is massively dominant in the region \u2014 accounting for more than\u00a0<a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4781_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">90 per cent of the search market in Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>The complainants in the Google Shopping case have accused the company of demoting rival vertical search services in its general search results, and thereby depriving their businesses of scale and market access. It has also been accused of positioning its own shopping service prominently in search results.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/30/google-foundem-ec-competition-rules\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">original complaint</a>\u00a0to the EC that Google had manipulated search results was made to the Commission by shopping comparison site, Foundem, in 2009 \u2014 who said its service effectively vanished from Google search results weeks after launch in 2006, and was not reindexed until years later \u2014 to the evident detriment of the business.</p>\n<p>A formal investigation into this complaint was opened by the EU in 2012, under the prior competition commissioner, who went on to reject three proposed settlements from Google.</p>\n<p>Current competition commissioner Vestager took up the post in 2014 \u2014 by which time complainants relating to the case numbered more than two dozen. She went on to issue <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4780_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">formal charges</a>\u00a0against Google Shopping in 2015, and <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2532_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">supplemental charges</a> in 2016.</p>\n<p>Last fall the Commission gave Google a <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/google-gets-another-extension-to-reply-to-eu-antitrust-shopping-charge/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">series of extensions</a> to respond to these charges. The company\u2019s formal response finally came in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/11/03/google-formally-rebuts-eu-antitrust-charges-against-shopping-adsense/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">November</a>\u00a0\u2014 when it argued: \u201cThere is simply no meaningful correlation between the evolution of our search services and the performance of price comparison sites.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evidently the Commission disagreed with Google\u2019s defense of its behavior.</p>\n<p>Vestager touched on some of the company\u2019s arguments in a Q&amp;A during the press conference \u2014 saying it had analyzed and dismissed the notion that general Internet search is in competition with search within the \u201cAmazon universe\u201d, for example, as Google has tried to argue.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly this line of thinking and these argument was looked into in depth before we sent the supplementary statement of objection. And there we say we do not find that Google Shopping is in competition with Amazon and eBay and the like,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the reason is because they are different. In Amazon and eBay you can search within the Amazon and eBay universe of different retailers.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things that you find in Google Shopping is, for instance, some of the major brands that you do not find in Amazon. Because these brands they would like themselves to have the consumer contact \u2014 their search pattern, their payment information, the information about what they have bought lately. You can find them on Google Shopping, you cannot find them in the Amazon universe. You also see that in the relationship with other shopping comparison services. Amazon could be a customer of Google Shopping but another comparison shopping service cannot be a customer of Google Shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe competition that should be fierce should be the competition between shopping comparison services \u2014 and this is exactly the point of this case, that Google has used its dominant position in general Internet search to promote itself and demote its rivals of shopping comparison services in this particular market,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/topics/google-europe/european-commission-decision-shopping-google-story/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> responding to the Commission\u2019s ruling at greater length today, Google continues to dispute the Commission\u2019s analysis \u2014 with Walker arguing that consumers shopping online want to find products \u201cquickly and easily\u201d, and that\u2019s why it links directly to products rather than to shopping comparison services.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe believe the European Commission\u2019s online shopping decision underestimates the value of those\u00a0kinds of fast and easy connections. While some comparison shopping sites naturally want Google to show them more prominently, our data show that people usually prefer links that take them directly to the products they want, not to websites where they have to repeat their searches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe think our current shopping results are useful and are a much-improved version of the text-only ads we showed a decade ago. Showing ads that include pictures, ratings, and prices benefits us, our advertisers, and most of all, our users. And we show them only when your feedback tells us they are relevant. Thousands of European merchants use these ads to compete with larger companies like Amazon and eBay,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>During today\u2019s press conference Vestager spent some time detailing her approach to the case, which she inherited from prior commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia<em>,</em>\u00a0after his attempts at reaching settlement solutions with Google had failed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI chose to take the case forward in a different way,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore reaching today\u2019s conclusion we have analyzed huge quantities of data. This includes 5.2TB of actual search results from Google \u2014 that is more or less the equivalent of 1.7BN search queries.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of data. And it is of course needed \u2014 because our decision has to be based on firm evidence. We have to prove our points, even if they may seem intuitive.\u201d</p>\n<p>She noted, for example, that the Commission looked at the impact of having a prominent place in Google\u2019s search results \u2014 first analyzing studies on user click behavior, which she said \u201cindicated there is a link\u201d (i.e. between a prominent placement and more traffic). But also running further tests to determine whether users are clicking on the top result because it\u2019s more relevant, rather than because it\u2019s most prominent.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe simulated what happens when you swap the ranking of generic results \u2014 and this confirmed that the same result receives significantly more traffic when ranked higher up,\u201d she noted.</p>\n<p>And while she said the EC had not found specific evidence of intent by Google \u201cwhen it comes to demoting rivals\u201d, it has evidently found enough evidence of the impact of systematic demotions of rival services by Google\u2019s algorithms, and the contrary promotion of its own services, to conclude that Google\u2019s behavior breaches EU antitrust law.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Commission found evidence of sudden drops in clicks on certain rival websites of more than 90 per cent after Google applied demotions,\u201d noted Vestager. \u201cSome of them adapted and managed to recover some of the traffic, but never in full.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are high barriers to entry in the market. The more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. The profit generated in term can be used to attract even more consumers, similarly the more data a search engine gathers from consumers, well, the better equipped it is to improve its results,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>She said Google has implemented its \u201cillegal practices\u201d pertaining to price comparison services everywhere it offers its own comparison shopping service \u2014 starting as early as 2008, in Germany and the UK, followed by France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the Czech Republic and finally Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden; an area which she said has some 418 million citizens.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoogle\u2019s practices have deprived millions of European consumers of the full benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>The Commission\u2019s full decision will be published online in due course, according to Vestager, after it has agreed with Google and third parties involved in the case on any confidential \u201cbusiness secrets\u201d that need to be redacted.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n<input class=\"shortlink\" readonly=\"\" title=\"Article Shortlink\" type=\"text\"

The Commission said the fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of Google&#8217;s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 EEA (European Economic Area) countries concerned.<\\/p>\\n<p>Its finding states that:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Google has systematically given prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service<\\/strong>: when a consumer enters a query into the Google search engine in relation to which Google&#8217;s comparison shopping service wants to show results, these are displayed at or near the top of the search results.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>Google has demoted rival comparison shopping services in its search results<\\/strong>: rival comparison shopping services appear in Google&#8217;s search results on the basis of Google&#8217;s generic search algorithms. Google has included a number of criteria in these algorithms, as a result of which rival comparison shopping services are demoted. Evidence shows that even the most highly ranked rival service appears on average only on page four of Google&#8217;s search results, and others appear even further down. Google&#8217;s own comparison shopping service is not subject to Google&#8217;s generic search algorithms, including such demotions.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p>As a result, the EC said it found Google&#8217;s comparison shopping service is much more visible to consumers in Google&#8217;s search results, while rival comparison shopping services are much less visible.<\\/p>\\n<p>Speaking during a press conference about the ruling, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: &#8220;Google has given its own comparison shopping service an illegal advantage by abusing its dominance in general Internet search. It has promoted its own service, and demoted rival services. It has harmed competition and consumers. That&#8217;s illegal under EU antitrust rules.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;This decision requires Google to change the way it operates, and to face the consequences of its actions,&#8221; she added.<\\/p>\\n<p>Google must end the censured conduct within 90 days &#8212; or face additional penalty payments of up to 5 per cent of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, its parent company, for each day of non-compliance. (Although any such fine for non-compliance would require a separate Commission decision &#8212; but would be backdated to the date of when the non-compliance started).<\\/p>\\n<p>In an official statement on the decision, Vestager noted: &#8220;Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That&#8217;s a good thing. But Google&#8217;s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn&#8217;t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n<p>Vestager confirmed it will be up to Google to come up with a remedy to comply with the Commission&#8217;s decision &#8212; although it will also face (likely years of) being closely monitored by regulators for compliance.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;The decision requires Google to stop its illegal conduct within 90 days. And Google must respect a simple principle &#8212; it has to give equal treatment to rival comparison shopping services and to its own. It has to apply the same method and processes to position and display its own and rival comparison shopping services in its search results,&#8221; she added.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;This means that Google cannot simply stop dong what it&#8217;s doing now and replace it with other practices that have the same or an equivalent anticompetitive effect. It is Google&#8217;s sole responsibility to ensure compliance. And it is for Google to explain how it intends to do so. I have no reason to believe that Google will not comply.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Commenting on the Commission decision in a statement, Google&#8217;s Kent Walker, SVP and general counsel, said: \\u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission\\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;When you shop online, you want to find the products you\\u2019re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. That&#8217;s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,&#8221; he added.<\\/p>\\n<p>The company said it will &#8220;review the Commission\\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>Vestager further noted that &#8220;anyone who has suffered damage from Google&#8217;s illegal behavior can claim compensation from Google before national courts&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>Another key additional point of today&#8217;s decision is that the Commission has found Google to be a dominant company in Internet search &#8212; a finding which will now feed into any additional EU antitrust investigations into its behavior.<\\/p>\\n<p>Not just other existing formal investigations, such as pertaining to Google&#8217;s search advertising; during the press conference Vestager noted that her department is also aware of complaints pertaining to other Google products, such as image search, maps and travel search. Although she stressed there are no formal investigations into those products at this point.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;A few words on concerns that Google may have abused its dominance as a search engine to give an illegal advantage to Google products other than Google Shopping,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been looking into this &#8212; and today&#8217;s decision is a precedent. A precedent which can be used as a framework to analyze the legality of such conduct.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Her department would, however, be looking closely at the particular &#8220;characteristics, detail and difference&#8221; &#8212; as well as &#8220;the facts&#8221; &#8212; in each additional market where concerns are held about a Google product, she added.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s decision shows that in Europe companies must compete on their merits,&#8221; said Vestager. &#8220;Regardless of whether they operate online or on high streets, regardless of whether they&#8217;re European or not. We invite you to make the most out of the European market, and the potential of 500 million citizens &#8212; and therefore 500 million potential customers. And we congratulate you for being successful.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;But the applause stops when you stop competing on the merits. You&#8217;ll never get a free pass to stop competing on the merits &#8212; neither in the market you dominate, nor in other markets.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2017\\/06\\/27\\/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches\\/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm\\/\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-1508542\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508542\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/06\\/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"667\\\" height=\\\"374\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/06\\/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png 667w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/06\\/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/06\\/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=300,168 300w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/06\\/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=50,28 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\\\" \\/><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>Dominant companies, as Google has now been formally judged, &#8220;need to be more vigilant&#8221; and have a &#8220;special responsibility&#8221; to ensure they are not in breach of antitrust rules, she added, stressing this applied both &#8220;in the market where it&#8217;s dominant&#8221; and &#8220;in any other market&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>Welcoming the Commission&#8217;s decision, Shivaun Raff, CEO and co-founder of Foundem, the lead complainant in the case, said: &#8220;We welcome today\\u2019s announcement that the European Commission has adopted a Prohibition Decision in the Google Search case.\\u00a0Although the record-breaking \\u20ac2.42BN fine is likely to dominate the headlines, the prohibition of Google\\u2019s immensely harmful search manipulation practices is far more important.\\u00a0 There can\\u2019t have been many Competition cases where the stakes for consumers, businesses, and innovation were any higher.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;For well over a decade, Google\\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online. Left unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power. Google can deploy its insidious search manipulation practices to commandeer the lion\\u2019s share of traffic and revenues in virtually any online sector of its choosing, quietly crushing competition, innovation, and consumer choice in the process.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The Commission still has two outstanding formal investigations into Google&#8217;s business &#8212; into its search advertising practices, and how it bundles other Google products with its Android mobile OS (which in some European markets has around an <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.statista.com\\/statistics\\/260419\\/market-share-held-by-smartphone-operating-systems-in-spain\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">80 per cent marketshare<\\/a>).<\\/p>\\n<p>On these ongoing investigations, Vestager had chilling words for Google &#8212; suggesting it is also inclining towards a conclusion of anticompetitive behavior. Although she emphasized no final decision has been made.<\\/p>\\n<p>She said: &#8220;We are also making good progress with our two other pending enquiries into certain Google practices concerning Android, as well as search advertising. Our preliminary &#8212; and this is of course important, these are preliminary &#8212; conclusions in relation to both practices is that they breach EU antitrust rules.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Froogle &gt; Google Product Search &gt; Google Shopping\\u00a0<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>The Europe Union\\u2019s investigation into\\u00a0complaints about the Google\\u00a0Shopping service (previously called &#8216;Froogle&#8217; and then &#8216;Google Product Search&#8217;) dates back more than six years, although the Commission only issued a formal Statement of Objections (SO) in <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2015\\/04\\/15\\/google-shopping-so-android-probe\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">April 2015<\\/a>, extending that in <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/07\\/14\\/google-under-fire-again-from-europes-antitrust-regulator-over-adsense-comparison-shopping\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">July last year<\\/a>\\u00a0with further objections &#8212; when it also issued objections against\\u00a0AdSense.<\\/p>\\n<p>A third EC antitrust investigation pertains to <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/04\\/20\\/europes-antitrust-chief-confirms-android-objections\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Google&#8217;s mobile OS, Android<\\/a>, and also remains ongoing.<\\/p>\\n<p>The bloc&#8217;s law puts a special obligation on dominant companies not to abuse their power to try to harm existing competitors or block new entrants.

And there we say we do not find that Google Shopping is in competition with Amazon and eBay and the like,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And the reason is because they are different. In Amazon and eBay you can search within the Amazon and eBay universe of different retailers.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;One of the things that you find in Google Shopping is, for instance, some of the major brands that you do not find in Amazon. Because these brands they would like themselves to have the consumer contact &#8212; their search pattern, their payment information, the information about what they have bought lately. You can find them on Google Shopping, you cannot find them in the Amazon universe. You also see that in the relationship with other shopping comparison services. Amazon could be a customer of Google Shopping but another comparison shopping service cannot be a customer of Google Shopping.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;The competition that should be fierce should be the competition between shopping comparison services &#8212; and this is exactly the point of this case, that Google has used its dominant position in general Internet search to promote itself and demote its rivals of shopping comparison services in this particular market,&#8221; she added.<\\/p>\\n<p>In a <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.blog.google\\/topics\\/google-europe\\/european-commission-decision-shopping-google-story\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">blog post<\\/a> responding to the Commission&#8217;s ruling at greater length today, Google continues to dispute the Commission&#8217;s analysis &#8212; with Walker arguing that consumers shopping online want to find products &#8220;quickly and easily&#8221;, and that&#8217;s why it links directly to products rather than to shopping comparison services.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;We believe the European Commission\\u2019s online shopping decision underestimates the value of those\\u00a0kinds of fast and easy connections. While some comparison shopping sites naturally want Google to show them more prominently, our data show that people usually prefer links that take them directly to the products they want, not to websites where they have to repeat their searches.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We think our current shopping results are useful and are a much-improved version of the text-only ads we showed a decade ago. Showing ads that include pictures, ratings, and prices benefits us, our advertisers, and most of all, our users. And we show them only when your feedback tells us they are relevant. Thousands of European merchants use these ads to compete with larger companies like Amazon and eBay,&#8221; he adds.<\\/p>\\n<p>During today&#8217;s press conference Vestager spent some time detailing her approach to the case, which she inherited from prior commissioner, Joaqu\\u00edn Almunia<em>,<\\/em>\\u00a0after his attempts at reaching settlement solutions with Google had failed.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I chose to take the case forward in a different way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Before reaching today&#8217;s conclusion we have analyzed huge quantities of data. This includes 5.2TB of actual search results from Google &#8212; that is more or less the equivalent of 1.7BN search queries.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of data. And it is of course needed &#8212; because our decision has to be based on firm evidence. We have to prove our points, even if they may seem intuitive.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>She noted, for example, that the Commission looked at the impact of having a prominent place in Google&#8217;s search results &#8212; first analyzing studies on user click behavior, which she said &#8220;indicated there is a link&#8221; (i.e. between a prominent placement and more traffic). But also running further tests to determine whether users are clicking on the top result because it&#8217;s more relevant, rather than because it&#8217;s most prominent.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We simulated what happens when you swap the ranking of generic results &#8212; and this confirmed that the same result receives significantly more traffic when ranked higher up,&#8221; she noted.<\\/p>\\n<p>And while she said the EC had not found specific evidence of intent by Google &#8220;when it comes to demoting rivals&#8221;, it has evidently found enough evidence of the impact of systematic demotions of rival services by Google&#8217;s algorithms, and the contrary promotion of its own services, to conclude that Google&#8217;s behavior breaches EU antitrust law.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Commission found evidence of sudden drops in clicks on certain rival websites of more than 90 per cent after Google applied demotions,&#8221; noted Vestager. &#8220;Some of them adapted and managed to recover some of the traffic, but never in full.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;There are high barriers to entry in the market. The more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. The profit generated in term can be used to attract even more consumers, similarly the more data a search engine gathers from consumers, well, the better equipped it is to improve its results,&#8221; she added.<\\/p>\\n<p>She said Google has implemented its &#8220;illegal practices&#8221; pertaining to price comparison services everywhere it offers its own comparison shopping service &#8212; starting as early as 2008, in Germany and the UK, followed by France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the Czech Republic and finally Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden;

to its\u00a0<a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4780_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s Shopping</a> search comparison service \u2014 in what is widely considered the most significant antitrust ruling in Europe since the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp_v_Commission\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2004 Microsoft decision</a>.</p> <p>For some context on the size of the fine, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"google\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> (Alphabet\u2019s) full year revenue for 2016 was <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266206/googles-annual-global-revenue/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">almost $90BN</a>. The Commission said the fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of Google\u2019s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 EEA (European Economic Area) countries concerned.</p> <p>Its finding states that:</p> <p>As a result, the EC said it found Google\u2019s comparison shopping service is much more visible to consumers in Google\u2019s search results, while rival comparison shopping services are much less visible.</p> <p>Speaking during a press conference about the ruling, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: \u201cGoogle has given its own comparison shopping service an illegal advantage by abusing its dominance in general Internet search. It has promoted its own service, and demoted rival services. It has harmed competition and consumers. That\u2019s illegal under EU antitrust rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis decision requires Google to change the way it operates, and to face the consequences of its actions,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Google must end the censured conduct within 90 days \u2014 or face additional penalty payments of up to 5 per cent of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, its parent company, for each day of non-compliance. (Although any such fine for non-compliance would require a separate Commission decision \u2014 but would be backdated to the date of when the non-compliance started).</p> <p>In an official statement on the decision, Vestager noted: \u201cGoogle has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives. That\u2019s a good thing. But Google\u2019s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn\u2019t just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Vestager confirmed it will be up to Google to come up with a remedy to comply with the Commission\u2019s decision \u2014 although it will also face (likely years of) being closely monitored by regulators for compliance.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision requires Google to stop its illegal conduct within 90 days. And Google must respect a simple principle \u2014 it has to give equal treatment to rival comparison shopping services and to its own. It has to apply the same method and processes to position and display its own and rival comparison shopping services in its search results,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that Google cannot simply stop dong what it\u2019s doing now and replace it with other practices that have the same or an equivalent anticompetitive effect. It is Google\u2019s sole responsibility to ensure compliance. And it is for Google to explain how it intends to do so. I have no reason to believe that Google will not comply.\u201d</p> <p>Commenting on the Commission decision in a statement, Google\u2019s Kent Walker, SVP and general counsel, said: \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you shop online, you want to find the products you\u2019re looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. That\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The company said it will \u201creview the Commission\u2019s decision in detail as we consider an appeal\u201d.</p> <p>Vestager further noted that \u201canyone who has suffered damage from Google\u2019s illegal behavior can claim compensation from Google before national courts\u201d.</p> <p>Another key additional point of today\u2019s decision is that the Commission has found Google to be a dominant company in Internet search \u2014 a finding which will now feed into any additional EU antitrust investigations into its behavior.</p> <p>Not just other existing formal investigations, such as pertaining to Google\u2019s search advertising; during the press conference Vestager noted that her department is also aware of complaints pertaining to other Google products, such as image search, maps and travel search. Although she stressed there are no formal investigations into those products at this point.</p> <p>\u201cA few words on concerns that Google may have abused its dominance as a search engine to give an illegal advantage to Google products other than Google Shopping,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking into this \u2014 and today\u2019s decision is a precedent. A precedent which can be used as a framework to analyze the legality of such conduct.\u201d</p> <p>Her department would, however, be looking closely at the particular \u201ccharacteristics, detail and difference\u201d \u2014 as well as \u201cthe facts\u201d \u2014 in each additional market where concerns are held about a Google product, she added.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s decision shows that in Europe companies must compete on their merits,\u201d said Vestager. \u201cRegardless of whether they operate online or on high streets, regardless of whether they\u2019re European or not. We invite you to make the most out of the European market, and the potential of 500 million citizens \u2014 and therefore 500 million potential customers. And we congratulate you for being successful.</p> <p>\u201cBut the applause stops when you stop competing on the merits. You\u2019ll never get a free pass to stop competing on the merits \u2014 neither in the market you dominate, nor in other markets.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1508542\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508542\" height=\"374\" sizes=\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\" src=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png 667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/screen-shot-2017-06-27-at-12-07-53-pm.png?resize=50,28 50w\" width=\"667\"/></a></p> <p>Dominant companies, as Google has now been formally judged, \u201cneed to be more vigilant\u201d and have a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to ensure they are not in breach of antitrust rules, she added, stressing this applied both \u201cin the market where it\u2019s dominant\u201d and \u201cin any other market\u201d.</p> <p>Welcoming the Commission\u2019s decision, Shivaun Raff, CEO and co-founder of Foundem, the lead complainant in the case, said: \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s announcement that the European Commission has adopted a Prohibition Decision in the Google Search case.\u00a0Although the record-breaking \u20ac2.42BN fine is likely to dominate the headlines, the prohibition of Google\u2019s immensely harmful search manipulation practices is far more important.\u00a0 There can\u2019t have been many Competition cases where the stakes for consumers, businesses, and innovation were any higher.</p> <p>\u201cFor well over a decade, Google\u2019s search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online. Left unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power. Google can deploy its insidious search manipulation practices to commandeer the lion\u2019s share of traffic and revenues in virtually any online sector of its choosing, quietly crushing competition, innovation, and consumer choice in the process.\u201d</p> <p>The Commission still has two outstanding formal investigations into Google\u2019s business \u2014 into its search advertising practices, and how it bundles other Google products with its Android mobile OS (which in some European markets has around an <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/260419/market-share-held-by-smartphone-operating-systems-in-spain/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">80 per cent marketshare</a>).</p> <p>On these ongoing investigations, Vestager had chilling words for Google \u2014 suggesting it is also inclining towards a conclusion of anticompetitive behavior. Although she emphasized no final decision has been made.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe are also making good progress with our two other pending enquiries into certain Google practices concerning Android, as well as search advertising. Our preliminary \u2014 and this is of course important, these are preliminary \u2014 conclusions in relation to both practices is that they breach EU antitrust rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Froogle &gt; Google Product Search &gt; Google Shopping\u00a0</strong></p> <p>The Europe Union\u2019s investigation into\u00a0complaints about the Google\u00a0Shopping service (previously called \u2018Froogle\u2019 and then \u2018Google Product Search\u2019) dates back more than six years, although the Commission only issued a formal Statement of Objections (SO) in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/04/15/google-shopping-so-android-probe/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">April 2015</a>, extending that in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/google-under-fire-again-from-europes-antitrust-regulator-over-adsense-comparison-shopping/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">July last year</a>\u00a0with further objections \u2014 when it also issued objections against\u00a0AdSense.</p> <p>A third EC antitrust investigation pertains to <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/europes-antitrust-chief-confirms-android-objections/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s mobile OS, Android</a>, and also remains ongoing.</p> <p>The bloc\u2019s law puts a special obligation on dominant companies not to abuse their power to try to harm existing competitors or block new entrants. And, in Google\u2019s case, its search engine is massively dominant in the region \u2014 accounting for more than\u00a0<a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4781_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">90 per cent of the search market in Europe</a>.</p> <p>The complainants in the Google Shopping case have accused the company of demoting rival vertical search services in its general search results, and thereby depriving their businesses of scale and market access. It has also been accused of positioning its own shopping service prominently in search results.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/30/google-foundem-ec-competition-rules\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">original complaint</a>\u00a0to the EC that Google had manipulated search results was made to the Commission by shopping comparison site, Foundem, in 2009 \u2014 who said its service effectively vanished from Google search results weeks after launch in 2006, and was not reindexed until years later \u2014 to the evident detriment of the business.</p> <p>A formal investigation into this complaint was opened by the EU in 2012, under the prior competition commissioner, who went on to reject three proposed settlements from Google.</p> <p>Current competition commissioner Vestager took up the post in 2014 \u2014 by which time complainants relating to the case numbered more than two dozen. She went on to issue <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4780_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">formal charges</a>\u00a0against Google Shopping in 2015, and <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2532_en.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">supplemental charges</a> in 2016.</p> <p>Last fall the Commission gave Google a <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/google-gets-another-extension-to-reply-to-eu-antitrust-shopping-charge/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">series of extensions</a> to respond to these charges.

And there we say we do not find that Google Shopping is in competition with Amazon and eBay and the like,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the reason is because they are different. In Amazon and eBay you can search within the Amazon and eBay universe of different retailers.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that you find in Google Shopping is, for instance, some of the major brands that you do not find in Amazon. Because these brands they would like themselves to have the consumer contact \u2014 their search pattern, their payment information, the information about what they have bought lately. You can find them on Google Shopping, you cannot find them in the Amazon universe. You also see that in the relationship with other shopping comparison services. Amazon could be a customer of Google Shopping but another comparison shopping service cannot be a customer of Google Shopping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe competition that should be fierce should be the competition between shopping comparison services \u2014 and this is exactly the point of this case, that Google has used its dominant position in general Internet search to promote itself and demote its rivals of shopping comparison services in this particular market,\u201d she added.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/topics/google-europe/european-commission-decision-shopping-google-story/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> responding to the Commission\u2019s ruling at greater length today, Google continues to dispute the Commission\u2019s analysis \u2014 with Walker arguing that consumers shopping online want to find products \u201cquickly and easily\u201d, and that\u2019s why it links directly to products rather than to shopping comparison services.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe believe the European Commission\u2019s online shopping decision underestimates the value of those\u00a0kinds of fast and easy connections. While some comparison shopping sites naturally want Google to show them more prominently, our data show that people usually prefer links that take them directly to the products they want, not to websites where they have to repeat their searches.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe think our current shopping results are useful and are a much-improved version of the text-only ads we showed a decade ago. Showing ads that include pictures, ratings, and prices benefits us, our advertisers, and most of all, our users. And we show them only when your feedback tells us they are relevant. Thousands of European merchants use these ads to compete with larger companies like Amazon and eBay,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>During today\u2019s press conference Vestager spent some time detailing her approach to the case, which she inherited from prior commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia<em>,</em>\u00a0after his attempts at reaching settlement solutions with Google had failed.</p> <p>\u201cI chose to take the case forward in a different way,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore reaching today\u2019s conclusion we have analyzed huge quantities of data. This includes 5.2TB of actual search results from Google \u2014 that is more or less the equivalent of 1.7BN search queries.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of data. And it is of course needed \u2014 because our decision has to be based on firm evidence. We have to prove our points, even if they may seem intuitive.\u201d</p> <p>She noted, for example, that the Commission looked at the impact of having a prominent place in Google\u2019s search results \u2014 first analyzing studies on user click behavior, which she said \u201cindicated there is a link\u201d (i.e. between a prominent placement and more traffic). But also running further tests to determine whether users are clicking on the top result because it\u2019s more relevant, rather than because it\u2019s most prominent.</p> <p>\u201cWe simulated what happens when you swap the ranking of generic results \u2014 and this confirmed that the same result receives significantly more traffic when ranked higher up,\u201d she noted.</p> <p>And while she said the EC had not found specific evidence of intent by Google \u201cwhen it comes to demoting rivals\u201d, it has evidently found enough evidence of the impact of systematic demotions of rival services by Google\u2019s algorithms, and the contrary promotion of its own services, to conclude that Google\u2019s behavior breaches EU antitrust law.</p> <p>\u201cThe Commission found evidence of sudden drops in clicks on certain rival websites of more than 90 per cent after Google applied demotions,\u201d noted Vestager. \u201cSome of them adapted and managed to recover some of the traffic, but never in full.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are high barriers to entry in the market. The more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. The profit generated in term can be used to attract even more consumers, similarly the more data a search engine gathers from consumers, well, the better equipped it is to improve its results,\u201d she added.</p> <p>She said Google has implemented its \u201cillegal practices\u201d pertaining to price comparison services everywhere it offers its own comparison shopping service \u2014 starting as early as 2008, in Germany and the UK, followed by France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the Czech Republic and finally Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden; an area which she said has some 418 million citizens.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle\u2019s practices have deprived millions of European consumers of the full benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The Commission\u2019s full decision will be published online in due course, according to Vestager, after it has agreed with Google and third parties involved in the case on any confidential \u201cbusiness secrets\u201d that need to be redacted.</p> ", "website": "techcrunch"}

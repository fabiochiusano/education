We\u2019ve had <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46020\" target=\"_blank\">Bronze Age weapons</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46031\" target=\"_blank\">Roman copper vessels packed with plants</a>. Now we have a <a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2017/02/28/valuable-collection-of-buried-treasure-found-in-staffordshire/\" target=\"_blank\">group of four ancient gold torcs</a> discovered by metal detectorists in a cow pasture in Leekfrith on the Staffordshire Moorlands. </p>\n<p>The torcs were found last December by Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania. Hambleton had scanned the field some two decades ago without success. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46175\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-430x368.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs.

All they\u2019d found up to that point was trash and a 19th century coin or two, so Hambleton had already packed up his metal detector when Kania pulled a gold torc out of the ground. Then another. And another. And another. Three of them are necklaces, one a bracelet. Three are complete and intact, the fourth broken, likely by agricultural interference. The torcs were about six inches beneath the surface about a meter (three feet) apart from each other. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46169\" height=\"75\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-150x75.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-430x217.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold torc fragment.

The next morning, the finders alerted the Portable Antiquities Scheme to their discovery. Stoke-On-Trent City Council dispatched archaeologists to the field but they found no evidence of further treasure. Hambleton and Kania defied the odds again, though, returning to the spot last Sunday where they discovered the second half of the broken torc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46171\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-200x260.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-430x560.jpg 430w\" title=\"Decorated bracelet torc. Photo courtesy the Staffordshire County Council.\" width=\"115\"/></a>The Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs were examined by Dr. Julia Farley, the British Museum\u2019s Curator of British &amp; European Iron Age Collections. She determined they were not of British origin, but likely from what is today Germany or France. Analysis of the gold content found that it was no less than 80% in every torc, making them more than 18 carat gold which is 75% pure. The torcs weigh between 31 grams for the smallest piece, the incomplete bracelet, and 230 grams for the largest. The one bracelet stirred particular excitement because it is decorated, etched with lines inside loops. This is some of the earliest Celtic art ever discovered in Britain. All of the workmanship on the torcs is extremely high quality. One of them even has an incredibly rare maker\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p>Dr. Farley:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46173\" height=\"68\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-150x68.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-150x68.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-200x91.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-430x197.jpg 430w\" title=\"Twisted gold torc from Leekfrith Hoard.

It dates to around 400\u2013250 BC, and is probably the earliest Iron Age gold work ever discovered in Britain.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the continent who had married into the local community. Piecing together how these objects came to be carefully buried in a Staffordshire field will give us an invaluable insight into life in Iron Age Britain.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46174\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3-200x170.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3-430x367.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold necklace torc from Leekfrith Hoard.

Coroner Ian Smith asked questions of experts about the hoard, its continental origin and how they pieces may have made their way to Leekfrith. After hearing testimony about the torcs\u2019 age and precious metal content, the coroner ruled that the pieces are treasure trove. The next step is for the independent experts of the Treasure Valuation Committee to determine fair value of the torcs. Local museums will then be offered the first opportunity to raise the amount of the valuation. That money will be divided between the finders and the landowner. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46170\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-200x178.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-430x383.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det.jpg 1240w\" title=\"Decoration detail from bracelet.

Some women waited longingly for their lovers on the field, while others sought companionship with the men left behind. There was love that transcended borders, love that lasted the ages, and love for one woman fought over by two different men. In the Love Run, we present you stories of romance and betrayal, of lust and longing, heartbreak and new beginnings \u2013 all the makings of your favourite melodrama, but from real, handwritten sources of real, lived experiences.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46165\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-front-95x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-front-95x150.jpg 95w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-front-191x300.jpg 191w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-front-430x674.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Censor-stamped-postcard-front.jpg 1014w\" title=\"Censor-stamped postcard, front.

The former munitions factory was converted into a forced labour camp for political prisoners which at that time were the Communists and Social Democrats who opposed the Nazi Party. As soon as Hitler was appointed chancellor, he ordered the systematic persecution of his political rivals to consolidate his grip on power. Dachau became a death camp for the slaughter of Jews, homosexuals, Roma and anyone else they deemed inferior during the war, but of course they kept that \u201cWorks Sets You Free\u201d sign (always a blatant lie since from day one none of those political prisoners could ever work their way to freedom), as if the purpose of the camp were labour, not mass-murder. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46153\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl-141x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl-141x150.jpg 141w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl-200x212.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl-430x455.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jourhaus-with-gate-and-inscription-1940s.-Photo-by-Franz-Br\u00fcckl.jpg 566w\" title=\"Jourhaus with gate and inscription, 1940s.

There\u2019s an undated photograph of the gate taken by former political prisoner Franz Br\u00fcckl that shows the sign in place. Researchers believe it was taken immediately after liberation. Another photograph, also unfortunately undated, but taken after Br\u00fcckl\u2019s shows the gate with the inscription removed. An exact replica was created from historical photographs and installed in the gate after the Dachau memorial opened in 1965.

He and his one-time friend and colleague turned nemesis Lucius Cornelius Sulla, each founded a colony in Corsica (Sulla\u2019s was Aleria) which they seeded with their veterans. Mariana was an important center in Roman Corsica, thanks largely to its commercial harbor that was a hub of maritime trade on the Mediterranean. The patron saint of Corsica and of the Principality of Monaco, Saint Devota, was born in Mariana in the late 3rd century and was martyred there in 303 A.D. Her martyrdom inspired many a conversion and by the end of the century Mariana was solidly Christian. The Diocese of Mariana was created in 4th or early 5th century, one of the first Christian dioceses in Corsica. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46135\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sun-feature-in-the-courtyard-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sun feature in the mithraeum courtyard.

Emperor Theodosius I made Christianity the official religion of the Empire in 392 and outlawed all pagan religions, including Mithraism. Some of the objects found in the Mariana sanctuary were damaged in antiquity, most notably the altar, and the sanctuary itself appears to have been deliberately destroyed and filled with rubble. A large Paleochristian church and baptistery complex was built in the city around 400 A.D., the first archaeological traces of Christianity in Corsica. There were likely tensions between the adherents of the religions.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mithras sanctuary found in Corsica\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46126\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46126#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-46115\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46115\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Child\u2019s footprints found in ancient Egyptian mortar\">Child\u2019s footprints found in ancient Egyptian mortar</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, February 24th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46124\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pi-Ramesse excavation at Qantir.

The site at the eastern edge of the Nile Delta about 70 miles northeast of Cairo was once the capital of the pharaoh Ramesses the Great (r. 1279\u20131213 B.C.) and is recorded in ancient sources as a city of great beauty, power and wealth. An estimated 300,000 people lived in the city which covered seven square miles during its heyday, making one of the biggest late Bronze Age cities in the Mediterranean both in area and population. It had a massive temple, riverside mansions, modest mud-brick homes, a planned street grid, a harbour, a system of navigable canals and lakes like Venice, Ramesses\u2019 great palace, industrial works and high-end artisan workshops.</p>\n<p>It was inhabited from the reign of Ramesses until and 1050 B.C. when the branch of the Nile that provided Pi-Ramesse with all of its water silted over. The pharaohs of the 21st Dynasty (1077-943 B.C.) used the former capital as a ready source of building materials. All the splendid architecture \u2014 temple reliefs, obelisks, statues, sphinxes \u2014 were moved whole to the new capital Tanis and reinstalled there. Entire buildings were dismantled in the abandoned city and rebuilt in the new capital. If the buildings weren\u2019t worthy of reassembly at Tanis, they were simply demolished and their stone used for new structures. They were so thorough that nothing of Pi-Ramesse survives above the surface today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46123\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pi-Ramesse-excavation-trench-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pi-Ramesse excavation trench.

An international team of archaeologists based at the <a href=\"http://www.rpmuseum.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Roemer-Pelizaeus-Museum in Hildesheim</a>, Germany, have excavated the site since 1980, discovering, among many other things, the largest bronze foundry ever discovered, glass-making workshops specializing in red glass, faience factories, a chariot manufacturer with massive stables that could accommodate close to 500 horses and a bone workshop that used the bones of animals long-since extinct in Egypt (lions, elephants, giraffes) that can only have been exotic imports in Ramesses\u2019 days.</p>\n<p>From 1996 through 2003, Caesium-Magnetometry was used to take measurements of the ancient city. The technology can differentiate between materials with different magnetic signatures, so for instance since mud brick responds differently than soil, mud-brick structures under the surface became apparent. With the magnetometry data, the team was able to map the layout of Pi-Ramesse. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46117\" height=\"127\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit-150x127.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit-150x127.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit-200x169.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit-430x364.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Broken-painted-plaster-in-mortar-pit.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Broken painted plaster in the mortar pit.

Archaeologists believe this was a construction site for the renovation of a monumental complex, likely a palace or a temple. Pottery sherds found on the spot date the building to between 1300 and 1200 B.C., so either during the reign of Ramesses or shortly thereafter. Near the monumental remains, the team found an intriguing feature this season: a mortar pit. The pit measures about eight by 26 feet and at the bottom an ancient layer of mortar was still extant. Embedded in the mortar were prints left by the pitter-patter of tiny feet.</p>\n<p>The footprints are 5.9-6.6 inches long, so about the size of kids between three and five years old, according to modern growth charts (which may or may not apply). Archaeologists can\u2019t tell yet if they were left by multiple children or if the prints were smeared.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46118\" height=\"76\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar-150x76.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar-200x101.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar-430x219.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/footprint-of-child-captured-in-mortar.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Child footprints left in the mortar pit.

Although no modern concept of banning child labor was in place, the footprints seem to be too small even for children who may have been working.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it appears unlikely that royal kids were left to play in the mud and mortar.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It does feel very satisfyingly squishy between your toes.

The fragments are small and the original paintings appear to have been large-scale, so the team has not yet been able to identify imagery or motif from the pieces. The fragments are of hard plaster, a substance rarely used in Egyptian art, so may indicate foreign craftsmen were employed at the site. Fresco technique \u2014 pigment applied to wet plaster \u2014 is also extremely rare in ancient Egypt. More analysis is needed to determine whether this painted plaster was a fresco.</p>\n<p>Next season, archaeologists will excavate the pit further in the hope of recovering more missing pieces of the colored plaster. They will then try to puzzle them together to determine their motif and size, which will in turn suggest which walls the paintings may have once adorned. From what we know now, it was likely the monumental structure nearby. The mortar pit could have been used in the renovation and the frescoes stripped from the wall to redecorate in a style more au courant with the fashions 1200 B.C. They will also bring in specialists to analyze the footprints.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Child\u2019s footprints found in ancient Egyptian mortar\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46115\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46115#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-46111\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46111\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Galloway Viking Hoard Campaign launched\">Galloway Viking Hoard Campaign launched</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, February 23rd, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32852\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gold-bird-hair-ornament.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Gold bird pin or hair ornament from Galloway Viking Hoard.

Buried in the 10th century, the hoard was discovered by a metal detectorist in field near Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32847\" target=\"_blank\">in September of 2014</a>. Archaeologists excavated the hoard and found more than 100 silver and gold pieces, from ingots to jewelry to fragments of Byzantine silk to an extremely rare <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33382\" target=\"_blank\">Carolingian pot</a> stuffed with <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32847\" target=\"_blank\">more treasure</a>.

Bordered by the Cumbria, with its high Norse population, to the south, and the Viking-dominated Irish Sea to the west, Galloway had a strong Viking presence from the 9th until the 11th century. The person who buried the hoard was almost certain Norse, burying his or her most precious valuables, many of them heirlooms, handed down spoils from long-ago raids on Anglo-Saxon, Irish French and/or German communities. No other Viking hoard has been found with such a wide variety of objects \u2014 gold, silver, glass, enamel, textiles \u2014 from such a wide geographic area. The rare survival of textiles, the precision wrapping of each object and careful burial in order of priority makes this hoard a particularly rich source of information about Viking Galloway beyond just the value and significance of the precious objects. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41271\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Irish-brooch-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bracelet from Galloway Viking Hoard.

A <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-29226104\" target=\"_blank\">pre-existing plan</a> to convert the Kirkcudbright Town Hall into a major art gallery gained whole new steam with the prospect of the Galloway Viking Hoard as the centerpiece of the collection. The budget for the conversion was cranked way up and hefty contributions secured from the Heritage Lottery fund, the Kirkcudbright Common Good Fund and the council itself. The new Kirkcudbright Art Gallery would be a secure, state-of-the-art setting for the display of the hoard near where it was discovered.</p>\n<p>But the course of true hoard love never did run smooth, and some David-and-Goliath museum drama has churned in the background of this campaign. The Kirkcudbright Art Gallery doesn\u2019t actually exist yet, while National Museums Scotland (NMS) sure does. NMS wants the Galloway Hoard. The Dumfries and Galloway Council <a href=\"http://www.dumgal.gov.uk/pressreleases?item=1500\" target=\"_blank\">released a statement last month</a> expressing their support for a joint bid with NMS that would give the county and the national museum joint custody of the hoard.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Town-Hall.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46112\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Town-Hall-142x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Town-Hall-142x150.jpg 142w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Town-Hall-200x210.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Town-Hall-430x451.jpg 430w\" title=\"Kirkcudbright Town Hall.

This appraisal highlighted 3 main options that our Council could take.  We could apply for sole ownership of the Hoard, we could enter into a joint agreement with NMS, or we could withdraw our interest in homing the Hoard.  This appraisal provided many positive and negative reasons why each option should be explored, but mainly highlighted that the Hoard needs to have some connection with Kirkcudbright and the region, and that applying for sole ownership would bring serious financial pressures with it.  It was therefore decided by Members at the meeting on 24 January to pursue a joint agreement with NMS, but for adjustments to be made to the current proposal, to give Kirkcudbright Gallery and Dumfries and Galloway as a whole, a more flexible position in terms of a joint ownership of the Galloway Viking Hoard.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41261\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Enameled-cross-wrapped-in-silver-chain-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Enameled cross wrapped in silver chain.

Requests from the council that National Museums Scotland spell out the details of the partnership and clarify how much time the hoard would spend in Kirkcudbright went unanswered. With deadlines on the horizon and the ominous prospect of a deep-pocketed national museum bidding against the scrappy county underdog, the Galloway Viking Hoard Campaign has taken matters in hand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Campaign chair Cathy Agnew] said: \u201cThis is a time for Scotland to take the lead. The Galloway Viking Hoard is quite extraordinary and should have pride of place in a specially created exhibition space in the new Kirkcudbright Art Gallery. Remarkable finds have so often been whisked away from the communities where they were discovered only to become a small feature in a large national museum. This is a very old-fashioned approach and in 2017 we should be making sure that regions fully benefit from their cultural riches.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving a collection of this kind in Dumfries and Galloway would act as a powerful magnet to bring in visitors from all over the country and overseas, benefiting the local economy by encouraging them to spend time here visiting historic sites.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-41264\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Silver-arm-rings-from-hoard-upper-layer-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Silver arm rings from the Galloway Hoard's upper layer.

The ruts of hundreds of years of wagon wheels are deeply embedded in the pavers. The average width is 2.1 meters (a hair under 7 feet). Going towards the Appia, a u-shaped drainage canal runs along the right side of the road, while on the left side the edge stones survive in excellent condition and there\u2019s a little sidewalk .8 meters (2.6 feet) wide.

Nobody noticed the ancient road they cut through. It wasn\u2019t a complete unknown, mind you, just forgotten. The existence of a road feature had been noted on topographical maps as early as the 18th century, but it was architect and antiquarian Luigi Canina who put it on the archaeological map. Canina in his role as Papal Commissioner of Antiquities directed the project of cleaning, restabilizing and restoring the Via Appia Antica and its many funerary monuments between 1851 and 1855. His efforts transformed fragmented, overgrown, ramshackle ruins into the usable road and open-air archaeological park it still is today. In his 1853 work documenting the first section of the Appia, <em>La prima parte della Via Appia dalla Porta Capena a Boville</em>, Canina identified it as a \u201ccommunication route of the Appian Way at Castrimenio.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46099\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-to-Roman-road-museum-430x644.jpg 430w\" title=\"Visitors walk the Roman road in the underground museum gallery.

According to the founding myth of Rome, its father city Alba Longa was destroyed by Roman king Tullus Hostilius in the 7th century B.C. and all of Alba Longa\u2019s sacred objects were moved to Bovillae. These objects and the rituals connected to them were the foundations of Rome\u2019s religions, so Bovillae became an important (and wealthy) religious center. The offshoot of the Appia was likely built for the benefit of a wealthy noble resident of Bovillae who wanted a nice, properly paved road to take him to his doorstep.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46095\" height=\"77\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road-150x77.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road-150x77.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road-200x103.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Visitors-walk-the-road-430x222.jpg 430w\" title=\"Visitors walk over ancient wheel ruts in the paving stones.

Augustus\u2019 body lay is state there before returning to Rome, and Tiberius invested heavily in public buildings including a theater, a circus and a chapel dedicated to the Gens Julia. The town declined after the Julio-Claudians died out in the 1st century. By 326 A.D., it was so insignificant it didn\u2019t garner a mention in a document wherein Emperor Constantine I donated land that included Bovillae to a cathedral in Albano Laziale. Whatever was left of it must have suffered greatly when Alaric I sacked Rome in 410. The towns along the Via Appia were the first to feel the Visigothic wrath.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46101\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-of-Roman-road-under-McD-e1487827185870-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Section of Roman road with cast of skeleton in original location.

This creature is known as \u201ctiriarnaq\u201d in the Siglitun dialect, \u201ctigiaqpak\u201d in the Kangiryuarmiut dialect, all of them translating to \u201cweasel bear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a description of a weasel bear by a Sachs Harbour hunter from a 2010 interview:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cYou get sometimes bears which we call tiriarnat, and they get over 11 foot. They get very big; they\u2019re slim, their necks are way longer than the stubby bears that we get now. I never seen a weasel type bear for years, years and years\u2026. We used to see some north of Storkerson Bay when we travel\u2026. And they\u2019re very big\u2026. Stubby bears get ten [feet] three [inches], ten [feet] four [inches], that sort of thing. But a weasel type bear is 11-foot plus.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are differences between some of the accounts of the weasel bear \u2014 some say they\u2019re fat, not slender, others say they\u2019re all male \u2014 but the large, long, narrow head and neck is common to all the stories. The recently discovered skull fits the description.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt looks different from your average polar bear,\u201d said Anne Jensen, an Utqia\u0121vik-based archaeologist who has been leading excavation and research programs in the region.</p>\n<p>Through radiocarbon dating and subsequent analysis, Jensen and her colleagues estimate that the big bear skull \u2014 which appears to be the fourth largest ever found \u2014 is from a period between the years 670 and 800. It is possibly the oldest complete polar bear skull found in Alaska, inspiring a name for the departed creature that owned it: The Old One.</p>\n<p>Exactly what accounts for its differences is yet to be determined; genetic testing is needed for that, Jensen said. It could have been a member of a subspecies or a member of a different \u201crace\u201d in genetic terms \u2014 similar to the varying breeds that are found among dogs \u2014 or possibly something else entirely, said Jensen, who works for the science department of the Native village corporation, Ukpea\u0121vik I\u00f1upiat Corp., or UIC.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/eroding-Walakpa-site-July-2016.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-46087\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/eroding-Walakpa-site-July-2016-430x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/eroding-Walakpa-site-July-2016-430x131.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/eroding-Walakpa-site-July-2016-150x45.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/eroding-Walakpa-site-July-2016-200x61.jpg 200w\" title=\"A panoramic image shows the eroding Walakpa site as it is excavated July 2016.

As soils warm, bacteria are better able to decompose bones and other items. Even worse, warming soils can bring the items to a point where they generate their own heat, speeding the decomposition process.</p>\n<p>With open water present up to eight months of the year instead of two and with temperatures rising and shorelines crumbling, the threats to the archaeological sites are increasing exponentially, Jensen said. Sites are eroding at a rate that far outpaces the normal grant process used to secure funding for work, and some new emergency approach is probably warranted, she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the library is essentially on fire \u2014 now,\u201d she said.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Is this the skull of the legendary \u201cweasel bear\u201d?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46084\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46084#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-46078\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46078\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Navy posts &lt;em&gt;Hunley&lt;/em&gt; recovery report online\">Navy posts <em>Hunley</em> recovery report online</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, February 20th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-46081\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000-200x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Hunley-raised-2000-430x282.jpg 430w\" title=\"Confederate submarine H.L.

Hunley</em></a> and it is a total page-turner.</p>\n<p>The <em>Hunley</em> sank off of Charleston Harbor on February 17th, 1864, but not before taking down its target, the USS <em>Housatonic</em>, in the first successful torpedoing of a ship by a submarine. Famous for this feat and for its disappearance immediately after the clash, the wreck of the <em>Hunley</em> was much sought by scholars, archaeologists and an adventure novelist. After decades of scholarship and fruitless searches, it was the novelist, Clive Cussler, with a team of experts from the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), who found the wreck in 1995. It was tilted on its starboard side, embedded in the seabed at a 45 degree angle and buried under feet of silt. </p>\n<p>The idea of raising the hand-cranked iron submarine that played such a seminal role in the development of naval technology was a daunting one. It had been protected for 131 years by its silten blanket, and any excavation could endanger the sub. If it survived being dug out, then it would have to be safely raised out of the water, a logistical challenge of massive proportions. But the incentives to take the plunge were strong. Unlike other shipwrecks, <em>Hunley</em> almost certainly had sealed compartments that contained not just untouched artifacts, but the remains of the eight brave crewmen who operated this terrifying contraption. With the news of the discovery making headlines all over the country, the wreck would certainly become the target of looters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-41382\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hunley-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"The iron hull of the H.

You don\u2019t have to be Civil War or naval history buff to find the Navy\u2019s report on the recovery project riveting. It covers so much ground that anyone with an interest in archaeology, conservation, science, engineering, metallurgy, museums, even project management will be fascinated. I\u2019ve read a lot of archaeological reports over the years, but I\u2019ve never read one this thorough. It goes into depth on the historical background of <em>Hunley</em>, including its predecessors, recovery attempts after the war and searches in the 20th century. It\u2019s not just verbiage, either. There is a plethora of pictures, maps and diagrams.</p>\n<p>Dr. Michael McCarthy of the Western Australia Museum, who participated in a 1999 symposium of experts convened to discuss the recovery of <em>H.L. Hunley</em>, puts it beautifully in the foreword: </p>\n<blockquote><p>[This report] ably brings to the world the complexity of such a multi-faceted project, its own history, including the search and finding, the engineering problems and solutions, the archaeology, conservation, historical research, public access, and future exhibition plans. Clearly evident is the fact that it has all required perseverance, dedication, and exceptional time management from not only the archaeologists, researchers, and conservators, but those who managed the funding and the enormous resources required to complete the project. What editors Robert Neyland and Heather Brown have brought together and presented in what follows is a fitting and lasting tribute to the project\u2019s many and various constituents and, like <em>H.L. Hunley</em> itself, it is a monument to its builder and to its three brave crews, young men once lost and now known to all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The 321-page document can be downloaded free of charge in pdf format <a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/research/underwater-archaeology/sites-and-projects/ship-wrecksites/hl-hunley/recovery-report.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Navy posts Hunley recovery report online\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46078\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46078#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-45971\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/45971\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to How to move a painting the size of football field\">How to move a painting the size of football field</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, February 19th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46075\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Original_Gettysburg_Cyclorama_Building-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Original Battle of Gettysburg Cyclorama building.

The trend began with large-scale panoramas in the late 18th century. European artists pioneered the form, creating massive works that depicted famous battles, Biblical and mythological scenes, landscapes, famous explorers exploring exotic lands and more. This evolved into cycloramas, 360 degrees paintings installed in purpose-built circular buildings so that viewers on a central platform could have a full-immersion experience of being in the middle of the action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46076\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama-430x646.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philippoteaux-painting-Gettysburg-Cyclorama.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Paul Philippoteaux painting the Gettysburg Cyclorama. Gettysburg National Military Park.\" width=\"99\"/></a>Cycloramas caught on in the 1870s after the Franco-Prussian War inspired a proliferation of battle depictions. It was European artists who brought their techniques of creating massive 360 degree paintings to the United States. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gett/learn/historyculture/gettysburg-cyclorama.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Battle of Gettysburg</em></a>, now at the Gettysburg National Military Park and the largest oil painting in the world, opened the cyclorama floodgates. French artist Paul Philippoteaux, who had been painting cycloramas in Europe since 1871, was commissioned to create the massive panorama by a group of Chicago investors in 1879. It took him two years and a couple of dozen of assistants to finish the piece. It went on display in Chicago in 1883 and was a runaway success, so much so that Philippoteaux was commissioned to make another three Battle of Gettysburg cycloramas. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46072\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Battle-of-Atlanta-painters-in-Milwaukee-1886-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Battle of Atlanta painters in Milwaukee, 1886\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Gettysburg blockbuster started a trend, and the same year it first went on display, German-born Milwaukee resident William Wehner founded the American Panorama Company. He had little difficulty investors that there would be a market in the United States for massive-scale views of scenes from the Civil War. <em>The Battle of Atlanta</em>, fought on July 22nd, 1864, was the chosen subject for the American Panorama Company\u2019s second and most elaborate work, and little wonder since one of Wehner\u2019s patrons was Illinois senator and Union Major General John \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Logan who had commanded the Fifteenth Corps in the Battle of Atlanta. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Historical-1886-sketch-Troup-hurt-house.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46000\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Historical-1886-sketch-Troup-hurt-house-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Historical-1886-sketch-Troup-hurt-house-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Historical-1886-sketch-Troup-hurt-house-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Historical-1886-sketch-Troup-hurt-house-430x292.jpg 430w\" title=\"Original study at Troup Hurt House by Atlanta Cyclorama painters, 1886.

They had access to the sketchbooks and notebooks of <em>Harper\u2019s Weekly</em> Civil War campaign artist Theodore Davis, official government documents and maps, spoke to veterans of the battle from both sides, and traveled to Atlanta so they could scope out the site of the battle with their own eyes. Even though the neighborhood where the battle took place (Edgewood, then an eastern suburb, now intown Atlanta) was completely unrecognizable just 20 years later, the artists were able to view tracks and landscape features by sketching from towers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46070\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Manual-for-the-Battle-of-Altanta-at-Detroit-Cyclorama-430x646.jpg 430w\" title=\"Brochure for the Battle of Altanta exhibited at the Detroit Cyclorama.\" width=\"99\"/></a><em>The Battle of Atlanta</em> made its debut in February 1887 in Detroit. Senator Logan had died in December of 1886 and the work was advertised as \u201cLogan\u2019s Great Battle\u201d in homage to him. His cavalry charge to reinforce the Union lines was a featured scene in the cyclorama. Believe it or not, this massive painting more than 370 feet wide and just shy of 50 feet high was designed to be moved. After it was shown in Detroit, vast swaths of the canvas were draped on wooden frames and taken on the road where it was shown in Minneapolis and Indianapolis. The Cyclorama opened in Indianapolis in May of 1888 and by then Wehner\u2019s company was in trouble. He sold <em>The Battle of Atlanta</em> to a local exhibitor. In 1890, that company sold it to promoter Paul Atkinson of Madison, Georgia.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logan-rides-to-the-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46074\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logan-rides-to-the-front-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logan-rides-to-the-front-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logan-rides-to-the-front-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logan-rides-to-the-front-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Logan rides to the front, detail from Atlanta Cyclorama.

It finally set foot in Atlanta in February 1892, where Atkinson put it on display in a wooden building on Edgewood Avenue, close to the battle site. In Atlanta, Atkinson promoted the one-time \u201cLogan\u2019s Great Battle\u201d as the only painting of a Confederate victory, and he had it altered to make sure it fit the new pro-Southern narrative.

General Sherman had to besiege Atlanta for more than a month before the city finally surrendered on September 2nd, 1864. Still, the one-day Battle of Atlanta was something of a Pyrrhic victory given the 5,500 Confederate casualties they could ill-afford this late in the war, and since the final conclusion of the wider fight for Atlanta was a decisive Union victory that played an important role in revitalizing Northern enthusiasm for the war and in re-electing President Lincoln, Atkinson\u2019s pitch was more than a little disingenuous.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-45998\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyclorama-Overall-view-with-diorama-7.26.2014-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cyclorama curved view with diorama in the foreground.

A year later, the painting was sold for a comparative pittance to Atlanta business magnate Ernest Woodruff. He quickly resold it to George V. Gress and Charles Northen.

Twenty years of discussions from the late 1950s until the late 1970s considered a number of solutions to the problems, all of them rejected as too expensive. Finally between 1979 and 1982 the painted and diorama were conserved and the building renovated to include a revolving viewing platform.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-45994\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2-200x297.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/4-2016.3-examination-and-mapping-2-430x640.jpg 430w\" title=\"Examination and mapping of the Atlanta Cyclorama before the move.

Meanwhile, Zoo Atlanta, which shares space in Grant Park with the Atlanta Cyclorama and draws far, far larger crowds than the painting could ever dream of drawing, is keen to expand. In 2014, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed announced that the cyclorama would be moved to a new state-of-the-art facility <a href=\"http://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/press/atlanta-history-center-prepares-for-historic-restoration-and-move-of-atlantas-cyclorama-civil-war-painting-and-texas-locomotive\" target=\"_blank\">at the Atlanta History Center</a>\u2018s 33-acre campus in the toney Buckhead neighborhood.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-45991\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2016.12-scrolling-first-half-2-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scrolling the first half of the painting, December, 2016.

It has taken more than two years to plan and prepare the move.

A crane will slowly lift the spools \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re hoping paint-drying goes faster,\u201d Mr. McQuigg said in an interview \u2014 through seven-foot holes cut in the roof of the nearly century-old building. Then, once the shrink-wrapped painting is resting aboard two trucks, the workers will let the clock tick.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait until everybody goes home and the traffic dies down and there\u2019s no more Atlanta rush hour,\u201d Mr. McQuigg said in the musty room where the cyclorama has hung for generations. \u201cHeck, it might be 3 in the morning.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-45989\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/First-scroll-craned-into-AHC-Feb-10-5-00-35-PM-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Scroll craned into the new facility at the Atlanta History Center, February 10.

The first scroll did end up being transported in the middle of the night to the new Lloyd and Mary Ann Whitaker Cyclorama Building at the Atlanta History Center. The second was moved during the day. </p>\n<p>Now that they\u2019re in the new building, the sections of the painting <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/us/atlanta-cyclorama-big-painting-move-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">will be reunited and restored</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The restored painting will finally have the proper perspective: Until now, the painting hung like a shower curtain and there were folds and creases. When the painting reopens next year, the aim is to return the \u201cimmersion\u201d effect.</p>\n<p>The Battle of Atlanta will be displayed in its original hyperbolic, or hourglass shape. Through proper tension at the top and bottom, the painting\u2019s horizon will appear closer to the viewer, restoring the original 3D illusion.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be able to see the whole painting: At Grant Park, patrons sat on a carpeted revolving grandstand, which kept them from taking in the entire painting at once. At the AHC, visitors will gaze from a platform 15 feet above ground. The diorama will be rebuilt. The idea is to remove as many obstructions as possible and let the painting make its own statement.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Battle of Gettysburg</em> is the same height as the Atlanta Cyclorama, but it\u2019s 377 feet wide. When the restoration is complete, <em>The Battle of Atlanta</em> will get a little closer in width and beat it in height. The pieces cut out to squeeze Procrustes the Painting into the 1921 Atlanta Cyclorama building will be readded so that for the first time in almost a century, the complete panorama will be seen as the German painters created it. The restored cyclorama will be 371 feet wide and 49 feet high. The Atlanta Cyclorama will reopen to the public in the fall of 2018.</p>\n<p>Here are timelapse videos of the two halves of the painting being scrolled up.

We\u2019ve had <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46020\" target=\"_blank\">Bronze Age weapons</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/46031\" target=\"_blank\">Roman copper vessels packed with plants</a>. Now we have a <a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2017/02/28/valuable-collection-of-buried-treasure-found-in-staffordshire/\" target=\"_blank\">group of four ancient gold torcs</a> discovered by metal detectorists in a cow pasture in Leekfrith on the Staffordshire Moorlands. </p>\n<p>The torcs were found last December by Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania. Hambleton had scanned the field some two decades ago without success. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46175\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gold-torcs-430x368.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs.

All they\u2019d found up to that point was trash and a 19th century coin or two, so Hambleton had already packed up his metal detector when Kania pulled a gold torc out of the ground. Then another. And another. And another. Three of them are necklaces, one a bracelet. Three are complete and intact, the fourth broken, likely by agricultural interference. The torcs were about six inches beneath the surface about a meter (three feet) apart from each other. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46169\" height=\"75\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-150x75.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-fragment-430x217.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold torc fragment.

The next morning, the finders alerted the Portable Antiquities Scheme to their discovery. Stoke-On-Trent City Council dispatched archaeologists to the field but they found no evidence of further treasure. Hambleton and Kania defied the odds again, though, returning to the spot last Sunday where they discovered the second half of the broken torc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46171\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-200x260.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-5-430x560.jpg 430w\" title=\"Decorated bracelet torc. Photo courtesy the Staffordshire County Council.\" width=\"115\"/></a>The Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs were examined by Dr. Julia Farley, the British Museum\u2019s Curator of British &amp; European Iron Age Collections. She determined they were not of British origin, but likely from what is today Germany or France. Analysis of the gold content found that it was no less than 80% in every torc, making them more than 18 carat gold which is 75% pure. The torcs weigh between 31 grams for the smallest piece, the incomplete bracelet, and 230 grams for the largest. The one bracelet stirred particular excitement because it is decorated, etched with lines inside loops. This is some of the earliest Celtic art ever discovered in Britain. All of the workmanship on the torcs is extremely high quality. One of them even has an incredibly rare maker\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p>Dr. Farley:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46173\" height=\"68\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-150x68.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-150x68.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-200x91.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-4-430x197.jpg 430w\" title=\"Twisted gold torc from Leekfrith Hoard.

It dates to around 400\u2013250 BC, and is probably the earliest Iron Age gold work ever discovered in Britain.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the continent who had married into the local community. Piecing together how these objects came to be carefully buried in a Staffordshire field will give us an invaluable insight into life in Iron Age Britain.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-46174\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3-200x170.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gold-torc-3-430x367.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold necklace torc from Leekfrith Hoard.

Coroner Ian Smith asked questions of experts about the hoard, its continental origin and how they pieces may have made their way to Leekfrith. After hearing testimony about the torcs\u2019 age and precious metal content, the coroner ruled that the pieces are treasure trove. The next step is for the independent experts of the Treasure Valuation Committee to determine fair value of the torcs. Local museums will then be offered the first opportunity to raise the amount of the valuation. That money will be divided between the finders and the landowner. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46170\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-200x178.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det-430x383.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Decoration-det.jpg 1240w\" title=\"Decoration detail from bracelet.

We\u2019ve had Bronze Age weapons and Roman copper vessels packed with plants. Now we have a group of four ancient gold torcs discovered by metal detectorists in a cow pasture in Leekfrith on the Staffordshire Moorlands. The torcs were found last December by Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania. Hambleton had scanned the field some two decades ago without success. They were about to give up when Joe Kania\u2019s machine signalled the presence of metal. All they\u2019d found up to that point was trash and a 19th century coin or two, so Hambleton had already packed up his metal detector when Kania pulled a gold torc out of the ground. Then another. And another. And another. Three of them are necklaces, one a bracelet. Three are complete and intact, the fourth broken, likely by agricultural interference. The torcs were about six inches beneath the surface about a meter (three feet) apart from each other. Hambleton spent a fitful night failing to sleep with the hoard by his side. The next morning, the finders alerted the Portable Antiquities Scheme to their discovery. Stoke-On-Trent City Council dispatched archaeologists to the field but they found no evidence of further treasure. Hambleton and Kania defied the odds again, though, returning to the spot last Sunday where they discovered the second half of the broken torc. The Leekfrith Iron Age Torcs were examined by Dr. Julia Farley, the British Museum\u2019s Curator of British & European Iron Age Collections. She determined they were not of British origin, but likely from what is today Germany or France. Analysis of the gold content found that it was no less than 80% in every torc, making them more than 18 carat gold which is 75% pure. The torcs weigh between 31 grams for the smallest piece, the incomplete bracelet, and 230 grams for the largest. The one bracelet stirred particular excitement because it is decorated, etched with lines inside loops. This is some of the earliest Celtic art ever discovered in Britain. All of the workmanship on the torcs is extremely high quality. One of them even has an incredibly rare maker\u2019s mark. Dr. Farley: \u201cThis unique find is of international importance. It dates to around 400\u2013250 BC, and is probably the earliest Iron Age gold work ever discovered in Britain. \u201cThe torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the continent who had married into the local community. Piecing together how these objects came to be carefully buried in a Staffordshire field will give us an invaluable insight into life in Iron Age Britain.\u201d A coroner\u2019s inquest was held in North Staffordshire on Tuesday. Coroner Ian Smith asked questions of experts about the hoard, its continental origin and how they pieces may have made their way to Leekfrith. After hearing testimony about the torcs\u2019 age and precious metal content, the coroner ruled that the pieces are treasure trove. The next step is for the independent experts of the Treasure Valuation Committee to determine fair value of the torcs. Local museums will then be offered the first opportunity to raise the amount of the valuation. That money will be divided between the finders and the landowner. Stoke-on-Trent, which is bidding to be a 2021 UK City of Culture, is mighty keen to secure the torc hoard. Another little hoard you might have heard of, the Staffordshire Hoard, spends half its time in Stoke and it has brought millions of tourists and their cash to the region.

That\u2019s when the fragments of the Old French manuscript became integrated into the books. Parchment was expensive and bookbinders often reused old \u201cwaste materials\u201d in their bindings instead of using clean sheets. There is evidence on the leaves that at this time they were pasted on the front and back boards of the books. When the books were rebound at a later date, the pasted fragments were unglued from the boards and used as flyleaves (those blank pages you still find today at the beginning and end of a volume).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54164\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail from one of the fragments showing the name Merlin.

Merlin text found in Bristol library\">Fragments of 13th c. Merlin text found in Bristol library</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, January 31st, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Fragments of a 13th century Old French text of Arthurian legends have been <a href=\"https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/january/bristol-merlin-.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found inside a series of later bound books</a> in the Bristol Central Library. Seven handwritten manuscript fragments from the Vulgate Cycle, also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, were discovered by the University of Bristol\u2019s Special Collections Librarian Michael Richardson while perusing a collection of the works of 15th century French scholar Jean Gerson. </p>\n<p>The four-volume edition of Gerson\u2019s works was printed in Strasbourg between 1494 and 1502, but it seems they were not bound because the first binding appears to have been done in England in the early 16th century. That\u2019s when the fragments of the Old French manuscript became integrated into the books. Parchment was expensive and bookbinders often reused old \u201cwaste materials\u201d in their bindings instead of using clean sheets. There is evidence on the leaves that at this time they were pasted on the front and back boards of the books. When the books were rebound at a later date, the pasted fragments were unglued from the boards and used as flyleaves (those blank pages you still find today at the beginning and end of a volume).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54164\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Merlin-book-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail from one of the fragments showing the name Merlin. Photo courtesy the University of Bristol.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Richardson recognized the names of key figures, most notably Merlin, from the Arthurian tales on the oft-recycled parchment pieces. He called in Dr. Leah Tether, an Arthurian expert from the University of Bristol\u2019s English department to assess the significance of those names and manuscript fragments. She identified them as pieces of the Vulgate Cycle, a telling of the Arthur legend that predates all English-language versions and is thought to have been Sir Thomas Malory\u2019s source for <em>Le Morte D\u2019Arthur</em>. There are other surviving examples of the text, these fragments have intriguing differences in the narrative.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The seven leaves represent a continuous sequence of the <em>Estoire de Merlin</em> narrative (though they are bound \u2018out of chronological order\u2019 in their current form) \u2013 specifically in a section known as the \u2018Suite Vulgate de Merlin\u2019 (Vulgate Continuation of Merlin).</p>\n<p>Events begin with Arthur, Merlin, Gawain and assorted other knights, including King Ban and King Bohors preparing for battle at Trebes against King Claudas and his followers.</p>\n<p>Merlin has been strategising the best plan of attack. There follows a long description of the battle. At one point, Arthur\u2019s forces look beleaguered but a speech from Merlin urging them to avoid cowardice leads them to fight again, and Merlin leads the charge using Sir Kay\u2019s special dragon standard that Merlin had gifted to Arthur, which breathes real fire.</p>\n<p>In the end, Arthur\u2019s forces are triumphant. Kings Arthur, Ban and Bohors, and the other knights, are accommodated in the Castle of Trebes.</p>\n<p>That night Ban and his wife, Queen Elaine, conceive a child. Elaine then has a strange dream about a lion and a leopard, the latter of which seems to prefigure Elaine\u2019s yet-to-be-born son. Ban also has a terrifying dream in which he hears a voice. He wakes up and goes to church.</p>\n<p>We are told that during Arthur\u2019s stay in the kingdom of Benoic for the next month, Ban and Bohors are able to continue to fight and defeat Claudas, but after Arthur leaves to look after matters in his own lands, Claudas is once again triumphant.</p>\n<p>The narrative then moves to Merlin\u2019s partial explanation of the dreams of Ban and Elaine. Afterwards, Merlin meets Viviane who wishes to know how to put people to sleep (she wishes to do this to her parents). Merlin stays with Viviane for a week, apparently falling in love with her, but resists sleeping with her. Merlin then returns to Benoic to rejoin Arthur and his companions.</p>\n<p>In the newly discovered fragments, there tend to be longer, more detailed descriptions of the actions of various characters in certain sections \u2013 particularly in relation to battle action.</p>\n<p>Where Merlin gives instructions for who will lead each of the four divisions of Arthur\u2019s forces, the characters responsible for each division are different from the version of the narrative we know.</p>\n<p>Sometimes only small details are changed \u2013 for example, King Claudas is wounded through the thighs in the known version, where in the fragments the nature of the wound is left unsaid, which may lead to different interpretations of the text owing to thigh wounds often being used as metaphors for impotence or castration.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The damage to the fragments from their use in two different bindings will make it challenging to fully decipher the text. Researchers will use infrared imaging, if necessary, to read through the damage and publish a full transcript of the exciting new finds.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Volumes.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54163\" height=\"323\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Volumes-430x323.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Volumes-430x323.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Volumes-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Volumes-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Volumes-768x576.jpg 768w\" title=\"Left to right: Leah Tether, Laura Chuhan Campbell, Michael Richardson and Benjamin Pohl with the books in Bristol Central Library\u2019s Rare Books Room.

Infrared images reveal underdrawings unseen for 500 years, published here for the first time.

The organs were not intact inside the bodies, but even without hearts to explore, researchers were able to detect hardened calcium, ie plaque, in the remains of blood vessels in the chest and neck.</p>\n<blockquote><p>From Egypt to Mongolia and now Greenland, mummies throughout the ages have shown evidence of atherosclerosis. The Greenland mummies were of particular interest due to their diet, which would have primarily consisted of fish and sea mammals.</p>\n<p>While increased fish consumption is commonly touted as heart-healthy \u2014 which may make the findings of atherosclerosis seem surprising \u2014 [associate director of the Brigham\u2019s Cardiovascular Imaging Program Dr. Ron] Blankstein emphasized that scientists still have much to learn about its relationship to cardiovascular health. For example, although it is known that consuming fish rich in omega-3 fats has benefits, some types of fish can also be high in cholesterol and, in the current era, contain toxins like mercury or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that may pose risk, he said.</p>\n<p>Lifestyle factors, such as exposure to cooking smoke in their dwellings, may have also contributed to the mummified individuals developing cardiovascular disease during their lifetimes, Blankstein said. Given that and the small sample sizes of these mummy scans, he noted that the team\u2019s findings shouldn\u2019t be taken too much to heart, so to speak.</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7GRt1YhFvA\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"16th c.

Modern-day Ljubljana began in 1st century B.C. as a castrum, a Roman fort, that developed an associated civilian settlement. Historians believe the city of Emona was built by imperial decree in 14 A.D. after the legion departed. Located on the Ljubljanica river, it was an important center of trade between the Adriatic and the Danube area and was the seat of a bishopric in the Early Christian era. It was destroyed by Attila the Hun in the 5th century.

It seems that possibly within a decade of her burial, her square chapel was demolished and a larger (30-by-40-foot) structure was built to enclose her tomb. Around the new structure and inside it, Emona\u2019s Christian community began to practice a burial practice known as ad sanctos, in which the deceased are interred near the tombs of saints and other remains considered holy.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4th-c-coin.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54116\" height=\"138\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4th-c-coin-150x138.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4th-c-coin-150x138.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4th-c-coin-200x184.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4th-c-coin-768x708.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4th-c-coin-430x397.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4th-c-coin.jpg 1406w\" title=\"Coin from 4th c.

So in 2016 when one its most famous restaurants, <a href=\"http://www.solardospresuntos.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Solar dos Presuntos</a>, a culinary icon of the city renown for its traditional Portuguese fare, decided to expand its kitchen and build a school attached to the restaurant, archaeologists got first crack at the site. Contractor archaeology company <a href=\"http://www.neoepica.pt/index.php/component/k2/item/849-cal%C3%A7ada-do-lavra-n%C2%BA-2-a-10-lisboa\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Neoepica</a> was hired to work on this project, beginning with a preliminary study, diagnostic and test pits.</p>\n<p>Lisbon has a rich history going back to the Neolithic and there were Phoenicians living in what would become Lisbon since at least 1200 B.C. Rome established a foothill in what they called Olissipo after the defeat of Carthage by Scipio Africanus in 206 B.C. The city was an important and prosperous trade center, thanks to its location on the Atlantic Ocean and Tagus river. Lisbon\u2019s main square, the Pra\u00e7a da Figueira, is located over a major Roman cemetery in use from the 1st through the 4th century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15th-c-pottery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54104\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15th-c-pottery-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15th-c-pottery-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15th-c-pottery-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15th-c-pottery-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15th-c-pottery-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Age of Discovery pottery.

Altogether, the remains of 60 people were found in the cemetery. Several of the inhumations included grave goods and funerary offerings left at the time of burial. These include typical Roman offerings like lamps, which illuminated the way to the underworld, and coins to secure the deceased would have the wherewithal to pay their way. There\u2019s also a highly unusual object that is still in the process of being studied and evaluated, but appears to be a doctor\u2019s case containing surgical instruments. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pottery-grave-goods.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54108\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pottery-grave-goods-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pottery-grave-goods-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pottery-grave-goods-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pottery-grave-goods-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pottery-grave-goods-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Roman-era pottery found in grave.

They add up to around 100,000 LEDs generating more than 10 times the light with 80% fewer fixtures. The energy savings are enormous, up to 90% over the previous system. The lighting can be controlled in minute detail by a digital system which will allow different elements to be emphasized on different occasions. It will allow video capture in 4K and 8K for ultra high definition television broadcasts and recordings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-illuminates-interior-of-St-Peters-Basilica.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54087\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-illuminates-interior-of-St-Peters-Basilica-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-illuminates-interior-of-St-Peters-Basilica-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-illuminates-interior-of-St-Peters-Basilica-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-illuminates-interior-of-St-Peters-Basilica-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-illuminates-interior-of-St-Peters-Basilica-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"New LED lights illuminate side aisle ceilings.

These improvements will enhance the experience for the thousands of pilgrims who flock to the basilica to celebrate religious events, making it much easier to get a decent view of the Pope and other concelebrants. An even greater advantage will go to the lovers of art and architecture who also flock to St. Peter\u2019s and wait in its insane lines without the consolation of religious fervor. The architectural and decorative features of one of the masterpieces of Renaissance construction are now visible in a whole new depth. The areas that were lit by the old system, like the main dome, originally designed by Bramante and redesigned and strengthened by Michelangelo, are now so clearly lit that details can be seen which were previously invisible. Places that could not be lit under the old regime are now dazzling, including the octagons and mini-cupolas of the side aisles. You simply could not see the rich mosaics that adorn these features from the ground unaided. Five hundred years ago they were lit by candles, so effectively not lit at all. Now they\u2019re plain as day for the first time in half a millennium. </p>\n<p>The photographs look so good I might even brave those insane lines myself next time I\u2019m in Rome, which is saying something because I took one look at them and ran the hell out of there in 2017. I didn\u2019t even attempt it in 2018.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-54085\" height=\"291\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-430x291.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-430x291.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LED-cupola-768x520.jpg 768w\" title=\"LED lights in the dome of St. Peter's.

In return, the Elector commissioned a hugely expensive necklace from  goldsmith Urban Schneeweiss to thank Giambologna for his generous gift. It is believed he was wearing the prized jewel when he sat for a 1591 chalk portrait by Hendrik Goltzius now in the collection of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem.</p>\n<p>After three centuries at the Kunstkammer, the masterpiece went into private ownership in 1924, a casualty of the complicated aftermath of World War I. In the wake of Germany\u2019s defeat in 1918 and the abdication of the Kaiser, the last King of Saxony, Frederick Augustus III abdicated as well. The kingdom became the Free State of Saxony, a semi-autonomous state in the Weimar Republic. The new state confiscated the former king\u2019s assets but he refuse to walk away from them as he had the throne. Instead he hired a lawyer and in 1919 sued the Free State of Saxony for illegally requisitioning his family patrimony. He claimed a passel of real estate, millions in cash and securities and 17.5 million marks\u2019 worth of art.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54071\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-200x268.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-768x1028.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys-430x575.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mars-2.-Photo-by-Rick-Jenkins-courtesy-Sothebys.jpg 1000w\" title=\"The Dresden Mars, left view.

It took many years of stops and starts, amendments and provisos before the deal was sealed. In 1924, Frederick Augustus got castles, lots of cash and a buttload of art from the collections of multiple museums, including the Kupferstichkabinett Dresden, now the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (SKD).</p>\n<p>He was more into the castles and cash than the art. The Dresden Mars was consigned to an art gallery in Berlin which sold it to Theodor Plieninger, General Director of Chemische Werke Griesheim-Elektron, in 1927. Griesheim-Elektron gave it to a member of the board of directors Constantin Jacobi as a retirement present in 1943. Sure beats the usual gold watch. It remained in his family until 1988 when his son and heir Walter Jacobi gave it Bayer AG.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Bayer decided to sell Mars at a Sotheby\u2019s auction. The company\u2019s art collection is almost entirely modern, with the Giambologna as its only Renaissance piece and the infusion of millions of dollars from the sale would give them the chance to grow the collection\u2019s contemporary art. Sotheby\u2019s pre-sale estimate was \u00a33-5 million ($4-6.6 million) and it was thrilled to be handling an original Giambologna because they basically never come on the market.</p>\n<p>A week before the auction, the SKD, armed with contributions from Free State of Saxony, the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media, the Ernst von Siemens Kunststiftung, the German Federal Cultural Foundation and the Friends of the SKD, approached Bayer AG offering a private sale. On July 3rd, the day before the scheduled auction, the deal was made and the lot withdrawn. </p>\n<p>The Dresden Mars will go on permanent display in the SKD\u2019s Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister when it reopens after refurbishment in December of this year. As of this week, it is going on a Welcome Home Tour through Saxony, beginning at the Stadt-und Bergbaumuseum Freiberg then moving to the Schloss Hartenfels in Torgau and making its last stop on the tour at the Schlossbergmuseum Chemnit.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"The Dresden Mars returns to Dresden\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54067\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54067#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54040\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54040\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Conservation of Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb complete\">Conservation of Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb complete</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, January 24th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019Tut13.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54048\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019Tut13-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019Tut13-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019Tut13-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019Tut13-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019Tut13-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Wall paintings conservation work being conducted in the burial chamber of the tomb in spring 2016 \u00a9 J.

Newly designed barriers now restrict visitor access in these areas to reduce the risk of future damage. The paintings were stabilized through dust removal and reduction of coatings from previous treatments, and condition monitoring was also established to better evaluate future changes.</p>\n<p>Also addressed were the mysterious brown spots on the wall paintings. They were already present when Carter first entered the tomb, and a comparison of the spots with historic photographs from the mid-1920s showed no new growth. To confirm this finding, DNA and chemical analysis were undertaken and confirmed the spots to be microbiological in origin but dead and thus no longer a threat.

Photo by Richard Cave.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The University of Oxford\u2019s Bodleian Libraries has acquired <a href=\"https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/news/2019/jan-22\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a rare late 15th century book chest</a>. The Bodleian\u2019s collection of manuscripts and early printed books is one of the largest in the world, but this is its first book coffer and it\u2019s a special one. At 8.5 x 12.6 x 5.5 inches in size, it is one of the largest examples of a book coffer from this period known to survive.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This acquisition gives us greater insight into the \u2018everyday life\u2019 of books and print culture more broadly. The coffer provides a link between books held at the Bodleian and cultural objects which were once united, but now usually live apart in libraries and museums around the world.</p>\n<p>Dr Christopher Fletcher, Keeper of Special Collections at the Bodleian Libraries, said: </p>\n<p>\u201cThe Bodleian collects books and manuscripts but also objects which helps us to understand the history and culture of the book \u2013 how they were kept, used, moved and understood. The coffer is a remarkable item which is both utilitarian and devotional and preserves an exceptionally rare woodcut in its original context. Among other things, it shows us that our preoccupation with carrying information around with us in mobile devices \u2013 including texts and images \u2013 is nothing new.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The coffer is made of leather-covered wood and is lined with red canvas. The cover is wrapped with nine iron bands, hinges and a lock to secure the high-value contents. Also known as a messenger\u2019s box, it has two iron loops on the side through which leather straps would have been threaded through so it could be carried on a person\u2019s shoulders or attached to a horse\u2019s saddle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Book-chest.-Photo-by-Richard-Cave..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54028\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Book-chest.-Photo-by-Richard-Cave.-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Book-chest.-Photo-by-Richard-Cave.-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Book-chest.-Photo-by-Richard-Cave.-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Book-chest.-Photo-by-Richard-Cave.-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Book-chest.-Photo-by-Richard-Cave.-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"Book chest open with God in Majesty woodprint on the inside cover. Photo by Richard Cave.\" width=\"100\"/></a>A woodcut depicting <em>God the Father in Majesty</em> is affixed to the inside of the lid, one of only four surviving impressions of this print. His presence would have blessed the contents and protected them during their journeys. Other coffers from this time also contain religious prints on the inside lid, and it\u2019s possible they served double duty as portable altars.</p>\n<p>It is a version of an illumination in a 1491 Missal by the Master of the Tr\u00e8s Petites Heures of Anne of Brittany, a Paris illuminator who was active in the last quarter of the 15th century. He was a versatile artist who created designs for woodcuts, metalcuts, tapestries and stained glass as well as creating illuminated manuscripts for his highest-end clientele. The hand-colored prints found in messenger\u2019s boxes were produced in Paris between 1490 and 1510, which is how we know where and when this coffer was made. These boxes are the only sources of single-leaf French prints before 1500. They are literally the only examples we have of the dawn of printmaking in France.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Landscape-with-the-Rest-on-the-Flight-into-Egypt-Antwerp-School-ca.-1530.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54033\" height=\"126\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Landscape-with-the-Rest-on-the-Flight-into-Egypt-Antwerp-School-ca.-1530-200x126.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Landscape-with-the-Rest-on-the-Flight-into-Egypt-Antwerp-School-ca.-1530-200x126.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Landscape-with-the-Rest-on-the-Flight-into-Egypt-Antwerp-School-ca.-1530-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Landscape-with-the-Rest-on-the-Flight-into-Egypt-Antwerp-School-ca.-1530-768x484.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Landscape-with-the-Rest-on-the-Flight-into-Egypt-Antwerp-School-ca.-1530-430x271.jpg 430w\" title=\"Landscape with the Rest on the Flight into Egypt, Antwerp School, ca. 1530. Photo courtesy Christie's.\" width=\"200\"/></a>We have confirmation that these types of lockboxes were used to transport precious books as well as other valuables because depictions of them being used for this purpose have survived, most notably a Rest on the Flight into Egypt made in Antwerp around 1530 which shows a partially open coffer by Mary\u2019s side. At the back is a small book with metal clasps. In front of it are a rosary, a pair of scissors and a brush.</p>\n<p>The coffer has gone display at the Bodleian\u2019s Weston Library in a new exhibition, <em>Thinking Inside the Box: Carrying Books Across Cultures</em>, which runs until February 17th.

Visigoth limestone reliefs of two evangelists looted from the church of Maria del Lara in Spain. Photo by Niklas Halle'n, AFP. \" width=\"200\"/></a>Two Visigoth reliefs looted from a church in northern Spain 15 years ago have been <a href=\"https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/indiana-jones-art-finds-stolen-spanish-carvings-english-garden-doc-1cg4hv2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found in Britain and returned to Spanish officials</a>. The theft was a total debacle, but the heavy reliefs depicting two evangelists managed to survive intact against the odds.</p>\n<p>The 7th century limestone reliefs originally adorned the church of Santa Maria de Lara, one of only a handful of churches from the Visigoth era still remaining on the Iberian peninsula. Built in the 7th or early 8th century, the church was abandoned after the Umayyad conquest and was likely rebuilt after the Spanish Reconquista in the 9th century. It was donated to the neighboring monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza in the 11th century but was not maintained and fell to ruin, eventually being forgotten entirely. The remains were rediscovered by a priest on a walk in 1921. They were obscured by brush and the location was remote so even after the church was found locals still used the ruins as corrals for their livestock. </p>\n<p>Its fortunes improved when scholars identified as a Visigoth church in 1927 and it was granted National Monument status two years later. It wasn\u2019t until the custodian and guide built an asphalted road to the nearby town of Quintanilla de las Vinas in the 1970s that the church became a popular tourist draw and brought it enough money to fund the site\u2019s maintenance.</p>\n<p>Even with a decent access road and thousands of visitors a year, Santa Maria de Lara was secluded enough that in 2004 thieves were able to use a crane to strip two 110-pound stone reliefs from the church and remove them unimpeded. They thought they had hit the jackpot. Very few Visigoth figural sculptures have survived, so these two pieces would be worth millions. Notice the conditional. They would be worth millions if they weren\u2019t protected cultural patrimony, but they are. </p>\n<p>As so often happens, the looters found themselves saddled with artifacts they could not sell for what they were worth. They had to take the hit and sell them off for whatever money they could get. And so in 2010, two priceless Visigoth reliefs were sold in Britain as garden ornaments for maybe 50,000 pounds apiece. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54022\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Arthur Brand with recovered reliefs. Photo by Niklas Halle'n, AFP.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Somebody with a keen eye saw the \u201cgarden ornaments\u201d for sale and thought they was much more to them. He alerted <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53373\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Art Detective</a>, private investigator Arthur Brand who recovers looted cultural material and stars in a TV show in the Netherlands dedicated to his exploits. Brand traveled to England to follow up, only to find that his informant had just died. His wife only knew a man named \u201cTony\u201d was connected to the stones. All she had was his first name and a description of him. </p>\n<p>It took Brand years to track Tony down. When he finally did, the fellow was suffering from dementia. He did remember the reliefs. He had seen them being delivered to London on a truck by a French art dealer and recognized that they might be Visigothic. Eventually he was able to locate photographs of them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Brand then tracked down the French dealer, who pointed them towards an unnamed British aristocratic family living north of London.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt ended up in the garden of an English nobleman, who did not know that it was world heritage, where they would stay like 15 years,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The owners were so shocked when told the truth that \u201cthey wanted to throw the artworks into a river and let them disappear forever. Fortunately we managed to convinced them not to,\u201d said Brand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I hope that was facetious. Destroying cultural heritage out of shame for having bought it through no fault of your own seems \u2026 well, nuts. Anyway it\u2019s all good now. The reliefs are on their way back to Burgos and scholars are thrilled at what might be learned from them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The looted artworks could also be \u201cessential\u201d evidence in a debate raging among scholars about the exact age of the church, said Oxford University researcher David Addison.</p>\n<p>Addison said some believed it was a 7th century building while others dated it to the 10th or 11th centuries.</p>\n<p>Brand\u2019s return of the artifacts \u201cwould be a great service in this regard,\u201d Addison said.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Speaking of looted art from Visigothic Spain\u2026\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54019\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54019#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2019/01/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

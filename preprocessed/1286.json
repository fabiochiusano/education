Constine's cousin Darren Lachtman is the founder of influencer advertising startup Niche that was acquired by Twitter, and he's since left and founded teen content studio Brat. Constine does not write about Founders Embassy or Brat.

Constine occasionally does paid speaking engagements at conferences, but only those funded by companies he does not cover. Constine owns a small position in Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, does not day-trade, and discloses his positions directly in articles where appropriate. Constine does not do consulting, angel investing, or public stock trading beyond public stock invesments by his parents' estate that he has no role in managing or advising.]<\\/p>\",\"cbAvatar\":\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\\/image\\/upload\\/v1415412437\\/xje35licfau9iewxnf44.png\",\"twitter\":\"joshconstine\",\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\\/1603003\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\"}]}},{\"id\":133574213,\"name\":\"Kate Clark\",\"url\":\"\",\"description\":\"\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/author\\/kate-clark\\/\",\"slug\":\"kate-clark\",\"avatar_urls\":{\"24\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b3c493a500cfa371f64f24efe2712a63?s=24&d=identicon&r=g\",\"48\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b3c493a500cfa371f64f24efe2712a63?s=48&d=identicon&r=g\",\"96\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b3c493a500cfa371f64f24efe2712a63?s=96&d=identicon&r=g\"},\"links\":{\"twitter\":\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/kateclarktweets\",\"linkedin\":\"https:\\/\\/www.linkedin.com\\/in\\/katelynmayclark\\/\",\"crunchbase\":\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/person\\/kate-clark\"},\"position\":\"Writer\",\"cbDescription\":\"<p>Kate Clark is a reporter at TechCrunch covering venture capital.

He researched the impact of privacy controls on the socialization of children, meme popularity cycles, and what influences the click through rate of links posted to Twitter.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Constine also received a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors from Stanford University in 2007, with a concentration in Social Psychology &amp; Interpersonal Processes.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Josh Constine is an experienced public speaker, and has moderated over 120 on-stage interviews in 15 countries with leaders including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whistleblower Edward Snowden (via on-stage video conference), and U.S. Senator Cory Booker. He is available to moderate panels and fireside chats, deliver keynotes, and judge hackathon and pitch competitions.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Constine has been quoted by The Wall Street Journal, CNN Money, The Atlantic, BBC World Magazine, Slate, and more, plus has been featured on television on Good Morning, America, The Today Show, China Central Television, and Fox News. Constine is ranked as the #1 most cited tech journalist on prestigious news aggregator Techmeme.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>[Disclosures: Josh Constine temporarily advised a college friend's social location-sharing startup codenamed 'Signal' that was based in San Francisco before dissolving in 2015. This advising role was cleared with AOL and TechCrunch's editors and has concluded. Constine's fianc\\u00e9e Andee Gardiner co-founded startup accelerator Founders Embassy. Constine's cousin Darren Lachtman is the founder of influencer advertising startup Niche that was acquired by Twitter, and he's since left and founded teen content studio Brat. Constine does not write about Founders Embassy or Brat. Constine has personal acquaintances stemming from college housing circa 2007 with founders at Skybox Imaging (now Terra Bella), Hustle, Snapchat, and Robinhood, but does not maintain close social ties with them nor does that influence his writing. Constine occasionally does paid speaking engagements at conferences, but only those funded by companies he does not cover. Constine owns a small position in Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, does not day-trade, and discloses his positions directly in articles where appropriate. Constine does not do consulting, angel investing, or public stock trading beyond public stock invesments by his parents' estate that he has no role in managing or advising.]<\\/p>\",\"cbAvatar\":\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\\/image\\/upload\\/v1415412437\\/xje35licfau9iewxnf44.png\",\"twitter\":\"joshconstine\",\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\\/1603003\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\"}]}}],\"wp:featuredmedia\":[{\"id\":1798736,\"date\":\"2019-03-18T17:53:36\",\"slug\":\"demo-day-header\",\"type\":\"attachment\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/03\\/18\\/here-are-the-85-startups-that-launched-today-at-y-combinators-w19-demo-day-1\\/demo-day-header\\/\",\"title\":{\"rendered\":\"demo

With over 200 companies, the Winter 2019 class is by far YC\u2019s largest yet. Meanwhile, the incubator prepares to shift its headquarters from Mountain View to San Francisco. It\u2019s so large, in fact, it\u2019s had to change the way it does Demo Day. Rather than all pitches happening on one stage, they were split across two stages (the \u201cPioneer\u201d and \u201cMission\u201d stages) running in parallel. So even if you were in the building, you couldn\u2019t see all the pitches in person. We were there \u2014 and as we do with each class, we\u2019ve brought back our notes on everything we saw. You can check out write-ups of all 88 startups from Day 2 plus our favorite picks . Here are the 85+ companies that pitched today, and click here to check out our top 10 picks from Day 1. The top 10 startups from Y Combinator W19 Demo Day 1 Career Karma : Hundreds of millions of people will need to change jobs in the coming years. Career Karma gives them a placement quiz and gets them accepted at coding bootcamps and other training programs that pay the startup $1,000 per student. With income-sharing agreements growing in popularity, plenty of job skill providers will be willing to pay to enroll the highest potential students. VanGo : An on-demand ride service for getting your kids and teens around. The founders say that, because \u201cmoms trust other moms,\u201d 85 percent of drivers on their service are moms and all of them are women. They plan to expand into other verticals to help parents down the road. Team Mobot : Simulated user interface testing doesn\u2019t catch all the bugs and can be complex for less tech savvy companies to perform. Team Mobot offers a fleet of robots that physically test any app\u2019s UI on real devices to perform QA testing and spot bugs. Team Mobot\u2019s fleet learns over time to increase accuracy, and the startup plans to invade the Internet of Things and medical device verticals next. Bento Club : Cheaper lunch delivery for office workers. Customers pre-order food from a select set of restaurants, and Bento picks it up and brings all orders to a shared pickup spot within one block of the customer\u2019s office. Thirty-eight percent of customers come from referrals. Basilica : Most teams trying to build artificial intelligence systems don\u2019t have enough data, and that data can be expensive to collect. Basilica says its transfer learning method allows businesses to create accurate AI with just 1,000 data points instead of 1 million. Basilica generates network effect by using data from across its clients to improve efficiency for each vertical that teams will need to keep up with Google. Keynua : In Latin America, signing documents requires tedious identity verifications. With Keynua you record a short video to verbally agree to a document, and they use existing records to verify your identity. This team\u2019s previous product (Cinepapaya) was acquired by Fandango in 2016. Lumos : Doctors use Google 40X more than professional tools for finding medical information, but Google is full of ads and results are meant for patients not doctors. Lumos offers a medical Q&A search engine for doctors who pay $15 per month. A trial at UPenn saw half of the med students using Lumos each day within weeks of launch. Lumos says it has more potential business opportunities based off understanding what studies and info doctors trust, and having access to them at critical decision points during treatment. Traverse Technologies: Traverse uses software to identify potential sites for wind and hydro power generation. The company then buys and resells those sites. They estimate that a plot that they buy for $750k can be resold for $5 million. The currently have about $50 million worth of letters of intent. Basement : A social network for your close friends. Feed broadcasting social networks feel impersonal, and inevitably bloat with distant acquaintances you\u2019re shy about sharing with. Basement is designed for college students and grads to just add their best friends. It offers Instagram-style posting tools, but the intimacy leads to comment threads that feel more like WhatsApp chat. Basement will have to get users to break the social contract of courtesy so they don\u2019t friend the wrong people, but has a chance to be where Facebook wants to go. CosmicJS : A drop-in, easier to manage alternative to WordPress. The company says that KFC, MLB, and Dailymotion are already customers. Currently making roughly $10k in monthly recurring revenue, and they say that\u2019s growing about 15 percent monthly. Ravn : Looking around corners is one of the most dangerous parts of war for infantry. Ravn builds heads-up displays that let soldiers and law enforcement see around corners thanks to cameras on their gun, drones, or elsewhere. The ability to see the enemy while still being behind cover saves lives, and Ravn already has $490,000 in Navy and Air Force contracts. With a CEO who was a Navy Seal who went on to study computer science plus experts in augmented reality and selling hardware to the Department Of Defense, Ravn could deliver the inevitable future of soldier heads-up displays. 54gene : 54gene aims to be 23andMe for Africa. The company says that competitor data is limited because their users are mostly white. By focusing on Africa, the company can help detect and identify DNA markers that might otherwise go overlooked. Co-founder Abasi Ene-Obong has a PhD in cancer biology from the University of London. Slapdash : Enterprise apps run slow and it can be tough to find files or messages across them. Slapdash creates a desktop software-speed container in which workers can run all their office software like Slack, Dropbox, Asana, Salesforce, and Google. Users can search across all their apps and be more productive, luring SaaS subscriptions from their employers. YourChoice : Male contraceptive pill. With \u201ctwo of the world\u2019s leading sperm physiologists\u201d, YourChoice says they\u2019ve created a pill thats 100% effective with \u201cno side effects\u201d by targeting the ABHD2 and ANT4 proteins in sperm. They\u2019re also working on a hormone-free contraceptive pill for women. AccioJob : Only one-third of India\u2019s college graduates get placed in jobs because their schools often only expose them to local recruiters. AccioJob charges colleges $10,000 per year to place their students in jobs, and charges employers per placement. Since it gains student contact info and grades, AccioJob can become the gateway to the best Indian college grads as more students from the country begin to enroll. CentaurLabs : Hires doctors to label medical imagery datasets at scale, which can then be used to train AI. In the future, they\u2019re aiming to build a diagnosis system to provide second opinions for doctors and patients. Travelchime : Planning travel requires cobbling together Google Docs, maps, blogs, friend recommendations, inspiration apps, and booking sites. Travelchime combines travel planning tools into a Google Doc-style interface that automatically suggests contextual information and places popular amongst travel writing that it\u2019s indexed. Users can then book from Travelchime, which hopes it can build a more helpful version of TripAdvisor. Seawise Capital : Trade loans for exporters in India. The founders say they make 10% on every loan, and have taken on $550k in loans in the past 6 weeks. They plan to raise $5 million in debt by Q3 2019, and $25 million in debt by Q1 2020. PerShop : Shopping online can be frustrating because you\u2019re either hopping between individual brands without comparative pricing, seeing too many irrelevant products on aggregators, or can\u2019t checkout on social apps. PerShop is a personalized shopping site that only recommends you items from your favorite brands, in your size, in your price range. Eventually it plans to sell personalized, targeted e-commerce ads. PerShop gets smarter as people use it to buy or just for entertainment. Prometheus : Removes CO2 from the air to make gasoline. They say they can make gasoline for about $3.00 per gallon. Whereas past attempts required massive distillation columns, founder Rob McGinnis says he was working with carbon nanotube membranes when he discovered a cheaper way to do it with much less real estate. Unicorn : Scooter companies that rent by the minute lose 2 percent of their fleet per day to damage and theft, and that means customers don\u2019t have a safe scooter available when they want one. Unicorn rents scooters by the week or month and is already profitable. Vehicles aren\u2019t left outside overnight and spend more time rented, while customers know there\u2019s a scooter available for them without having to buy one outright. Unicorn\u2019s founder started Tile and now he wants to build a better unit economics business than Lime and Bird. Loonify Space : A bespoke launch system meant specifically for carrying small satellites into orbit. A balloon carries rocket to 35km and launches it mid-air. They have Letters of Intent for 155 satellite launches, worth a total of roughly $77 million. They intend to have their first launch on May 9th. Supernova : Programming apps based on design mockups can be tough internally, but expensive and hard to maintain if outsourced. Supernova converts designs into production-ready code that follows best practices so it\u2019s easy to update. Supernova\u2019s AI can understand a product\u2019s purpose and distinguish between navigation elements, buttons, and more. As more businesses try to modernize with tech products, Supernova could let them focus on their utility rather than computer science. Kovi : Provides rental cars for on-demand drivers in Latin America. They currently have around 300 cars on the street, with 3,000 rental requests this year. The company estimates that 70 percent of drivers in Latin America rent/lease their vehicles. Deel :\u00a0 20 million international contractors work with US companies but it\u2019s difficult to onboard and train them. Deel handles the contracts, payments, and taxes in one interface to eliminate paperwork and wasted time. Deel charges businesses $10 per contractor per month and a 1% fee on payouts, which earns it an average of $560 per contractor per year. As the globalization megatrend continues, businesses need better remote HR tools. COUTURME : Custom, AI-designed wedding/formal dresses. The customer inputs their preferences, the software generates options, and the dress is produced and shipped within 30 days. It went live in January, and has been growing at roughly 50% weekly since. Co-founder Yuliya Raquel previously founded plus-size designer fashion company IGIGI. ( Edit note: this post previously said COUTURME was growing at 15% weekly; we misheard. It\u2019s 50% weekly.) Instapath Inc : Cancer biopsies can take a week to get you your results. Instapath is building a fully-automated pathology lab that can test a tissue sample and provide a diagnosis within five minutes while you\u2019re still at the doctor\u2019s office. This eliminates agonizing waiting periods and can get users treated more quickly. Instapath charges $200 per procedure, has already processed 500 biopsies, and claims to be on the path to FDA clearance in nine months. Bensen : Bensen wants to replace the drive-thru window by allowing restaurants to receive orders via voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa in the car.. It\u2019ll launch in two restaurant chains later this year, with Letters of Intent from companies with 800 locations. They\u2019ll charge $3,000 per year per location. Socrates Intelligence : There\u2019s huge demand for reading in China but just one library per 480,000 citizens. Socrates Intelligence is the Netflix-style mailing business for books in China. For $56 per year, users can rent up to three books and get them within 48 hours. The startup already has 10,000 subscribers and plans to go after ebooks, audiobooks, and magazines next to become the \u2018rent everything store\u2019 for China. Overview : Many factories use massive robots to manufacture goods overnight, but there\u2019s not always someone watching. If something goes wrong but goes undetected, the robots can physically destroy themselves. Overview uses cameras and AI to monitor manufacturing robots, shutting them down if something goes wrong. Sunsama : A task manager that integrates with SaaS tools like Trello, JIRA and Asana to help workers identify and manage the tasks they should be working on a specific day. Kalshi : Instead of just betting on sports, Kalshi lets anyone bet on anything, like whether Brexit will happen by the end of the month or who will win an Oscar. Users bet against each other so it\u2019s more like a futures market than gambling, and regulators like it since Kalshi doesn\u2019t earn more when users lose. It already has 2 licenses making it legal in 200 countries and is in talks with US regulators to earn 7 percent transaction fees when people bet. Volk Wireless : Volk is making an Android smartphone with a free data plan, no carrier required. The co-founders say they\u2019re using long-range wireless hardware to share connections and build a network of phones. Co-Founder Greg Hazel was the Chief Architect at Bittorrent, while co-founder Straya Markovic was the lead engineer at mesh messaging platform Firechat. Nowports : Half of shipping containers are lost or delayed in part because of inefficient routing and tracking. Nowports is the Flexport for Latin America, a freight forwarding business that helps pallets of goods get from factory to truck to boat to warehouse to retailer. Started by a third generation freight forwarder, Nowports could succeed where US companies lack the required local understanding. Flower Co. : Memberships for cheaper weed sales and delivery. They\u2019re currently selling $200,000 in marijuana per month to 700 members. They charge $100 a year for membership, and take 10% on product sales. Middesk : It\u2019s difficult to know if a business\u2019 partners have paid their taxes, filed for bankruptcy, or are involved in lawsuits. That leads businesses to write off $120 billion a year in uncollectable bad debt. Middesk does due diligence to sort out good businesses from the bad to provide assurance for B2B deals loans, investments, acquisitions, and more. By giving clients the confidence that they\u2019ll be paid, Middesk could insert itself into a wide array of transactions. Eclipse Foods : Makes dairy product from plants, which they say are \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from those made from animal products. In their tests, 70% of consumers couldn\u2019t tell the difference between their product and a leading competitor. The co-founders were previously the Director of R&D of Hampton Creek and an innovation specialist at the Good Food Institute (a non-profit focusing on plant-based meat/dairy alternatives). Enemy on Board : By combining the excitement of League Of Legends with the strategy of Mafia, Enemy On Board is a game built for the Twitch era. 5 players team up to complete a mission, but 2 of them secretly are trying to sabotage it. The game\u2019s beta launch is scheduled for June, but testers are already averaging 61 minutes per day, and people have spent 2000 hours watching gameplay on Twitch. Through microtransactions, Enemy On Board\u2019s CEO who worked on League Of Legends believes they can build the next blockbuster freemium game. Modoo Technology : A wearable for monitoring fetal health, measuring heart rate and baby movements. It has been selling in China for $200 since 2017, with $3.4 million in revenue in 2018. The company recently introduced a monthly subscription option for those who don\u2019t want to buy outright. Our World In Data : World leaders need easy-to-access, understandable data on issues like CO2 emissions or child mortality to make decisions. Our World In Data takes key findings from studies buried in paid journal articles and jargon, and put them on an open access website that has achieved top Google ranking for many queries. It already has 1 million users, and its team from University Of Oxford believes optimizing research data for the web could lead to better global policy. Encarte : A browser extension bringing one-click checkout to any e-commerce store. Currently supports over 500,000 Shopify stores. It stores your data locally rather than in the cloud, and keeps track of all tracking numbers. They\u2019re also building a \u201cvirtual e-commerce credit card\u201d that will offer personalized promotions, amongst other things. Atomic Alchemy : Radio cardiograms and PET/CT scans require nuclear medicine to visualize abnormalities. But five of the six reactors that generate this nuclear medicine are set to shut down in the next 10 years. Atomic Alchemy builds tiny, privately-owned reactors from off-the-shelf parts in order to generate nuclear medicine. The startup already has letters of intent it estimates are worth $50 million to $100 million, and hopes to be operational by 2024. Jetpack Aviation : Jetpack is building a flying motorcycle.

The startup uses machine learning, satellite imaging, drones and LIDAR to offset carbon emissions. Pachama connects carbon buyers \u2014 an organization seeking to offset their carbon emissions \u2014 to carbon projects. Saratoga Energy : Over the course of six years, the company has developed and patented a production process to synthesize carbon nanotubes from CO2. The startup sells the carbon nanotubes, which are stronger and lighter than steel, at lower prices to aerospace, battery, concrete and other manufacturers. At the end of the week, the company will deliver their first batch for testing. Saratoga has raised $2 million in grant funding over the last two years. Cherry : Cherry is an office perks solution for the modern startup. Rather than giving entire swaths of employees the same benefits, the co-founders want to let people choose their favorite internet services. People will be able to select services through a Slackbot interface and get things like ClassPass and HBO paid for by their company. The company says they have 24 companies in paid pilot programs. We previously covered Cherry on TechCrunch here. CityFurnish : The provider of a furniture rental marketplace in India, CityFurnish delivers and installs furniture to customers in Delhi, Pune, Mumbai and Bangalore for a monthly rental fee, offering free relocation and free maintenance services.

The team\u2019s first product is made with fresh avocado and did\u00a0$2 million in sales in 6 months, the company says. While these may sound like Juicero packs for your hair, organic products are the fastest growing product category in beauty and the company\u2019s focus on an underserved audience could help them find a health and beauty niche. FlockJay : Operates an online sales academy that teaches job seekers from underrepresented backgrounds the skills and training they need to pursue a career in tech sales. The 12-week long bootcamp offers trainees coaching and mentorship. The company has launched its debut cohort with 17 students, 100 percent of which are already in job interviews and 40 percent of which have already secured new careers in the tech industry. Demodesk : Demodesk is making a screen sharing tool to help companies reshape sales by demoing products directly for customers. What\u2019s unique is that it isn\u2019t your desktop, it\u2019s a virtual machine where your demo presentation can live without potential customers having to wait through lengthy downloads while still being able to collaborate and edit what\u2019s happening in the software. Ultralight : A cross-platform app development tool used for rendering HTML UI within games and desktop applications.

Created by premiere Manchester banner maker Thomas Brown &amp; Sons, the banner celebrates the founding of the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU) by Emmeline Pankhurst, one of the fiercest and most committed suffragette leaders, in her home at <a href=\"http://www.thepankhurstcentre.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">62 Nelson Street</a>, Manchester, in 1903. The date of its manufacture is not known, but the banner glows with the colors of the WSPU campaign: green signifying reform, white purity and purple dignity. The green, white and purple weren\u2019t adopted as the WSPU\u2019s official colors until 1908.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48618\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-136x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-136x150.jpg 136w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-200x221.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-768x849.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-430x475.jpg 430w\" title=\"Embroidered letter detail.

Sick of failed attempts to extend the franchise by ostensibly allied politicians, the WSPU took as their motto \u201cdeeds not words\u201d and hit the streets. They tied themselves to railings, blew up mailboxes, went on hunger strikes when they were arrested and refused to eat even under threat of force-feeding. They made a very effective nuisance of themselves until World War I broke out in 1914 and the WSPU suspended all its activities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48615\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-768x958.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-430x536.jpg 430w\" title=\"Back of the banner.

It was sold to the charity shop after her death and this rare textile treasure remained in the shop, unrecognized and unappreciated, for 10 years. The charity shop <a href=\"https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-us/auction-catalogues/gary-don/catalogue-id-srgar10012/lot-ec310f6e-7c44-4acf-b6a0-a78c01067671\" target=\"_blank\">put the banner up for auction</a> on June 20th of this year where it was bought by a private collector. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-condition-detail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48617\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 98px) 100vw, 98px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-condition-detail-98x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-condition-detail-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-condition-detail-196x300.jpg 196w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-condition-detail-768x1175.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-condition-detail-430x658.jpg 430w\" title=\"Border condition detail.

They reached out to the collector and agreed on a buying price for the banner. They then raised most of the money in grants from the Arts Council England/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund. With \u00a35,000 still to go, <a href=\"http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/bring-manchesters-suffragette-banner-home\" target=\"_blank\">the museum turned to crowdfunding</a>. The Bring Manchester\u2019s Suffragette Banner Home campaign was an almost instant success, meeting the original target in a week. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-lettering.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48616\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-lettering-140x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-lettering-140x150.jpg 140w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-lettering-200x215.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-lettering-768x824.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Border-lettering-430x462.jpg 430w\" title=\"Border lettering detail.

The bone, or in this case clay tablet, of contention is <a href=\"http://cdli.ucla.edu/search/archival_view.php?ObjectID=P254790\" target=\"_blank\">known as Plimpton 322</a> and has been in the Columbia University collection since it was bequeathed to them in 1936 by the wealthy publisher and avid collector of historical written materials George Arthur Plimpton. (His grandson was George Plimpton, author, literary critic and one of the shrinks Matt Damon chases away in <em>Good Will Hunting</em>.) George Arthur left the tablet and the rest of his exceptional collection of rare books and manuscripts to the Butler Library; they are now in the university\u2019s Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</p>\n<p>The tablet is five inches wide, 3.5 inches high and .8 inch thick and features a table of cuneiform numbers four columns across and 15 rows long. The outer left edge is broken, possibly in the modern era because there are remains of glue indicating a repair attempt with the now-missing piece. This break took some of the first column figures with it, forcing mathematicians to have to extrapolate what the complete numbers were based on the extant ones. Experts think the complete table was six columns wide and 38 rows long. All of the numbers are in Babylonian sexagesimal (base 60) notation. </p>\n<p>Its origins are obscure because the tablet was one of hundreds acquired by roving antiquarian/adventurer/novelist/diplomat Edgar James Banks starting in the late 19th century. He sold it to Plimpton in around 1922, reportedly for $10. Neither of them realized the significance of the cuneiform text. Based on the writing style and formatting, researchers believe the tablet was created in the Sumerian city of Larsa in what is today southern Iraq between 1822 and 1762 B.C., right around the time of Hammurabi (c. 1810-1750 B.C.), 6th king of the First Babylonian Dynasty and promulgator of the law code that bears his name. Several other tablets with inscriptions of Babylonian mathematics came from Larsa.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dr-Daniel-Mansfield-with-Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48607\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dr-Daniel-Mansfield-with-Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-200x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dr-Daniel-Mansfield-with-Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dr-Daniel-Mansfield-with-Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dr-Daniel-Mansfield-with-Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dr-Daniel-Mansfield-with-Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-430x258.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dr-Daniel-Mansfield-with-Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Dr Daniel Mansfield with Plimpton 322 tablet.

Austrian mathematician and historian of science Otto Neugebauer recognized that the numbers on the table are Pythagorean triples, two different integers that squared and added together equal the square of the third integer, but to what end did ancient scholars take the immense trouble to compile the lists?</p>\n<p>The UNSW team posits that it is indeed a trigonometric table, but one that takes a previously unknown approach to calculation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOur research reveals that Plimpton 322 describes the shapes of right-angle triangles using a novel kind of trigonometry based on ratios, not angles and circles,\u201d said Dr Daniel Mansfield of the School of Mathematics and Statistics in the UNSW Faculty of Science.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a fascinating mathematical work that demonstrates undoubted genius. The tablet not only contains the world\u2019s oldest trigonometric table; it is also the only completely accurate trigonometric table, because of the very different Babylonian approach to arithmetic and geometry.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis means it has great relevance for our modern world. Babylonian mathematics may have been out of fashion for more than 3000 years, but it has possible practical applications in surveying, computer graphics and education. This is a rare example of the ancient world teaching us something new.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48606\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-1-200x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-1-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-1-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-1-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-1-430x258.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Plimpton-322-tablet.-Photo-by-Andrew-Kelly-UNSW-1.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Plimpton 322 tablet.

The prehistoric structure dates to between 3400 and 3100 B.C. and is fairly extensive with its original hearth and remains of walls. Northwest of the core structures is a second hearth that archaeologists believe is from a later expansion and reconstruction of the house.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Prof [Colin] Richards said: \u201cThe early Neolithic house is both interesting and unusual in having been built on a deep layer of sand, which rests on rounded beach stones. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Early-Neolithic-hearth.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48601\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Early-Neolithic-hearth-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Early-Neolithic-hearth-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Early-Neolithic-hearth-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Early-Neolithic-hearth-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Early-Neolithic-hearth-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Early-Neolithic-hearth.jpg 1402w\" title=\"Early Neolithic hearth. Photo courtesy UHI Archaeology Orkney.\" width=\"150\"/></a>\u201cAt least two construction phases have now been recognised. The primary house has a stone set hearth, internal pits and boxes, and remains of the lower courses of a double-faced thick stone outer wall and small dividing stones, which partition the house into different living areas. This phase of the structure is comparable with examples of dwellings at Stonehall, Mainland and Knap of Howar, Papa Westray. Although excavations at Pool uncovered some early Neolithic structures in the 1980s, this is the first \u2018classic\u2019 early Neolithic house to be discovered in Sanday.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>A number of artifacts have been found in the remains of the house \u2014 pottery fragments, flint knapping debris, animal bones, Skaill knives \u2014 and they are all well preserved, which is particularly key for the bones because time, soil and the elements have chewed up organic remains at other Neolithic sites in Orkney. The rich red-brown floors in the house indicate they have a rich complement of organic remains for researchers to study in the lab.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UHI-Prof-Jane-Downes-surveys-Cata-Sands-site-November-2016.-Photo-by-F.-Bradford..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48598\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UHI-Prof-Jane-Downes-surveys-Cata-Sands-site-November-2016.-Photo-by-F.-Bradford.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UHI-Prof-Jane-Downes-surveys-Cata-Sands-site-November-2016.-Photo-by-F.-Bradford.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UHI-Prof-Jane-Downes-surveys-Cata-Sands-site-November-2016.-Photo-by-F.-Bradford.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UHI-Prof-Jane-Downes-surveys-Cata-Sands-site-November-2016.-Photo-by-F.-Bradford.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UHI-Prof-Jane-Downes-surveys-Cata-Sands-site-November-2016.-Photo-by-F.-Bradford.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"UHI's Prof Jane Downes surveys Cata Sands site, November 2016.

When the site was discovered by UHI and UCLan researchers in November of last year, their survey found evidence of a large settlement they thought might date to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age (c. 2500-2000 BC). This was a transitional period which saw a great deal of social upheaval in Northern Scotland, so archaeologists were excited at the prospect of discoveries from so significant a time. If the dating on the Neolithic structure proves accurate, even though it will be earlier than expected nobody will be disappointed because it such a rare find in unusually good condition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Happily-fighting-the-wind-and-sand-at-Cata-Sands-excavation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48597\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Happily-fighting-the-wind-and-sand-at-Cata-Sands-excavation-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Happily-fighting-the-wind-and-sand-at-Cata-Sands-excavation-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Happily-fighting-the-wind-and-sand-at-Cata-Sands-excavation-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Happily-fighting-the-wind-and-sand-at-Cata-Sands-excavation-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Happily-fighting-the-wind-and-sand-at-Cata-Sands-excavation-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Happily-fighting-the-wind-and-sand-at-Cata-Sands-excavation.jpg 1402w\" title=\"Happily fighting the wind and sand at Cata Sands excavation.

Local traditions suggest they are the detritus of a practice known as \u201cca,\u201d from a word meaning \u201cdriven,\u201d in which whales, dozens, even hundreds at a time, were chased towards the shore until they beached themselves. There they were butchered for their blubber, a valuable source of oil that was used in lamps, motors, soaps, even margarine.

A large grouping of tombs was first unearthed after the demolition of the old plant last year, 42 of them in total, 40 dating to the Ming Dynasty. Tomb M4 was identified as Tang\u2019s from an epitaph, one of six found at the site some of which are believed to have been written by the playwright himself. His third wife Fu was buried with him in the tomb; his second wife Zhao was buried in the neighboring tomb labelled M3.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe epitaphs can help us learn more about the calligraphy, art and literature in Tang\u2019s time,\u201d Xu [Changqing, head of Jiangxi Provincial Cultural Relics and Archeology Research Institute,] said.[\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThis discovery is significant, because it tells us more about Tang\u2019s life, his family tree and relationships with other family members,\u201d said Mao Peiqi, vice chairman of the Chinese Society on Ming Dynasty History.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides, by learning about the status and lives of Tang\u2019s family, we can learn about education, culture and agriculture in the Ming Dynasty as well as the development of society,\u201d he said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tang\u2019s best known works are a series of plays known as the <em>Four Dreams</em>. One of them, <em>The Peony Pavilion</em>, is considered his masterpiece. It was the most popular play of the Ming Dynasty and continued to be performed in the classical Chinese opera tradition uninterrupted for hundreds of years until the present. Updated, experimental versions as well as the traditional style have been performed all over the world. There are references to it in popular music, novels, television and film.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Commemorative-statue-of-Tang-Xianzu-and-Willianm-Shakespeare-in-Stratford-Upon-Avon.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48593\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Commemorative-statue-of-Tang-Xianzu-and-Willianm-Shakespeare-in-Stratford-Upon-Avon-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Commemorative-statue-of-Tang-Xianzu-and-Willianm-Shakespeare-in-Stratford-Upon-Avon-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Commemorative-statue-of-Tang-Xianzu-and-Willianm-Shakespeare-in-Stratford-Upon-Avon-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Commemorative-statue-of-Tang-Xianzu-and-Willianm-Shakespeare-in-Stratford-Upon-Avon-768x513.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Commemorative-statue-of-Tang-Xianzu-and-Willianm-Shakespeare-in-Stratford-Upon-Avon-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Commemorative statue of Tang Xianzu and Willianm Shakespeare in Stratford-Upon-Avon, April 23rd, 2017.

They had other things in common: exceptional lyrical qualities in their verse, themes of star-crossed romance, plot-driving dreams, ghosts, comical elements combined with the tragic and dramatic, historical settings and personages, and legacies as literary giants that loom large in their native countries and beyond. Because they were contemporaries with such enduring cultural influence, comparisons between Tang and Shakespeare are rife. Tang is often referred to as the Chinese Shakespeare as shorthand to explain the enormity of his importance in Chinese theatrical history. Last year, the 400th anniversary of both men\u2019s deaths, <em>The Peony Pavilion</em> was performed at Stratford-upon-Avon, birthplace of the Bard. This year, a statue of the two great playwrights standing side by side gifted to the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust by the city of Fuzhou in 2015 was <a href=\"http://www.stratford-herald.com/69714-tang-xianzu-statue-unveiled-shakespeares-birthplace.html\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled in the garden at Shakespeare\u2019s Birthplace</a> in Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Fuzhou-tombs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48591\" height=\"94\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Fuzhou-tombs-150x94.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Fuzhou-tombs-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Fuzhou-tombs-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Fuzhou-tombs-768x480.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Fuzhou-tombs-430x269.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fuzhou tomb complex, 40 out 42 of them from the Ming Dynasty era.

An empty tomb was built in a Fuzhou park in the 1980s just so there\u2019d at least be some kind of monument. Now the city plans to create a destination site where Tang Xianzu and his family were really buried that will attract tourists, fans, artists and scholars alike.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Tomb of China\u2019s Shakespeare found\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48590\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48590#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48580\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48580\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Misunderstood dodo gets its due\">Misunderstood dodo gets its due</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, August 27th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Edwards-Dodo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48586\" height=\"161\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Edwards-Dodo-200x161.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Edwards-Dodo-200x161.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Edwards-Dodo-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Edwards-Dodo-768x616.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Edwards-Dodo-430x345.jpg 430w\" title=\"Dodo painted by Roelant Savery, late 1620s.

Because very few skeletal remains of dodo\u2019s have survived, researchers have been reluctant to slice and dice them to use the latest technology that might discover more about a very misunderstood animal. Recent discoveries of bone fragments gave scientists at London\u2019s Natural History Museum and the University of Cape Town a rare opportunity <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2017/august/lifestyle-of-the-dodo-revealed.html\" target=\"_blank\">to take a look inside the dodo</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>According to evidence in the different layers and types of tissue of the 22 bones examined, the dodo seems to have adapted its lifestyle to Mauritius\u2019s stormy summer, from November to March.</p>\n<p>During this period, heavy rain and strong winds can strip trees of leaves, flowers and fruit, causing severe food shortages for the island\u2019s animals.</p>\n<p>The dodo bones show repeated lines of arrested growth, which the researchers suggest correspond to the harsh conditions of the summer months when the birds were starved of food. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>In common with many modern birds living on the island, the breeding season for dodos appears to have begun around August. Once chicks hatched, they grew quickly to almost adult body size, attaining sexual maturity before the stormy summer began.</p>\n<p>Moulting began after the summer had passed, around March, with the replacement of the feathers of the wings and the tail. By July, the moult would have been completed and the bird would have had a chance to fatten up, ready for the next breeding season to begin.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The study has been published in the journal <em>Scientific Reports</em> and can be <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08536-3\" target=\"_blank\">read free of charge here</a>.</p>\n<p>The dodo has become an icon of species extinction, unfairly painted as a clumsy weirdo who couldn\u2019t find a way to survive, when, as this new evidence underscores, it was very well adapted to its unique environment before people hunted it mercilessly and destroyed its ecosystem. A native species of the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, the dodo\u2019s large beak and rotund body gave it something of a comical appearance which has played into the narrative of the goofy bird who just couldn\u2019t hack in the real world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/first-published-illustration-of-dodo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48585\" height=\"142\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/first-published-illustration-of-dodo-200x142.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/first-published-illustration-of-dodo-200x142.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/first-published-illustration-of-dodo-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/first-published-illustration-of-dodo-768x544.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/first-published-illustration-of-dodo-430x305.jpg 430w\" title=\"First published illustration of a Dodo (left, labelled number ), an engraving in the journal of Cornelis Jacob Van Neck, published 1601.\" width=\"200\"/></a>It was the Dutch they couldn\u2019t survive. Dutch ships first made landfall on Mauritius in 1598. Forty years later, the Dutch established their first settlement to harvest the island\u2019s ebony trees. They also attempted to grow sugar cane and introduced domestic animals and deer. None of these endeavors proved financially successful and the first colony was abandoned two decades years after its founding. Some desultory attempts to colonize the island ensued until the Dutch gave up once and for all in 1710.</p>\n<p>They sure left their mark, though. They destroyed the ebony forests, depriving endemic species of their habitat. They slaughtered local birds and turtles for food, and overwhelmed the ones they didn\u2019t eat with competing animal species. One of those local birds was the dodo. The last living one was sighted in 1662 and the Dutch cared not one whit, so little, in fact, that they didn\u2019t even notice that by the early 1690s the entire species was gone, extinguished in less than a century. </p>\n<p>For a long time the dodo was considered mythical and the only evidence that it had ever existed were a few drawings made from life by explorers and a smattering of bones. The 19th century saw a sudden surge of interest in the curious bird, but there was so little to go on that scientists had to make do with a few drawings and random body parts. In their 1848 monograph <a href=\"http://archive.org/stream/dodoitskindredor00stri#page/n11/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Dodo and Its Kindred</em></a>, Strickland and Melville remarked on how difficult scientific study of a bird that had gone extinct less than two centuries earlier was because the source material was so sparse and unreliable.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1658.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48584\" height=\"146\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1658-150x146.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1658-150x146.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1658-200x195.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1658-768x748.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1658-430x419.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1658.jpg 1239w\" title=\"Engraving of a Dodo printed in the supplementary chapters of the second edition of Jacob de Bondt's &lt;em&gt;Historiae naturalis et medicae Indiae orientalis&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Willem Piso, 1658.\" width=\"150\"/></a>In the case of the didinae, it is unfortunately no easy matter to collect satisfactory information as to their structure, habits, and affinities. We possess only the rude descriptions of unscientific voyagers, three or four oil paintings, and a few scattered osseous fragments, which have survived the neglect of two hundred years. The paleontologist has, in many cases, far better data for determining the zoological characters of a species which perished myriads of years ago, than those presented by a group of birds, which were living in the reign of Charles the First.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first dodo fossils were found in 1865, but they were fragmentary. Research based on those finds that was published in science journals still had to rely heavily on speculation to fill in the many unknowns about this bird.  Amateur naturalist Etienne Thirioux was the first to discover complete or almost complete skeletal remains of dodos during his excavations in Mauritius between 1899 and 1910. Decades after the Dodo became a subject of fascination despite the lack of osteological material bemoaned by Strickland and Melville, Thirioux\u2019s finds made little impact on the scientific community. One Thirioux skeleton, almost complete minus a few bones, wound up in the Durban Natural Science Museum in South Africa. The second is in the Mauritius Institute, appropriately enough. The one in the Mauritius Institute is the only complete dodo skeleton known and the only one that is from a single bird. The Durban skeletal is believed to be a composite of two partial dodo skeletons.</p>\n<p>Neither museum realized what rare and significant specimens they had until a few years ago when the Natural History Museum\u2019s Dr. Julian Hume sought them out to do the first comprehensive study of dodo anatomy in 150 years. The study was capped off with this nifty 3D laser surface scanning reconstruction of the skeleton at the Durban Natural Science Museum  shows a detailed rendering of the bird\u2019s skeletal structure in what scientists now believe is an anatomically accurate position.</p>\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" allowvr=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"322\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" onmousewheel=\"\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/b66a301fb38d4dcc92a7717a800d5372/embed?camera=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"430\"></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; margin: 5px; color: #4A4A4A;\">\n<a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/b66a301fb38d4dcc92a7717a800d5372?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Durban Dodo Skeleton \u2013 Anatomically Correct Pose</a><br/>\n    by <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/aves3d?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Aves 3D</a><br/>\n    on <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campain=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchfab</a>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Misunderstood dodo gets its due\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48580\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> \n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48580#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48570\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48570\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to From the annals of people are terrible\">From the annals of people are terrible</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, August 26th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Damaged-coffin-on-display.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-48573\" height=\"286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Damaged-coffin-on-display-430x286.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Damaged-coffin-on-display-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Damaged-coffin-on-display-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Damaged-coffin-on-display-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Damaged-coffin-on-display-768x510.jpg 768w\" title=\"Damaged medieval coffin on display at Prittlewell Priory Museum.

The council thinks it might take fewer than \u00a3100 ($130). Suitable materials for restoring historical artifacts can be expensive, however, and then there\u2019s the cost that will be incurred by creating a new display for the coffin when it goes back on display. For its own protection, it will have to be completely enclosed, so museum visitors will have to pay in distance and separation from the artifact for the carelessness of two idiots.</p>\n<p>Founded in around 1110 A.D. by Robert FitzSuen as the Priory of St Mary, a cell of the Cluniac Priory of St Pancras in Lewes, Sussex, Prittlewell was a small monastery with fewer than 20 monks at any given time. Most of the medieval priory was destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. That and later construction is why archaeological material from the original priory is so sparse. Henry VIII granted the monastery, its lands and revenues to Thomas Audley, Lord Chancellor of England and Keeper of the Great Seal, who also scored a number of far larger and more valuable monastic estates in the wake of the Dissolution. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Prittlewell-Priory-Museum-and-Park.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48577\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Prittlewell-Priory-Museum-and-Park-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Prittlewell-Priory-Museum-and-Park-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Prittlewell-Priory-Museum-and-Park-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Prittlewell-Priory-Museum-and-Park-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Prittlewell-Priory-Museum-and-Park-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Prittlewell Priory Museum and Park.

The Scratton family made the most pronounced mark on the estate in the Victorian era, extensively renovating, rebuilding and adding to what was left of the medieval monastery to create an impressive and livable country home. Having lived in the era before <em>Poltergeist</em>, they created a walled kitchen garden over what had been the monks\u2019 burial ground. The inevitable hauntings ensued and visitors have reported seeing a ghostly monk wandering the halls of the former cloister.</p>\n<p>In 1917 Prittlewell Priory, the buildings, the 22-acre property and six adjacent acres were bought from Captain Scratton by prosperous local jeweler and benefactor Robert Arthur Jones. He donated the whole kit and caboodle to the city of Southend with the explicit intent that it be turned into a multi-use public facility for the benefit of the people of Southend. Jones explained his reasoning at the time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI think it is a sin for a man to die rich, it is a great privilege to me to be able to do this, for I believe strongly in facilities for recreation. There will now be no need for such an out of the way and costly park as Belfairs. Prittlewell, with its historic and old-world associations, its beautiful trees and lakes, and its nearness to the centre of town, is an ideal place. Part of the building would be suitable for a museum, and there would also be refreshment room accommodation, while the grounds would provide facilities for cricket, football, tennis, hockey and other sports. I propose that the name of the park should be Priory Park\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crack-and-missing-chunk-in-medieval-sarcophagus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Prittlewell-Priory-Museum..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48574\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crack-and-missing-chunk-in-medieval-sarcophagus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Prittlewell-Priory-Museum.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crack-and-missing-chunk-in-medieval-sarcophagus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Prittlewell-Priory-Museum.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crack-and-missing-chunk-in-medieval-sarcophagus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Prittlewell-Priory-Museum.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crack-and-missing-chunk-in-medieval-sarcophagus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Prittlewell-Priory-Museum.-768x510.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Crack-and-missing-chunk-in-medieval-sarcophagus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Prittlewell-Priory-Museum.-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"View of crack in the side of the damaged coffin.

The land is arid desert, virtually rainless, and cannot grow any kind of crop at all without extensive irrigation systems piping water down from the mountains. Even irrigated, the land was only productive enough for two crops of cotton a year. The first was of comparatively good quality, but the manufactured product was still low-end. The second crop was worse in quality, lower in quantity and even more difficult to harvest. Harvesting by machine was not possible because the machines left too much of the bolls (the white fluffy part) behind while picking up too much of the leaves and stems that are useless in the manufacture of cotton textiles.</p>\n<p>From a description on the back of <a href=\"https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/5e66b3e9-1f21-d471-e040-e00a180654d7\" target=\"_blank\">a stereoscopic card</a> of Chinese cotton plantation pickers published by Underwood &amp; Underwood in 1900:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It has been found that Chinese laborers are the most reliable for work on a cotton plantation. They receive seventy cents, silver, per quintal (100 pounds) and they average two quintals a day. An expert picker will gather three quintals per day on the first crop of the season. On the second crop the laborers receive one dollar, silver, per quintal, because this crop is harder to pick. The cotton grown here is of medium grade, such as is used in the manufacture of coarse muslins and rough cotton goods.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With slavery abolished in 1854, the solution to the thorny question of who would willingly do this awful job for crap wages was what it always is: immigrants. Chinese indentured labourers migrated to Peru starting in 1849, when slavery was being phased out and there was a dire shortage of workers for the sugar and cotton plantations and guano mines. Just as in the United States with the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad, Chinese labour in Peru played a key role in the Guano Boom, a period of great prosperity for Peru thanks to profits from guano exports to Europe where it was highly prized as fertilizer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remains-of-Chinese-labourer-excavated.-Reuters.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48564\" height=\"102\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remains-of-Chinese-labourer-excavated.-Reuters-150x102.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remains-of-Chinese-labourer-excavated.-Reuters-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remains-of-Chinese-labourer-excavated.-Reuters-200x136.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remains-of-Chinese-labourer-excavated.-Reuters-768x522.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remains-of-Chinese-labourer-excavated.-Reuters-430x292.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of skull of Chinese labourer with fractured skull. REUTERS/Mariana Bazo\" width=\"150\"/></a>In the mid-19th century, 100,000 Chinese labourers, almost entirely Cantonese men from Guangdong province, immigrated to Peru to work in brutal conditions for spare change. They were deceived into signing contracts with the promise of making a decent living only to find almost immediately they\u2019d been lied to. The ships that transported them were called \u201cfloating hells\u201d and the ones who survived the four-month voyage arrived riddled with disease and injury. They were immediately put to work in the plantations and mines, working from dawn until night. After 12 hours of back-breaking labour, they were locked into their quarters to keep them from running away.</p>\n<p>Little wonder they hit the opium pipes once those doors locked, and the plantation owners encouraged the habit because they just so happened to have a monopoly on opium sales granted by the British. They couldn\u2019t make that kind of money off of alcohol and coca.</p>\n<p>Chinese immigration was severely restricted in 1909 and prohibited entirely in 1930. By then there was a well-established community of mixed Chinese and Peruvian heritage. Their descendants, the Tusans, still live in Peru today. Up to 3% of the population is of Chinese ancestry, more than 1,000,000 people according to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the largest ethnically Chinese community in Latin America and the seventh largest in the world. Lima has more than 6,000 Chinese restaurants that serve a unique fusion of Chinese and Peruvian cuisine and a small but thriving Chinatown (the Barrio Chino) with schools, temples, benevolent associations and multiple Chinese language periodicals.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Chinese workers found buried in ancient Lima pyramid\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48557\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <span>Comments Off<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> on Chinese workers found buried in ancient Lima pyramid</span></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48540\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48540\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Ancient child sarcophagi found at Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium\">Ancient child sarcophagi found at Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, August 24th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Excavation-behind-utility-pipes.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48544\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Excavation-behind-utility-pipes-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Excavation-behind-utility-pipes-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Excavation-behind-utility-pipes-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Excavation-behind-utility-pipes-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Excavation-behind-utility-pipes-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Excavation of sarcophagus behind old utility pipes.

One of them is rough hewn, the chisel marks clearly visible on the interior and exterior, while the other is decorated with a bas relief on the exterior. The relief depicts a central pair of erotes (Cupid-like figures also known as putti or cherubs) holding aloft a circular medallion that is either too eroded or too soil-encrusted to identify the image it bears. It was likely an image of the deceased called a clipeus portrait, or perhaps a mythological reference. Two small figures recline underneath the medallion.

The dating can\u2019t be asserted with confidence until the objects have been subjected to further testing. Concerned that the open excavation pit was too easily accessible to vandals and looters, archaeologists decided to remove the sarcophagi from the site as soon as they could. They have been transported to the laboratories of the Special Superintendency to be cleaned, studied and conserved. The first dating results and other research will be published next fall.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Ancient child sarcophagi found at Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48540\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48540#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48529\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48529\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 6th c. mosaic inscription found near Damascus Gate\">6th c. mosaic inscription found near Damascus Gate</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-mentioning-Justinian-found-near-Damascus-Gate.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48532\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-mentioning-Justinian-found-near-Damascus-Gate.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-mentioning-Justinian-found-near-Damascus-Gate.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-mentioning-Justinian-found-near-Damascus-Gate.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-mentioning-Justinian-found-near-Damascus-Gate.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-mentioning-Justinian-found-near-Damascus-Gate.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-mentioning-Justinian-found-near-Damascus-Gate.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA..jpg 1152w\" title=\"Mosaic floor with Greek inscription mentioning Emperor Justinian found near the Damascus Gate. Photo by Assaf Peretz, IAA.\" width=\"200\"/></a>A team of Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologists surveying the site of a cable line installation near Jerusalem\u2019s Damascus Gate this summer have discovered <a href=\"http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=4309\" target=\"_blank\">a rare 6th century mosaic inscription</a> that namedrops the Emperor Justinian. The excavation was just about complete with little to show for it besides a few extremely damaged ancient remains that were mangled by repeated infrastructure projects in the area in recent decades. Then the team spied a piece of the mosaic inscription between the network of pipes and cables. </p>\n<p>When they excavated it fully, they found large room with a surviving mosaic tile floor. Most of the floor is covered in simple white tesserae, but one section has an inscription in black tile. The six lines of Greek mention the precise date, Constinius (aka Constantine), who was in charge of the building project, and the Byzantine Emperor Flavius Justinianus, better known to us today as Justinian the Great. </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48530\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-768x503.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-430x281.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of mosaic inscription. Photo by Assaf Peretz, IAA.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Dr. Leah Di Segni, of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the expert on ancient Greek inscriptions, deciphered the inscription. The inscription reads, \u201cIn the time of our most pious emperor Flavius Justinian, also this entire building Constantine the most God-loving priest and abbot, established and raised, in the 14th indiction\u201d. According to Di Segni, \u201cThis inscription commemorates the founding of the building by Constantine, the priest. The inscription names the emperor Flavius Justinian. It seems that the building was used as a hostel for pilgrims.\u201d Di Segni added, \u201c\u2018Indiction\u2019 is an ancient method of counting years, for taxation purposes. Based on historical sources, the mosaic can be dated to the year 550/551 AD.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>For centuries the Damascus Gate was the main entrance into northern Jerusalem, and the area became a hive of activity during the 6th century under the fully Christianized Byzantine Empire thanks to a sharp increase in religious construction and pilgrimages to Jerusalem. The building with the mosaic floor was on the road leading into and out of the gate, the perfect location for a pilgrim hostel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Madaba-Map.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48533\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Madaba-Map-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Madaba-Map-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Madaba-Map-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Madaba-Map-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Madaba-Map-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of Jerusalem on the mosaic map inside St. George church, Madaba, Jordan.

It even made it on the extraordinary Madaba Map, a cartographic floor mosaic of the Middle East in the apse of the 6th century church of Saint George at Madaba, Jordan, which contains the first known map of Jerusalem. An inscription found on the vault of the Nea Church, first excavated in 1970, again mentions Constantine, the abbot of the church, and Emperor Justinian.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic-cleaned.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48531\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic-cleaned.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic-cleaned.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic-cleaned.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic-cleaned.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justinian-mosaic-cleaned.-Photo-by-Assaf-Peretz-IAA.-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mosaic inscription cleaned in situ. Photo by Assaf Peretz, IAA.\" width=\"150\"/></a>That Constinius oversaw the construction of Jerusalem\u2019s most important church inside the city walls as well the pilgrim hostel outside the walls shows how prominent a person he was in mid-6th century Jerusalem. Since a number of other structures from this time have been unearthed in the Damascus Gate area, archaeologists believe he was involved in large-scale, organized building projects of churches, monastery complexes and other religious structures both inside and outside the city walls.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Di Segni adds, \u201cThis new inscription helps us understand Justinian\u2019s building projects in Jerusalem, especially the Nea Church. The rare combination of archaeological finds and historical sources, woven together, is incredible to witness, and they throw important light on Jerusalem\u2019s past.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The mosaic has been lifted from the site and, after briefly being displayed to the press at the Rockefeller Museum in East Jerusalem, is now undergoing conservation at the Israel Antiquities Authority\u2019s laboratory.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-inscription-at-Rockefeller-Museum-in-Jerusalem.-Photo-by-Ronen-Zvulun-REUTERS..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-48537\" height=\"287\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-inscription-at-Rockefeller-Museum-in-Jerusalem.-Photo-by-Ronen-Zvulun-REUTERS.-430x287.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-inscription-at-Rockefeller-Museum-in-Jerusalem.-Photo-by-Ronen-Zvulun-REUTERS.-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-inscription-at-Rockefeller-Museum-in-Jerusalem.-Photo-by-Ronen-Zvulun-REUTERS.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-inscription-at-Rockefeller-Museum-in-Jerusalem.-Photo-by-Ronen-Zvulun-REUTERS.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mosaic-inscription-at-Rockefeller-Museum-in-Jerusalem.-Photo-by-Ronen-Zvulun-REUTERS.-768x512.jpg 768w\" title=\"Mosaic inscription displayed at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem August 23, 2017.

Photo by Tom Tingle for The Republic.\" width=\"200\"/></a>In a happy counterpoint to yesterday\u2019s sad news, a painting by Willem de Kooning stolen from the University of Arizona Museum of Art in Tucson 32 years ago <a href=\"http://artmuseum.arizona.edu/events/event/willem-de-koonings-woman-ochre-returns-ua-museum-art\" target=\"_blank\">has been found and returned</a> to the museum. <em>Woman-Ochre</em> was snatched November 29th, 1985, the day after Thanksgiving, in a classic two-person misdirection ploy. A woman and a man waltzed into the museum bright and early at 9:00AM. The woman ran interference with the security guard, capturing his attention while her partner cut the painting out of the frame. They quickly left together and that was the last anyone saw of them. The whole operation from entry to exit had taken less than 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>The subsequent police investigation failed to find the culprits or the painting and for three decades the case was cold as ice. It turned burning hot earlier this month when David Van Auker, Buck Burns and Rick Johnson, owners of Manzanita Ridge Furniture &amp; Antiques in Silver City, New Mexico, bought the painting at an estate sale. Van Auker saw it hanging behind the bedroom door at the home of Jerry and Rita Alter in Cliff, New Mexico, and decided to buy it along with a pile of other assorted gewgaws from the sale. He had no idea it was an original de Kooning; he just thought it was cool.</p>\n<p>He propped the painting up against the wall of his shop and a customer told him it looked like a de Kooning. Then another customer noticed it and mentioned it could be a de Kooning oil painting. A third soon joined the chorus. Van Auker started getting antsy. Much Googling ensued, and when he read about the theft from the museum, he realized he very likely had a gazillion dollar stolen painting in his shop. He nervously moved it into the bathroom to keep it out of view of any more customers.</p>\n<p>Van Auker called the UAMA and told them he thought he had their long-lost de Kooning. The next day the head of the museum, a curator and a restorer from the Arizona State Museum scrutinized the painting. The restorer examined it for two hours at the end of which she confirmed that it was authentic. After spending a night under lock and key at the local police station, <em>Woman-Ochre</em> was transported back to the museum in Tucson.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis is a monumental moment for the museum,\u201d said Meg Hagyard, director of UAMA. \u201cWe are thrilled at the possibility that this work could once again be on exhibit in our galleries. This is an especially poignant moment, as \u2018Woman-Ochre\u2019 was donated by Edward Joseph Gallagher Jr. as part of one of the largest gifts in the museum\u2019s history. Having both the collection and that gift complete once again is something that we\u2019ve always hoped for.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UA-Museum-of-Art-staff-Nathan-Saxton-Exhibitions-Specialist-and-Kristen-Schmidt-Registrar-examine-DeKooning.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48527\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UA-Museum-of-Art-staff-Nathan-Saxton-Exhibitions-Specialist-and-Kristen-Schmidt-Registrar-examine-DeKooning-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UA-Museum-of-Art-staff-Nathan-Saxton-Exhibitions-Specialist-and-Kristen-Schmidt-Registrar-examine-DeKooning-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UA-Museum-of-Art-staff-Nathan-Saxton-Exhibitions-Specialist-and-Kristen-Schmidt-Registrar-examine-DeKooning-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UA-Museum-of-Art-staff-Nathan-Saxton-Exhibitions-Specialist-and-Kristen-Schmidt-Registrar-examine-DeKooning-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UA-Museum-of-Art-staff-Nathan-Saxton-Exhibitions-Specialist-and-Kristen-Schmidt-Registrar-examine-DeKooning-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/UA-Museum-of-Art-staff-Nathan-Saxton-Exhibitions-Specialist-and-Kristen-Schmidt-Registrar-examine-DeKooning.jpg 1500w\" title=\"UA Museum of Art staff Nathan Saxton, Exhibitions Specialist, and Kristen Schmidt, Registrar, examine De Kooning's &quot;Woman-Ochre&quot;.

While eschewing the traditional depictions of what he called \u201cthe idol, the Venus, the nude,\u201d Kooning drew from a wide range of iconographic references \u2014 prehistoric mother goddess figurines, advertising models, pinup girls \u2014 to create abstract expressionist versions of figures out of thick lines and dynamic slashes of color. </p>\n<p>Paintings in de Kooning\u2019s Woman series today grace the walls of the world\u2019s top museums, and on the rare occasions when they become available on the market, they sell for astronomical prices. Ten years ago one sold for $137.5 million. Bound by the terms of the Gallagher donation, the UAMA cannot sell the painting even if it wanted to, which it most emphatically does not, but based on the comparables, it could be worth something in the neighborhood of $160 million.</p>\n<p>At the time of the theft, the painting was insured for $400,000, a risibly small sum compared to its market value today. The museum very wisely put the money in an endowment fund and used the interest to upgrade its security systems. Upon the painting\u2019s return, the museum paid back the original $400,000 to the insurers so they again have clean title to the artwork.</p>\n<p>The de Kooning is in need of some tender loving care. The edges are ripped from being hacked out of the original frame and whatever jackass reframed it stapled it to a board. The thieves also rolled it up for ease of transport, making the paint brittle in parts. Thankfully it has not begun to flake yet. Before the painting goes back on display, it will undergo thorough restoration and study. Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating how the stolen work wound up in the nice but humble three-bedroom home of a retired music teacher and a retired speech pathologist.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Stolen de Kooning found 32 years after theft\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48524\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48524#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2017/08/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

Created by premiere Manchester banner maker Thomas Brown &amp; Sons, the banner celebrates the founding of the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU) by Emmeline Pankhurst, one of the fiercest and most committed suffragette leaders, in her home at <a href=\"http://www.thepankhurstcentre.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">62 Nelson Street</a>, Manchester, in 1903. The date of its manufacture is not known, but the banner glows with the colors of the WSPU campaign: green signifying reform, white purity and purple dignity. The green, white and purple weren\u2019t adopted as the WSPU\u2019s official colors until 1908.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48618\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-136x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-136x150.jpg 136w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-200x221.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-768x849.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Letter-detail-430x475.jpg 430w\" title=\"Embroidered letter detail.

Sick of failed attempts to extend the franchise by ostensibly allied politicians, the WSPU took as their motto \u201cdeeds not words\u201d and hit the streets. They tied themselves to railings, blew up mailboxes, went on hunger strikes when they were arrested and refused to eat even under threat of force-feeding. They made a very effective nuisance of themselves until World War I broke out in 1914 and the WSPU suspended all its activities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48615\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-200x250.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-768x958.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Banner-back-430x536.jpg 430w\" title=\"Back of the banner.

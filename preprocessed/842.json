The effect was created by grinding up actual pearls and adding them to the paint. It was intended for display on the auto show circuit, but unlike many show cars, this one was made to work.

It ran the show circuit for the next few years and became immensely popular, so much so that Ford made model and toy car versions for the mass market. In 1959, the Futura had its first brush with show business, snagging a featured role in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052934/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>It Started with a Kiss</em></a>, and upstaging human stars Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds. Since pearl white didn\u2019t photograph with the drama the filmmakers were looking for, the car was painted red. See the Futura steal the show in this collection of clips from the movie:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHMLqe5y7Ag&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>With the dawn of a new decade, the Futura\u2019s days as a star of stage and screen seemed over. Its tailfin-and-bubble look was at odds with the more streamlined aesthetics of the 60s. Ford sold the car to George Barris, who worked for the company\u2019s Ford Custom Car Caravan for six years in the early and mid-60s, for $1. (This token price wasn\u2019t a particular slur on the illustrious Futura, mind you. Ford and Barris had done this before. Concept cars would be retired and sold to Barris for a nominal sum so he could use them in movies and television. Ah, the days before product placement\u2026)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21825\" height=\"62\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot-150x62.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot-150x62.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot-200x82.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot-430x177.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot.jpg 1027w\" title=\"The Futura wasting away in Barris' lot in the early to mid-1960s\" width=\"150\"/></a>The car sat in Barris\u2019 lot for a few years doing nothing when in late 1965, destiny came calling. <em>Batman</em> producer William Dozier called needing a Batmobile. He gave Barris 15 days and $15,000 to build it and so he did. The Futura\u2019s two-seater design and unique 50s futurist winged look made it the perfect car to customize into Batman and Robin\u2019s main ride. A few metal modifications, engine boosts, racing wheels exposed by opened wheel wells, Batgadget attachments and a gloss black paint job with glow-orange red trim later, history burst out of the Batcave.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBe3QzVW5_8&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>Although many Batmobiles have followed in the wake of its turbine flame, the original still holds the pole position in fans\u2019 hearts. Not just because of its fantastic good looks, either. It won a race against the 1989 Tim Burton Batmobile (the race starts at 8:00 in <a href=\"http://youtu.be/6m3jcBMI9WU\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>) so its badassery has more than stood the test of time. </p>\n<p>After years on the convention circuit, in special appearances and on display in museums, the Batmobile is still in pristine shape.  It is being sold by George Barris himself who has been the sole owner since it was decommissioned by Ford. Whoever is fortunate enough to buy it in January is going to spend a lot more than the dollar it cost the only other time it was sold. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The car features a 390-in 1956 Lincoln V-8 engine and a B&amp;M Hydro Automatic transmission. Gadgets include a nose-mounted aluminum Cable Cutter Blade, Bat Ray Projector, Anti-Theft Device, Detect-a-scope, Batscope, Bat Eye Switch, Antenna Activator, Police Band Cut-In Switch, Automatic Tire Inflation Device, Remote Batcomputer, the Batphone, Emergency Bat Turn Lever, Anti-Fire Activator, Bat Smoke, Bat Photoscope, and many other Bat gadgets. If needed, the Batmobile was capable of a quick 180\u00b0 \u201cbat-turn\u201d thanks to two rear-mounted ten-foot Deist parachutes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would slap a baby just to get a ride in this car. I don\u2019t even want to consider what I\u2019d do to own it.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/batmobile-lincoln-futura.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21826\" height=\"342\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/batmobile-lincoln-futura-430x342.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/batmobile-lincoln-futura-430x342.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/batmobile-lincoln-futura-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/batmobile-lincoln-futura-200x159.jpg 200w\" title=\"Lincoln Futura before, Batmobile after\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Original Batmobile for sale for the first time\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21816\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>", "title": "Original Batmobile for sale for the first time", "url": "http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2012/11", "content": "The first and some would say greatest of all Batmobiles, the one that started it all, is going on sale for the first time at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, on January 19th, 2013.

It still has all the Batgadgets even the most covetous and demanding of comic nerds could wish for and a pre-Bat history that the most covetous and demanding of car nerds could only dream of.</p>\n<p>It started its life in 1955, a one-off Lincoln Futura concept car. Designed by Ford\u2019s lead stylist Bill Schmidt who was inspired by manta rays and mako sharks he had seen while scuba diving, the Futura\u2019s body was built entirely at the Ghia Body Works in Turin, Italy, in 1954 and affixed to an experimental Lincoln Mark II chassis made three years before the first Mark IIs were sold. The car was 19 feet long, seven feet wide, and just<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lincoln-Futura-1955.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21827\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lincoln-Futura-1955-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lincoln-Futura-1955-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lincoln-Futura-1955-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lincoln-Futura-1955-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lincoln-Futura-1955.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Lincoln Futura 1955\" width=\"150\"/></a> 4.4 feet high with a double, clear-plastic bubble top, huge outward-angled tailfins on the back and front sides, a wide oval grill to give it that shark-mouth aggressive look and all kinds of newfangled technology like push-button transmission, warning lights and speedometer (among other indicators) housed in the steering wheel, and a circular rear antenna that also served as a microphone to pick up and amplify traffic or horn sounds from any car behind them to the driver and passenger inside the bubble canopy. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Futura-rear.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21832\" height=\"94\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Futura-rear-150x94.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Futura-rear-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Futura-rear-200x126.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Futura-rear-430x271.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Futura-rear.jpg 1250w\" title=\"Futura rear\" width=\"150\"/></a>This was Ford\u2019s car of the future, a repository of all the Jetsons-like technology that could be crammed into 19 feet of vehicle. Even its paint job was cutting edge, a Pearlescent Frost-Blue white which was one of the first pearlescent car treatments. The effect was created by grinding up actual pearls and adding them to the paint. It was intended for display on the auto show circuit, but unlike many show cars, this one was made to work. It was drivable from day one. The total production cost for the Lincoln Futura was $250,000.</p>\n<p>The Futura made its debut at the Chicago Auto Show of January 8th, 1955. It ran the show circuit for the next few years and became immensely popular, so much so that Ford made model and toy car versions for the mass market. In 1959, the Futura had its first brush with show business, snagging a featured role in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052934/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>It Started with a Kiss</em></a>, and upstaging human stars Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds. Since pearl white didn\u2019t photograph with the drama the filmmakers were looking for, the car was painted red. See the Futura steal the show in this collection of clips from the movie:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHMLqe5y7Ag&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>With the dawn of a new decade, the Futura\u2019s days as a star of stage and screen seemed over. Its tailfin-and-bubble look was at odds with the more streamlined aesthetics of the 60s. Ford sold the car to George Barris, who worked for the company\u2019s Ford Custom Car Caravan for six years in the early and mid-60s, for $1. (This token price wasn\u2019t a particular slur on the illustrious Futura, mind you. Ford and Barris had done this before. Concept cars would be retired and sold to Barris for a nominal sum so he could use them in movies and television. Ah, the days before product placement\u2026)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21825\" height=\"62\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot-150x62.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot-150x62.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot-200x82.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot-430x177.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/futura-lot.jpg 1027w\" title=\"The Futura wasting away in Barris' lot in the early to mid-1960s\" width=\"150\"/></a>The car sat in Barris\u2019 lot for a few years doing nothing when in late 1965, destiny came calling. <em>Batman</em> producer William Dozier called needing a Batmobile. He gave Barris 15 days and $15,000 to build it and so he did. The Futura\u2019s two-seater design and unique 50s futurist winged look made it the perfect car to customize into Batman and Robin\u2019s main ride. A few metal modifications, engine boosts, racing wheels exposed by opened wheel wells, Batgadget attachments and a gloss black paint job with glow-orange red trim later, history burst out of the Batcave.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBe3QzVW5_8&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>Although many Batmobiles have followed in the wake of its turbine flame, the original still holds the pole position in fans\u2019 hearts. Not just because of its fantastic good looks, either. It won a race against the 1989 Tim Burton Batmobile (the race starts at 8:00 in <a href=\"http://youtu.be/6m3jcBMI9WU\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>) so its badassery has more than stood the test of time. </p>\n<p>After years on the convention circuit, in special appearances and on display in museums, the Batmobile is still in pristine shape.  It is being sold by George Barris himself who has been the sole owner since it was decommissioned by Ford.

This is the first thorough scientific excavation of a crannog in Ulster and it almost didn\u2019t happen at all. </p>\n<p>Although Drumclay Crannog, long since filled in and no longer a discernible island in Loch Erne, had been marked on surveys and maps going back to the 19th century, its precise location was unclear. In 2007, the Roads Service began planning construction of a new highway link road outside of the county town of Enniskillen near the crannog. They did some rudimentary surveys of the planned route but the archaeologists they send to walk the area couldn\u2019t pinpoint the crannog due to waterlogged conditions and limited access. The Department of Regional Development clearly stated in its notice of intent to build that the construction would harm the archaeological site, even if it didn\u2019t cross exactly over it. To mitigate the damage, the department said the crew would be really careful stripping topsoil and would be sure to record all archaeological finds so they\u2019d be fully documented before they were destroyed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/interior-of-house-with-hearth.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21798\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/interior-of-house-with-hearth-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/interior-of-house-with-hearth-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/interior-of-house-with-hearth-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/interior-of-house-with-hearth-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/interior-of-house-with-hearth.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Interior of a house with hearth in the center\" width=\"150\"/></a>In 2011, once it had built a temporary stone haul route over the crannog, the construction company employed archaeologists to dig a single exploratory trench. They confirmed the exact location of the crannog (just slightly north of where it had been marked on the ordnance maps) and that it was a rich archaeological site with extensive structural remains and artifacts. Now the Road Service decided to preserve the site in situ by filling the perimeter with rocks and building a bridge over it rather than putting a road in its place, but in April 2012 it became clear that the heavy machinery and construction work in the area was draining the water-logged land. The crannog began to collapse outward. Road stone was dumped around it in an attempt to keep the island and its stratigraphy stable, but the stones sank like so many Monty Python Swamp Castles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/worn-leather-shoe-sole1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21807\" height=\"41\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/worn-leather-shoe-sole1-150x41.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/worn-leather-shoe-sole1-150x41.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/worn-leather-shoe-sole1-200x55.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/worn-leather-shoe-sole1-430x119.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/worn-leather-shoe-sole1.jpg 1140w\" title=\"worn leather shoe sole\" width=\"150\"/></a>In June 2012, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency determined that the crannog had to be excavated before it was too late. A small group of contract archaeologists hired by the construction company were given six weeks to do what they could. They had limited tools, no storage facility for keeping organic artifacts in proper conditions, poor recording and sampling practices. Meanwhile construction was still going on all around them. The discoveries were already remarkable \u2014 leather clothing, human remains, the foundation of a rare double-walled wattle house \u2014 but with the deadline looming and the damage ongoing, things looked bad for the crannog.</p>\n<p>Members of the crew contacted archaeologist Robert M. Chapple who <a href=\"http://rmchapple.blogspot.ie/2012/07/urgent-important-early-christian.html\" target=\"_blank\">got the word out on his blog</a> and in the press. The subsequent outcry spurred Minister of the Environment Alex Attwood to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-19053339\" target=\"blank\">impose a construction exclusion zone around the archaeological site</a>, to extend the excavation another eight weeks and to appoint an independent reviewer to investigate how this debacle had come about. In response to their letters of protests, Attwood assured the <a href=\"http://www.archaeologists.net/news/120725-crannog-site-drumclay-co-fermanagh\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Archaeologists</a>, that he was taking a personal interest in the site, that he had assigned additional staff to the project, including an environmental archaeologist to oversee the sampling strategy and a wood specialist to help with the identification and preservation of organic materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/house-with-fallen-wickerscreen-wall.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21797\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/house-with-fallen-wickerscreen-wall-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/house-with-fallen-wickerscreen-wall-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/house-with-fallen-wickerscreen-wall-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/house-with-fallen-wickerscreen-wall-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/house-with-fallen-wickerscreen-wall.jpg 1200w\" title=\"House with fallen wickerscreen wall\" width=\"150\"/></a>Those additional eight weeks of excavation have turned into five months <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20540374\" target=\"_blank\">and what glorious ones they have been</a>. Archaeologists have discovered that, contrary to previous estimates that put the age of the crannog at about 700 years old, people lived there from at least 900 A.D. to 1600. The extensive preserved structures of small but well-appointed houses indicate the crannog was home to one noble family whose scions and servants lived in four or five houses at any given time. They were adept at woodwork and metal work, grew their own crops and butchered their own meat. They also spun wool from their own sheep to make their clothes.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wooden-bowl-with-cross-carved-into-base.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21810\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wooden-bowl-with-cross-carved-into-base-150x144.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wooden-bowl-with-cross-carved-into-base-150x144.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wooden-bowl-with-cross-carved-into-base-200x192.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wooden-bowl-with-cross-carved-into-base-430x413.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wooden-bowl-with-cross-carved-into-base.jpg 1044w\" title=\"wooden bowl with cross carved into base\" width=\"100\"/></a>Some of the most striking finds are, a wooden bowl with a cross carved into its base, a unique find from an excavation in Ireland, parts of wooden vessels with interlace decoration, and exquisite combs made from antler and bone, status symbols that date to between 1000 and 1100 AD.</p>\n<p>Other finds include what is believed to be the largest collection of pottery from a crannog in Northern Ireland, as well as ornaments of iron, bronze and bone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/yew-gaming-piece1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21806\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 82px) 100vw, 82px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/yew-gaming-piece1-82x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/yew-gaming-piece1-82x150.jpg 82w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/yew-gaming-piece1-164x300.jpg 164w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/yew-gaming-piece1.jpg 400w\" title=\"Yew gaming piece\" width=\"82\"/></a>As the site had been waterlogged, a huge volume of wooden remains have been found, from gaming chess-like pieces, to drinking cups right through to the timber foundations of dozens of houses.</p>\n<p>Parts of at least two different log boats have been discovered, and a wooden oar \u2013 from deposits several centuries older than the boats \u2013 has also been found.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bone-comb-with-incised-decoration1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21805\" height=\"21\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bone-comb-with-incised-decoration1-150x21.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bone-comb-with-incised-decoration1-150x21.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bone-comb-with-incised-decoration1-200x28.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bone-comb-with-incised-decoration1-430x62.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bone-comb-with-incised-decoration1.jpg 1164w\" title=\"Bone comb with incised decoration\" width=\"150\"/></a>Some of the combs are similar to others found in Dublin and York and dating to Viking times.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists have also discovered leather shoes, agricultural equipment, knives and decorated dress pins.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The archaeological dig is now scheduled to conclude on December 30th, but there are still unexplored layers.

Particularly lamentable was the theft of multiple objects, including a gold hippocampus brooch, from the Lydian Hoard kept at the <a href=\"http://www.kultur.gov.tr/genel/SanalMuzeler/UsakArkeolojiMuzesi/en/default.html\" target=\"_blank\">U\u015fak Museum of Archaeology</a> in western Turkey.</p>\n<p>The Lydian Hoard is a collection of 363 artifacts, many of them silver and gold, that were looted from neighboring 6th century B.C. burial mounds in the U\u015fak and Manisa Provinces of Turkey. The treasure was said to have belonged to King Croesus of Lydia, of \u201crich as Croesus\u201d fame, but there\u2019s no specific connection to him beyond the fact that they date to around the same time as his reign. The tombs certainly belonged to royalty, but they could have been from Croesus\u2019 family, high functionaries or even the Persian satraps who ruled after Cyrus\u2019 crushing victory over the Lydian king in 547 B.C.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Looted-Anktepe-tumulus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Looted Lydian tumulus at Anktepe\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21771\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Looted-Anktepe-tumulus-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Looted-Anktepe-tumulus-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Looted-Anktepe-tumulus-200x276.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Looted-Anktepe-tumulus-430x594.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Looted-Anktepe-tumulus.jpg 775w\" title=\"Looted Lydian tumulus at Anktepe\" width=\"108\"/></a>The first tomb was discovered by looters in 1966. When they found they could not penetrate the hard marble outer walls, they used gunpowder to blow up the main entrance. Inside they found the remains of a royal woman and 125 vessels, pieces of jewelry, and sculptures in gold and silver. Looters found other richly appointed tombs in the area over the next two years. The entire haul is known as the Lydian Hoard, or the Karun (the Arabic and Persian name for Croesus) Treasure.</p>\n<p>The contents of the tombs and even painted pieces of the walls themselves were stripped and sold by Swiss and American middlemen to the Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1966 and 1970. The Met paid a total of $1.5 million for the Lydian Hoard, but they kept it hidden in storage for more than 20 years. \u00d6zgen Acar, a Turkish reporter who had spent years talking to the looters and following the tracks of the stolen hoard, caught wind of a potential Lydian treasure in the Met\u2019s basement but was unable to pin it down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lydian-Hoard-silver-alabastron.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Silver alabastron from the Lydian Hoard\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21772\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 98px) 100vw, 98px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lydian-Hoard-silver-alabastron-98x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lydian-Hoard-silver-alabastron-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lydian-Hoard-silver-alabastron-196x300.jpg 196w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lydian-Hoard-silver-alabastron-430x656.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lydian-Hoard-silver-alabastron.jpg 525w\" title=\"Silver alabastron from the Lydian Hoard\" width=\"98\"/></a>Finally, in 1984 many of the artifacts saw the light of day in a major exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Even though the museum intentionally mislabeled them as part of an \u201cEast Greek treasure,\u201d Acar immediately recognized them as the Lydian artifacts from the descriptions he had been given by the looters. He alerted the Turkish government. In 1986, Turkey officially requested the hoard be returned. The Met refused; Turkey sued.</p>\n<p>The legal wranglings continued until 1993 when the Met, caught red-handed by the minutes of their own acquisition committee which described how a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects, agreed to return the treasure. The artifacts went on display at the <a href=\"http://www.anadolumedeniyetlerimuzesi.gov.tr/ana-sayfa/1-54417/20121128.html\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Anatolian Civilizations</a> in Ankara for two years, after which the hoard became part of the permanent collection of the museum in U\u015fak near the tombs where it was buried. (This whole story and more is recounted in Sharon Waxman\u2019s excellent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Loot-Battle-Stolen-Treasures-Ancient/dp/B003R4ZIYE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354125214&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"blank\"><em>Loot: The Battle over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World</em></a>.)</p>\n<p>Turkey spent six years and 40 million dollars pursuing the Lydian Hoard in court. Yet, in 2006, the country\u2019s entire budget for museum and archaeological site maintenance was $66 million. Even when the one-room museum in U\u015fak went from holding a collection of rugs to one of the greatest treasures in the country, there was no additional security installed. Add to that the remote location and tiny number of visitors to the U\u015fak museum, and it\u2019s no small wonder that insiders were able to help themselves to pieces of the hard-won Lydian Hoard without anyone noticing for a year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Winged-seahorse-fake.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Fake hippocampus which was substituted for the real one at U\u015fak museum\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21764\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Winged-seahorse-fake-109x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Winged-seahorse-fake-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Winged-seahorse-fake-430x586.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Winged-seahorse-fake.jpg 1008w\" title=\"Fake hippocampus which was substituted for the real one at U\u015fak museum\" width=\"109\"/></a>The most famous and precious object from the treasure, the gold hippocampus (a mythical winged horse with the tail of a fish representing air, earth and water), had become a symbol of great pride for U\u015fak. It was stolen and replaced with a fake in 2005. Working on an anonymous tip, authorities found out in 2006. It weighed 23.5 grams; the original weighed 14.3 grams. It had to be an inside job and the main suspect was the museum director, Kazim Akbiyikoglu.</p>\n<p>This is one of the most heartbreaking parts of the story. Kazim Akbiyikoglu had worked assiduously to help reclaim the stolen hoard from the Met. He was a renowned archaeologist who had fought for decades against looters and had been threatened with murder and kidnapping by a prominent family who had made millions trafficking in antiquities. He was the first Turkish scholar sent to examine the Lydian Hoard during pretrial discovery when the Met was finally forced to give outside experts access to the artifact. He had submitted an affidavit attesting to the U\u015fakian origin of the \u201cEast Greek treasure.\u201d \u00d6zgen Acar considered him one of the most honest men he knew.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Kazim-Akbiyikoglu-points-to-Lydian-Hoard-artifacts.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Kazim Akbiyikoglu points to Lydian Hoard artifacts; you can see a bit of the hippocampus in the top left\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21774\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Kazim-Akbiyikoglu-points-to-Lydian-Hoard-artifacts-144x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Kazim-Akbiyikoglu-points-to-Lydian-Hoard-artifacts-144x150.jpg 144w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Kazim-Akbiyikoglu-points-to-Lydian-Hoard-artifacts-200x207.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Kazim-Akbiyikoglu-points-to-Lydian-Hoard-artifacts.jpg 400w\" title=\"Kazim Akbiyikoglu points to Lydian Hoard artifacts; you can see a bit of the hippocampus in the top left\" width=\"144\"/></a>Akbiyikoglu and nine other staffers were arrested in 2006 and put on trial for the theft. In 2009 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7889584.stm\" target=\"_blank\">they were all found guilty</a>. Akbiyikoglu was sentenced to 13 years in prison. He admitted that he had sold the hippocampus and other artifacts to pay off gambling debts, and he blamed his sad decline as a human being to the \u201ccurse\u201d of the hoard. The authorities continued to look for the artifacts, but they weren\u2019t optimistic. The hippocampus was so recognizable it would have been a lot easier to melt it down and sell it for its gold value than to sell it on the black market.</p>\n<p>But hope is the last to die, as the proverb goes, and after seven years on the lam, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey\" target=\"_blank\">the hippocampus has been found in Germany</a>. There are no details on how it was discovered, where, or how it got there. All we know is German officials have agreed to return the hippocampus as soon as the end of the year.</p>\n<p>When it goes back on display in U\u015fak, it will be in a brand new facility scheduled to open in December of 2013 which will hold all of the pieces (including a hundred or so additional objects discovered around the world after the Met lawsuit) of the Lydian treasure. I\u2019m glad to see that some lessons were learned from the humiliating debacle of 2006. If you\u2019re going to invest millions in repatriation suits, you\u2019d better spend hella millions on security.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-21733\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21733\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Civil War blockade authorization for sale\">Civil War blockade authorization for sale</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, November 27th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blockade4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='\"Affix the seal\" order for the blockade of Southern states signed by Abraham Lincoln, April 19th, 1861' class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-21749\" height=\"262\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blockade4-200x262.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blockade4-200x262.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blockade4-114x150.jpg 114w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blockade4-430x564.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blockade4.jpg 1200w\" title='\"Affix the seal\" order for the blockade of Southern states signed by Abraham Lincoln, April 19th, 1861' width=\"200\"/></a>The document signed by President Abraham Lincoln on April 19, 1861 authorizing the Union Navy blockade of Southern ports <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/20/us/lincoln-document/index.html?hpt=hp_t2\" target=\"_blank\">is being sold</a> by the anonymous private collector who owns it.

A strong, bold, authentic Lincoln autograph like the one signing this document would be highly sought after by collectors even if it were at the bottom of a shopping list. Having it attached to an order of immense historical and legal significance makes it a million dollar piece.</p>\n<p>On April 12th, 1861, Confederate batteries unloaded on Fort Sumter, a sea fort in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. Although there had been shots fired earlier after South Carolina declared its secession from the Union in December of 1860, the 34-hour bombardment of federal forces at Fort Sumter is widely considered the beginning of the Civil War. According to the Supreme Court, however, the Civil War began on April 19th, 1861, the day President Lincoln issued the <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70101\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Proclamation of Blockade Against Southern Ports</em></a>, an order directing the US Navy to prevent entrance and exit of vessels from all ports in the states of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.</p>\n<p>In its December Term of 1871, the Supreme Court adjudicated a case wherein to determine whether a statute of limitations applied, it was necessary to pinpoint the exact beginning and end dates of the Civil War. The Supreme Court\u2019s determination was that the April 19th Proclamation of Blockade Against Southern Ports marked the legal opening of the Civil War in the states which it embraced. (A <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70112\" target=\"_blank\">second proclamation issued on April 27th extended the blockade to Virginia and North Carolina</a>, so according to the Supreme Court, the Civil War started eight days later in those two states of the Confederacy.) The end date for every state but Texas was April 2nd, 1866, the date President Andrew Johnson issued Proclamation 153 <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=71987\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Declaring the Insurrection in Certain Southern States to be at an End</em></a>. Texas\u2019 war didn\u2019t officially end until August 20th, 1866, when Johnson issued Proclamation 157 <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=71992\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Declaring that Peace, Order, Tranquillity, and Civil Authority Now Exists in and Throughout the Whole of the United States of America</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The blockade proclamation was of momentous legal significance because it conferred belligerent status on the states in rebellion. You don\u2019t blockade ports in your own country; you close them. Proclaiming a closure of ports in states where the federal government no longer held sway, however, would have been entirely empty since the Confederate authorities would obviously have kept their ports open. Port closures also do not allow for the legal search and seizure of neutral vessels. If the Union wanted to be able to intercept British ships coming and going from Confederate ports, by international law only a blockade would grant them the right to do so.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gen-Winfield-Scotts-Anaconda-Plan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Cartoon of General Winfield Scott's Anaconda Plan, 1861\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-21750\" height=\"151\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gen-Winfield-Scotts-Anaconda-Plan-200x151.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gen-Winfield-Scotts-Anaconda-Plan-200x151.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gen-Winfield-Scotts-Anaconda-Plan-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gen-Winfield-Scotts-Anaconda-Plan-430x325.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cartoon of General Winfield Scott's Anaconda Plan, 1861\" width=\"200\"/></a>There was much debate in Lincoln\u2019s cabinet about whether the blockade proclamation was a bad idea, since it gave the Confederacy a legitimate position as belligerents which would allow them to make deals with neutral powers for loans and armaments. Lincoln decided that the blockade\u2019s strategic importance as part of General Winfield Scott\u2019s Anaconda Plan to strangle the South\u2019s economy by cutting off their access to coastal and Mississippi ports essential to trade superseded the concerns about legal status. The president made a point, however, of never referring to the states as belligerents in the proclamation itself. They\u2019re described as \u201crebellious\u201d or engaged in \u201cinsurrection.\u201d</p>\n<p>The <em>Proclamation of Blockade Against Southern Ports</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html> itself is not the document on sale. What\u2019s being sold for just short of a million dollars is the order signed by Abraham Lincoln directing the Secretary of State to affix the U.S. seal to the proclamation. That affixing of the seal is what gives the presidential order the force of law. This simple document is a pre-printed blank authorization form that directs the affixing of the seal to an order which is described in a field filled in by hand as \u201ca Proclamation setting on foot a Blockade of the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.\u201d The president signed the document and the Proclamation, complete with seal, was issued that same day.\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering how it\u2019s even possible that a document marking such a pivotal moment in United States history is in private hands rather than in a government archive, then you\u2019re not alone. I wondered the same thing and asked Nathan Raab, Vice President of The Raab Collection, how it came to be in private hands. It turns out that these seal-affixing documents, orders from a president that an official proclamation with the Seal of the United States be released, appear on the market with some regularity.  Often they were sold or disposed of by the government to raise funds or to make space for the official proclamations commissioned in the orders. In the early 20th century, these sorts of documents could be easily bought from book sellers and antiques shops for modest prices.</p>\n<p>Most of them treat with less significant subjects \u2014 presidential pardons and diplomatic correspondence, for instance \u2014 but every once in a while an \u201caffix the seal\u201d of major historical import turns up. The <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/chicagohistory/3953740976/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201caffix the seal\u201d order for the Emancipation Proclamation</a> was purchased in 2001 by the Chicago History Museum for one million dollars. The seal-affixing order for the <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=69782\" target=\"_blank\">preliminary Emancipation Proclamation</a> is <a href=\"http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/Jun/09/ln/hawaii906090351.html\" target=\"_blank\">in the Hawaii State Archives</a> and nobody knows how it got there. The working theory is it was donated by Bruce Cartwright, Jr., a Hawaiian businessman and collector of historic documents who was a strong supporter of the state archive.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Civil War blockade authorization for sale\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21733\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> \n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21733#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-21712\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21712\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Police recover artifacts stolen from Olympia museum\">Police recover artifacts stolen from Olympia museum</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, November 26th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20483275\" target=\"_blank\">Greek police have recovered all 76 artifacts stolen from the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games in Olympia</a> in February of this year. On February 17th, 2012 two masked men, one of them carrying an AK-47, disabled the alarm, broke into the museum and held up the sole security guard during a shift change. It appears the thieves picked the wrong museum, confusing the smaller Olympics-themed museum with the larger Archaeological Museum of Olympia. They demanded that the security guard hand over a pair of gold wreaths. When she pointed out that there are no such artifacts in that particular museum and refused to help them steal anything else, they tied her up and gagged her. They then smashed and grabbed indiscriminately, ultimately making off with 75 bronze and clay artifacts and one gold signet ring.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gold-seal-wring.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ring with gold bull-dancing seal, ca. 1400 B.C.\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-21718\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gold-seal-wring-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gold-seal-wring-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gold-seal-wring-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gold-seal-wring-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gold-seal-wring.jpg 940w\" title=\"Ring with gold bull-dancing seal, ca. 1400 B.C.\" width=\"200\"/></a>It was that ring, the most valuable of the stolen objects, which led police to the thieves. The ring is of royal provenance, having been discovered in a royal chamber tomb in Antheia, a town in the Peloponnese region of Messenia. It dates to the late Bronze Age Mycenaean period, from around 1400 B.C. The large oval crown depicts two male athletes leaping over a bull. The gold ring was on loan from a museum in Messenia when it was stolen.</p>\n<p>After lying low for nine months, the thieves attempted to sell the ring to a buyer who turned out to be an undercover police officer. Their initial asking price was 1.5 million euros ($1,943,000) which was reduced via haggling to a paltry 300,000 euros ($387,000). Just in case it wasn\u2019t obvious enough they were dealing in stolen goods, that price drop would have confirmed it beyond a doubt. First the wrong museum, then the attempted sale to a cop, then the awful negotiating skills. These guys were such amateurs I almost feel sorry for them. Almost.</p>\n<p>The man attempting to sell the ring was arrested. Upon interrogation, he turned over his co-conspirators. On November 24th, police announced the arrest of three men staying in a hotel in the city of Patra just a few miles from the museum. One was a 50-year-old contractor from Patra, the second a 36-year-old unemployed man from Patra and the third, considered the \u201cmastermind\u201d of this heist, if such a term can be applied, is a 41-year-old unemployed man originally from Patra but now residing in Athens where he sells trinkets to make a living. So yeah, amateurs. They thought they could make a quick buck selling gold only to find that they went to the wrong place and then couldn\u2019t sell any of the objects they\u2019d stolen. Two other suspects are still at large, a 58-year-old man and a 33-year-old, both from Patra.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s notable that all the suspects are Greek. The museum security guard said at the time of the theft that they spoke broken Greek. She thought they might have been Albanian, and at the time police did pursue some Albanian jewel thieves thinking they might have had a hand in the museum caper as well.

The thieves had put them in a bag and buried them in a field two miles from the scene of the crime. The gold ring, a bronze statuette of a victorious athlete, a number of clay lamps, bronze tripods, bronze wheels, charioteers, clay and bronze horses and bulls, everything stolen was found.

The letters had been sent to the T.K. Pharmacy, owned by Coloradan of Japanese descent Thomas Kobayashi and managed during the war by his brother-in-law, Yutaka \u201cTak\u201d Terasaki.

The initiative seeks to make a permanent online museum of the memories of people who were interned as a result of Executive Order 9066.

GCHQ only began working on the message last month after curators at the Bletchley Park museum spent two years trying to decipher it but were unable to make any headway. When the story first made the news at the beginning of November, GCHQ said they wouldn\u2019t comment on it until the code was broken. Now they\u2019ve released an official statement in which they throw their hands up.</p>\n<blockquote><p>During the war, the methods used to encode messages naturally needed to be as secure as possible and various methods were used. The senders would often have specialist codebooks in which each code group of four or five letters had a meaning relevant to a specific operation, allowing much information to be sent in a short message. For added security, the code groups could then themselves be encrypted using, for example, a one-time pad.</p>\n<p>The message found at Bletchingley had 27 five-letter code groups, and the GCHQ experts believe its contents are consistent with this method. This means that without access to the relevant codebooks and details of any additional encryption used, it will remain impossible to decrypt. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The basis of a \u201cone-time pad\u201d encryption system is that a random key is used to encrypt (and subsequently decrypt) only one message. The advantage of this system is that, if used correctly, it is unbreakable as long as the key is kept secret. The disadvantage is that both the sending and receiving parties need to have access to the same key, which usually means producing and sharing a large keypad in advance.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/carrier-pigeon-message.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Coded message found attached to the pigeon in the chimney\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-21673\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/carrier-pigeon-message-167x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/carrier-pigeon-message-167x300.jpg 167w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/carrier-pigeon-message-83x150.jpg 83w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/carrier-pigeon-message-430x770.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/carrier-pigeon-message.jpg 1013w\" title=\"Coded message found attached to the pigeon in the chimney\" width=\"167\"/></a>They\u2019d have more of a chance if they could find out more about the pigeon, its destination \u201cX02<em></em>\u201d and its sender \u201cSjt W Stot\u201d because it would narrow down the potential codebooks used.

After 112 continuous years on display in the Early Egypt Gallery of the British Museum, on September 1st Gebelein Man was taken to Bupa Cromwell Hospital for a CT scan. He is the first predynastic mummy to receive this treatment. Since he was mummified naturally, Gebelein Man\u2019s organs were not removed and the dry heat of the Egyptian desert preserved much of his organ tissue as well as his skeleton and skin. The scan produced detailed high resolution images of the body which allowed experts to examine the interior of the mummy in great detail.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-rib-fracture.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Gebelein Man's shoulder and rib fracture\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21644\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-rib-fracture-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-rib-fracture-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-rib-fracture-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-rib-fracture-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-rib-fracture.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Gebelein Man's shoulder and rib fracture\" width=\"150\"/></a>The new data showed that the mummy was a young man between 18 and 21 years of age when he died. There were a number of posthumous bone fractures, but his left shoulder blade and the rib right below it were cut. The bone fragments from that injury are still embedded in the muscle, and there\u2019s a clear entry wound in the skin above his shoulder blade. There are no defensive wounds, which suggests that his murderer took Gebelein Man by surprise rather than during a battle. The murder weapon was a copper or flint blade at least five inches long and it was planted with such force that it shattered the rib, penetrating the left lung and severing the surrounding blood vessels. This was a very severe wound and there is no evidence of healing, so the British Museum is calling it: cause of death is murder by person or persons unknown.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-entry-wound.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The entry wound in Gebelein Man's shoulder\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-21643\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-entry-wound-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-entry-wound-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-entry-wound-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-entry-wound-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Gebelein-Man-entry-wound.jpg 1600w\" title=\"The entry wound in Gebelein Man's shoulder\" width=\"150\"/></a>Just in case that weren\u2019t cool enough, they went full CSI.

The headdress was cleaned and conserved with much success. The faded colors of the feathers have been brought back to vibrancy: feathers from the Squirrel Cuckoo that looked orange are now a deep brick red, the small blue Lovely Cotinga feathers that looked powder blue are now a brilliant turquoise, and the smaller quetzal feathers that looked the same powder blue as the Cotinga feathers are now their proper iridescent green, as are the 400 long Resplendent Quetzal tail feathers.</p>\n<p>A commission of historians, archaeologists and ornithologists from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) and Austria\u2019s Kunsthistorisches Museum spent two years studying the incredibly fragile piece, investigating its historical significance and documenting its condition. They focused on historical questions \u2014 its composition, the materials and technique used in its creation \u2014 and conservation issues \u2014 how to keep it from any further deterioration.</p>\n<p>This is the last Aztec feather headdress to have survived, and people have been trying to ensure its survival for centuries. Conservators found and removed several old restoration attempts. They did keep a few springs added in the 16th century. They\u2019re something of historical note in and of themselves, a testament to how long this gorgeous piece has been on display, starting with Archduke Ferdinand II\u2019s extensive private collection at Ambras Castle in Innsbruck in 1575.</p>\n<p>There was an agenda on the table other than cleaning and conservation, namely, could the headdress survive a trip to Mexico. It was once part of the regalia either of the last Aztec king Moctezuma II or of a high priest; the Penacho was either gifted to conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s by the king or he looted it during the siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521. At some point thereafter it made its way to Europe where it was first documented in the collection of Ferdinand II, who in addition to being Archduke of Austria was also the nephew of Cort\u00e9s\u2019 boss, Spanish King and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Mexico figures half a millennium of absence is long enough and would like it back for a very long term loan. The Austrian museum authorities are amenable to the idea, but only if means of transportation can be found that will not damage the piece.</p>\n<p>Such means have not yet been found. The Museum of Ethnology constructed a display case that was custom-built to compensate for the vibrations caused by the footsteps of visitors walking around the room, because even such a small amount of movement could harm the delicate piece. They\u2019ll have to invent something far more complex to protect the headdress from the motion of an airplane or a ship voyage. Although this isn\u2019t likely to happen any time soon, Austria is definitely open to the prospect and talks are ongoing. Austria and Mexico are currently negotiating a new treaty on cultural exchanges. The Penacho will play a starring role in the discussions.</p>\n<p>Now, because you\u2019ve been so patient to read down this far (assuming you didn\u2019t just skip to the end which is what I would have done), here are the before and after pictures:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Montezuma-headdress-before-restoration.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Moctezuma's headdress before restoration\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21608\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Moctezuma-headdress-before-restoration.jpg\" title=\"Moctezuma's headdress before restoration\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Moctezuma-headdress.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Moctezuma's headdress after restoration\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21625\" height=\"166\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Moctezuma-headdress-430x341.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Moctezuma-headdress-430x341.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Moctezuma-headdress-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Moctezuma-headdress-200x158.jpg 200w\" title=\"Moctezuma's headdress after restoration\" width=\"210\"/></a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Moctezuma\u2019s headdress restored\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21616\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21616#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-21590\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21590\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Miscellaneous distractions\">Miscellaneous distractions</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, November 21st, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Much like the rest of the country, I\u2019m on the road today.

Not in the mood to read much? <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?st=grid&amp;co=fsac\" target=\"_blank\">Here are 1600 color photographs</a> taken by the Farm Security Administration and Office of War Information between 1939 and 1944. They were taken all over the United States, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and focus on rural life, farm labor and World War II industrial production. It\u2019s a neat contrast. You go from mule teams pulling a cart in Georgia to a state fair in Vermont to real life Rosie-the-Riveters. The color is great too, still rich after all these years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Roman-remains-in-Banwell.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Roman remains found in Banwell\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21595\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Roman-remains-in-Banwell-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Roman-remains-in-Banwell-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Roman-remains-in-Banwell-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Roman-remains-in-Banwell-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Roman-remains-in-Banwell.jpg 600w\" title=\"Roman remains found in Banwell\" width=\"112\"/></a>If it\u2019s the excitement of a new historical discovery you require to keep you sane, <a href=\"http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/news/mainNews.asp?newsID=1036\" target=\"_blank\">check out this article</a> about a wealth of Roman remains, human and material, unearthed during the construction of a water main in Bramwell, North Somerset. They\u2019ve found three inhumation burials, one of them in a partially preserved wooden coffin; several Roman brooches, including a small one that may have belonged to a child; a 4th century coin from the reign of Constantine the Great; a bone stylus; a bronze bracelet; and 9,000 pieces of pottery. The article is a fascinating read not so much because of the things found, but because of the picture they paint of Roman history in the area. Evidence of a removed wall and charcoal deposits, for instance, suggest a structure was destroyed by fire. Fragments of tiles in the debris indicate the building that once stood there was a sumptuous one with its own hypocaust heating system for a private bath.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Archaeologists-dig-up-skeletons-of-Norse-settlers-in-Ggeenland-2010.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Archaeologists dig up skeletons of Norse settlers in Greenland, 2010\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21596\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Archaeologists-dig-up-skeletons-of-Norse-settlers-in-Ggeenland-2010-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Archaeologists-dig-up-skeletons-of-Norse-settlers-in-Ggeenland-2010-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Archaeologists-dig-up-skeletons-of-Norse-settlers-in-Ggeenland-2010-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Archaeologists-dig-up-skeletons-of-Norse-settlers-in-Ggeenland-2010-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Archaeologists-dig-up-skeletons-of-Norse-settlers-in-Ggeenland-2010.jpg 794w\" title=\"Archaeologists dig up skeletons of Norse settlers in Greenland, 2010\" width=\"150\"/></a>Perhaps you need some reassurance that no matter how much turkey you\u2019ll be force-fed, you could always be worse off. You could be a Viking in 14th century Greenland where in order to survive, you\u2019d have to eat mainly seals. <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2012-11-greenland-viking-settlers-gorged.html\" target=\"_blank\">According to a Danish-Canadian study of 80 Greenlandic Norse skeletons</a>, 50 to 80 per cent of their diet was composed of seal meat. That\u2019s not how it was supposed to be. When they first settled in Greenland, the Norse planned to farm and raise stock they had brought with them. As the climate cooled and it became increasingly clear that Greenland was poorly named, they had to supplement their diets with seafood. Eventually, seals became staples for them just as they were for the Inuit who had moved to Greenland from Canada in the early 13th century. (Did you know that the Inuit and Norse lived side by side in medieval Greenland? I did not know that.) No doubt the blubbery monotony of the seal-based diet played a part in the eventual Viking abandonment of Greenland.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Hunts-Link-variation-by-George-G.-Hunt-patented-1877.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Hunt's Link variation patented in 1877 by George G.

Until yesterday, it didn\u2019t even occur to me that people would collect rusty, pointy, dangerous chunks of old wire fences, but they do and now I can see why because there are some incredibly intricate, beautiful period designs. Barbed wire came into its own in the second half of the 19th century, spurred on by the growth of the railroads and the demise of the open range brought on by homesteaders fencing in former pasture they\u2019d converted to farm land. Ranchers and farmers went to war over barbed wire. Barbed wire designers went to war with each other to secure patents. Fortunes were made and lost thanks to barbed wire.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Miscellaneous distractions\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21590\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21590#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2012/11/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

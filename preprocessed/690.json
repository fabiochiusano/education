The team was excavating the north bank of the Thames near London Bridge in advance of construction in 2000 when they found the rare piece in a medieval land reclamation dump. The waterlogged soil of the Thames riverbank is an outstanding <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24528\" target=\"_blank\">preserver of artifacts</a>, and this lead alloy panel with its delicate openwork has survived in excellent condition along with organic artifacts like timber revetments from the Roman period and the Middle Ages, the remains of plants used for cloth dyeing and a medieval leather knife sheath.</p>\n<p>The panel was originally a mass-produced object sold at a pilgrimage site dedicated to the earl. People bought them as devotional objects, often for use in small home shrines. Thomas Plantagenet, Earl of Lancaster, would not at first glance seem to be the ideal subject for religious reverence. A holy man he was not. What he was was a powerful baron, the holder of no fewer than five major earldoms (Lancaster, Lincoln, Salisbury, Leicester, Derby) that made him the second wealthiest man in England after the king, the paternal grandson King Henry III of England and a thorn in the side of the unpopular King Edward II, his cousin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-Excavations-at-Riverbank-House-c-Museum-of-London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35631\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 79px) 100vw, 79px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-Excavations-at-Riverbank-House-c-Museum-of-London-79x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-Excavations-at-Riverbank-House-c-Museum-of-London-79x150.jpg 79w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-Excavations-at-Riverbank-House-c-Museum-of-London-158x300.jpg 158w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-Excavations-at-Riverbank-House-c-Museum-of-London-421x800.jpg 421w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4-Excavations-at-Riverbank-House-c-Museum-of-London.jpg 1039w\" title=\"Archaeologists from MOLA excavating the deep Thames waterfront site at Riverbank House where the devotional panel was discovered. \u00a9 MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology)\" width=\"79\"/></a>At first Thomas supported Edward, but the bloom was soon off the rose, in large part thanks to Edward\u2019s lavishing of titles, monies and power on his low-born favorite Piers Gaveston. By 1311, three years after he\u2019d carried Curtana, the sword of St. Edward the Confessor, at his cousin\u2019s coronation, Thomas was the leader of the Ordainers, a group of barons, earls and bishops demanding, among other things, that Gaveston be exiled. When Gaveston returned less than two months after this his third exile and Edward gave him all his lands and titles back, the Ordainers went to war. He was captured, tried and beheaded. Lancaster was one of the judges and Gaveston was executed on his property.</p>\n<p>From then on it was one fight after the other between the royal cousins. For a while Lancaster had the upper hand in a big way, becoming the de facto king after Edward\u2019s army was defeated by the forces of Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, but in 1318 he was ousted and the two Hugh Despensers, father and son, took over as power behind the throne and Edward\u2019s favorite. Lancaster marshalled his private army, struck up a deal with Robert the Bruce and rebelled against the crown. </p>\n<p>On March 16th, 1322, Lancaster and the King\u2019s allies went head to head at the Battle of Boroughbridge. Lancaster lost. He was taken prisoner and tried for treason in a sham court (the judges included both Despensers and the King) in his own castle at Pontefract where he was not allowed to speak in his own defense. He was convicted, of course, and on March 23rd, he was executed by beheading (Edward had commuted the traditional sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering on account of Lancaster\u2019s royal blood).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-14th-century-devotional-panel-discovered-by-archaeologists-from-MOLA-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-35630\" height=\"291\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-14th-century-devotional-panel-discovered-by-archaeologists-from-MOLA-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping-e1427805089753-200x291.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-14th-century-devotional-panel-discovered-by-archaeologists-from-MOLA-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping-e1427805089753-200x291.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-14th-century-devotional-panel-discovered-by-archaeologists-from-MOLA-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping-e1427805089753-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-14th-century-devotional-panel-discovered-by-archaeologists-from-MOLA-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping-e1427805089753-430x625.jpg 430w\" title=\"A 14th century devotional panel dedicated to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, found in Thames riverbank excavation. \u00a9 MOLA/ Andy Chopping\" width=\"200\"/></a>Within weeks after Lancaster\u2019s execution, shrines dedicated to him began to crop up, at the site of his execution at Pontefract Castle, his tomb in Pontefract Priory and at Old St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. Rumors of miracles at the priory tomb and execution site abounded and soon Thomas was venerated as a popular saint. He was so popular Edward II put an armed guard around the priory to keep the crowds away. In response money was raised from all over England to build a chantry chapel on the site of his execution.</p>\n<p>His saintliness rested not in his personal piety or holy behavior (there certainly wasn\u2019t much of the latter), but in his rebellion against a despised king. This was a thing in Medieval England: make saints out of fallen political/military heroes. Simon de Montfort received similar devotions after his death in 1265. What better way for Edward III to distance himself from his father after Edward II\u2019s murder than to side with the cult of St. Thomas of Lancaster? In 1327 petitioned Pope John XXII that Thomas be canonized as an official saint of the Church, but it never happened. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lancaster-execution-Bridwell-Library-MS-13-Book-of-Hours-1330.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35647\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lancaster-execution-Bridwell-Library-MS-13-Book-of-Hours-1330-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lancaster-execution-Bridwell-Library-MS-13-Book-of-Hours-1330-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lancaster-execution-Bridwell-Library-MS-13-Book-of-Hours-1330-200x289.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lancaster-execution-Bridwell-Library-MS-13-Book-of-Hours-1330-430x621.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lancaster-execution-Bridwell-Library-MS-13-Book-of-Hours-1330.jpg 1219w\" title=\"Illumination of Lancaster's execution in Bridwell Library's MS 13 Book of Hours, ca. 1330\" width=\"103\"/></a>Notwithstanding his lack of a Church-sanctioned halo, Thomas continued to be revered locally at least until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. His relics were believed to hold specific healing properties \u2014 his belt helped women in labour, his hat cured migraines \u2014 and a hymn called the Lancaster Suffrage was included as part of the daily prayers in the psalters and Books of Hours of wealthy Lancastrians.

Although they were very popular in the 14th century, few of these panels have survived. The British Museum has two examples, <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=44860&amp;partId=1&amp;people=78104&amp;peoA=78104-1-7&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">one smaller</a> and <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=43763&amp;partId=1&amp;people=78104&amp;peoA=78104-1-7&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">one larger</a>, neither of them are in great condition. The figures on the smaller piece are crudely designed and while the larger panel has an elaborate Gothic cathedral-like structure and more people in it than the MOLA panel, they aren\u2019t as finely crafted and the piece is fragmented. You can see in the picture that it\u2019s being held together with wires. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Liz-Goodman-MOLA-conservator-with-panel-c-Museum-of-London.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35633\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Liz-Goodman-MOLA-conservator-with-panel-c-Museum-of-London-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Liz-Goodman-MOLA-conservator-with-panel-c-Museum-of-London-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Liz-Goodman-MOLA-conservator-with-panel-c-Museum-of-London-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Liz-Goodman-MOLA-conservator-with-panel-c-Museum-of-London-430x644.jpg 430w\" title=\"Liz Goodman, MOLA archaeological conservator with the Thomas Earl of Lancaster panel. \u00a9 Museum of London\" width=\"100\"/></a>The MOLA piece is five inches high and 3.5 inches wide and divided into four scenes that are to be read clockwise from the top left. In scene one, Thomas is captured. The caption in French reads \u201cHere I am taken prisoner.\u201d In scene two he is put on trial. The caption reads \u201cI am judged.\u201d In scene three he is convicted and conveyed by horse (the quality, or lack thereof, of this horse was a big issue in some of the chronicles) to the site of execution. The caption: \u201cI am under threat.\u201d In the last scene Thomas is beheaded by sword. The caption states simply: \u201cla mort\u201d (death). These shenanigans are presided over by Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, perched atop the sun and moon, waiting to welcome Lancaster\u2019s saintly soul to heaven.</p>\n<p>This is the only Lancaster devotional panel known to have French labels explaining each scene. It\u2019s also the only one known with surviving gilding which highlights the sun and moon. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-Medieval-timber-revetments-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35632\" height=\"107\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-Medieval-timber-revetments-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping-150x107.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-Medieval-timber-revetments-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping-150x107.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-Medieval-timber-revetments-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping-200x143.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5-Medieval-timber-revetments-c-MOLA-Andy-Chopping-430x308.jpg 430w\" title=\"Medieval timber revetments excavated on Thames riverbank. \u00a9 MOLA, Andy Chopping\" width=\"150\"/></a>Up until now the panel has only been known by Museum of London experts, but the riverbank excavation, including detailed information about the panel, has just been published (<a href=\"http://www.mola.org.uk/publications/roman-and-medieval-revetments-thames-waterfront-excavations-riverbank-house-city-lond\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Roman and Medieval Revetments on the Thames Waterfront</em></a>) so the museum is putting the panel on display for the first time.

A pharaoh from a weak transitional dynasty in Egypt\u2019s Second Intermediate Period (1650 and 1550 B.C.), Senebkay was beset by enemies to the north \u2014 the Canaanite Hyksos 15th Dynasty \u2014 and south \u2014 the Theban 16th and 17th Dynasties (1650 \u2013 1590 B.C., 1580 \u2013 1550 B.C.). These were turbulent times that would only come to end with the unification of Egypt under Pharaoh Ahmose I, founder of the 18th Dynasty and of the New Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Senebkay lived somewhere in the middle of the Second Intermediate Period, probably around 1600 B.C., which makes him the earliest pharaoh known to have died in battle. Before this study the first pharaoh thought to have died in battle was Theban Pharaoh Seqnenre of the 17th Dynasty (ca. 1558 B.C.), father of the future Ahmose I. Although Seqnenre too was viciously slaughtered, there are no defensive wounds so he could well have been attacked in his sleep or executed by his Hyksos enemies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pharaoh-Senebkay-skull.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35618\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pharaoh-Senebkay-skull-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pharaoh-Senebkay-skull-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pharaoh-Senebkay-skull-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pharaoh-Senebkay-skull-430x291.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pharaoh-Senebkay-skull.jpg 1419w\" title=\"Pharaoh Senebkay's skull with axe wounds\" width=\"150\"/></a>Osteologists found that Senebkay was between 35 to 49 years old at the time of his death and of unusual height for his era at five feet seven inches to six feet tall.

University of Pennsylvania archaeologist Josef Wegner, leader of the excavation team, believes the pharoah\u2019s injuries, the weapons they were inflicted with and force with which they were used indicates professional soldiers took the king down in a fight rather than, say, assassins or muggers.</p>\n<p>Senebkay appears to have been on horseback when the assault began. Wounds to his lower body \u2014 a cut to his right ankle so severe it would have all but amputed his foot, slashes on his knees and hands \u2014 were inflicted from the ground upwards and the strikes on his lower back indicate he was seated when he received them. That was more than enough to unhorse him. By the time his assailants embedded their axes in his skull, the pharaoh was probably on the ground.</p>\n<blockquote><p> Another surprising result of the osteological analysis is that muscle attachments on Senebkay\u2019s femurs and pelvis indicate he spent a significant amount of his adult life as a horse rider. Another king\u2019s body discovered this year in a tomb close to that of Senebkay also shows evidence for horse riding, suggesting these Second Intermediate Period kings buried at Abydos were accomplished horsemen. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a significant discovery because the introduction of the horse to Egypt was still recent at the time. The first inscriptions referring to the use of horses among the Egyptian elite appear shortly after this period and the chariots that would become inextricably associated with pharaonic Egypt weren\u2019t introduced until the New Kingdom. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Senebkay-right-ankle-left-knee.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35622\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 78px) 100vw, 78px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Senebkay-right-ankle-left-knee-78x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Senebkay-right-ankle-left-knee-78x150.jpg 78w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Senebkay-right-ankle-left-knee-157x300.jpg 157w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Senebkay-right-ankle-left-knee-419x800.jpg 419w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Senebkay-right-ankle-left-knee.jpg 843w\" title=\"Wounds on Senebkay's right ankle and left knee\" width=\"78\"/></a>One of other skeletons thought to be from a royal tomb (other than Senebkay\u2019s, none of the seven other royal tombs had cartouches identifying the deceased), was a powerfully built man trained to perform a strenuous, repetitive activity with his left arm, possibly archery or combat. Between their prowess on horseback and their tough physical training, it\u2019s possible these Abydos pharaohs were warrior-kings. The research team is hoping to be able to confirm with DNA testing if any of the people found buried in the tombs bore a familial relationship to each other.</p>\n<p>Because we know so little about the Abydos kings, the geographic boundaries of their territory are unclear. It seems Senebkay did not die close to Abydos, however. The linen bandages wrapping him are close to the bones, which means the body had already been decaying for a while when he was mummified. He could have been exposed, perhaps by the enemies who killed him, before being sent home, or the voyage home was so long it took several weeks to get his decomposing body to the royal necropolis at Abydos.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Possibly the king died in battle fighting against the Hyksos kings who at that time ruled northern Egypt from their capital at Avaris in the Nile Delta. However, Senebkay may have died in struggles against enemies in the south of Egypt. Historical records dating to Senebkay\u2019s lifetime record at least one attempted invasion of Upper Egypt by a large military force from Nubia to the south. Alternatively, Senebkay may have had other political opponents, possibly kings based at Thebes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The University of Pennsylvania team will continue excavations at Abydos and to study the remains in the hope of answering some of these questions.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Pharaoh Senebkay died a violent death in battle\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35617\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35617#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-35601\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35601\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Mithras tauroctony, Picasso painting found in Italy\">Mithras tauroctony, Picasso painting found in Italy</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, March 29th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Culture-Minister-Dario-Franceschini-with-Violin-e-bouteille-de-bass-Pablo-Picasso-1912.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35602\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Culture-Minister-Dario-Franceschini-with-Violin-e-bouteille-de-bass-Pablo-Picasso-1912-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Culture-Minister-Dario-Franceschini-with-Violin-e-bouteille-de-bass-Pablo-Picasso-1912-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Culture-Minister-Dario-Franceschini-with-Violin-e-bouteille-de-bass-Pablo-Picasso-1912-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Culture-Minister-Dario-Franceschini-with-Violin-e-bouteille-de-bass-Pablo-Picasso-1912-430x304.jpg 430w\" title='Culture Minister Dario Franceschini (left) with \"Violin and Bottle of Bass\" by Pablo Picasso, 1912' width=\"150\"/></a>The Carabinieri art theft squad has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/27/us-italy-arts-picasso-idUSKBN0MN1VO20150327\" target=\"_blank\">recovered two major artworks</a> in separate investigations: an early Cubist work by Pablo Picasso and an ancient Roman sculptural group of Mithras slaying the bull, a scene known today as a tauroctony. Only one of them, the sculpture, is known to have been looted. The Picasso painting is currently under investigation, but its purported provenance is a classic art smuggler\u2019s tall tale, and a particularly bold iteration at that. It could be true, sure, but the Carabinieri clearly don\u2019t think so or they wouldn\u2019t have confiscated it.</p>\n<p>The Picasso came to light when Sotheby\u2019s, in the name of the putative current owner, filed an export license request in Venice for the oil painting <em>Violin and Bottle of Bass</em> made in 1912 by Pablo Picasso. The painting is listed in the 1961 edition of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/arts/design/the-zervos-picasso-catalog-is-resurrected.html?_r=0\" target=\"blank\">great multi-volume catalogue raisonn\u00e9</a> of the artist\u2019s works compiled by Christian Zervos. It was done in the early Analytic Cubist style developed by Picasso and Georges Braque characterized by a palette of browns and other neutrals and as such is extremely rare and desirable. </p>\n<p>Yet, the declared value of this early work was 1.4 million euros ($1.5 million). That\u2019s a ridiculously lowball figure for a painting that would go for at least 15 million euros ($16.2 million) in the open market and could easily make more at auction. The weirdly cheap Picasso drew the unblinking eye of art squad investigators who sought an explanation from the owner. Said owner turns out to be a retired Roman frame maker. In 1978, a gentleman of advanced age came to his shop holding a picture frame with a photo of his beloved late wife inside. The maid had apparently knocked over the frame and broken the glass, devastating the widower. The frame maker repaired the frame for free because it was such an easy fix. In gratitude, the customer repaid the frame maker by returning two days later with a gift: <em>Violin and Bottle of Bass</em>. The frame maker had no idea what a treasure he\u2019d been given for replacing a two-cent piece of glass, so he just stashed it somewhere and forgot about it for 36 years until discovering by accident that he might have a Picasso. </p>\n<p>Mysteries abound in this less than entirely believable story. Tests have confirmed the attribution of the painting to Picasso, but more will be forthcoming while the investigation proceeds. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabinieri-with-Mithras-tauroctony.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35603\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabinieri-with-Mithras-tauroctony-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabinieri-with-Mithras-tauroctony-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabinieri-with-Mithras-tauroctony-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabinieri-with-Mithras-tauroctony-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Carabinieri with Mithras tauroctony, 2nd-3rd c.

The Carabinieri found it during a complex operation of surveillance centered in the Fiumicino area outside Rome where the airport is, a crossroads of the market in illicit archaeological goods. Carabinieri noticed a nondescript van with no external identifiers that for some reason had a motorized escort \u2014 a motorcycle in front and a Smart Car taking up the rear. They pulled the van over and searched it. The back was filled with flowers and plants under a tarp. Cops saw the nose of a bull sticking up through the plants and found the marble sculpture group with the soil from its illegal excavation still caked on it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-front-2-3rd-c-AD.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35606\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-front-2-3rd-c-AD-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-front-2-3rd-c-AD-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-front-2-3rd-c-AD-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-front-2-3rd-c-AD-430x643.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mithras tauroctony front 2-3rd c AD\" width=\"100\"/></a>The sculpture dates from the 2nd-3rd century A.D. and depicts an iconic scene in Mithraism wherein the hero tilts back the bull\u2019s head and slays the beast with a knife while a dog and snake lick its blood and a scorpion has a go at the bull\u2019s testicles. Every <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32448\" target=\"_blank\">Mithraeum</a> had at least one representation of this scene, usually reliefs and frescoes. A large freestanding sculpture like this would have been extremely luxurious then, and it is even more so today. Experts put its value at a minimum of 8 million euros. Only two other large tauroctonies like this one are known to exist today, one in the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/marble_group_of_mithras.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">British Museum</a>, one in the Vatican Museums.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-back-2-3rd-c-AD.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35607\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-back-2-3rd-c-AD-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-back-2-3rd-c-AD-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-back-2-3rd-c-AD-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mithras-tauroctony-back-2-3rd-c-AD-430x644.jpg 430w\" title=\"Tauroctony back\" width=\"100\"/></a>Soil tests of the dirt on the sculpture pinpointed two possible locations of origin in central Italy: the ancient Etruscan cities of Tarquinia and Vulci. The regional Culture Ministry immediately began emergency excavations at the possible sites and found the exact spot from which the statue had been looted. It was Tarquinia, and archaeologists found two smoking guns in the form of the little rampant dog missing from the sculpture and the head of the missing snake. They also unearthed a few other marble fragments, the remains of a mosaic floor and a terracotta tile floor that suggest this was once a Mithraem. </p>\n<p>A map of Switzerland and Swiss traveling routes found in the van make it very clear where the tauroctony was headed if it hadn\u2019t been intercepted. Its value on the open market would be something in the neighborhood of 8 million euros ($8.7 million), a meager thing compared to its immense historical value. The statue will go on temporary display at the Vatican Museums in a few weeks after which it will return to Tarquinia in July.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-View-of-Piazza-San-Marco-from-the-Dock-by-Luca-Carlevarijs-18th-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35605\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-View-of-Piazza-San-Marco-from-the-Dock-by-Luca-Carlevarijs-18th-c-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-View-of-Piazza-San-Marco-from-the-Dock-by-Luca-Carlevarijs-18th-c-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-View-of-Piazza-San-Marco-from-the-Dock-by-Luca-Carlevarijs-18th-c-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-View-of-Piazza-San-Marco-from-the-Dock-by-Luca-Carlevarijs-18th-c-430x286.jpg 430w\" title='Carabiniere with \"View of Piazza San Marco from the Dock\" by Luca Carlevarijs, 18th c.' width=\"150\"/></a>The Carabinieri announced a third recovery at the same press conference, an 18th century oil painting by Luca Carlevarijs entitled <em>View of Piazza San Marco from the Dock</em>. It was stolen on April 28th, 1984, from the home of a private collector and discovered last September in the hands of an art dealer in Milan indicted for receiving stolen goods and illegal export of a painting now in the United States. While searching the dealer\u2019s home, cops found 190 photographs of paintings. One of them was the Carlevarijs. They compared the photos against the squad\u2019s database of stolen cultural goods and discovered the 30-year-old theft. It seems the artwork had been given to the dealer by a collector in anticipation of its sale.</p>\n<p>Carlevarijs was the founder of the Venetian school of <em>vedute</em>, meaning views or landscapes of the city, starting with etchings in 1703 and then moving on to oil paintings. Canaletto was strongly influenced by him, as you can see in this piece, and probably met Carlevarijs around 1720 when the young artist moved back home to Venice after studying in Rome. Canaletto may have been Carlevarijs\u2019 pupil at this time \u2014 the sources are murky \u2014 but if so, he soon surpassed the master. In 1725, just five years after Canaletto\u2019s return, art merchant Alessandro Marchesini would suggest to his client, collector Stefano Conti who was looking for <em>vedute</em> of Venice, that he acquire a piece by Canaletto who \u201cinevitably amazes everyone here who sees his works, which are in the manner of Carlevaris, but light shines out from the sun.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-Picasso-and-Carlevarijs-18th-c.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-35604\" height=\"95\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-Picasso-and-Carlevarijs-18th-c-200x95.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-Picasso-and-Carlevarijs-18th-c-200x95.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-Picasso-and-Carlevarijs-18th-c-150x71.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carabiniere-with-Picasso-and-Carlevarijs-18th-c-430x206.jpg 430w\" title=\"Carabiniere with Picasso and Carlevarijs \" width=\"200\"/></a>Compared to the Picasso and the tauroctony I\u2019m afraid poor Mr. Carlevarijs doesn\u2019t quite make the headline, but it amuses me how each of these stories touches on the standard tropes of the traffic in illicit art and antiquities. We\u2019ve got a supershady provenance story, a recently excavated, high-quality ancient sculpture that was destined for surreptitious sale in Switzerland where it doubtless would have received brand new papers certifying it as having been in \u201can anonymous Swiss collection\u201d for the past 50 years, and we have the art dealer acting as a fence and keeping a <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17713\" target=\"_blank\">big cache of incriminating photographs</a> of the pieces he is trying to sell/has sold illegally.

Trajan\u2019s Column, built in 113 A.D. to commemorate the emperor\u2019s victories over the Dacians in two wars (101\u2013102 and 105\u2013106 A.D.), has a 625 foot-long frieze that winds around the 98 foot-high column shaft 23 times. There are 2,662 figures in 155 scenes plus scads of structures (pontoon bridges! forts!) and gear (weapons! army standards! exotic Dacian fashions!). The complexity of the carving, the density of characters and scenes, and, last but certainly not least, the monumental scale of the column make it an ideal candidate for digital exploration. Short of a surreptitious and illegal nighttime visit to Trajan\u2019s Forum aboard a cherry picker, it\u2019s simply impossible to see anything more than the pedestal close up in person. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plaster-casts-in-Museum-of-Roman-Civilization.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35593\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plaster-casts-in-Museum-of-Roman-Civilization-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plaster-casts-in-Museum-of-Roman-Civilization-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plaster-casts-in-Museum-of-Roman-Civilization-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plaster-casts-in-Museum-of-Roman-Civilization-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Plaster casts of the column's relief in the Museum of Roman Civilization\" width=\"150\"/></a>Your best shot at a thorough look at the frieze in person is on the plaster casts in museums. The <a href=\"http://www.museociviltaromana.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Roman Civilisation</a> in the EUR neighborhood of Rome has a blessedly handy collection of casts of the relief separated into sections that are lined up in narrative order along three rows that you can walk through. Because the casts were made in the 19th century, the relief is in better condition than on the original column that has been exposed to an additional century and a half of pollution and erosion. The <a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O102467/trajans-column-column-unknown/\" target=\"_blank\">Victoria &amp; Albert has plaster casts</a> mounted on two central brick columns that makes them look like the column was cut in half.

The University of St. Andrews has a phenomenal <a href=\"https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/trajans-column/\" target=\"_blank\">Trajan\u2019s Column site</a> that has a <a href=\"https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/trajans-column/data/search.php\" target=\"_blank\">searchable database</a> of images of the frieze that you can easily click through using a numbered map (after you click on a piece of the frieze, click zoom out to see all the images of that scene). It also has exceptional background information: explanations of numbering conventions used to identify scenes and figures, the drawings and casts that scholars have made to study the column, a detailed description of the column\u2019s history, materials, construction method and more. The only problem is the photographs are small and it\u2019s easy to lose your way in the details. There is no big picture view of the entire relief.</p>\n<p>The German Archaeological Institute\u2019s Arachne database has <a href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/?q=en/node/202\" target=\"_blank\">many images of Trajan\u2019s Column</a>, but they\u2019re in black and white, watermarked and the interface is awkward, to put it mildly. Far more user friendly but still information-rich is the <a href=\"http://www.trajans-column.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Trajan\u2019s Column website</a> created by Dartmouth College professor Roger B. Ulrich. The photographs are too small to quench my thirst. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/museo-della-civilta-romana?projectId=art-project\" target=\"_blank\">Google Art Project</a> has a handful of good images of the plaster casts at the Museum of Roman Civilisation (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/cast-of-trajan-s-column-battle-between-the-roman-cavalry-and-the-cataphractarii-allies-of-the-dacians/mwFHo2Nq3Zi6xg?projectId=art-project\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> of Trajan\u2019s cavalry defeating the Sarmatian cataphract heavy cavalry is my favorite because you get to see the weird fish scale armour in detail), but nowhere near enough. </p>\n<p>Wikipedia user MatthiasKabel has probably the best photographs of the complete column in situ on the web.

Their <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan-column/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">interactive graphic</a> has a brief slideshow of highlights you can click through, but most importantly allows you to wind your way around the entire column, zooming in to examine whatever detail catches your fancy. They\u2019ve created a simple color-coded notation system that categorizes the scenes by subject (marches, speeches, construction, etc.) and makes Trajan easy to spot because he\u2019s been tinted yellow in all 58 of the scenes in which he appears.</p>\n<p>As if that weren\u2019t cool enough, National Geographic raised the bar to infinity and beyond by making a stop-motion animated video of how the column may have been constructed. There are several competing theories on the question, but none of their advocates have made a stop-motion video of them, so, you know\u2026 </p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"268\" seamless=\"\" src=\"http://player.d.nationalgeographic.com/players/ngsvideo/share/?feed=http://feed.theplatform.com/f/ngs/dCCn2isYZ9N9&amp;guid=0000014b-eaa8-dcb2-a96b-eebc38d50003&amp;link=http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>But wait, there\u2019s more!

These two have the advantage of being iconic images and having been rescued by a legendary animator who has kept them safe at home for all these decades. </p>\n<p><em>What\u2019s Opera, Doc?</em> was directed by Chuck Jones (legend), voiced by Mel Blanc (legend) as Bugs with animation by Ken Harris (legend). Just six minutes long, the cartoon took seven weeks to produce, two weeks more than scheduled. Jones was so committed to this story that he made his crew falsify their time cards to say those extra two weeks were spent on a Road Runner cartoon that wasn\u2019t in production yet. \u201cFor sheer production quality, magnificent music, and wonderful animation,\u201d Jones said, \u201cthis is our most elaborate and satisfying production.\u201d His  instincts were unerring. Voted number one of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by 1,000 members animators in 1994, <em>What\u2019s Opera, Doc?</em> was also the first cartoon Congress deemed worthy of preservation in the National Film Registry in 1992. </p>\n<p>One lot captures <a href=\"http://comics.ha.com/itm/animation-art/what-s-opera-doc-bugs-bunny-and-elmer-fudd-production-cel-warner-brothers-1957-/a/7108-94451.s\" target=\"_blank\">Elmer in his Siegfried outfit lifting up Br\u00fcnnhilde Bugs</a> during their dance inspired by the Bacchanal ballet in Richard Wagner\u2019s <em>Tannh\u00e4user</em>.

The art appealed to him and, knowing that most animation art was simply stored and eventually trashed, he took a few.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn those day I never thought much about saving them,\u201d he said. \u201cI really just saved them for the artwork.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bless his good taste.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/WIiNOl5IiLA&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Kill the wabbit!

Individual talons thought to have been used as pendants have been found at Neanderthal sites before, but this group of eight talons collected from at least three eagles was used for a more elaborate ornament that likely held symbolic meaning. Crafted early in the Middle Paleolithic era long before anatomically modern humans arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago, the talons are evidence that Neanderthals created complex ornaments with symbolic significance independently of any later interactions with <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Krapina-stratigraphy.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-35516\" height=\"137\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Krapina-stratigraphy-200x137.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Krapina-stratigraphy-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Krapina-stratigraphy-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Krapina-stratigraphy-430x295.jpg 430w\" title=\"Stratigraphy of Krapina Neanderthal site Dragutin Gorjanovi\u0107-Kramberger commissioned an engineer named Kos to draw in 1905\" width=\"200\"/></a>The eight talons and one pedal phalanx (the toe bone associated with one of the talons) were found in the same level of a rock shelter on Hu\u0161njak hill, near the Croatian town of Krapina, that was excavated by Croatian paleontologist Dragutin Gorjanovi\u0107-Kramberger from 1899 to 1905.

Although most of the Neanderthal bones were found more than halfway down site (level 4 on the diagram, labeled \u201cHomo sapiens\u201d because when it was drawn they hadn\u2019t figured out yet that the bones belonged to another species of human), stone tools and one hearth were also found on the bear level confirming its use by Neanderthals.

Those smooth edges are how we know the cuts weren\u2019t the result of butchering. Other fauna in the rock shelter bears the sharp cut marks of the butchering process and none of them have smoothed edges. This was done deliberately, probably by wrapping the talon in a fiber of some kind. The shiny polished areas look like what happens when bone rubs against bone. The research team believes these are the tell-tale signs of the claws having been mounted in a necklace or bracelet. </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Articulation-of-Krapina-385.4-and-386.18.-Dorsal-lateral-view-arrow-points-to-highly-polished-area-on-385.4..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35510\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Articulation-of-Krapina-385.4-and-386.18.-Dorsal-lateral-view-arrow-points-to-highly-polished-area-on-385.4.-150x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Articulation-of-Krapina-385.4-and-386.18.-Dorsal-lateral-view-arrow-points-to-highly-polished-area-on-385.4.-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Articulation-of-Krapina-385.4-and-386.18.-Dorsal-lateral-view-arrow-points-to-highly-polished-area-on-385.4.-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Articulation-of-Krapina-385.4-and-386.18.-Dorsal-lateral-view-arrow-points-to-highly-polished-area-on-385.4.-430x278.jpg 430w\" title=\"Articulation of talon and phalanx, arrow points to highly polished area on talon\" width=\"150\"/></a>At Krapina, cut marks on the pedal phalanx and talons are not related to feather removal or subsistence, so these must be the result of severing tendons for talon acquisition. Further evidence for combining these in jewelry is edge smoothing of the cut marks, the small polished facets, medial/lateral sheen and nicks on some specimens. All are a likely manifestation of the separating the bones from the foot and the attachment of the talons to a string or sinew. Cut marks on many aspects, but not the plantar surfaces, illustrate the numerous approaches the Neandertals had for severing the bones and mounting them into a piece of jewelry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/right-talon-Two-cut-marks-with-smoothed-edges-and-a-magnification-of-the-area-shows-that-the-more-proximal-one-has-the-broader-dimension.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35511\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/right-talon-Two-cut-marks-with-smoothed-edges-and-a-magnification-of-the-area-shows-that-the-more-proximal-one-has-the-broader-dimension-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/right-talon-Two-cut-marks-with-smoothed-edges-and-a-magnification-of-the-area-shows-that-the-more-proximal-one-has-the-broader-dimension-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/right-talon-Two-cut-marks-with-smoothed-edges-and-a-magnification-of-the-area-shows-that-the-more-proximal-one-has-the-broader-dimension-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/right-talon-Two-cut-marks-with-smoothed-edges-and-a-magnification-of-the-area-shows-that-the-more-proximal-one-has-the-broader-dimension-430x431.jpg 430w\" title=\"Right talon, two cut marks with smoothed edges, magnification shows the closer one is wider.\" width=\"150\"/></a>As in ethnohistoric-present societies, the Neandertals\u2019 practice of catching eagles very likely involved planning and ceremony. We cannot know the way they were captured, but if collected from carcasses it must have taken keen eyes to locate the dead birds as rare as they were in the prehistoric avifauna. We suspect that the collection of talons from at least three different white-tailed eagles mitigates against recovering carcasses in the field, but more likely represents evidence for live capture. In any case, these talons provide multiple new lines of evidence for Neandertals\u2019 abilities and cultural sophistication. They are the earliest evidence for jewelry in the European fossil record and demonstrate that Neandertals possessed a symbolic culture long before more modern human forms arrived in Europe.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Neanderthals made jewelry from eagle talons 130,000 years ago\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35507\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35507#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-35483\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35483\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rubens\u2019 Three Magi reunited after 130 years\">Rubens\u2019 Three Magi reunited after 130 years</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, March 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rubens-Three-Magi-at-NGA.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-35487\" height=\"127\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rubens-Three-Magi-at-NGA-200x127.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rubens-Three-Magi-at-NGA-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rubens-Three-Magi-at-NGA-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rubens-Three-Magi-at-NGA-430x273.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Three Magi by Peter Paul Rubens reunited at the National Gallery of Art.

There\u2019s a reason for this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Christophe-Plantin-Rubens-1630-36.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35499\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Christophe-Plantin-Rubens-1630-36-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Christophe-Plantin-Rubens-1630-36-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Christophe-Plantin-Rubens-1630-36-430x556.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Christophe-Plantin-Rubens-1630-36.jpg 740w\" title=\"Portrait of Christophe Plantin by Peter Paul Rubens, 1612-1616\" width=\"115\"/></a>Balthasar Moretus was head of the Officina Plantiniana (Plantin Press), a printing company founded by his grandfather Christophe Plantin which was the largest publisher in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. He had been close friends with Rubens since they were schoolkids and once he and his brother became heads of the company after their father\u2019s death in 1610, Moretus regularly commissioned Rubens to make illustrations and title pages for Officina publications.

Balthasar\u2019s father Jan I Moretus had started at Plantin Press as an assistant when he was 15 years old and worked his way up the ladder to become Christophe Plantin\u2019s indispensable right hand man. After his marriage to Plantin\u2019s second daughter Martina, who ran a successful lace and linen business of her own, he became Plantin\u2019s son-in-law and presumptive successor too. In a letter to his father, Jan explained that Moretus was the Latinized version of his last name Moerentorf and that he had chosen it as a reference to \u201cMorus,\u201d the Moorish king who was one of the Three Magi. He placed the king and the Star of Bethlehem on his insignia along with the motto \u201cratione recta\u201d (\u201cright reason\u201d) because he held the star to be a symbol of reason. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Star-in-printer-device-1634.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35496\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 132px) 100vw, 132px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Star-in-printer-device-1634-132x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Star-in-printer-device-1634-132x150.jpg 132w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Star-in-printer-device-1634-200x226.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Star-in-printer-device-1634-430x486.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Star-in-printer-device-1634.jpg 590w\" title=\"Plantin printer's device with Star of Bethlehem, 1634\" width=\"132\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plantin-device-1599.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35495\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plantin-device-1599-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plantin-device-1599-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plantin-device-1599-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plantin-device-1599-430x318.jpg 430w\" title=\"Plantin printer's device from 1599\" width=\"150\"/></a>He carried that theme into the family nomenclature when he and Martina named three of their 10 children after the Magi. Balthasar, obviously, was one of the three. When he became head of the Platin Press he took a page out of his father\u2019s book, no pun intended, put the Star of Bethlehem into the company\u2019s golden compass printer\u2019s device and adopted the motto \u201cstella duce\u201d (\u201cwith the star as guide\u201d). The Three Magi Rubens painted for him, therefore, were avatars of the brothers, the family and its vocation on top of their religious meaning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Printing-presses-ca-1600-Plantin-Moretus-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35492\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Printing-presses-ca-1600-Plantin-Moretus-Museum-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Printing-presses-ca-1600-Plantin-Moretus-Museum-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Printing-presses-ca-1600-Plantin-Moretus-Museum-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Printing-presses-ca-1600-Plantin-Moretus-Museum-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Printing presses from 1600, oldest surviving in the world, at the Plantin-Moretus Museum\" width=\"150\"/></a>Many of the portraits Rubens painted for the publishing dynasty still hang on the wall of the main gallery of <a href=\"http://www.museumplantinmoretus.be/Museum_PlantinMoretus_EN\" target=\"_blank\">Plantin-Moretus Museum</a>, a museum dedicated to the Plantin Press and Plantin-Moretus families that is located in the Renaissance-style palace that housed both the family and the business from the 16th century through the late 19th.

Within a year it was a museum for the public to enjoy the gorgeousness of the home (never mind the priceless art on the wall, the woodwork is INSANE) and the utilitarian beauty of the printing offices. The Three Magi were long gone by then, however. The family had sold the Three Kings to Graaf Van de Werve de Vosselaer of Antwerp in 1781.

Newton was Master of the Mint at the time, but before this discovery scholars believed that the medal was designed by court painter Sir Godfrey Kneller. </p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]he notes show Newton switching ideas from science to maths, classical history, politics and literature.<br/>\n\u201cIt tells us that Newton didn\u2019t conceive of himself as a scientist, but a master of lots of trades. The understanding of him as a great scientist is a later imposition, he would have seen himself more as a public servant.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Finding a manuscript in Newton\u2019s own hand complete with sketches and explanations of the metaphors woven into the design lends new insight into the man, his work at the mint and the seething cauldron of politics bubbling around Queen Anne\u2019s coronation.</p>\n<p>Official commemorative medals were struck for every coronation of a Stuart monarch. There were gold versions to hand out to the peers and diplomats attending the coronation and cheaper silver versions to throw into the crowds gathered at Westminster Abbey. Original documentation about the design and production of most of the Stuart tokens has not survived. That makes the Isaac Newton papers on the creation of the 1702 medal all the more significant.</p>\n<p>Hone was doing research for the <a href=\"http://stuarts.exeter.ac.uk/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Stuart Successions Project</a>, a joint study by Exeter University and Oxford University of printed material written during and about the succession crises in Britain between 1603 and 1702, when he came across a set of manuscripts from Newton\u2019s time as Master of the Mint. One of them was a 50-page document that, judging from the completely rusted clasp keeping the pages together, hadn\u2019t been read for years. The manuscript detailed the design of the first coronation medal and other prospective medals as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sir-Isaac-Newton-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1702.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-35480\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sir-Isaac-Newton-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1702-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sir-Isaac-Newton-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1702-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sir-Isaac-Newton-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1702-200x242.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Sir-Isaac-Newton-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-1702-430x521.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait of Isaac Newton by Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1702\" width=\"123\"/></a>Newton was in his mid-50s when he was appointed Warden of the Royal Mint in 1696 during the reign of King William III. He was enlisted by Secretary to the Treasury William Lowndes to help in the Great Recoinage of 1696, an attempt by the government to solve a currency crisis by taking old, badly clipped silver coins and counterfeits out of circulation. Newton committed to the task with characteristic vigor, going undercover in taverns and dark alleys to gather information on counterfeiters. He personally interrogated suspects and witnesses and prosecuted dozens, securing convictions in 28 cases. He also helped establish the Bank of England as ordered by Acts of Parliament.</p>\n<p>He was appointed Master of the Mint in 1699, and even though both the mint positions he held were widely considered sinecures, Isaac Newton took the second one as seriously as he had the first. He retired as Member of Parliament for the Cambridge University constituency to dedicate himself to the job. Little surprise, then, that he was writing 50-page treatises on commemorative medals when his predecessors had left that sort of thing to Mint minions. He put his extensive knowledge of mythology and allegory to work crafting a doozy of a propaganda piece.</p>\n<p>The obverse of the medal is profile of Queen Anne similar to what you\u2019d find on the regular coinage inscribed \u201cANNA D.G. MAG. BR. FRA. ET. HIB REGINA\u201d (\u201cAnne, by the grace of God, Queen of Great Britain, France and Ireland\u201d). The reverse is the juicy bit. Anne is depicted as the Greek warrior goddess Pallas Athena standing on a hill with the rays of the sun shining down upon her. She holds three bolts of lightning upraised in her right hand and her aegis in the left. At her feet is an aggressive monster with two heads, four arms (two of them hold clubs, the other two rocks) and eight snakes in place of legs. This side is inscribed \u201cVICEM GERIT ILLA TONANTIS\u201d or \u201cShe is the Thunderer\u2019s viceregent\u201d across the top and \u201cINAUGURAT XXIII AP MDCCII\u201d (\u201cCrowned April 23, 1702\u201d) across the bottom.</p>\n<p>The multi-headed serpent element suggests this monster is the Hydra, classical symbol of a complex and die-hard enemy that springs two new heads for every one you cut off. Before now scholars have thought the monster represented a domestic faction opposed to Anne\u2019s rule. Hone discovered that <a href=\"http://stuarts.exeter.ac.uk/isaac-newton-and-queen-annes-coronation-medal/\" target=\"_blank\">Newton had a whole other think going</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>But Newton, in his own notes on the design, describes it as a symbol of \u201cany Enemy with which Her Majesty hath or may have War\u201d. In other words, the monster presents the double threat posed by Louis XIV and James Francis Edward Stuart [Anne\u2019s exiled half-brother, the Catholic son of James II], the Old Pretender. The motto looks back to William and Mary. By describing Anne as a \u201cThunderer\u201d, Newton explains that he was alluding to the coronation medal of 1689, which likewise portrayed William as a thundering Jupiter. In a sentence, Newton explains that the coronation medal \u201csignifies that her Majesty continues the scene of the last reign\u201d.</p>\n<p>The messages of the medal were not lost at the time. Some of William\u2019s allies used the medal to suggest that Anne was William redivivus. William\u2019s Tory enemies, on the other hand, considered it a potentially seditious object. The High Tory Vice Chancellor of Oxford even banned students from discussing the medal in their panegyrics to the new queen! This medal, it seems, had political bite.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait-of-Queen-Anne-by-John-Closterman-1702.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-35479\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait-of-Queen-Anne-by-John-Closterman-1702-121x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait-of-Queen-Anne-by-John-Closterman-1702-121x150.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait-of-Queen-Anne-by-John-Closterman-1702-200x246.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait-of-Queen-Anne-by-John-Closterman-1702-430x529.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait of Queen Anne by John Closterman, 1702\" width=\"121\"/></a>The medal\u2019s depiction of Anne as the warrior queen continuing where King William had left off seems to have made people nervous in other ways as well. She never again appeared as a fighter. There were two other medals cast after this one in 1702. The second featured her profile on the obverse and her husband Prince George of Denmark on the reverse. The third had the usual profile obverse and a European town under siege on the reverse. The inscription says \u201cVIRES ANIMUMQUE MINISTRAT,\u201d meaning \u201cShe gives strength and courage.\u201d Gone was the warrior goddess vanquishing the country\u2019s enemies with her terrible power of the thunderbolt. In a matter of months her she was whittled down into an inspiration, a sort of spiritual Betty Grable pin-up shoring up troop morale. That shift became permanent, and it\u2019s very noticeable because there were multiple issues of Queen Anne commemorative medals with battle scenes on the reverse.</p>\n<p>Hone thinks Newton\u2019s work at the mint may have played a part in his knighthood. Queen Anne knighted Isaac Newton in 1705, three years to the month after her coronation, during her visit to Cambridge. He was running for Cambridge MP at the time and the election was a month away, so historians generally believe the knighting was a political gesture rather than recognition of his work for the crown or his scientific accomplishments. Newton was only the second scientist ever knighted. Sir Francis Bacon was the first to receive the honor in 1603.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Queen Anne coronation medal designed by Isaac Newton\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35474\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35474#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2015/03/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

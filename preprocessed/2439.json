It was widely known that the situation was dire, that all the great herds were gone, indiscriminately slaughtered by hunters, that from the 10-15 million that once roamed the range, maybe a few thousand individuals remained in the more inaccessible regions of the northern range. Hornaday\u2019s research found that extinction loomed even closer, that instead of thousands there were probably fewer than 300 head of wild bison left in the entire United States.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"William Temple Hornaday\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32132\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday-110x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday-110x150.jpg 110w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday-200x271.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday-430x583.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday.jpg 566w\" title=\"William Temple Hornaday\" width=\"110\"/></a>Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, concerned that the National Museum only had a handful of ratty skins, a skeleton, a couple of heads and assorted bones in its collection, agreed to send Hornaday on a mission to secure enough specimens before there were none left to be had. Hornaday\u2019s brief was to kill between 80 and 100 bison, possibly a third of the entire surviving population, to ensure the Smithsonian, smaller museums and future museums not yet in existence would have specimens to display and study when the bison were extinct.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Partially completed armature for taxidermy bison, drawing from Hornaday's 1891 book &quot;Taxidermy and Zoological Collecting&quot;\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32131\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Partially completed armature for taxidermy bison, drawing from Hornaday's 1891 book &quot;Taxidermy and Zoological Collecting&quot;\" width=\"200\"/></a>This is a passage from <a href=\"http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/letter-dated-december-21-1886-professor-spencer-f-baird-secretary-smithsoni\" target=\"_blank\">a letter Hornaday wrote to Baird</a> in December of 1886 reporting on the team\u2019s success:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I consider that we have been extremely lucky in finding a sufficient number of buffalo where it was supposed by people generally that none existed. Our \u201coutfit\u201d has been pronounced by old buffalo hunters \u201cThe luckiest outfit that ever hunted buffalo in Montana,\u201d and the opinion is quite generally held that our \u201chaul\u201d of specimens could not be equaled again in Montana by anybody, no matter what their resources for the reason that the buffalo are not there. We killed very nearly all we saw and I am confident there are not over thirty-head remaining in Montana, all told. By this time next year the cowboys will have destroyed about all of this remnant. We got in our Exploration just in the nick of time, \u2014 the last day in the evening, so to speak, and I do not hesitate to say that I am really rejoiced over the fact that we have been successful in securing the specimens we needed so urgently.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I understand his perspective \u2014 hunters would have killed those bison anyway, so this way they were preserved for posterity at least \u2014 but my modern sensibilities can\u2019t help but find the impulse to conserve by destruction contradictory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Hornaday with bison calf Sandy at Smithsonian, 1886\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32120\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 114px) 100vw, 114px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886-114x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886-114x150.jpg 114w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886-200x262.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886-430x563.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886.jpg 586w\" title=\"Hornaday with bison calf Sandy at Smithsonian, 1886\" width=\"114\"/></a>William Temple Hornaday didn\u2019t stop there, however. He became a powerful advocate for the wild bison, realizing he had to at least try to prevent the total annihilation of the noble beast. He actually brought back a live bison, a calf he named Sandy, from his 1886 hunt, but Sandy only lived a few months. Hornaday got the idea for a national zoo and wrote to Baird proposing it. Baird was very ill and would soon pass away, so his assistant Professor George Brown Goode, appointed acting secretary until a permanent replacement could be found, picked up the mantle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Taxidermy bison group by William Hornaday in the Smithsonian, 1887\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32129\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887-200x160.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887-430x344.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887.jpg 958w\" title=\"Taxidermy bison group by William Hornaday in the Smithsonian, 1887\" width=\"150\"/></a>In the fall of 1887, Goode created the Department of Living Animals of the National Museum and made Hornaday its curator. Their plan was to test the public\u2019s interest in a zoo in the capital. If people were into the test run, getting the necessary legislation passed for a full-on national zoo would be much more likely. Hornaday went off on another field trip to assemble some actual living animals and came back with 15 American natives: one cinnamon bear, one white-tailed deer, one Columbia black-tailed deer, five prairie dogs, a Cross fox, a mule deer, two badgers, a red fox, and two spotted lynx. He set up a rather rickety group of paddocks and sheds on the National Mall and <em>Field of Dreams</em>-like, people came.</p>\n<p>The Smithsonian\u2019s mini-zoo was an instant success. Crowds flocked to see the live animals, and donors from President Grover Cleveland (he donated a golden eagle that had been given to him as a Christmas gift) to wealthy collectors quickly increased the complement of animals. In December of 1887, <a href=\"http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/letter-dated-december-2-1887-professor-george-brown-goode-director-national\" target=\"_blank\">Hornaday wrote to Goode</a> proposing that they obtain a nucleus of a bison herd to breed them in captivity without diluting the genes by mating them with domestic cattle (something that had been happening on ranches for years) or damaging the line by in-breeding.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In view of the fact that thus far this government has done nothing to preserve alive any specimens of the American Bison, the most striking and conspicuous species on this continent, I have the honor to propose that the Smithsonian Institution, or the National Museum, one or both, take immediate steps to procure either by gift or purchase, as may be necessary, the nucleus of a herd of live buffaloes. Having been spared the misfortune, thanks to the Smithsonian Institution, of being left without a series of skins and skeletons of the species suitable for the wants of the National Museum, it now seems necessary for us to assume the responsibility of forming and preserving a herd of live buffaloes which may, in a small measure, atone for the national disgrace that attaches to the heartless and senseless extermination of the species in a wild state.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To purchase the nucleus herd would be expensive, and space was going to be an issue sooner rather than later. Hornaday\u2019s dream would become closer to reality shortly when frontier surgeon and Indian Agent Dr. Valentine Trant McGillycuddy donated a breeding pair of bison and two of their calves (one male, one female). That wasn\u2019t enough for a breeding program, but it was a great start.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Group-of-bison-standing-in-paddock-near-first-National-Zoological-Park-Building-a-house-for-the-bison-and-elk.-An-elk-is-visible-in-his-paddock-in-the-distance-by-C.-M.-Bell-1891.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Group of bison standing in paddock near first National Zoological Park Building, a house for the bison and elk.

The paddocks and shanties around the Smithsonian Castle could not handle the burgeoning population, and Hornaday turned his considerable energies to Congress. A Senate bill was drafted in May of 1888 proposing that $200,000 be spent buying 166 acres of Rock Creek Park for a national zoo. Hornaday testified before the House Appropriations Committee, and although his testimony was well received, a few squeaky wheels had a problem with the proposed bill. Democrat Thomas Stockdale of Mississippi told the press that a national zoo \u201cwould be of no use to the poor who come to Washington to visit the last of the buffaloes,\u201d and the idea \u201cdoes not sound like republicanism. It echoes like royalty.\u201d The bill was defeated soundly with 36 votes in favor, 56 against and one abstention.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"H.R. 11810, bill establishing national zoo\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32125\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 104px) 100vw, 104px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2-104x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2-104x150.jpg 104w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2-200x287.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2-430x618.jpg 430w\" title=\"H.R. 11810, bill establishing national zoo\" width=\"104\"/></a>So the Smithsonian\u2019s Mall zoo had to keep making do for the foreseeable future. In December of 1888, they were forced to decline a most wonderful offer from Buffalo Bill Cody of 18 bison, the third largest private collection in the world, because they didn\u2019t have the room for them. The tragic loss proved to be a public relations victory for the zoo since everyone was bummed at the missed opportunity. Three months later, on March 2, 1889, Grover Cleveland signed the bill establishing a National Zoo which had passed the House by a vote of 131 to 98.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bison standing in front of the Buffalo Barn at the National Zoo, ca. 1895\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32122\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895-200x177.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895-430x382.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895.jpg 864w\" title=\"Bison standing in front of the Buffalo Barn at the National Zoo, ca. 1895\" width=\"150\"/></a>That wasn\u2019t the end of the struggle. Hornaday had to fight for his vision against his new boss, Samuel Pierpont Langley, and for funding with Congress. He secured the funding, but he couldn\u2019t persuade Langley to go along with his plans for how the zoo should be designed and operated (Hornaday wanted naturalistic enclosures that flowed with the landscape, two entrances, full public access; Langley did not). Hornaday resigned later in 1889 but kept on fighting for the conservation of the bison. His passionate advocacy took published form in his highly influential 1889 book <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17748/17748-h/17748-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Extermination of the American Bison</em></a>.

His shoulder was also freshly broken. These were perimortem battle wounds. He was buried with copious grave goods and careful attention to ritual indicating he was a person of high status in his community. The most remarkable indication of the respect accorded to him was the large bear fang embedded in his nose, a fearsome symbol of strength and power. He also wore a death mask, now mostly decayed because it was made of fabric. Part of the mask were caskets of birch bark over his eye sockets and mouth. Inside the caskets were metal fish figurines whose heads were deliberately snapped off before burial.</p>\n<p>Other grave goods include a round mirror of bronze decorated with abstract swirls that was placed on his chest inside a birch bark cover and a bronze cauldron with the remains of food still inside that was placed at his feet.

Archaeologists believe the mirror was a worn as an amulet and served as a tool used to communicate with the gods, while the cauldron and food were meant to feed the warrior in the afterlife. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Close by were remains of leather and fur, perhaps part of his costume or from the quiver decorations on his arrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe found 25 arrowheads \u2013 armour-piercing and diamond shaped, made from metal and bone,\u201d said [archeologist Mikhail Korusenko], a candidate of historical sciences, from the Omsk branch of the Institute of Archeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of them were clearly of military purpose.

This is a righting of a wrong that has been very long in coming.</p>\n<p>Captain Cook was the first European to encounter the main island in 1774. He named it New Caledonia because the cliffs of the east coast reminded him of the Scottish Highlands. French explorers mapped more of the archipelago, Bruni d\u2019Entrecasteaux in 1792, Durmont d\u2019Urville in 1827. British Protestant missionaries arrived in 1840 and with the discovery of sandalwood the next year, British merchants followed. French Catholic missionaries came in 1843. Religious conflict ensued with the Catholics ultimately coming out on top. New Caledonia was formally claimed as a French colony by Admiral Auguste Febvrier-Despointes in 1853, and two years later all land on the main island was declared property of the French state.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Outside-walls-of-Canak-prison-before-1906.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Outside walls of Canak prison before 1906\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32100\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Outside-walls-of-Canak-prison-before-1906-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Outside-walls-of-Canak-prison-before-1906-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Outside-walls-of-Canak-prison-before-1906-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Outside-walls-of-Canak-prison-before-1906-430x315.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Outside-walls-of-Canak-prison-before-1906.jpg 1472w\" title=\"Outside walls of Canak prison before 1906\" width=\"150\"/></a>The French used it as a penal colony for the second half of the 19th century. An estimated 20,000 prisoners were transported to New Caledonia between 1864 and 1897, including 4,000 or so deported for their involvement in the Paris Commune and 100 Algerian insurrectionists. Most of them were put to work in the nickel and copper mines. While French authorities sent foreign laborers and settlers to the archipelago, they took indigenous people out. Many of the Kanak (a general name given to people from a wide variety of different tribes and clans with almost 30 mutually unintelligible languages) were enslaved or coerced into forced labor in Australia, Fiji, Canada, India, Japan, Malaysia and Chile, to name a few.</p>\n<p>The ones were remained were in barely better straits. In 1864, convicts who were deemed worthy were freed and given land grants. More than 100,000 hectares of the richest farmland were deeded out to former convicts. In 1868, an order was promulgated forcing the indigenous people onto reservations, moving them inland close to the mountains where the land was barely arable. Many were made to work the plantations and ranches of French settlers without pay.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Engraving-of-Atai-le-Voleur-October-4-1878.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='Engraving of Ata\u00ef published in French magazine \"Le Voleur\" on October 4th, 1878' class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32099\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Engraving-of-Atai-le-Voleur-October-4-1878-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Engraving-of-Atai-le-Voleur-October-4-1878-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Engraving-of-Atai-le-Voleur-October-4-1878-200x277.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Engraving-of-Atai-le-Voleur-October-4-1878-430x596.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Engraving-of-Atai-le-Voleur-October-4-1878.jpg 1153w\" title='Engraving of Ata\u00ef published in French magazine \"Le Voleur\" on October 4th, 1878' width=\"108\"/></a>Under these kinds of pressure, it\u2019s no surprise that conflicts exploded. Small revolts began in the 1850s but were quickly suppressed by overwhelming French force. It all came to a head in 1878. A drought in 1877 had taken a huge toll on the cattle, so the governor granted ranchers grazing rights on reservation lands. The stock were let loose on fallow fields, but there weren\u2019t any fences. The cattle just walked on over to the farmed land and ate the yam and taro crops that were all the tribes had to live on. Already displaced from lands which defined their identities and to which they had a profound religious connection, the Kanaks couldn\u2019t tolerate having what was left of their livelihoods threatened by French cows.</p>\n<p>High Chief Ata\u00ef of the Petit Couli tribe sought out the French governor. The chief poured out a bag of soil in front of the governor and said, \u201cThis is what we had.\u201d Then he dumped a bag of rocks out and said, \u201cThis is what you have left us.\u201d The governor replied that they should protect their crops by building fences. Ata\u00ef responded: \u201cWhen the taro eat the cattle, I\u2019ll build the fences.\u201d</p>\n<p>Violent clashes ensued, with Kanaks attacking settlers and tribal leaders being imprisoned in retaliation. Ata\u00ef realized that localized revolts would go nowhere. He created an alliance between multiple tribes to fight the French. In June of 1878, the allied tribes launched an attack on troops and settlers. Their guerilla warfare was so successful that the French commander called for reinforcements from Indochina.</p>\n<p>In August, Ata\u00ef and 500 warriors besieged a fort the French had built in La Foa on the southwest coast. At first the siege appeared to be going well for the Kanak side, but then the French managed to make a deal with Gelina, the High Chief of the Canala tribe, dividing the Kanak forces. Then the reinforcements from Indochina arrived. At the end of the month, a motley team of French regulars, convicts, former Communards who were promised their freedom in return for fighting on the side of a government they had once fought against so passionately, former Algerian rebels in the same position, and Kanak warriors from the Canala tribe surrounded Ata\u00ef\u2019s army.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Louise-Michel-1880.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Louise Michel, 1880\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32096\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 98px) 100vw, 98px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Louise-Michel-1880-98x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Louise-Michel-1880-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Louise-Michel-1880-197x300.jpg 197w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Louise-Michel-1880-430x652.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Louise-Michel-1880.jpg 1181w\" title=\"Louise Michel, 1880\" width=\"98\"/></a>On September 1st, a detachment of French military encountered the chief, his three sons and his bard (the French anthropologists called him a \u201csorcerer\u201d) Andia on the way back to the Kanak encampment. A Canala warrior with the French identified the chief from his shock of white hair. Communard hero Louise Michel, aka the Red Virgin, who had taught school during her New Caledonian exile and who was one of the only Communards to side with the Kanak, seeing in them the same struggle for liberty that she and her comrades had fought for, described the scene thus in <a href=\"http://socialiststories.net/liberate/Memoirs%20of%20Louise%20Michel.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">her memoirs (pdf)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The traitor Segou faltered for a moment under the look of the old chief, but then, wanting it all to be over, he threw his short spear at Ata\u00ef and it pierced the old chief\u2019s right arm. Ata\u00ef raised his axe in his left hand as his sons were shot down around him, one killed and the others wounded.</p>\n<p>Andia lunged forward crying out, \u201cTango! Tango! (Cursed! Cursed!),\u201d but he was shot dead instantly. Then Segou moved in against the wounded Ata\u00ef, and with his own axe struck blow after blow, the way he would have chopped at a tree.</p>\n<p>Ata\u00ef fell, and Segou grabbed at his partially severed head. He struck him several more blows, and Ata\u00ef was finally dead. Seeing Ata\u00ef fall at Segou\u2019s hands, the Kanaks unleashed their death cry in an echo to the mountains.

Enslavement, disease and war took a terrible toll on the Kanak population. There were about 70,000 indigenous people living on the islands of New Caledonia when Cook arrived in 1774. By 1921, there were only 27,000 left.</p>\n<p>The heads of Ata\u00ef, Andia and Ata\u00ef\u2019s adolescent son were all severed, as was one of Ata\u00ef\u2019s hands. Ship\u2019s Lieutenant Servant received Andia\u2019s head and Ata\u00ef\u2019s head and hand from Segou and sold them for 200 francs to Dr. Navarre, a naval doctor. He packed the remains in tin boxes filled with phenol and shipped them to Professor Paul Broca, founder and president of the Anthropological Society of Paris (SAP). According to the minutes of SAP\u2019s 396th meeting held on October 23, 1879 (<a href=\"http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bmsap_0301-8644_1879_num_2_1_5258\" target=\"_blank\">Page 616 here</a>), they arrived in a \u201cperfect state of conservation. They emit no odor and we hope that the brain, even though they\u2019re still in their skulls, will still be good for study.\u201d Professor Broca:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-skull.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Atai's skull\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32095\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 135px) 100vw, 135px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-skull-135x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-skull-135x150.jpg 135w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-skull-200x221.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-skull-430x475.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-skull.jpg 639w\" title=\"Atai's skull\" width=\"135\"/></a>The magnificent head of the chief Ata\u00ef draws the most attention.

Palmar creases are similar to ours.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Andia\u2019s head gets the same treatment, although it\u2019s worse in some ways because it seems he suffered from some form of dwarfism so there\u2019s a lot of gross talk about how savages see deformity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-death-mask.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ata\u00ef death mask\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32098\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-death-mask-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-death-mask-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-death-mask-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-death-mask-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atai-death-mask.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Ata\u00ef death mask\" width=\"112\"/></a>Chief Ata\u00ef\u2019s head was cast in bronze by F\u00e9lix Flandinette, after which it was stripped of flesh and that brain they were so keen to get a look at, and the skull was kept with the SAP collection of skulls in the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. In 1951, SAP\u2019s skull collection was transferred to the <a href=\"http://www.museedelhomme.fr/\" target=\"_blank\">Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Homme</a> where they\u2019ve been kept in a cabinet for decades.

The seats weren\u2019t always stone, however. There were wooden toilet seats as well, but the organic material decays leaving behind only the stone or brick structure. Now archaeologists have <a href=\"http://www.vindolanda.com/_blog/press-releases/post/press-release---earliest-known-wooden-toilet-seat-discovered-at-vindolanda/\" target=\"_blank\">unearthed the first Roman toilet seat made of wood</a> perfectly preserved in the waterlogged soil of the Roman fort of Vindolanda.</p>\n<p>Vindolanda, a fort and settlement in Northumberland just south of Hadrian\u2019s Wall, has been an <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31040\" target=\"_blank\">unparalleled source of artifacts</a> illuminating daily life in this remote outpost of the Roman Empire starting with the first timber fort built in the late 1st century (around 85 A.D.).

That was the fifth timber fort built at Vindolanda after the demolition of the previous one in 105 A.D., so the toilet seat could have been in use for almost two decades.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a long time for a piece of wood to do such hard duty (yes, I said duty), and there\u2019s no way of knowing how long it was in use, but there is a great deal of wear around the opening.

As soon as we started to uncover it there was no doubt at all on what we had found. It is made from a very well worked piece of wood and looks pretty comfortable. Now we need to find the toilet that went with it as Roman loos are fascinating places to excavate \u2013 their drains often contain astonishing artefacts. Let\u2019s face it, if you drop something down a Roman latrine you are unlikely to attempt to fish it out unless you are pretty brave or foolhardy.\u201d  Discoveries at Vindolanda from latrines have included a baby boot, coins, a betrothal medallion, and a bronze lamp.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Wooden-toilet-seat-cleaned.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-32075\" height=\"165\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Wooden-toilet-seat-cleaned-e1409286837440-430x165.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Wooden-toilet-seat-cleaned-e1409286837440-430x165.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Wooden-toilet-seat-cleaned-e1409286837440-150x57.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Wooden-toilet-seat-cleaned-e1409286837440-200x76.jpg 200w\" title=\"Wooden toilet seat cleaned, Image courtesy Vindolanda Trust\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Next on the Vindolanda team\u2019s toilet-related wishlist is a <em>tersorium</em>, a stick topped with a natural sponge that was used to clean the business areas after defecation.

The joint project of the International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., has already scanned almost 9,000 negatives that have never been seen or published before. More negatives continue to be added all the time.

Even as he studied biology and zoology in college, he continued to explore photography and was an accomplished amateur photographer by the time he left Russia in 1920. He and his new wife joined his \u00e9migr\u00e9 family in Weimar Berlin. Throughout the 1920s, Roman took copious pictures documenting the street life of the city, particularly his own neighborhood populated primarily by Russian Jews. He experimented with framing and composition, and even built his own darkroom in his apartment.  </p>\n<p>In the wake of Adolf Hitler\u2019s appointment as Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Jews are increasingly marginalized. Vishniac kept taking pictures, documenting the increasing dominance of anti-Semitic laws and attitudes in Berlin. He soon traveled further afield. From 1935 to 1938, the Paris headquarters of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (AJDC) commissioned him to photograph rural Jewish communities in Central and Eastern Europe. They aimed to publicize the images in the United States to raise awareness of the deep need in these impoverished communities. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Berlin-street-scene-with-swastika-flag-in-background-1935-6.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32068\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Berlin-street-scene-with-swastika-flag-in-background-1935-6-142x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Berlin-street-scene-with-swastika-flag-in-background-1935-6-142x150.jpg 142w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Berlin-street-scene-with-swastika-flag-in-background-1935-6-200x210.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Berlin-street-scene-with-swastika-flag-in-background-1935-6-430x451.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Berlin-street-scene-with-swastika-flag-in-background-1935-6.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Berlin street scene with swastika in the background, 1935-6\" width=\"142\"/></a>In 1938 and 1939, the AJDC sent Vishniac to Poland and the Netherlands to photograph Jewish refugees expelled from Germany. From the Netherlands he traveled to France, working as a freelance photographer. In 1940, he gave all his negatives to a friend in Paris, asking him to take them to the United States. That was very well timed since shortly thereafter he was arrested and interned in Camp du Ruchard in Clichy for three months. He got out and managed to leave France for Lisbon where he reunites with his wife and children and together they flee to New York.</p>\n<p>His pre-war negatives had finally reached him in 1942 and prints of some of them had already been displayed in an attempt to draw attention to the plight of Europe\u2019s Jews. The vast majority of them, however, remained unprinted negatives, and Vishniac never labeled them or annotated them in any way. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that those negatives are now published online. There are still people alive who may be able to recognize the people and places in the pictures but the clock is ticking. Others may recognize something they\u2019ve seen in family photographs even if they weren\u2019t born when Vishniac took the pictures.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://vishniac.icp.org/search-the-collection\" target=\"_blank\">search the collection</a> by keyword, date, location, etc., or you can <a href=\"http://vishniac.icp.org/search-the-collection?field_titleobjtitle_external_value=&amp;field_art_object_identifier_object_number=&amp;field_datebegin_external_int_value[min]=&amp;field_datebegin_external_int_value[max]=&amp;field_combined_locations_for_sea_external_value=&amp;field_medium_external_value=\" target=\"_blank\">browse through all 8999 scanned negatives</a>. <a href=\"http://vishniac.icp.org/user/register\" target=\"_blank\">Register here</a> to help with the labeling. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Vast archive of pre-war European Jewish life digitized\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32063\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32063#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32052\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32052\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Camp Security saved, excavations begin\">Camp Security saved, excavations begin</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, August 26th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camp-Security-aerial-view.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-24516\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camp-Security-aerial-view-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camp-Security-aerial-view-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camp-Security-aerial-view-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Camp-Security-aerial-view-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Camp Security aerial view with encroaching development all around\" width=\"200\"/></a>The only Revolutionary War POW camp to survive in undeveloped condition has been saved for posterity thanks to donations from the public. When I first wrote about Camp Security <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24508\" target=\"_blank\">last April</a>, the 47-acre plot in Springettsbury Township, Pennsylvania, between the city of York and the Susquehanna River, was in danger of being sold. More than half a million dollars of a bridge loan secured by non-profit The Conservation Fund for its purchase was still outstanding, and if the money couldn\u2019t be raised by August, the Fund might have to sell the land or face disastrous budgetary consequences. </p>\n<p>They must have gotten an extension on that bridge loan, because at the end of the July they were <a href=\"http://www.ydr.com/ci_23739680\" target=\"_blank\">still $250,000 short</a> and there was no news I could find in August, but come December, the <a href=\"http://www.ydr.com/local/ci_24671060/springettsbury-takes-ownership-camp-security-property\" target=\"_blank\">Springettsbury Township announced</a> that the full sum had been raised and that The Conservation Fund had transferred the deed to the property to the township. Thanks to more than a decade of hard work from the township, The Conservation Fund, York County, the York County Heritage Trust, the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and Friends of Camp Security, plus donations from people all over the country, the field now belongs to the township in perpetuity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Camp_Security_Overlay.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32055\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Camp_Security_Overlay-122x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Camp_Security_Overlay-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Camp_Security_Overlay-200x245.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Camp_Security_Overlay-430x526.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Camp_Security_Overlay.jpg 631w\" title=\"Camp Security and adjacent parcels now all owned by Springettsbury Township\" width=\"122\"/></a>It joins an adjacent 115-acre parcel and a small park that already belong to the township to form a large public open space. Hunting and digging are prohibited, but people can walk it or picnic on it or throw frisbees to their hearts\u2019 content. The overall plans for the property include environmental preservation, historic preservation and archaeological exploration. </p>\n<p>On Monday, the <a href=\"http://www.ydr.com/history/ci_26389388/camp-security-archaeological-dig-starts-monday\" target=\"_blank\">excavation of the Camp Security site began</a>. There was limited survey on a small section of the site in 1979 that returned thousands of Revolutionary War artifacts \u2014 that\u2019s how it was identified as the location of Camp Security \u2014 but this is the first time archaeologists and volunteers will really get to explore the site. More than 75 people have volunteered to help. They will work four-hour shifts over 25 days in the field.</p>\n<p>Since the site has been plowed by a farmer, volunteers will first scan the surface for artifacts. Next the team will dig about 100 holes looking for evidence of the two camps built on the site. Camp Security was the POW camp \u2014 sharpened picket fence, wooden stockade and fieldstone cabins \u2014 built by prisoners when they arrived in August of 1781. Outside the picket fence was Camp Indulgence, unenclosed fieldstone huts built to house the wives and children who followed their husbands. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lamb-drawing-XXII.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32056\" height=\"139\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lamb-drawing-XXII-200x139.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lamb-drawing-XXII-200x139.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lamb-drawing-XXII-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lamb-drawing-XXII-430x300.jpg 430w\" title=\"Drawing by POW Sergeant Roger Lamb of Camp Security and Camp Indulgence\" width=\"200\"/></a>Most of this first group of prisoners had been captured after the surrender of General John Burgoyne at Saratoga, New York, in 1777. They were used to living in America, despite have experienced considerable hardships during nearly four years of imprisonment, and at Camp Security they were given many freedoms. They could work \u2014 gets jobs or run their own cottage industries \u2014 travel freely within 10 miles of the camp, and even live with their families at Camp Indulgence. It was the newer prisoners, particularly those captured after Cornwallis\u2019 defeat at Yorktown in October of 1781, who were confined to Camp Security and closely guarded. Once the archaeological team identifies the location of one of the camps, they can figure out where the other one is. </p>\n<p>For more about the history of Camp Security, check out local historian June Lloyd\u2019s fantastic <a href=\"http://www.yorkblog.com/universal/category/camp-security/\" target=\"_blank\">York Blog</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Camp Security saved, excavations begin\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32052\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32052#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32014\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32014\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Two Mayan cities found in Yucatan jungle\">Two Mayan cities found in Yucatan jungle</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, August 25th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preliminary-3D-model-of-Lagunit.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32044\" height=\"124\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preliminary-3D-model-of-Lagunit-150x124.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preliminary-3D-model-of-Lagunit-150x124.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preliminary-3D-model-of-Lagunit-200x166.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preliminary-3D-model-of-Lagunit-430x358.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preliminary-3D-model-of-Lagunit.jpg 969w\" title=\"Preliminary 3D model of Lagunita\" width=\"150\"/></a>Archaeologists have <a href=\"http://www.zrc-sazu.si/en/novice/two-ancient-maya-cities-discovered-in-the-jungle-of-southeastern-mexico\" target=\"_blank\">discovered two lost Mayan cities</a> in the jungle of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve on the southeastern tip of Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n peninsula.

He never published his drawings nor noted the location of the find, but his sketches are kept in Harvard University\u2019s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and Maya scholar Karl Herbert Mayer made them available to Sprajc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lagunita-stela-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32039\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 75px) 100vw, 75px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lagunita-stela-2-75x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lagunita-stela-2-75x150.jpg 75w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lagunita-stela-2-150x300.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lagunita-stela-2-400x800.jpg 400w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lagunita-stela-2.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Lagunita stela 2\" width=\"75\"/></a>It was that dramatic fa\u00e7ade that identified the site as Euw\u2019s Lagunita. Its open mouth represents the entrance to the underworld and the creature represents a Maya fertility deity. Other structures were found: a Maya ball game court, a pyramid 65 feet high, massive palaces arranged around four plazas, three altars, 10 trails connecting the buildings and altars, and 10 stelae. There are inscriptions on the altars and stelae, and a key section of stela two has already been translated by Octavio Esparza Olguin, an epigrapher from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. For our convenience, it\u2019s a precise date \u2014 November 29th, 711 A.D. \u2014 and a signature of the \u201clord of 4 k\u2019atuns\u201d (a k\u2019atun is a 20-year calendar cycle). Olguin notes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cTo judge by both architectural volumes and monuments with inscriptions, Lagunita must have been the seat of a relatively powerful polity, though the nature of its relationship with the larger Chact\u00fan, lying some 10 km to the north, remains unclear.\u201d The importance of Lagunita is further attested by the great density of residential mounds, terraces, albarradas (low dry walls) and other settlement remains in the surrounding area.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamchen-chultun.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32015\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamchen-chultun-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamchen-chultun-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamchen-chultun-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamchen-chultun-430x290.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamchen-chultun.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Tamch\u00e9n chultun\" width=\"150\"/></a>The second site, Tamch\u00e9n, has much in common with its neighbor four miles to the southeast. It too has large buildings arranged around plazas, a pyramid temple, a courtyard with three temples on each side, altars and stelae. It\u2019s significantly older, however, dating to the Late Preclassic (300 B.C. \u2013 250 A.D.). It also has another unusual feature: more than 30 chultuns, underground wells built to collect rainwater. Chultuns are common in Maya cities, but the number at Tamch\u00e9n is far greater than have been discovered anywhere else, and they are remarkably deep as well, some approaching 45 feet in depth. We can\u2019t know if this proliferation of chultuns is unique to Tamch\u00e9n or if other Maya cities in the region have similar structures until the area is more fully explored.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamch\u00e9n-Structure-1-north-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32041\" height=\"92\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamch\u00e9n-Structure-1-north-side-150x92.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamch\u00e9n-Structure-1-north-side-150x92.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamch\u00e9n-Structure-1-north-side-200x123.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamch\u00e9n-Structure-1-north-side-430x265.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tamch\u00e9n-Structure-1-north-side.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Tamch\u00e9n Structure 1 north side\" width=\"150\"/></a>There are many intriguing aspects to these cities that may open a new window into Maya history.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The zoomorphic fa\u00e7ade at Lagunita does not come as a surprise, considering that Bec\u00e1n, the largest site in the R\u00edo Bec zone, is only 15 km away. What has not been expected, however, is the presence of so many pyramid temples and monuments with inscriptions, which are rare in the R\u00edo Bec regi\u00f3n. Both Tamch\u00e9n and Lagunita appear to have been largely abandoned around A.D. 1000, sharing the fate of other lowland Maya polities, but a few stelae were modified some time after they had been originally erected, and Postclassic offerings were found at others. These facts obviously reflect continuities and ruptures in cultural traditions, but their significance for understanding political geography and history of the region is yet to be explained.</p>\n<p>Particularly interesting are various elements that have not been known elsewhere in the Maya area. Two altars of Lagunita have a curious nail-head shape. The third one is rectangular and has a series of Ajaw glyphs on its sides, with coefficients evidently referring to successive k\u2019atun (20-year period) endings; such records are common in codices, but not on stone monuments. Whereas hieroglyphic texts normally appear in an even number of columns, the inscription on Stela 2 of Lagunita has three, and the Long Count date is incomplete.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Two Mayan cities found in Yucatan jungle\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32014\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32014#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32024\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32024\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Action Comics #1 shatters record at auction\">Action Comics #1 shatters record at auction</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, August 24th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Action1_Cover.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32030\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Action1_Cover-200x267.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Action1_Cover-200x267.png 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Action1_Cover-112x150.png 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Action1_Cover-430x574.png 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Action1_Cover.png 748w\" title=\"Cover of Action Comics #1, CGC 9.0 with White pages\" width=\"200\"/></a>A copy of Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman which revolutionized the industry, in almost perfect condition has <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/Action-Comics-1-June-1938-Supermans-Debut-CGC-9-0-Perfect-White-Pages-/311050328393\" target=\"_blank\">sold on eBay for $3,207,852</a>, shattering the previous record price of $2.16 million set in 2011 by Nicholas Cage\u2019s famously purloined copy.

That\u2019s the result of <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/The-birth-of-Impressionism-calculated-to-the-nearest-minute/33412\" target=\"_blank\">calculations done by Texas State University astrophysicist Donald Olson</a> on the work by Claude Monet that gave the movement its name. Monet called the painting, the harbour of Le Havre as seen through his hotel window, <em>Impression, soleil levant</em> (<em>Impression, Sunrise</em>) because it captured a fleeting moment and thus couldn\u2019t really be called a view. He came up with the title a year and a half after he painted the scene when it went on public display April 15th, 1874, at the first exhibition of works that would within days become known as Impressionist at the Paris studio of the photographer Nadar. It had to have a title for the exhibition catalogue.</p>\n<p>Thirty artists, among them Renoir, Pissarro, C\u00e9zanne, Degas, Sisley and Boudin, put their work on display at Nadar\u2019s studio. All of them had been soundly and repeatedly rejected by the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts who insisted on traditional realism with invisible brushstrokes and muted colors for their prestigious Salon de Paris art shows. By order of Napoleon III (who was bowing to public clamor, not indulging a personal preference), they had gotten a chance to show their works in the Salon des Refus\u00e9s, the Salon of the Refused, in 1863, but even though the Refus\u00e9s saw far more traffic than the jury-selected works in the Salon de Paris, future petitions requesting new Refus\u00e9s shows were, well, refused.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atelier_Nadar_35BoulevardDesCapucines_1860_Nadar.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32011\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atelier_Nadar_35BoulevardDesCapucines_1860_Nadar-119x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atelier_Nadar_35BoulevardDesCapucines_1860_Nadar-119x150.jpg 119w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atelier_Nadar_35BoulevardDesCapucines_1860_Nadar-200x251.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Atelier_Nadar_35BoulevardDesCapucines_1860_Nadar-430x541.jpg 430w\" title=\"Nadar's studio at 35 Boulevard des Capucines, 1860\" width=\"119\"/></a>Finally the denied artists founded an anonymous collective and arranged for an independent show. They rented Nadar\u2019s old studio (he had just moved to new digs) on the first floor (European first floor, that is, the storey above the ground floor shops) of a building at 35 Boulevard des Capucines and put 163 of their works on display two weeks before that year\u2019s Salon de Paris opened.</p>\n<p>Ten days later, on April 25th, 1874, the exhibition was reviewed by artist, playwright, journalist and critic Louis Leroy in the satirical newspaper <em>Le Charivari</em>. Entitled <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Exhibition_of_the_Impressionists\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Exhibition of the Impressionists</em></a>, the review used Monet\u2019s term for his landscape of Le Havre to deride the weirdly blurry, poorly drawn, sloppy \u201cpalette-scrapings \u2026 on a dirty canvas\u201d that so obnoxiously rejected the traditional forms of the great masters.</p>\n<p>Leroy\u2019s use of Monet\u2019s term stuck, and the movement became known as Impressionism. As for the canvas that launched the label, <em>Impression, soleil levant</em> was purchased in May of 1874 by collector Ernest Hosched\u00e9s. He sold it four years later to Dr. George Bellio for a quarter of what he had paid. Bellio left it his daughter Victorine. On September 1st, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, Victorine transferred the work to the <a href=\"http://www.marmottan.fr/uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Mus\u00e9e Marmottan in Paris</a>, which at that time had no Impressionist paintings in its collection, due to \u201crisk of war.\u201d Within days it was evacuated to the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord along with the <em>Mona Lisa</em>, <em>Venus de Milo</em> and other masterpieces from the Louvre.</p>\n<p>In May of 1940, with German forces advancing inexorably into France, Victorine donated the painting to the museum. <em>Impression, soleil levant</em> remained in hiding in Chambord for the duration of the war. For nearly two decades after the donation, the painting appeared in the museum\u2019s inventories as <em>Impression, soleil couchant</em> (<em>Impression, Sunset</em>) and even though Monet had dated it 72 next to his signature, not much was known about him that year and there was dispute about whether he was actually in Le Havre in 1873. </p>\n<p>The museum, now the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, to celebrate its 80th anniversary and the 140th anniversary of the seminal exhibition of the painting that named one of art\u2019s most influential and revolutionary movements, enlisted the aid of Donald Olson to answer some of the questions about Monet\u2019s piece.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Le-Havre-southeast.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32006\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Le-Havre-southeast-200x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Le-Havre-southeast-200x128.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Le-Havre-southeast-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Le-Havre-southeast-430x276.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Le-Havre-southeast.jpg 841w\" title=\"Postcard of Le Havre, southeast view\" width=\"200\"/></a>He has pinpointed a particular third-floor bedroom with a balcony in the Hotel d\u2019Amiraut\u00e9 au Havre, at 45 Grand Quai. Monet would have looked across the outer harbour, facing towards the Quai Courbe, to the southeast. </p>\n<p>[\u2026] Olson demonstrates that because of the sun\u2019s position towards the east it must have been rising. He also calculated that the sun rises in the position shown in the Monet painting twice each year, in mid-November and late-January. The sun is depicted two to three degrees above the horizon, which corresponds to 20 to 30 minutes after sunrise.</p>\n<p>Olson then looked at the level of the sea, since large ships can only pass in or out of the outer harbour for three to four hours at high tide. Taking the sun\u2019s position, plus the high tide, this narrowed down the possibilities to 19 dates in 1872-73.</p>\n<p>The next stage of the puzzle was to examine weather reports\u2014to exclude days when cloud would have obscured the sun and to include only days when there was fog. This further winnowed the dates to six: 21 and 22 January 1872, 13 and 15 November 1872 and 25 and 26 January 1873. </p>\n<p>Olson then focussed on the plumes of smoke on the left side of the painting, which rise into the sky towards the right. Meteorological reports suggest that this wind direction would have occurred on only two of the six dates, on 13 November 1872 and 25 January 1873.</p>\n<p>The final factor is the research of G\u00e9raldine Lefebre, a curator at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne Andr\u00e9 Malraux in Le Havre. She is convinced that the year \u201c72\u201d inscribed by Monet on the painting is correct, since what we know of Monet\u2019s movements makes it very unlikely he was there the following January. This means that <em>Impression, Soleil Levant</em> depicts the view in La Havre on 13 November 1872, at 7.35am. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lAvant-port-du-Havre-effet-de-nuit.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32010\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lAvant-port-du-Havre-effet-de-nuit-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lAvant-port-du-Havre-effet-de-nuit-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lAvant-port-du-Havre-effet-de-nuit-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lAvant-port-du-Havre-effet-de-nuit-430x320.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lAvant-port-du-Havre-effet-de-nuit.jpg 1320w\" title='\"Le Port du Havre, Effet de Nuit\" by Claude Monet, 1872' width=\"200\"/></a><em>Impression, soleil levant</em> will be the centerpiece of an exhibit that runs from September 18th, 2014, to January 18th, 2015.

The young men wanted the chance to find something, so to keep them out of his hair their father shooed them away from his excavation site to go dig in an area where he thought they might unearth an innocuous fragment or two. By the end of the day they had unearthed a bone so big the two of them couldn\u2019t carry it. Dad shifted his attention to his sons\u2019 find and excavated almost the entire 56-foot-long skeleton of the dinosaur.</p>\n<p>Because it was found on private land, there were no legal barriers to the fossil\u2019s export and sale. After the bones were conserved in the US, they were sent to the Netherlands for assembly and then to London for auction.

Darwin wanted to compare species from different locations, to examine the differences and commonalities of related species. He had met Johan Georg Forchhammer, Professor of Mineralogy and Geology at the University of Copenhagen, in Birmingham, and he offered to send Darwin some barnacle fossils from the Copenhagen Geological Museum. He also connected Darwin to his friend Japetus Steenstrup, Professor of Zoology at the University of Copenhagen, who had his own collection of barnacles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Japetus-Steenstrup-undated.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Japetus Steenstrup, undated\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31998\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Japetus-Steenstrup-undated-97x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Japetus-Steenstrup-undated-97x150.jpg 97w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Japetus-Steenstrup-undated-194x300.jpg 194w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Japetus-Steenstrup-undated-430x662.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Japetus-Steenstrup-undated.jpg 1298w\" title=\"Japetus Steenstrup, undated\" width=\"97\"/></a>Steenstrup contributed some barnacle fossils from his collection to a parcel Forchhammer sent Darwin in November of 1849. When Darwin received them two months later \u2014 he had been so worried about his delayed barnacles that he put an ad in the paper offering a reward for their return \u2014  he wrote Steenstrup an <a href=\"https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/entry-1297\" target=\"_blank\">abjectly delighted thank you note</a> on January 25, 1850:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Sir</p>\n<p>I am quite delighted in at last being able to tell you that your Box with the fossil cirripedes has arrived quite safely this morning.\u2014 It is a great load off my mind.\u2014 Not one specimen is injured, except, perhaps, some of the valves of your Anat(?) cret\u00e6.\u2014 It is a noble collection, &amp; I feel most grateful to you for having entrusted them to me.\u2014 I have now a great many collections in this house, so that I have good means of comparison.\u2014 Most of your species, as far as a hasty first glance tells, are different from the British. Your P. medius. is the same as P. sulcatus of Sowerby; &amp; instead of being a Pollicipes, it is a Scalpellum, though these genera differ much too little.\u2014 The P. elegans I have (unnamed) from our Chalk.\u2014 I will do my best in comparing all the specimens which I have now together; but I am not hopeful of producing good results: I much dislike giving specific names to each separate valve, &amp; thereby almost certainly making three or four nominal species for each true species.\u2014</p>\n<p>I am extremely pleased to see the Alepas. The cause of the great delay was in Prof. Forchhammer having sent the box within another to a dealer in minerals, who uncourteously did not take the trouble to inform me. Please to tell Prof. Forchammer that owing to his note I have got the Box, &amp; pray give him, &amp; accept yourself my most cordial thanks.\u2014 I will take great care of your specimens.\u2014 I hope now that this Box has arrived safely, that you will add to your already great kindness, &amp; send me the northern species alluded to in your former letter.\u2014</p>\n<p>I will hereafter write again to you.\u2014</p>\n<p>Pray believe me | my dear Sir | Yours most gratefully | C.

I hope it will be up and running again soon because it\u2019s awesome.</p>\n<p>EDIT: And it\u2019s back! I\u2019ve replaced the cached links with live ones.

The barnacle study was an important part of Darwin\u2019s research, so if they could be found they would have a great story to tell. Strager was reading through Steenstrup\u2019s papers in the museum archives looking for clues that might identify the specific fossils Darwin examined when she found something even better: an 1854 letter from Darwin in which he mentioned a list of 77 species of barnacles he had sent to Steenstrup as a thank you gift for his help.</p>\n<p>The list itself was not in the letter. More searching through Steenstrup\u2019s papers ensued and lo and behold, the list was found. It was hard to read, however, and took some time to decipher. Once that was done, Strager had to dig through storage looking for the 77 specimens. They weren\u2019t kept together because in 1854 there was no reason for it. <em>On the Origin of Species</em> was five years away. The barnacles were seen as specimens like any other, not the curated collection of a great pioneering scientist. They were spread throughout the museum collection according to their species.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Darwin-specimens-gift.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Darwin's barnacle specimens and list\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-31987\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Darwin-specimens-gift-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Darwin-specimens-gift-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Darwin-specimens-gift-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Darwin-specimens-gift-430x324.jpg 430w\" title=\"Darwin's barnacle specimens and list\" width=\"200\"/></a>Strager finally located 55 of Darwin\u2019s barnacles. Most of the missing 22 are samples from a single genus. They were probably loaned to another institution or scientist who was researching that specific genus at some point over the past 160 years and never returned. Somebody somewhere may have 22 barnacle specimens collected by Charles Darwin and have no idea of their illustrious history.</p>\n<p>Not that anyone\u2019s complaining. The collection of 55 specimens, with original labels and an inventory list in Darwin\u2019s hand, is an exceptional find.

It was widely known that the situation was dire, that all the great herds were gone, indiscriminately slaughtered by hunters, that from the 10-15 million that once roamed the range, maybe a few thousand individuals remained in the more inaccessible regions of the northern range. Hornaday\u2019s research found that extinction loomed even closer, that instead of thousands there were probably fewer than 300 head of wild bison left in the entire United States.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"William Temple Hornaday\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32132\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday-110x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday-110x150.jpg 110w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday-200x271.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday-430x583.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/William-Temple-Hornaday.jpg 566w\" title=\"William Temple Hornaday\" width=\"110\"/></a>Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, concerned that the National Museum only had a handful of ratty skins, a skeleton, a couple of heads and assorted bones in its collection, agreed to send Hornaday on a mission to secure enough specimens before there were none left to be had. Hornaday\u2019s brief was to kill between 80 and 100 bison, possibly a third of the entire surviving population, to ensure the Smithsonian, smaller museums and future museums not yet in existence would have specimens to display and study when the bison were extinct.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Partially completed armature for taxidermy bison, drawing from Hornaday's 1891 book &quot;Taxidermy and Zoological Collecting&quot;\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32131\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Partially-completed-armature-for-taxidermy-bison-Taxidermy-and-Zoological-Collecting-1891.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Partially completed armature for taxidermy bison, drawing from Hornaday's 1891 book &quot;Taxidermy and Zoological Collecting&quot;\" width=\"200\"/></a>This is a passage from <a href=\"http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/letter-dated-december-21-1886-professor-spencer-f-baird-secretary-smithsoni\" target=\"_blank\">a letter Hornaday wrote to Baird</a> in December of 1886 reporting on the team\u2019s success:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I consider that we have been extremely lucky in finding a sufficient number of buffalo where it was supposed by people generally that none existed. Our \u201coutfit\u201d has been pronounced by old buffalo hunters \u201cThe luckiest outfit that ever hunted buffalo in Montana,\u201d and the opinion is quite generally held that our \u201chaul\u201d of specimens could not be equaled again in Montana by anybody, no matter what their resources for the reason that the buffalo are not there. We killed very nearly all we saw and I am confident there are not over thirty-head remaining in Montana, all told. By this time next year the cowboys will have destroyed about all of this remnant. We got in our Exploration just in the nick of time, \u2014 the last day in the evening, so to speak, and I do not hesitate to say that I am really rejoiced over the fact that we have been successful in securing the specimens we needed so urgently.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I understand his perspective \u2014 hunters would have killed those bison anyway, so this way they were preserved for posterity at least \u2014 but my modern sensibilities can\u2019t help but find the impulse to conserve by destruction contradictory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Hornaday with bison calf Sandy at Smithsonian, 1886\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32120\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 114px) 100vw, 114px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886-114x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886-114x150.jpg 114w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886-200x262.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886-430x563.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hornaday-with-Baby-Bison-at-Smithsonian-1886.jpg 586w\" title=\"Hornaday with bison calf Sandy at Smithsonian, 1886\" width=\"114\"/></a>William Temple Hornaday didn\u2019t stop there, however. He became a powerful advocate for the wild bison, realizing he had to at least try to prevent the total annihilation of the noble beast. He actually brought back a live bison, a calf he named Sandy, from his 1886 hunt, but Sandy only lived a few months. Hornaday got the idea for a national zoo and wrote to Baird proposing it. Baird was very ill and would soon pass away, so his assistant Professor George Brown Goode, appointed acting secretary until a permanent replacement could be found, picked up the mantle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Taxidermy bison group by William Hornaday in the Smithsonian, 1887\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32129\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887-200x160.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887-430x344.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Taxidermy-bison-group-by-William-Hornaday-1887.jpg 958w\" title=\"Taxidermy bison group by William Hornaday in the Smithsonian, 1887\" width=\"150\"/></a>In the fall of 1887, Goode created the Department of Living Animals of the National Museum and made Hornaday its curator. Their plan was to test the public\u2019s interest in a zoo in the capital. If people were into the test run, getting the necessary legislation passed for a full-on national zoo would be much more likely. Hornaday went off on another field trip to assemble some actual living animals and came back with 15 American natives: one cinnamon bear, one white-tailed deer, one Columbia black-tailed deer, five prairie dogs, a Cross fox, a mule deer, two badgers, a red fox, and two spotted lynx. He set up a rather rickety group of paddocks and sheds on the National Mall and <em>Field of Dreams</em>-like, people came.</p>\n<p>The Smithsonian\u2019s mini-zoo was an instant success. Crowds flocked to see the live animals, and donors from President Grover Cleveland (he donated a golden eagle that had been given to him as a Christmas gift) to wealthy collectors quickly increased the complement of animals. In December of 1887, <a href=\"http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/letter-dated-december-2-1887-professor-george-brown-goode-director-national\" target=\"_blank\">Hornaday wrote to Goode</a> proposing that they obtain a nucleus of a bison herd to breed them in captivity without diluting the genes by mating them with domestic cattle (something that had been happening on ranches for years) or damaging the line by in-breeding.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In view of the fact that thus far this government has done nothing to preserve alive any specimens of the American Bison, the most striking and conspicuous species on this continent, I have the honor to propose that the Smithsonian Institution, or the National Museum, one or both, take immediate steps to procure either by gift or purchase, as may be necessary, the nucleus of a herd of live buffaloes. Having been spared the misfortune, thanks to the Smithsonian Institution, of being left without a series of skins and skeletons of the species suitable for the wants of the National Museum, it now seems necessary for us to assume the responsibility of forming and preserving a herd of live buffaloes which may, in a small measure, atone for the national disgrace that attaches to the heartless and senseless extermination of the species in a wild state.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To purchase the nucleus herd would be expensive, and space was going to be an issue sooner rather than later. Hornaday\u2019s dream would become closer to reality shortly when frontier surgeon and Indian Agent Dr. Valentine Trant McGillycuddy donated a breeding pair of bison and two of their calves (one male, one female). That wasn\u2019t enough for a breeding program, but it was a great start.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Group-of-bison-standing-in-paddock-near-first-National-Zoological-Park-Building-a-house-for-the-bison-and-elk.-An-elk-is-visible-in-his-paddock-in-the-distance-by-C.-M.-Bell-1891.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Group of bison standing in paddock near first National Zoological Park Building, a house for the bison and elk.

Bell 1891\" width=\"150\"/></a>By the spring of 1888, the Department of Living Animals of the National Museum had 172 animals in its charge. The paddocks and shanties around the Smithsonian Castle could not handle the burgeoning population, and Hornaday turned his considerable energies to Congress. A Senate bill was drafted in May of 1888 proposing that $200,000 be spent buying 166 acres of Rock Creek Park for a national zoo. Hornaday testified before the House Appropriations Committee, and although his testimony was well received, a few squeaky wheels had a problem with the proposed bill. Democrat Thomas Stockdale of Mississippi told the press that a national zoo \u201cwould be of no use to the poor who come to Washington to visit the last of the buffaloes,\u201d and the idea \u201cdoes not sound like republicanism. It echoes like royalty.\u201d The bill was defeated soundly with 36 votes in favor, 56 against and one abstention.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"H.R. 11810, bill establishing national zoo\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32125\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 104px) 100vw, 104px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2-104x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2-104x150.jpg 104w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2-200x287.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H.R.-11810-bill-establishing-national-zoo2-430x618.jpg 430w\" title=\"H.R. 11810, bill establishing national zoo\" width=\"104\"/></a>So the Smithsonian\u2019s Mall zoo had to keep making do for the foreseeable future. In December of 1888, they were forced to decline a most wonderful offer from Buffalo Bill Cody of 18 bison, the third largest private collection in the world, because they didn\u2019t have the room for them. The tragic loss proved to be a public relations victory for the zoo since everyone was bummed at the missed opportunity. Three months later, on March 2, 1889, Grover Cleveland signed the bill establishing a National Zoo which had passed the House by a vote of 131 to 98.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bison standing in front of the Buffalo Barn at the National Zoo, ca. 1895\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32122\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895-200x177.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895-430x382.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Bison-standing-in-front-of-the-Buffalo-Barn-at-the-National-Zoological-Park-c.-1895.jpg 864w\" title=\"Bison standing in front of the Buffalo Barn at the National Zoo, ca. 1895\" width=\"150\"/></a>That wasn\u2019t the end of the struggle. Hornaday had to fight for his vision against his new boss, Samuel Pierpont Langley, and for funding with Congress. He secured the funding, but he couldn\u2019t persuade Langley to go along with his plans for how the zoo should be designed and operated (Hornaday wanted naturalistic enclosures that flowed with the landscape, two entrances, full public access; Langley did not). Hornaday resigned later in 1889 but kept on fighting for the conservation of the bison. His passionate advocacy took published form in his highly influential 1889 book <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17748/17748-h/17748-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Extermination of the American Bison</em></a>.

The New York Zoological Society appointed him creator and director of what would become the Bronx Zoo. He remained its director until 1926. He continued to lobby tirelessly for the conservation of the American bison and for other endangered species. Today there are 30,000 bison in conservation herds in national parks, zoos and protected areas.

Hornaday\u2019s research found that extinction loomed even closer, that instead of thousands there were probably fewer than 300 head of wild bison left in the entire United States. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, concerned that the National Museum only had a handful of ratty skins, a skeleton, a couple of heads and assorted bones in its collection, agreed to send Hornaday on a mission to secure enough specimens before there were none left to be had. Hornaday\u2019s brief was to kill between 80 and 100 bison, possibly a third of the entire surviving population, to ensure the Smithsonian, smaller museums and future museums not yet in existence would have specimens to display and study when the bison were extinct. This is a passage from a letter Hornaday wrote to Baird in December of 1886 reporting on the team\u2019s success: I consider that we have been extremely lucky in finding a sufficient number of buffalo where it was supposed by people generally that none existed. Our \u201coutfit\u201d has been pronounced by old buffalo hunters \u201cThe luckiest outfit that ever hunted buffalo in Montana,\u201d and the opinion is quite generally held that our \u201chaul\u201d of specimens could not be equaled again in Montana by anybody, no matter what their resources for the reason that the buffalo are not there. We killed very nearly all we saw and I am confident there are not over thirty-head remaining in Montana, all told. By this time next year the cowboys will have destroyed about all of this remnant. We got in our Exploration just in the nick of time, \u2014 the last day in the evening, so to speak, and I do not hesitate to say that I am really rejoiced over the fact that we have been successful in securing the specimens we needed so urgently. I understand his perspective \u2014 hunters would have killed those bison anyway, so this way they were preserved for posterity at least \u2014 but my modern sensibilities can\u2019t help but find the impulse to conserve by destruction contradictory. William Temple Hornaday didn\u2019t stop there, however. He became a powerful advocate for the wild bison, realizing he had to at least try to prevent the total annihilation of the noble beast. He actually brought back a live bison, a calf he named Sandy, from his 1886 hunt, but Sandy only lived a few months. Hornaday got the idea for a national zoo and wrote to Baird proposing it. Baird was very ill and would soon pass away, so his assistant Professor George Brown Goode, appointed acting secretary until a permanent replacement could be found, picked up the mantle. In the fall of 1887, Goode created the Department of Living Animals of the National Museum and made Hornaday its curator. Their plan was to test the public\u2019s interest in a zoo in the capital. If people were into the test run, getting the necessary legislation passed for a full-on national zoo would be much more likely. Hornaday went off on another field trip to assemble some actual living animals and came back with 15 American natives: one cinnamon bear, one white-tailed deer, one Columbia black-tailed deer, five prairie dogs, a Cross fox, a mule deer, two badgers, a red fox, and two spotted lynx. He set up a rather rickety group of paddocks and sheds on the National Mall and Field of Dreams-like, people came. The Smithsonian\u2019s mini-zoo was an instant success. Crowds flocked to see the live animals, and donors from President Grover Cleveland (he donated a golden eagle that had been given to him as a Christmas gift) to wealthy collectors quickly increased the complement of animals. In December of 1887, Hornaday wrote to Goode proposing that they obtain a nucleus of a bison herd to breed them in captivity without diluting the genes by mating them with domestic cattle (something that had been happening on ranches for years) or damaging the line by in-breeding. In view of the fact that thus far this government has done nothing to preserve alive any specimens of the American Bison, the most striking and conspicuous species on this continent, I have the honor to propose that the Smithsonian Institution, or the National Museum, one or both, take immediate steps to procure either by gift or purchase, as may be necessary, the nucleus of a herd of live buffaloes. Having been spared the misfortune, thanks to the Smithsonian Institution, of being left without a series of skins and skeletons of the species suitable for the wants of the National Museum, it now seems necessary for us to assume the responsibility of forming and preserving a herd of live buffaloes which may, in a small measure, atone for the national disgrace that attaches to the heartless and senseless extermination of the species in a wild state. To purchase the nucleus herd would be expensive, and space was going to be an issue sooner rather than later. Hornaday\u2019s dream would become closer to reality shortly when frontier surgeon and Indian Agent Dr. Valentine Trant McGillycuddy donated a breeding pair of bison and two of their calves (one male, one female). That wasn\u2019t enough for a breeding program, but it was a great start. By the spring of 1888, the Department of Living Animals of the National Museum had 172 animals in its charge. The paddocks and shanties around the Smithsonian Castle could not handle the burgeoning population, and Hornaday turned his considerable energies to Congress. A Senate bill was drafted in May of 1888 proposing that $200,000 be spent buying 166 acres of Rock Creek Park for a national zoo. Hornaday testified before the House Appropriations Committee, and although his testimony was well received, a few squeaky wheels had a problem with the proposed bill. Democrat Thomas Stockdale of Mississippi told the press that a national zoo \u201cwould be of no use to the poor who come to Washington to visit the last of the buffaloes,\u201d and the idea \u201cdoes not sound like republicanism. It echoes like royalty.\u201d The bill was defeated soundly with 36 votes in favor, 56 against and one abstention. So the Smithsonian\u2019s Mall zoo had to keep making do for the foreseeable future. In December of 1888, they were forced to decline a most wonderful offer from Buffalo Bill Cody of 18 bison, the third largest private collection in the world, because they didn\u2019t have the room for them. The tragic loss proved to be a public relations victory for the zoo since everyone was bummed at the missed opportunity. Three months later, on March 2, 1889, Grover Cleveland signed the bill establishing a National Zoo which had passed the House by a vote of 131 to 98. That wasn\u2019t the end of the struggle. Hornaday had to fight for his vision against his new boss, Samuel Pierpont Langley, and for funding with Congress. He secured the funding, but he couldn\u2019t persuade Langley to go along with his plans for how the zoo should be designed and operated (Hornaday wanted naturalistic enclosures that flowed with the landscape, two entrances, full public access; Langley did not). Hornaday resigned later in 1889 but kept on fighting for the conservation of the bison. His passionate advocacy took published form in his highly influential 1889 book The Extermination of the American Bison. The National Zoo opened to the public on April 30th, 1891. Five years later, William Temple Hornaday got another chance to build a zoo from the ground up. The New York Zoological Society appointed him creator and director of what would become the Bronx Zoo. He remained its director until 1926. He continued to lobby tirelessly for the conservation of the American bison and for other endangered species. Today there are 30,000 bison in conservation herds in national parks, zoos and protected areas. There are half a million in commercial herds. Now, 125 years after their impending extinction drove the creation of a national zoo, American bison are back at the National Zoo.

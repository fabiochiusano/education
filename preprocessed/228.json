href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6951978/\"><i>The Good Place</i> episode \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</a> won one of science fiction\u2019s most prestigious awards, the Hugo, in the category of best dramatic presentation, short form, I celebrated. I celebrated not because I loved the episode (in fact, I had so far only seen a couple of The Good Place\u2019s earlier episodes) but because, as a philosophy professor aiming to build bridges between academic philosophy and popular science fiction, the awarding of a Hugo to a show starring a professor of philosophy discussing a famous philosophical problem seemed to confirm that science fiction fans see some of the same synergies I see between science fiction and philosophy.<p>\n\nI do think the synergies are there and that the fans see and value them \u2013 as also revealed by the enduring popularity of The Matrix, and by West World, and Her, and Black Mirror, among others \u2013 but \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d, considered as a free-standing episode, fumbles the job. (Below, I will suggest a twist by which The Good Place could redeem itself in later episodes.)<p>\n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to be fussy when maybe I should just cheer and praise. And I\u2019m going to take the episode more philosophically seriously than maybe I should, treating it as not just light humor. But taking good science fiction philosophically seriously is important to me \u2013 and that means engaging critically. So here we go.<p>\n<i>The Philosophical Trolley Problem</i><p>\n\nThe trolley problem \u2013 the classic academic philosophy version of the trolley problem \u2013 concerns a pair of scenarios.<p>\n\nIn one scenario, the Switch case, you are standing beside a railroad track watching a runaway railcar (or \u201ctrolley\u201d) headed toward five people it will surely kill if you do nothing. You are standing by a switch, however, and you can flip the switch to divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. Unfortunately, there is one person on the side track who will be killed if you divert the trolley. Question: Should you flip the switch?<p>\n\nIn another scenario, the Push case, you are standing on a footbridge when you see the runaway railcar headed toward the five people. In this case, there is no switch. You do, however, happen to be standing beside a hiker with a heavy backpack, who you could push off the bridge into the path of the trolley, which will then grind to a halt on his body, killing him and saving the five. (You are too light to stop the trolley with your own body.) He is leaning over the railing, heedless of you, so you could just push him over. Question: Should you push the hiker?<p>\n\nThe interesting thing about these problems is that most people say it\u2019s okay to flip the switch in Switch but not okay to push the hiker in Push, despite the fact that in both cases you appear to be killing one person to save five. Is there really a meaningful difference between the cases? If so, what is it? Or are our ordinary intuitions about one or the other case wrong?<p>\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely puzzle, much, much debated in academic philosophy, often with intricate variations on the cases. (Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">one of my papers about it</a>.)<p>\n<i>The Problem with \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\n\u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d episode nicely sets up some basic trolley scenarios, adding also a medical case of killing one to save five (an involuntary organ donor). The philosophy professor character, Chidi, is teaching the material to the other characters.<p>\n\nSpoilers coming.<p>\n\nThe episode stumbles by trying to do two conflicting things.<p>\n\nFirst, it seizes the trope of the philosophy professor who can\u2019t put his theories into practice. The demon Michael sets up a simulated trolley, headed toward five victims, with Chidi at the helm. Chidi is called on to make a fast decision. He hesitates, agonizing, and crashes into the five. Micheal reruns the scenario with several variations, and it\u2019s clear that Chidi, faced with a practical decision requiring swift action, can\u2019t actually figure out what\u2019s best. (However, Chidi is clear that he wouldn\u2019t cut up a healthy patient in an involuntary organ donor case.)<p>\n\nSecond, incompatibly, the episode wants to affirm Chidi\u2019s moral expertise. Michael, the demon who enjoys torturing humans, can\u2019t seem to take Chidi\u2019s philosophy lessons seriously, despite Chidi\u2019s great knowledge of ethics. Michael tries to win Chidi\u2019s favor by giving him a previously unseen notebook of Kant\u2019s, but Chidi, with integrity that I suppose the viewer is expected to find admirable, casts the notebook aside, seeing it as a bribe. What Chidi really wants is for Michael to recognize his moral expertise. At the climax of the episode, Michael seems to do just this, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.</blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from within the episode whether we are supposed to regard Michael as sincere. Maybe not. Regardless, the viewer is invited to think that it\u2019s what Michael should say, what his attitude should be \u2013 and Chidi accepts the apology.<p>\n\nBut this resolution hardly fits with Chidi\u2019s failure in actual ethical decision making in the moment (a vice he also reveals in other episodes). Chidi has abstract, theoretical knowledge about ethical quandaries such as the trolley problem, and he is in some ways the most morally admirable of the lead characters, but his failure in vividly simulated trolley cases casts his practical ethical expertise into doubt. Nothing in the episode satisfactorily resolves that practical challenge to Chidi\u2019s expertise, pro or con.<p>\n<i>Ethical Expertise?</i><p>\n\nNow, as it happens, I am the world\u2019s leading expert on the ethical behavior of professional ethicists. (Yes, really. Admittedly, the <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">competition is limited</a>.)<p>\n\nThe one thing that shows most clearly from my and others\u2019 work on this topic, and which is anyway pretty evident if you spend much time around professional ethicists, is that ethicists, on average, behave more or less similarly to other people of similar social background \u2013 not especially better, not especially worse. From the fact that Chidi is a professor of ethics, nothing in particular follows about his moral behavior. Often, indeed, expertise in philosophical ethics appears to become expertise in constructing <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">post-hoc intellectual rationales for what you were inclined to do anyway</a>.<p>\n\nI hope you will agree with me about the following, concerning the philosophy of philosophy: Real ethical understanding is not a matter of what words you speak in classroom moments. It\u2019s a matter of what you choose and what you do habitually, regardless of whether you can tell your friends a handsome story about it, grounded in your knowledge of Kant. It\u2019s not clear that Chidi does have especially good ethical understanding in this practical sense. Moreover, to the extent Chidi does have some such practical ethical understanding, as a somewhat morally admirable person, it is not in virtue of his knowledge of Kant.<p>\n\nMichael should not be so deferential to Chidi\u2019s expertise, and especially he should not be deferential on the basis of Chidi\u2019s training as a philosopher. If, over the seasons, the characters improve morally, it is, or should be, because they learn from the practical situations they find themselves in, not because of Chidi\u2019s theoretical lessons.<p>\n<i>How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\nThus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics).<p>\n\nWhen the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.overthinkingit.com/2017/10/23/the-good-place-unlocked-season-2-episode-6-the-trolley-problem/\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Update, October 21, 2018:</i><p>\n\nWisecrack has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds\">terrific treatment of the philosophy of <i>The Good Place</i></a>, revealing that the show has a more nuanced view of the role of ethics lessons than one might infer from treating \"The Trolley Problem\" as a stand-alone work.

Did you say SUNGLASSES?!\"<p>\n\nSpeaking of hyperminds....<p>\n\nI want to distinguish two ways of being a group mind, since <strike>I know you care immensely about the cognitive architecture of group minds</strike> I'm a dork.  My thought is that the philosophical issues of group consciousness and personal identity play out differently in the two types of case.<p>\n<i>\nSynchronic:</i><p>\n\nExamples: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Star Trek's Borg</a> (mostly), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Justice\">Ann Leckie's ancillaries</a>, highly interconnected nations (<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">according to me</a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep\">Vernor Vinge's tines</a>.<p>\n\nSynchronic group minds are probably the default conception.  A bunch of independent, or semi-independent, or independent-enough entities remain in constant or constant-enough communication with each other.  Their communication is sufficiently rich or sufficiently well structured that it gives rise to group-level mental states in the whole.  In the most interesting case, the individual entities are distinct enough to have rich mental lives but also the group is well enough coordinated that it also, simultaneously, has a distinctive, rich mental life above and beyond that of its members.<p>\n<i>Diachronic:</i><p>\n\nExamples: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln_People\">David Brin's Kiln People</a>, <a href=\"https://socialecologies.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/linda-negata-the-bohr-maker/\">Linda Nagata's ghosts</a>, <a href=\"http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/meltwater/\">Benjamin Kinney's forks</a>.<p>\n\nIn a diachronic group mind, communication is relatively rare but high bandwidth and transformative.  Post-communication, the individuals inherit mental states from the others.  In the most interesting case, the inheritance process is very different from just listening credulously to someone's testimony; rather it's more like a direct transfer of memories, plans, and opinions, maybe even values or personality.  Imagine \"forking\" into three versions of yourself, going your separate ways for the day, and then at the end of the day merging back into a single individual, integrating the memories and plans of each, and averaging any general changes in value, opinion, or personality.  Tomorrow and every day thereafter, you will fork and merge in the same way.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mC2tLnP5OB0/W0addm2naSI/AAAAAAAAA70/oyiSxK9d9wI3tfnRi_HUWsUi21BMZ_i3QCLcBGAs/s1600/Cerberus-Blake.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"725\" data-original-width=\"1024\" height=\"227\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mC2tLnP5OB0/W0addm2naSI/AAAAAAAAA70/oyiSxK9d9wI3tfnRi_HUWsUi21BMZ_i3QCLcBGAs/s320/Cerberus-Blake.jpeg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[Cerberus might not be integrated enough to be a good example of a group mind, but I didn't want to attach another darn picture of the Borg.]<p>\n<i>Tradeoffs Between Group-Level and Individual-Level Personhood and Autonomy:</i><p>\n\nAs I have described it here, delay between information transfer episodes is the fundamental difference between these types of group minds: whether the minds are in constant or constant-enough communication, or whether instead they communicate only at long intervals.  Obviously, temporal distance admits of degree, but this difference in degree creates structural pressures.  If communication is infrequent, its effects have to be radical if it is to give rise to an entity sufficiently integrated to be worth calling a \"group mind\".  If every day group of friends meets to exchange information and plan the next day's activities, in the ordinary way people sometimes do this, I suppose that in some weak sense they have formed a group mind.  But they haven't done so in the radical science-fictional sense I'm imagining.  For example, if there were five friends who did this, there would still be exactly five <i>persons </i>-- entities with serious rights whose destruction would we worth calling murder.  For the emergence of something more metaphysically and morally interesting, the exchange has to be radical enough to challenge the boundaries of personal identity.<p>\n\nConversely, if communication is constant <i>and </i>its effects are radical, it's not clear that we have a group of individuals in any interesting sense: We might just have a single non-group entity that happens to be spatially scattered (as in my <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/05/martian-rabbit-superorganisms-yeah.html\">Martian Smartspiders</a>).<p>\n\nIn other words, to be a philosophically-interesting group entity there must be some sort of interestingly autonomous mentality both at the individual level and at the group level.  Massive transformative communication (as in diachronic merging of memories and values) radically reduces autonomy: If communication is both massively transformative and very frequent, there's no chance for interesting person-like autonomy at the individual level.  If communication is neither massively transformative nor very frequent, there's no chance for interesting person-like autonomy at the group level.<p>\n<i>Consciousness:</i><p>\n\nOur intuitive judgments about group-level consciousness are probably pretty crappy (as I've argued <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">here</a>).  But our general theories about consciousness as they apply to the group level are probably even crappier (as I've argued <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/07/tononis-exclusion-postulate-would-make.html\">here</a>).  At the same time, whether the group as a whole has a stream of conscious experience over and above the consciousness of its individual members seems like a very important question if we're interested in its mentality and whether it deserves moral status as a person.  So we're kind of stuck.  We'll have to guess.<p>\n\nPlausibly, in the diachronic case there is no stream of consciousness beyond that of the merging individuals.  When there's one body at night, there's one stream of consciousness (at most, if it's dreaming).  When there are three bodies off doing their thing, there are three streams of consciousness.  We might be able to create some problematic boundary cases during the merge, but maybe that's marginal enough to dismiss with a bit of hand waving.<p>\n\nThe synchronic case is, I think, more conceptually challenging with respect to consciousness.  If we allow that minimally interactive groups do not give rise to group level consciousness and we also allow that a fully informationally integrated but spatially distributed entity does give rise to consciousness, it seems that we can create a <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/slippery-slope-arguments-and-discretely.html\">slippery slope</a> from one case to the other by adding more integration and communication (for example <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/group-minds-on-ringworld.html\">here</a>).  At some point, if there is enough coherent behavior, self-representation, and information exchange at the group level, most standard functionalist views of consciousness (unless they accept an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nesting_principle\">anti-nesting principle</a>) should allow that each individual member of the group would have a stream of experience and also that there would be a further, different stream of experience at the group level. \n But it's a tricky question how much integration and information exchange, and with what kind of structural properties, is necessary for group-level consciousness to arise.<p>\n<i>Personhood:</i><p>\n\nOne interesting issue that arises is the extent to which an individual's <i>beliefs </i>about what counts as \"self-interest\" and \"death\" define the boundaries of their personhood.  Consider a diachronic case: You are walking back home after your day out and about town, with a wallet full of money and interesting new information about a job opportunity tomorrow, and you are about to merge back together with the two other entities you forked off from this morning.  Is this death?  Are \"you\" going to be gone after the merge, your memories absorbed into some entity who is not you (but who you might care about even more than you care about yourself)?  In walking back, are you magnanimously sacrificing your life to give your money and information to the entity who will exist tomorrow?  Would it be more in your self-interest to run away and blow your wad on something fun for this current body?  Or, instead, will it still be \"you\" tomorrow, post-merge, with that information and that money?  To some extent, in unclear cases of this sort, I think it might depend on how you think and feel about it: It's to some extent <i>up to you</i> whether to conceptualize the merging together as death or not.<p>\n\nA parallel issue might arise with synchronic groups, though my hunch is that it would play out differently.  Synchronic groups, as I'm imagining them, don't have identity-threatening splits and merges.  The individual members of synchronic groups would seem to have the same types of rights that otherwise similar individuals who aren't members of synchronic group minds would have -- rights depending on (for example, but it's not this simple) their capacity to suffer and think and choose as individuals.  They might choose, <i>as individuals</i>, to view the group welfare as much more important than their own welfare (as a soldier might choose to die for sake of country); but unless there's some real loss of autonomy or consciousness, this doesn't threaten their status as persons or redefine the boundaries of what counts as death.<p>\n<i>\nRelated:</i><p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/05/possible-architectures-of-group-minds.html\">Possible Architectures of Group Minds: Perception (May 4, 2016)</a><p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/possible-architectures-of-group-minds.html\">Possible Architectures of Group Minds: Memory</a> (Jun 14, 2016)<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/group-minds-on-ringworld.html\">Group Minds on Ringworld</a> (Oct 24, 2012)<p>\n<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious</a> (academic essay in <i>Philosophical Studies,</i> 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/03/our-moral-duties-to-monsters.html\">Our Moral Duties to Monsters</a> (Mar 8, 2014)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/08/choosing-to-be-that-fellow-back-then.html\">Choosing to Be That Fellow Back Then: Voluntarism about Personal Identity</a> (Aug 20, 2016).<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/two-ways-of-being-group-mind-synchronic.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-07-12T09:55:00-07:00\">9:55 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5922877562377500567\" onclick=\"\">9\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/USA%20consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">USA consciousness</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, January 18, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2285382327477492462\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/flying-free-of-deathbed-with.html\">Flying Free of the Deathbed, with Technological Help</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Today marks the third year since the death of my father, Kirkland Gable.  (Some memories of him <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/memories-of-my-father.html\">here</a>.)  I now better understand than I once did why the ancient Confucian tradition recommends three years' mourning for one's parents.  To my surprise -- since we had only been in contact about once a month before his death -- I find myself almost every day still thinking about his absence.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WkJaa2_oy0k/Wl-4-ASi_TI/AAAAAAAAAoU/8-QQpHqtyuYTq_DrsijJXokd0g18XkI7wCLcBGAs/s1600/William_Blake_-_Sconfitta_-_Frontispiece_to_The_Song_of_Los.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1229\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WkJaa2_oy0k/Wl-4-ASi_TI/AAAAAAAAAoU/8-QQpHqtyuYTq_DrsijJXokd0g18XkI7wCLcBGAs/s320/William_Blake_-_Sconfitta_-_Frontispiece_to_The_Song_of_Los.jpg\" width=\"246\"/></a></div><p>\n\nMy father spent the final twenty years of his life severely disabled and often bedridden.  Among his many maladies, he suffered from severe <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Complex-Regional-Pain-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet\">Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome</a> in one foot, which meant that he was in constant pain which would be seriously aggravated, sometimes for weeks, from even mild exertion, such as ten minutes' walking, or jostling the foot too much during sleep or while in a wheelchair.  It was, I believe, ultimately the CRiPS that killed him, through the side effects of long-term narcotics and the bodily harm from spending years almost immobile in bed.<p>\n\nI have often wished, during his final years, that we could have freed him from his horrible bed.  I've tried this in imagination many times, attempting to write it up as a science fiction story.  But the story never seems to come out right.  Today, instead of the story I can't yet write, let me discuss a technological innovation that I think would be interesting for people who are bedridden.<p>\n\nThe core idea is simple and would be easy to implement.  Probably, it is already being implemented somewhere.  (Links and info welcome!)  <b>Equip an able-bodied volunteer, the \"Host\", with a camera above each eye and a microphone by each ear.  Equip the bedridden person, the \"Rider\", with VR gear that immersively presents these audiovisual stimuli to Rider's eyes and ears.  Also equip Rider with a microphone to speak with Host</b>, directly into Host's ear.  Now send Host on a trip.  <b>During this trip, let Host be guided mainly by Rider's expressed desires</b>, going where Rider wants, looking where Rider wants to look, stopping and listening where Rider wants to stop and listen.  Unlike VR tours as they currently exist, Host can interact with and alter the environment in real time.  Rider could have Host lift a flower and turn it in their hands, then cast the flower into a stream and watch it drift away.  Host could purchase goods or services on Rider's behalf.  Host could conduct a conversation through Rider, interacting with locals by having Rider speak Host's words verbatim.<p>\n\n(In the psychology literature, speaking the words of another immediately upon hearing them quietly projected into your ear is called \"<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/136216880100500203\">conversational shadowing</a>\".  In his career as a psychologist, my father was involved in some early shadowing studies.  Shadowing can be surprisingly fast and smooth once one gets the hang of it, with utterances almost simultaneous as the host half-anticipates the rider's next word.)<p>\n\nA more ambitious Host-Rider setup would employ VR gloves.  As I imagine it, <b>Rider and Host wear matching gloves.  These gloves are synchronized to move in exactly the same way</b> -- of course with quick escape overrides and perhaps with Rider's motions damped down to prevent overextension or bumping into unseen obstacles near the bed.  This would take some excellent technological chicanery with good motion tracking (Nintendo Wii, improved) and some way of restricting or guiding the movements of the gloves on each end, perhaps using magnetic fields, so that when Rider wants to move a hand on vector W and Host wants to move it on vector V, the result is some compromise vector (barring safety override).  An intuitive collaboration would be necessary between Rider and Host, and gentle, predictable movements.  With practice, I think it would not be unfeasible, at least in safe and simple environments, for Rider to feel as though it is almost <i>their</i> hands that are moving in the virtual environment.  This could be further enhanced with tactile feedback -- that is, if pressure sensors in Host's gloves communicated with actuators in Rider's gloves that exerted corresponding pressures in corresponding locations.<p>\n\n(Here, compare the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_transfer_illusion\">Rubber Hand or Body Transfer Illusion</a>.  I have been a participant in some body transfer experiments and have informally conducted others at home with friends and family.  It is amazing how flexible one's sense of one's bodily shape, position, and boundaries can be, given suggestive feedback!)<p>\n\nA final, expensive, risky, and much more conjectural step here -- probably a step too far -- would involve equipping Host and Rider with helmets with brain-imaging technology and the capacity for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation\">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a> (or some other ability to directly stimulate or suppress brain activity).  For example, for <b>a fuller tactile experience, activity in Host's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex\">primary somatosensory cortex</a> could be tracked, and a vague, faint echo of it could be stimulated in matching areas in Rider's cortex</b>.  One wouldn't want too much synchrony, and anyhow brains differ somewhat in their organizational structure, even in fairly similarly structured regions like somatosensory cortex.   Also, of course, you wouldn't want much motor signal going down through efferent nerves into the Rider's body, making Rider move around in the bed.  Also, current brain imaging technologies, even if we imagine portable versions of them, wouldn't be spatiotemporally sharp enough to do a proper job of it.  But still, a dim, vague signal <i>might</i> be very suggestive for an otherwise well-harmonized, collaborative Host and Rider, in a rich environmental context with very clear cues and expectations.<p>\n\nI won't conjecture about, say, attempting to match activity in emotional regions or associative cortex.  Conjecturing about a high degree of match between different people's brains is both neurophysiologically unrealistic and possibly too threatening to the autonomy of Host and Rider -- though of course there are dark, interesting, far-future science-fictional possibilities there.<p>\n\nLet's bracket, then, this last conjectural step with brain imaging and brain stimulation, and focus just on the VR experience with audiovisual input, shadowing, and matching-motion gloves -- all in a positive, harmonious, and non-exploitative relationship with a host.  I think that would be pretty cool, and near- to medium-term technologically achievable.  If it plays out right, it might give some bedridden people a chance to explore the world beyond their bed in a much more vivid, engaging, and interactive manner.<p>\n\nMy father was both a psychologist and an inventor.  In 1995, when he was first diagnosed with cancer, he had been wanting to go to Hong Kong, and he had to cancel the trip to attempt a bone marrow transplant.  He never did make it to Hong Kong.  I wish I could bring him back, build some of this technology with him, then take him there.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/flying-free-of-deathbed-with.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-01-18T08:12:00-08:00\">8:12 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2285382327477492462\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sense%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">sense experience</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, October 26, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"123876686394688099\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/in-25-years-your-employer-will-directly.html\">In 25 Years, Your Employer Will Directly Control Your Moods</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[Edit Oct. 28: After discussion with friends and commenters in social media, I now think that the thesis should be moderated in two ways.  First, before direct mood control becomes common in the workplace, it probably first needs to become voluntarily common at home; and thus it will probably take more than 25 years.  Second, it seems likely that in many (most?) cases the direct control will remain in the employee's hands, though there will likely be coercive pressure from the employer to use it as the employer expects.  (Thanks to everyone for their comments!)]<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBKmfmeEQt8/WfIxkOjIeRI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RWPwdvEKCXstFOa-7oxpEkf6ngGb6GHLQCLcBGAs/s1600/braincontrol.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"629\" data-original-width=\"564\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBKmfmeEQt8/WfIxkOjIeRI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RWPwdvEKCXstFOa-7oxpEkf6ngGb6GHLQCLcBGAs/s320/braincontrol.jpg\" width=\"287\"/></a></div><p>\n\nHere's the argument:<p>\n\n(1.) In 25 years, employers will have the technological capacity to directly control their employees' moods.<p>\n\n(2.) Employers will not refrain from exercising that capacity.<p>\n\n(3.) Most working-age adults will be employees.<p>\n\n(4.) Therefore, in 25 years, most working-age adults will have employers who directly control their moods.<p>\n\nThe argument is valid in the sense that the conclusion (4) follows if all of the premises are true.<p>\n<b>Premise 1 seems plausible</b>, given current technological trajectories.  Control could be either pharmacological or via direct brain stimulation.  Pharmacological control could, for example, be through pills that directly influence your mood, energy levels, ability to concentrate, feeling of submissiveness, or passion for the type of task at hand.  Direct brain stimulation could be through a removable <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/home/ovc-20163795\">TMS helmet</a> that magnetically stimulates and suppresses neural activity in different brain regions, or with some more invasive technology.  McDonald's might ask its cashiers to tweak their dials toward perky friendliness.  Data entry centers might ask their temp workers to tweak their dials toward undistractable focus.  Brothels might ask their strippers to tweak their dials toward sexual arousal.<p>\n\nContra Premise 1, society might collapse, of course, or technological growth could stall or proceed much more slowly.  If it's just slower, then we can replace \"25 years\" with 50 or 100 and retain the rest of the argument.  It seems unlikely that moods are too complex or finicky to be subject to fairly precise technological control, given how readily they can be influenced by low-tech means.<p>\n\nI don't know to what extent people in Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and elite universities already use high-tech drugs to enhance alertness, energy, and concentration at work.  That might already be a step down this road.  Indeed, coffee might partly be seen this way too, especially if you use it to give your all to work, and then collapse in exhaustion when the caffeine wears off and you arrive home.  My thought is that in a few decades the interventions might be much more direct, effective, and precisely targeted.<p>\n<b>Premise 2 also seems plausible</b>, given the relative social power of employers vs. employees.  As long as there's surplus labor and a scarcity of desirable jobs, then employers will have some choice about whom to hire.  If Starbucks has a choice between Applicant A who is willing to turn up the perky-friendly dial and otherwise similar Applicant B who is not so willing, then they will presumably tend to prefer Applicant A.  If the Silicon Valley startup wants an employee who will crank out intense 16-hour days one after the next, and the technology is available for people to do so by directly regulating their moods, energy levels, focus, and passion, then the people who take that direct control, for their employers' benefit, will tend to win the competition for positions.  If Stanford wants to hire the medical researcher who is publishing article after article, they'll find the researcher who dialed up her appetite for work and dialed down everything else.<p>\n\nEmployees might yield control directly to the employer: The TMS dials might be in the boss's office, or the cafeteria lunch might include the pharmacological cocktail of the day.  Alternatively, employees might keep the hand on the dial themselves, but experience substantial pressure to manipulate it in the directions expected by the employer.  If that pressure is high enough and effective enough, then it comes to much the same thing.  (My guess is that lower-prestige occupations (the majority) would yield control directly to the employer, while higher-prestige occupations would retain the sheen of self-control alongside very effective pressure to use that \"self-control\" in certain ways.)<p>\n\nContra Premise 2, (a.) collective bargaining might prevent employers from successfully demanding direct mood control; or (b.) governmental regulations might do so; or (c.) there might be a lack of surplus labor.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (a): The historical trend recently, at least in the U.S., has been against unionization and collective bargaining, though I guess that could change.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (b): Although government regulations could forbid certain drugs or brain technologies, if there's enough demand for those drugs or technologies, employees will find ways to use them (unless enforcement gets a lot of resources, as in professional sports).  Government regulations could specifically forbid employers from requiring that their employees use certain technologies, while permitting such technologies for private use.  (No TMS helmets on the job.)  But enforcement might again be difficult; and private use vs. use as an employee is a permeable line for the increasing number of jobs that involve working outside of a set time and location.  Also, it's easier to regulate a contractual demand than an informal de facto demand.  Presumably many companies could say that of course they don't <i>require </i>their employees to use such technologies.  It's up to the employee!  But if the technology delivers as promised, the employees who \"voluntarily choose\" to have their moods directly regulated will be more productive and otherwise behave as the company desires, and thus be more attractive to retain and promote.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (c): At present there's no general long-term trend toward a shortage of labor; and at least for jobs seen as highly desirable, there will always be more applicants than available positions.<p>\n<b>Premise 3 also seems plausible</b>, especially on a liberal definition of \"employee\".  Most working-age adults (in Europe and North America) are currently employees of one form or another.  That could change substantially with the \"gig economy\" and more independent contracting, but not necessarily in a way that takes the sting out of the main argument.  Even if an Uber driver is technically not an employee, the pressures toward direct mood control for productivity ought to be similar.  Likewise for computer programmers and others who do piecework as independent contractors.  If anything, the pressures may be higher, with less security of income and fewer formal workplace regulations.<p>\n\nThinking about Premises 1-3, I find myself drawn to the conclusion that my children's and grandchildren's employers are likely to have a huge amount of coercive control over their moods and passions.<p>\n\n-------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/what-would-or-should-you-do-with.html\">What Would (or Should) You Do with Administrator Access to Your Mind?</a>\" (guest post by Henry Shevlin, Aug 16, 2017).<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/misp.12034/abstract\">Crash Space</a>\" (a short story by R.

Reynolds has written up a fun, vivid summary of my talk at Oxford Brookes last spring, on fiction writing for philosophers!<p>\n\n-----------------------------------<p>\n\nEric Schwitzgebel has a pleasingly liberal view of what constitutes philosophy. A philosopher is anyone wrestling with the \u201cbiggest picture framing issues\u201d of... well, anything.<p>\n\nIn a keynote session at the Fiction Writing for Philosophers Workshop that was held at Oxford Brookes University in June 2017, Schwitzgebel, Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside, shared his advice\u2013which he stated would be both practical and impractical.<p>\n\nSchwitzgebel tells us of a leading coiffeur who styles himself as a \u201cPhilosopher of Hair\u201d. We laugh \u2013 but there\u2019s something in this \u2013 the vagary, the contingency in favoured forms of philosophical output. And it\u2019s not just hairdressers that threaten to encroach upon the Philosophy Department\u2019s turf. Given that the foundational issues in any branch of science or art are philosophical in nature, it follows that most people \u201cdoing\u201d philosophy today aren\u2019t professional philosophers.<p>\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXG_Ju8hljI/WekqVa31D0I/AAAAAAAAAcI/_i-NSRx-K7Aj5vl63Z9FQ_z2H564JOoUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Hair.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"155\" data-original-width=\"307\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXG_Ju8hljI/WekqVa31D0I/AAAAAAAAAcI/_i-NSRx-K7Aj5vl63Z9FQ_z2H564JOoUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Hair.jpg\"/></a><p>\n\nThere are a host of ways one could go about doing philosophy, but of late a consensus has emerged amongst those that write articles for academic journals: the only proper way to \u201cdo\u201d philosophy is by writing articles for academic journals. Is it time to re-stock the tool shed? Philosophical nuts come in all shapes and sizes; yet contemporary attempts to crack them are somewhat monotone.<p>\n\nAs Schwitzgebel wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0719-schwitzgebel-philosophy-articles-20150717-story.html\">Los Angeles Times op-ed piece</a>:\n\n<blockquote>Too exclusive a focus on technical journal articles excludes non-academics from the dialogue \u2014 or maybe, better said, excludes us philosophers from non-academics\u2019 more important dialogue.</blockquote><p>\n\n[Hugh's account of my talk <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2017/10/18/practical-and-impractical-advice-for-philosophers-writing-fiction/\">continues here</a>.]<p>\n\n\n-----------------------------------<p>\n\nThanks also to Helen De Cruz for setting up the talk and to Skye Cleary for finding a home for Hugh's account on the APA blog.<p>\n\n[image detail from APA Blog]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/practical-and-impractical-advice-for.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-10-19T15:43:00-07:00\">3:43 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2066098109992975784\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, September 25, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8980555665204028303\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/how-to-build-immaterial-computer.html\">How to Build an Immaterial Computer</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I'm working on a paper, \"Kant Meets Cyberpunk\", in which I'll argue that <a href=\"https://www.simulation-argument.com/\">if we are living in a simulation</a> -- that is, if we are conscious AIs living in an artificial computational environment -- <b>then there's no particularly good reason to think that the computer that is running our simulation is a <i>material </i>computer.</b>  It might, for example, be an immaterial Cartesian soul.  (I do think it has to be a concrete, temporally existing object, capable of state transitions, rather than a purely abstract entity.)<p>\n\nSince we normally think of computers as material objects, it might seem odd to suppose that a computer could be composed from immaterial soul-stuff.  However, the well-known philosopher and theorist of computation Hilary Putnam has remarked that there's nothing in the theory of computation that requires that computers be made of material substances (<a href=\"http://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/courses/ICS/readings/ICS_03read_Putnam1967.pdf\">1965/1975, p. 435-436</a>).  To support this idea, I want to <b>construct an example of an immaterial computer</b> -- which might be fun or useful even independently of my project concerning Kant and the simulation argument.<p>\n\n--------------------------<p>\n\nStandard computational theory goes back to <a href=\"https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf\">Alan Turing (1936)</a>.  One of its most famous results is this: Any problem that can be solved purely algorithmically can in principle be solved by a very simple system.  Turing imagined a strip of tape, of unlimited length in at least one direction, with a read-write head that can move back and forth along the tape, reading alphanumeric characters written on that tape and then erasing them and writing new characters according to simple if-then rules.  In principle, one could construct a computer along these lines -- a \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine\">Turing machine</a>\" -- that, given enough time, has the same ability to solve computational problems as the most powerful supercomputer we can imagine.<p>\n<b>Now, can we build a Turing machine, or a Turing machine equivalent, out of something immaterial?<p></p></b>\n\nFor concreteness, let's consider <b>a Cartesian soul</b> [note 1]: It is capable of thought and conscious experience.  It exists in time, and it has causal powers.  However, it does not have spatial properties like extension or position.  To give it full power, let's assume it has perfect memory.  This need not be a <i>human </i>soul.  Let's call it Angel.<p>\n\nA proper Turing machine requires the following:<p>\n<li>a finite, non-empty <b>set of possible <i>states </i></b>of the machine, including a specified starting state and one or more specified halting states;</li>\n<li>a finite, non-empty <b>set of <i>symbols</i></b>, including a specified blank symbol;</li>\n<li>the <b>capacity to move <i>a read/write head \"right\" and \"left\"</i> along a tape</b> inscribed with those symbols, reading a symbol inscribed at whatever position the head occupies; and</li>\n<li>a finite <b><i>transition function</i></b> that specifies, given the machine's current state and the symbol currently beneath its read/write head, a new state to be entered and a replacement symbol to be written in that position, plus an instruction to then move the head either right or left.</li><p>\n<b>A Cartesian soul ought to be capable of having multiple <i>states</i>.</b>  We might suppose that Angel has moods, such as bliss.  Perhaps he can be in any one of several discrete states along an interval from sad to happy.  Angel\u2019s initial state might be the most extreme sadness and Angel might halt only at the most extreme happiness.<p>\n\nAlthough we normally think of an alphabet of symbols as an alphabet of written symbols, <b><i>symbols </i>might also be imagined</b>.  Angel might imagine a number of discrete pitches from the A three octaves below middle C to the A three octaves above middle C.  Middle C might be the blank symbol.<p>\n<b>Instead of physical <i>tape</i>, Angel thinks of integer numbers.  Instead of having a <i>read-write head that moves right and left in space</i>, Angel thinks of adding or subtracting one from a running total.</b>  We can populate the \"tape\" with symbols using Angel's perfect memory: Angel associates 0 with one pitch, +1 with another pitch, +2 with another pitch, and so forth, for a finite number of specified associations.  All unspecified associations are assumed to be middle C.  Instead of a read-write head starting at a spatial location on a tape, Angel starts by thinking of 0, and recalling the pitch that 0 is associated with.  Instead of the read-write head moving right to read the next spatially adjacent symbol on the tape, Angel adds one to his running total and thinks of the pitch that is associated with the updated running total.  Instead of moving left, he subtracts one.  Thus, Angel's \"tape\" is a set of memory associations like that in the figure below, where at some point specific associations run out and Middle C is assumed on to infinity.<p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BgeP9_Up0dU/Wckci0Syb5I/AAAAAAAAAZE/guTzsw1wcdgW0Km3tHR1SgwzEYfVBjwbQCLcBGAs/s1600/TuringTape.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"385\" data-original-width=\"421\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BgeP9_Up0dU/Wckci0Syb5I/AAAAAAAAAZE/guTzsw1wcdgW0Km3tHR1SgwzEYfVBjwbQCLcBGAs/s400/TuringTape.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><p>\n\nThe <i>transition function</i> can be understood as a set of rules of this form: If Angel is in such and such a state (e.g., 23% happy) and is \"reading\" such and such a note (e.g., B2), then Angel should \"write\" such-and-such a note (e.g, G4), enter such-and-such a new state (e.g., 52% happy), and either add or subtract one from his running count.  <b>We rely on Angel's memory to implement the writing and reading</b>: To \"write\" G4 when his running count is +2 is to commit to memory the idea that next time the running count is +2 he will \"read\" \u2013 that is, actively recall \u2013 the symbol G4 (instead of the B2 he previously associated with +2).<p>\n\nAs far as I can tell, Angel is a perfectly fine Turing machine equivalent.  If standard computational theory is correct, he could execute any computational task that any ordinary material computer could execute.  And he has no properties incompatible with being an immaterial Cartesian soul as such souls are ordinarily conceived.<p>\n\n--------------------------<p>\n\n[Note 1] I attribute moods and imaginings to this soul, which Descartes believes arise from the interaction of soul and body.  On my understanding of Descartes, such things are possible in souls without bodies, but if necessary we could change to more purely intellectual examples.  I am also bracketing Descartes' view that the soul is not a \"machine\", which appears to depend on commitment to a view of machines as necessarily material entities (<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/59/59-h/59-h.htm\">Discourse</a>, part 5).\n\n--------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/01/kant-meets-cyberpunk.html\">Kant Meets Cyberpunk</a> (blogpost version, Jan 19, 2012)<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.apex-magazine.com/issue-98-july-2017/\">The Turing Machines of Babel</a> (short story in Apex Magazine, July 2017)\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/how-to-build-immaterial-computer.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-09-25T08:22:00-07:00\">8:22 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=8980555665204028303\" onclick=\"\">15\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, September 12, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1101019932700355190\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/writing-for-10.html\">Writing for the 10%</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[The following is adapted from my advice to aspiring writers of philosophical fiction at the <a href=\"https://www.brookes.ac.uk/hpc/research/philosophy-through-fiction/\">Philosophy Through Fiction workshop</a> at Oxford Brookes last June.]<p>\n\nI have a <a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/schwitzgebel_09_17/\">new science fiction story</a> out this month in <i>Clarkesworld</i>.

I don't say this out of modesty or because I think this story is especially unlikable.  I say it partly to help defuse expectations: Please feel free not to like my story!  I won't be offended.  But I say it too, in this context, because I think it's important for writers to remind themselves regularly of one possibly somewhat disappointing fact: <i>Most people don't like most fiction.</i>  So most people are probably not going to like <i>your</i> fiction -- no matter how wonderful it is.<p>\n\nIn fiction, so much depends on taste.  Even the very best, most famous fiction in the world is disliked by most people.  I can't stand Ernest Hemingway or George Eliot.  I don't dispute that they were great writers -- just not my taste, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Similarly, most people don't like most poetry, no matter how famous or awesome it is.  And most people don't like most music, when it's not in a style that suits them.<p>\n\nA few stories do appear to be enjoyed by almost everyone who reads them (\"<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/2015/04/20/ep490-flowers-for-algernon/\">Flowers for Algernon</a>\"? \"<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/2012/05/17/ep345-the-paper-menagerie/\">The Paper Menagerie</a>\"?), but those are <i>peak stories of great writers' careers</i>.  To expect even a very good story by an excellent writer to achieve almost universal likability is like hearing that a philosopher has just put out a new book and then expecting it to be as beloved and influential as <i>Naming and Necessity</i>.<p>\n\nEven if someone likes your expository philosophy, they probably won't like your fiction.  The two types of writing are so different!  Even someone who enjoys philosophically-inspired fiction probably won't like your fiction in particular.  Too many other parameters of taste also need to align.  They'll find your prose style too flowery or too dry, your characters too flat or too cartoonishly clever, your plot too predictable or too confusing, your philosophical elements too heavy-handed or too understated....<p>\n\nI draw two lessons.<p>\n\nFirst lesson: Although you probably want your friends, family, and colleagues to enjoy your work, and some secret inner part of you might <i>expect </i>them to enjoy it (because it's so wonderful!), it's best to suppress that desire and expectation.  You need to learn to expect indifference without feeling disappointed.  It's like expecting your friends and family and colleagues to like your favorite band.  Almost none of them will -- even if some part of you screams out \"of course everyone should love this song it's so great!\"  Aesthetic taste doesn't work like that.  <i>It's perfectly fine if almost no one you know you likes your writing.</i>  They shouldn't feel bad about that, and you shouldn't feel bad about that.<p>\n\nSecond lesson: Write for the people who will like it.  Sometimes one hears the advice that you should \"just write for yourself\" and forget the potential audience.  I can see how this might be good advice if the alternative is to try to please everyone, which will never succeed and might along the way destroy what is most distinctive about your voice and style.  However, I don't think that advice is quite right, for most writers.  If you really are just writing for yourself -- well, isn't that what diaries are for?  If you're only writing for yourself you needn't think about comprehensibility, since of course <i>you </i>understand everything.  If you're only writing for yourself, you needn't think about suspense, since of course <i>you</i> know what's going to happen.  And so forth.  The better advice here is <i>write for the 10%</i>.  Maybe 10% of the people around you have tastes similar enough to your own that there's a chance that your story will please them.  They are your target audience.  Your story needn't be comprehensible to everyone, but it should be comprehensible to them.  Your story needn't work intellectually and emotionally for everyone, but you should try to make it work intellectually and emotionally for them.<p>\n\nWhen sending your story out for feedback, ignore the feedback of the 90%, and treasure the feedback of the 10%.  Don't try to implement every change that everyone recommends, or even the majority of changes.  Most people will never like the story that you would write.  You wouldn't want your favorite punk band taking aesthetic advice from your country-music loving uncle.  But listen intently to the 10%, to the readers who are almost there, the ones who have the <i>potential </i>to love your story but don't quite love it yet.  They are the ones to listen to.  Make it great for them, and forget everyone else.<p>\n\n[Cross-posted at <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2017/09/12/writing-for-the-ten-percent/\">The Blog of the APA</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/writing-for-10.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-09-12T09:23:00-07:00\">9:23 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1101019932700355190\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, August 03, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3887325787907329296\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/top-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html\">Top Science Fiction and Fantasy Magazines 2017</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mxmQExzW1I/WX-wfj-1xPI/AAAAAAAAAR8/afPDls3aHVodmoDyXwn-uZzq9yBw0CY5ACLcBGAs/s1600/asimovscoverr.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1178\" data-original-width=\"776\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mxmQExzW1I/WX-wfj-1xPI/AAAAAAAAAR8/afPDls3aHVodmoDyXwn-uZzq9yBw0CY5ACLcBGAs/s320/asimovscoverr.jpg\" width=\"211\"/></a></div><p>\n\nIn 2014, as a beginning writer of science fiction or speculative fiction, with no idea what magazines were well regarded in the industry, I decided to compile <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-top-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html\">a ranked list of magazines</a> based on awards and \"best of\" placements in the previous ten years.  Since people seemed to find it useful or interesting, I've been <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/SFranking.htm\">updating it annually</a>. Below is my list for 2017.<p>\n<i>Method and Caveats:</i><p>\n\n(1.) Only magazines are included (online or in print), not anthologies or standalones.<p>\n\n(2.) I gave each magazine one point for each story nominated for a <a href=\"http://www.thehugoawards.org/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sfwa.org/nebula-awards/\">Nebula</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eugiefoster.com/eugieaward\">Eugie</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.worldfantasy.org/\">World Fantasy Award</a> in the past ten years; one point for each story appearance in any of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250119243/\">Dozois</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blackgate.com/2016/11/23/prime-books-reveals-the-contents-of-the-years-best-science-fiction-and-fantasy-2017-edited-by-rich-horton/\">Horton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781085625/\">Strahan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597808962\">Clarke</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544555201\">Adams</a> \"Year's Best\" anthologies; and half a point for each story appearing in the short story or novelette category of the annual <a href=\"http://www.locusmag.com/News/2017/01/2016-locus-recommended-reading-list/\">Locus Recommended list</a>.<p>\n\n(3.) I am <b>not attempting to include the horror / dark fantasy genre</b>, except as it appears incidentally on the list.<p>\n\n(4.) <b>Prose only</b>, not poetry.<p>\n\n(5.) I'm <b>not attempting to correct for frequency of publication</b> or length of table of contents.<p>\n\n(6.) I'm also <b>not correcting for a magazine's only having published during part of the ten-year period</b>.  Reputations of defunct magazines slowly fade, and sometimes they are restarted.  Reputations of new magazines take time to build.<p>\n\n(7.) Lists of this sort do tend to <b>reinforce the prestige hierarchy</b>.  I have mixed feelings about that.

The remaining magazines focus on the F/SF genre.<p>\n\n(2.) It's also interesting to consider a three-year window.  Here are those results, down to six points:\n<blockquote>\n1. Clarkesworld (66.5)</blockquote></p></p></p>\n2. Tor.com (61)\n3. Asimov's (59)\n4. Lightspeed (49.5)\n5. F&amp;SF (37.5)\n6. Analog (21)\n7. Beneath Ceaseless Skies (20)\n8. Uncanny (19)\n9. Subterranean (16)\n10. Interzone (11.5)\n11. Strange Horizons (11)\n12. Nightmare (9)\n<p>\n\n(3.) One important thing left out of these numbers is the rise of good podcast venues such as the Escape Artists' podcasts (<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/\">Escape Pod</a>, <a href=\"http://podcastle.org/\">Podcastle</a>, <a href=\"http://pseudopod.org/\">Pseudopod</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.castofwonders.org/\">Cast of Wonders</a>), <a href=\"http://www.drabblecast.org/\">Drabblecast</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.starshipsofa.com/\">StarShipSofa</a>.  None of these qualify for my list by existing criteria, but podcasts are an increasingly important venue.  Some text-based magazines, like <i>Clarkesworld</i>, <i>Lightspeed</i>, and <i>Strange Horizons</i> also regularly podcast their stories.<p>\n\n(5.) Philosophers interested in science fiction might also want to look at <a href=\"http://www.sciphijournal.com/\">Sci Phi Journal</a>, which publishes both science fiction with philosophical discussion notes and philosophical essays about science fiction.<p>\n\n(6.) Other lists: The SFWA <a href=\"https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/\">qualifying markets list</a> is a list of \"pro\" science fiction and fantasy venues based on pay rates and track records of strong circulation.  <a href=\"http://ralan.com/\">Ralan.com</a> is a regularly updated list of markets, divided into categories based on pay rate.<p>\n\n(7.) The \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Puppies\">Sad Puppy</a>\" kerfuffle threatens to damage the once-sterling reputation of the Hugos, but the Hugos are a small part of my calculation and the results are pretty much the same either way.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.americanmagazinecollection.com/isaac-asimovs-science-fiction-magazine/\">image source</a>; admittedly, it's not the latest issue!]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/top-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-08-03T09:21:00-07:00\">9:21 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3887325787907329296\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, August 01, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6341506688198046478\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/why-was-sci-fi-so-slow-to-discover-time.html\">Why Was Sci-Fi So Slow to Discover Time Travel?

Almost every long running SF show \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday%27s_Enterprise\">Star Trek</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Late_Philip_J._Fry\">Futurama</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrony_(The_X-Files)\">The X-Files</a> \u2013 will have a time travel episode sooner or later, and some, like Doctor Who, use time travel as the main narrative device. The same applies to novels and, of course, to Hollywood \u2013 blockbuster SF franchises like the Terminator and Back to the Future employ it, as do quirkier pictures like Midnight in Paris. And of course, there\u2019s no shortage of time travel novels, including old favorites like A Christmas Carol, and perhaps most influentially, HG Wells\u2019s wonderful social sci-fi novella <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine\">The Time Machine</a>.<p>\nI don\u2019t find it particularly surprising that we\u2019re so interested in time travel. We all engage in so called \u2018mental time travel\u2019 (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronesthesia\">Chronaesthesia</a>) all the time, reviewing past experiences and imagining possible futures, and the psychological capacities required in our doing so are the subject of intense scientific and philosophical interest.<p>\nAdmittedly, the label \u201cmental time travel\u201d may be a bit misleading here; most of what gets labelled mental time travel is quite different from the SF variant, consisting in episodic recall of the past or projection into the future rather than imagining our present selves thrown back in time. But I think we also do this latter thing quite a lot. To give a commonplace example, we\u2019re all prone to engage in \u201ccoulda woulda shoulda\u201d thinking: if only I hadn\u2019t parked the car under that tree branch in a storm, if I only I hadn\u2019t forgotten my wedding anniversary, if only I hadn\u2019t fumbled that one interview question. Frequently when we do this, we even elaborate how the present might have been different if we\u2019d just done something a bit differently in the past. This looks a lot like the plots of some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sound_of_Thunder\">famous science fiction stories</a>! Similarly, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all pondered what it would be like to experience different historical periods like the American Revolution, the Roman Empire, or the age of dinosaurs (<a href=\"https://topatoco.com/products/qw-cheatsheet\">you can even buy a handy t-shirt</a>). More prosaically, I imagine many of us have also reflected on how satisfying it would be to relive some of our earlier life experiences and do things differently the second time round \u2013 standing up to high school bullies, or studying harder in high school (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Tub_Time_Machine\">again, a staple of light entertainment</a>).<p>\nGiven the above, I had always assumed that time travel was part of fiction because it was simply part of us. Time travel narratives, in other words, were borrowed from the kind of imaginings we all do all the time. It was with huge surprise, then, that I discovered (while teaching a course on philosophy and science fiction) that time travel doesn\u2019t appear in fiction until the 18th century, in the short novel \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_the_Twentieth_Century\">Memoirs of the Twentieth Century</a>\u201d. Specifically, this story imagines letters from the future being brought back to 1728. The first story of any kind (as far as I\u2019ve been able to find) that features humans being physically transported back into the past doesn\u2019t come until 1881, in Edward Page Mitchell\u2019s short story \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_that_Went_Backward\">The Clock That Went Backwards</a>\u201d.<p>\nMaybe this doesn\u2019t seem so surprising \u2013 isn\u2019t science fiction in the business of coming up with bizarre, never before seen plot devices? But in fact, it\u2019s pretty rare for genuinely new ideas to show up in science fiction. Long before we had stories about artificial intelligence, we had the tales of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio\">Pinocchio</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague\">Golem of Prague</a>. Creatures on other planets? Lucian's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_History\">True History</a> had beings living on the moon and sun back in the 2nd century AD. For huge spaceships, witness the mind-controlled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimana\">Vimanas</a> of the Sanskrit epics. And so on. And yet, for all the inventiveness of folklore and mythology, there\u2019s very little in the way of time travel to be found. The best I\u2019ve come up with so far is some time dilation in the stories of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakudmi\">Kakudmi</a> in the Ramayanas, and visions of the past in the Book of Enoch. But as far as I can tell, there\u2019s nothing that fits the conventional time travel narratives we\u2019re used to, namely physically travelling to ages past or future, let alone any idea that we might alter history.<p>\nWhat\u2019s going on here? One possibility is that something changed in science or society in the 18th century that paved the way for stories about time travel. But what would that be, and how would it lead to time travel seeming more plausible? For example, if the first time travel literature had accompanied the emergence of general relativity (with all its assorted time related weirdness), then that would offer a satisfying answer. However, Newtonian physics was already in place by the late 17th century, and it\u2019s not clear which of Newton\u2019s principles might pave the way for time travel narratives.<p>\nI\u2019m very open to suggestions, but let me throw out one final idea: time travel narratives don\u2019t show up in earlier fiction because they\u2019re <b>weird, unnatural, and counterintuitive</b>. Even weirder than the staples of folklore and mythology, like people being turned into animals. Time travel is just not the kind of thing that naturally occurs to humans to think about at all, and it\u2019s only via a few fateful books in the 18th century and its subsequent canonisation in The Time Machine that it\u2019s become established as a central plot device in science fiction.<p>\nBut doesn\u2019t that contradict what I said earlier about how we all often naturally think about time travel related scenarios, like changing the past, or witnessing historical events firsthand? Not necessarily. Maybe <b>these kinds of thought patterns are actually inspired by time-travel science fiction</b>. In other words, prior to the emergence of time travel as a trope, maybe people really didn\u2019t daydream about meeting Julius Caesar or going back and changing history. Perhaps the past was seen simply as a closed book, rather than (in the memorable words of L. P. Hartley) just \u201ca foreign country\u201d. That\u2019s not to suggest, of course, that people didn\u2019t experience memories and regrets, but maybe they experienced them a little differently, with the past seeming simply an immutable background to the present.<p>\nI\u2019m excited the idea that a science fiction trope might have birthed a new and widespread form of thinking. Partly that\u2019s because it suggests that science fiction may be more influential than we realize, and partly it\u2019s because, as a philosopher, I\u2019m interested in where patterns of thought come from. However, I\u2019m very happy to proven wrong in this conjecture \u2013 perhaps there are letters from the Middle Ages in which writers engage in precisely this kind of speculation. Or perhaps the emergence of science fiction in the 18th century can be explained in terms of some historical event I\u2019ve missed. Or who knows: maybe there\u2019s an untranslated gnostic manuscript out there where Jesus has a time machine....<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/p-1974990/\">image source</a>]\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/why-was-sci-fi-so-slow-to-discover-time.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-08-01T08:00:00-07:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6341506688198046478\" onclick=\"\">11\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Henry%20Shevlin\" rel=\"tag\">Henry Shevlin</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, July 21, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6414505003472379115\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/07/new-journal-journal-of-science-fiction.html\">New Journal! The Journal of Science Fiction and Philosophy</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>This looks very cool:<p>\n<b>\nCall for Papers<p>\n\nGeneral Theme<p></p></p></b>\n<i>The Journal of Science Fiction and Philosophy</i>, a peer-reviewed, open access publication, is dedicated to the analysis of philosophical themes present in science fiction stories in all formats, with a view to their use in the discussion, teaching, and narrative modeling of philosophical ideas. It aims at highlighting the role of science fiction as a medium for philosophical reflection.<p>\n\nThe Journal is currently accepting papers and paper proposals. Because this is the Journal\u2019s first issue, papers specifically reflecting on the relationship between philosophy and science fiction are especially encouraged, but all areas of philosophy are welcome. Any format of SF story (short story, novel, movie, TV series, interactive) may be addressed.<p>\n\nWe welcome papers written with teaching in mind! Have used an SF story to teach a particular item in your curricula (e.g., using the movie Gattacca to introduce the ethics of genetic technologies, or The Island of Dr. Moreau to discuss personhood)? Turn that class into a paper!<p>\n<b>\nYearly Theme<p></p></b>\n\nEvery year the Journal selects a Yearly Theme. Papers addressing the Yearly Theme are collected in a special section of the Journal. The Yearly Theme for 2017 is All Persons Great and Small: The Notion of Personhood in Science Fiction Stories.<p>\n \nSF stories are in a unique position to help us examine the concept of personhood, by making the human  world engage with a bewildering variety of beings with person-like qualities \u2013 aliens of bizarre shapes and customs, artificial constructs conflicted about their artificiality, planetary-wide intelligences, collective minds, and the list goes on. Every one of these instances provides the opportunity to reflect on specific aspects of the notion of personhood, such as, for example: What is a person? What are its defining qualities? What is the connection between personhood and morality, identity, rationality, basic (\u201chuman?\u201d) rights? What patterns do SF authors identify when describing the oppression of one group of persons by another, and how do they reflect past and present human history?<p>\n \nThe Journal accepts papers year-round.

That is, mentality is just a matter of transitioning between computationally definable states in response to environmental inputs, in a way that hypothetically could be implemented by a computer.<p>\n\n(2) As Alan Turing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine\">famously showed</a>, it's possible to implement any finitely computable function on a strip of tape containing alphanumeric characters, given a read-write head that implements simple rules for writing and erasing characters and moving itself back and forth along the tape.<p>\n\n(3) Given 1 and 2, one way to implement a mind is by means of a rabbit reading and writing characters on a long strip of tape that is properly responsive, in an organized way, to its environment.  (The rabbit will need to adhere to simple rules and may need to live a very long time, so it won't be exactly a normal rabbit.  Environmental influence could be implemented by alteration of the characters on segments of the tape.)<p>\n\n(4) The universe is infinite.<p>\n\n(5) Given 3 and 4, the cardinality of \"normally\" implemented minds is the same as the cardinality of minds implemented by rabbits reading and writing on Turing tape.  (Given that such Turing-rabbit minds are finitely probable, we can create a one-to-one mapping or bijection between Turing-rabbit minds and normally implemented minds, for example by starting at an arbitrary point in space and then pairing the closest normal mind with the closest Turing-rabbit mind, then pairing the second-closest of each, then pairing the third-closest....)<p>\n\n(6) Given 5, you cannot justifiably assume that most minds in the universe are \"normal\" minds rather than Turing-rabbit implemented minds.  (This might seem unintuitive, but comparing infinities often yields such unintuitive results.  ETA: One way out of this would be to look at the ratios in limits of sequences.  But then we need to figure out a non-question-begging way to construct those sequences.  See the helpful <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10211859003703086\">comments by Eric Steinhart on my public FB feed</a>.)<p>\n\n(7) Given 6, you cannot justifiably assume that you yourself are very likely to be a normal mind rather than a Turing-rabbit mind.  (If 1-3 are true, Turing-rabbit minds can be perfectly similar to normally implemented minds.)<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6VgPQkK99dk/WV0XhsAVfvI/AAAAAAAAAPA/pR-L0-CFwY8VDv2tSivqYtf_W19WVwq2ACLcBGAs/s1600/Tape4.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"268\" data-original-width=\"830\" height=\"207\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6VgPQkK99dk/WV0XhsAVfvI/AAAAAAAAAPA/pR-L0-CFwY8VDv2tSivqYtf_W19WVwq2ACLcBGAs/s640/Tape4.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a></div><p>\n\nI explore this possibility in \"THE TURING MACHINES OF BABEL\", a story in <a href=\"https://www.apex-magazine.com/issue-98-july-2017/\">this month's issue of <i>Apex Magazine</i></a>.  I'll link to the story once it's available online, but also consider supporting <i>Apex</i> by purchasing the issue now.<p>\n\nThe conclusion is of course \"crazy\" in my <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/07/crazyism.html\">technical sense of the term</a>: It's highly contrary to common sense and we aren't epistemically compelled to believe it.<p>\n\nAmong the ways out: You could reject the computational-functional theory of mind, or you could reject the infinitude of the universe (though these are both fairly common positions in philosophy and cosmology these days).  Or you could reject my hypothesized rabbit implementation (maybe slowness is a problem even with perfect computational similarity).  Or you could hold a view which allows a low ratio of Turing rabbits to normal minds despite the infinitude of both.  Or you could insist that we (?) normally implemented minds have some epistemic access to our normality even if Turing-rabbit minds are perfectly similar and no less abundant.  But none of those moves is entirely cost-free, philosophically.<p>\n\nNotice that this argument, though skeptical in a way, does not include any prima facie highly unlikely claims among its premises (such as that aliens envatted your brain last night or that there is a demon bent upon deceiving you).  The premises are contentious, and there are various ways to resist my combination of them to draw the conclusion, but I hope that each element and move, considered individually, is broadly plausible on a fairly standard 21st-century academic worldview.<p>\n\nThe basic idea is this: If minds can be implemented in strange ways, and if the universe is infinite, then there will be infinitely many strangely implemented minds alongside infinitely many \"normally\" implemented minds; and given standard rules for comparing infinities, it seems likely that these infinities will be of the same cardinality.  <b>In an infinite universe that contains infinitely many strangely implemented minds, it's unclear how you could know you are not among the strange ones.</b></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/07/whats-likelihood-that-your-mind-is.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-07-05T10:19:00-07:00\">10:19 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5004740228330197696\" onclick=\"\">16\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/cosmology\" rel=\"tag\">cosmology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/crazyism\" rel=\"tag\">crazyism</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/skepticism\" rel=\"tag\">skepticism</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, June 20, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8440506728031430410\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-dauphins-metaphysics-read-by.html\">The Dauphin's Metaphysics, read by Tatiana Grey at Podcastle</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>My alternative-history story about love and low-tech body switching through hypnosis has just been released in audio at PodCastle.

Some undergraduates struggle to fill their 1500-word papers because they think that every idea gets one sentence.  How do you have eighty ideas?!  It becomes much easier to fill the pages -- indeed the challenge shifts from filling the pages to staying concise -- once you recognize that every idea in an academic paper deserves a full academic-sized paragraph.  Throw in an intro and conclusion and you've got, what, five ideas in a 1500-word paper?  Background, a main point, one elaboration or application, one objection, a response -- done.<p>\n<b>It took a while for me to learn that this is also true in writing fiction.</b>  You can't just say something once.  My first stories were too dense.  (They are now either trunked or substantially expanded.)  I guess I implicitly figured that you say something, maybe in a clever oblique way, the reader gets it, and you're done with that thing.  Who wants boring repetition and didacticism in fiction?<p>\n\nWithout being didactically tiresome, there are lots of ways to slow things down so that the reader can relish your idea, your plot turn, your character's emotion or reaction, rather than having the thing over and done in a sentence.  You can break it into phases; you can explicitly set it up, then deliver; you can repeat in different words (especially if the phrasings are lovely); you can show different aspects of the scene, relevant sensory detail, inner monologue, other characters' reactions, a symbolic event in the environment.<p>\n\nBut one of my favorite techniques is <b>hint, confirm, remind</b>.  You can do this in a compact way (as in the example I'm about to give), but writers more commonly spread HCRs throughout the story.  Some early detail hints or foreshadows -- gives the reader a basis for guessing.  Then later, when you hit it directly, the earlier hint is remembered (or if not, no biggie, not all readers are super careful), and the alert reader will enjoy seeing how the pieces come together.  Still later, you remind the reader -- more quickly, like a final little hammer tap (and also so that the least alert readers finally get it).<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.neilgaiman.com/\">Neil Gaiman</a> is a master of the art.  As I was preparing some thoughts for a fiction-writing workshop for philosophers I'm co-leading next month, I noticed <a href=\"https://qz.com/984070/neil-gaiman-has-the-perfect-anecdote-for-anyone-with-impostors-syndrome/\">this passage about \"imposter syndrome\", recently going around</a>.  Here's Gaiman:\n\n<blockquote><p>Some years ago, I was lucky enough invited to a gathering of great and good people: artists and scientists, writers and discoverers of things. And I felt that at any moment they would realise that I didn\u2019t qualify to be there, among these people who had really done things.<p>\n\nOn my second or third night there, I was standing at the back of the hall, while a musical entertainment happened, and I started talking to a very nice, polite, elderly gentleman about several things, including our shared first name. And then he pointed to the hall of people, and said words to the effect of, \"I just look at all these people, and I think, what the heck am I doing here? They\u2019ve made amazing things. I just went where I was sent.\"<p>\n\nAnd I said, \"Yes. But you were the first man on the moon. I think that counts for something.\"<p>\n\nAnd I felt a bit better. Because if Neil Armstrong felt like an imposter, maybe everyone did.</p></p></p></p></blockquote><p>\n\nHint: an elderly gentleman, same first name as Gaiman, famous enough to be backstage among well known artists and scientists.  Went where he was sent.<p>\n\nConfirm: \"You were the first man on the moon\".<p>\n\nRemind: \"... if Neil Armstrong...\"<p>\n<b>The hints set up the puzzle.</b>  It's unfolding fast before you, if you're reading at a normal pace.  You could slow way down and treat it as a riddle, but few of us would do that.<p>\n<b>The confirm gives you the answer.</b>  Now it all fits together.  Bonus points to Gaiman for making it natural dialogue rather than flat-footed exposition.<p>\n\nThe remind here is too soon after the confirm to really be a <i>reminder</i>, as it would be if it appeared a couple of pages later in a longer piece of writing.  But the basic structure is the same: <b>The remind hammer-taps the thing that should already be obvious,</b> to make sure the reader really has it -- but quickly, with a light touch.<p>\n\nIf you want the reader to remember, you can't just say it only once.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/08/neil_armstrong_s_moon_landing_quote_did_he_say_one_small_step_for_a_man_.html\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/05/hint-confirm-remind.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-05-18T09:28:00-07:00\">9:28 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7725604044729743148\" onclick=\"\">1 comments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, April 21, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8142079485966570006\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/04/common-sense-science-fiction-and-weird.html\">Common Sense, Science Fiction, and Weird, Uncharitable History of Philosophy</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Philosophers have three broad methods for settling disputes: appeal to \"common sense\" or culturally common presuppositions, appeal to scientific evidence, and appeal to theoretical virtues like simplicity, coherence, fruitfulness, and pragmatic value.  Some of the most interesting disputes are disputes in which all three of these broad methods are problematic and seemingly indecisive.<p>\n\nOne of my aims as a philosopher is to intervene on common sense.  <b>\"Common sense\" is inherently conservative.</b>  Common sense used to tell us that the Earth didn't move, that humans didn't descend from ape-like ancestors, that certain races were superior to others, that the world was created by a god or gods of one sort or another.  Common sense is a product of biological and cultural evolution, plus the cognitive and social development of people in a limited range of environments. <b> Common sense only has to get things right enough, for practical purposes, to help us manage the range of environments to which we are accustomed.</b>  Common sense is under no obligation to get it right about the early universe, the microstructure of matter, the history of the species, future technologies, or the consciousness of weird hypothetical systems we have never encountered.<p>\n\nThe conservativism and limited vision of common sense leads us to dismiss as \"crazy\" some philosophical and scientific views that might in fact be true.  I've argued that this is especially so regarding theories of consciousness, about which <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">something crazy must be true</a>.  For example: <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">literal group consciousness</a>, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/\">panpsychism</a>, and/or <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/TyrantsHeadache.htm\">the failure of pain to supervene locally</a>. Although I don't believe that existing arguments <i>decisively</i> favor any of those possibilities, I do think that we ought to restrain our impulse to dismiss such views out of hand.  Fit with common sense is <i>one</i> important factor in evaluating philosophical claims, especially when direct scientific evidence and considerations of general theoretical virtue are indecisive, but it is only one factor.  We ought to be ready to accept that in some philosophical domains, our commonsense intuitions cannot be entirely preserved.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wQScn1A_VmQ/WPpAgC9VTSI/AAAAAAAAAII/YMyfnDxkDSk-7kOd1RnDBJU-yby6t__hQCLcB/s1600/MadScience.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wQScn1A_VmQ/WPpAgC9VTSI/AAAAAAAAAII/YMyfnDxkDSk-7kOd1RnDBJU-yby6t__hQCLcB/s200/MadScience.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\nToward this end, <b>I want to <i>broaden our intuitive sense of the possible</i>.  The two best techniques I know are science fiction and cross-cultural philosophy.</b><p>\n\nThe philosophical value of science fiction consists not only in the potential of science fictional speculations to describe possible futures that we might actually encounter.  Historically, science fiction has not been a great predictor of the future.  <b>The primary philosophical value of science fiction might rather consist in its ability to flex our minds and disrupt commonsense conservatism.</b>  After reading far-out stories about weird utopias, uploading into simulated realities, bizarrely constructed intelligent aliens, body switching, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain\">Matrioshka Brains</a>, and alternative universes, philosophical speculations about panpsychism and group consciousness no longer seem quite so intolerably weird.  At least that's my (empirically falsifiable) conjecture.<p>\n\nSimilarly, brain-flexing is an important part of the value of reading the history of philosophy -- especially work from traditions other than those with which you are already familiar.   Here it's especially <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/against-charity-in-history-of-philosophy.html\">important not to be too \"charitable\"</a> (i.e. assimilative). <b>Relish the weirdness -- \"weird\" from your perspective! -- of radical Buddhist metaphysics, of medieval Chinese neo-Confucianism,</b> of neo-Platonism in late antiquity, of 19th century Hegelianism and neo-Hegelianism.<p>\n\nIf something that seems crazy must be true about the metaphysics of consciousness, or about the nature of objects and causes, or about the nature of moral value -- as extended philosophical discussions of these topics suggest probably is the case -- then to evaluate the possibilities without excess conservatism, we need to get used to bending our minds out of their usual ruts.<p>\n\nThis is my new favorite excuse for reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang\">Ted Chiang</a>, cyberpunk, and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/\">Zhuangzi</a>.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/81/45/32/814532579a6e428b679f279825525968.jpg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/04/common-sense-science-fiction-and-weird.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-04-21T10:59:00-07:00\">10:59 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=8142079485966570006\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">psychology of philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction?updated-max=2017-04-21T10:59:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=15&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6951978/\"><i>The Good Place</i> episode \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</a> won one of science fiction\u2019s most prestigious awards, the Hugo, in the category of best dramatic presentation, short form, I celebrated. I celebrated not because I loved the episode (in fact, I had so far only seen a couple of The Good Place\u2019s earlier episodes) but because, as a philosophy professor aiming to build bridges between academic philosophy and popular science fiction, the awarding of a Hugo to a show starring a professor of philosophy discussing a famous philosophical problem seemed to confirm that science fiction fans see some of the same synergies I see between science fiction and philosophy.<p>\n\nI do think the synergies are there and that the fans see and value them \u2013 as also revealed by the enduring popularity of The Matrix, and by West World, and Her, and Black Mirror, among others \u2013 but \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d, considered as a free-standing episode, fumbles the job. (Below, I will suggest a twist by which The Good Place could redeem itself in later episodes.)<p>\n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to be fussy when maybe I should just cheer and praise. And I\u2019m going to take the episode more philosophically seriously than maybe I should, treating it as not just light humor. But taking good science fiction philosophically seriously is important to me \u2013 and that means engaging critically. So here we go.<p>\n<i>The Philosophical Trolley Problem</i><p>\n\nThe trolley problem \u2013 the classic academic philosophy version of the trolley problem \u2013 concerns a pair of scenarios.<p>\n\nIn one scenario, the Switch case, you are standing beside a railroad track watching a runaway railcar (or \u201ctrolley\u201d) headed toward five people it will surely kill if you do nothing. You are standing by a switch, however, and you can flip the switch to divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. Unfortunately, there is one person on the side track who will be killed if you divert the trolley. Question: Should you flip the switch?<p>\n\nIn another scenario, the Push case, you are standing on a footbridge when you see the runaway railcar headed toward the five people. In this case, there is no switch. You do, however, happen to be standing beside a hiker with a heavy backpack, who you could push off the bridge into the path of the trolley, which will then grind to a halt on his body, killing him and saving the five. (You are too light to stop the trolley with your own body.) He is leaning over the railing, heedless of you, so you could just push him over. Question: Should you push the hiker?<p>\n\nThe interesting thing about these problems is that most people say it\u2019s okay to flip the switch in Switch but not okay to push the hiker in Push, despite the fact that in both cases you appear to be killing one person to save five. Is there really a meaningful difference between the cases? If so, what is it? Or are our ordinary intuitions about one or the other case wrong?<p>\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely puzzle, much, much debated in academic philosophy, often with intricate variations on the cases. (Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">one of my papers about it</a>.)<p>\n<i>The Problem with \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\n\u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d episode nicely sets up some basic trolley scenarios, adding also a medical case of killing one to save five (an involuntary organ donor). The philosophy professor character, Chidi, is teaching the material to the other characters.<p>\n\nSpoilers coming.<p>\n\nThe episode stumbles by trying to do two conflicting things.<p>\n\nFirst, it seizes the trope of the philosophy professor who can\u2019t put his theories into practice. The demon Michael sets up a simulated trolley, headed toward five victims, with Chidi at the helm. Chidi is called on to make a fast decision. He hesitates, agonizing, and crashes into the five. Micheal reruns the scenario with several variations, and it\u2019s clear that Chidi, faced with a practical decision requiring swift action, can\u2019t actually figure out what\u2019s best. (However, Chidi is clear that he wouldn\u2019t cut up a healthy patient in an involuntary organ donor case.)<p>\n\nSecond, incompatibly, the episode wants to affirm Chidi\u2019s moral expertise. Michael, the demon who enjoys torturing humans, can\u2019t seem to take Chidi\u2019s philosophy lessons seriously, despite Chidi\u2019s great knowledge of ethics. Michael tries to win Chidi\u2019s favor by giving him a previously unseen notebook of Kant\u2019s, but Chidi, with integrity that I suppose the viewer is expected to find admirable, casts the notebook aside, seeing it as a bribe. What Chidi really wants is for Michael to recognize his moral expertise. At the climax of the episode, Michael seems to do just this, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.</blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from within the episode whether we are supposed to regard Michael as sincere. Maybe not. Regardless, the viewer is invited to think that it\u2019s what Michael should say, what his attitude should be \u2013 and Chidi accepts the apology.<p>\n\nBut this resolution hardly fits with Chidi\u2019s failure in actual ethical decision making in the moment (a vice he also reveals in other episodes). Chidi has abstract, theoretical knowledge about ethical quandaries such as the trolley problem, and he is in some ways the most morally admirable of the lead characters, but his failure in vividly simulated trolley cases casts his practical ethical expertise into doubt. Nothing in the episode satisfactorily resolves that practical challenge to Chidi\u2019s expertise, pro or con.<p>\n<i>Ethical Expertise?</i><p>\n\nNow, as it happens, I am the world\u2019s leading expert on the ethical behavior of professional ethicists. (Yes, really. Admittedly, the <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">competition is limited</a>.)<p>\n\nThe one thing that shows most clearly from my and others\u2019 work on this topic, and which is anyway pretty evident if you spend much time around professional ethicists, is that ethicists, on average, behave more or less similarly to other people of similar social background \u2013 not especially better, not especially worse. From the fact that Chidi is a professor of ethics, nothing in particular follows about his moral behavior. Often, indeed, expertise in philosophical ethics appears to become expertise in constructing <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">post-hoc intellectual rationales for what you were inclined to do anyway</a>.<p>\n\nI hope you will agree with me about the following, concerning the philosophy of philosophy: Real ethical understanding is not a matter of what words you speak in classroom moments. It\u2019s a matter of what you choose and what you do habitually, regardless of whether you can tell your friends a handsome story about it, grounded in your knowledge of Kant. It\u2019s not clear that Chidi does have especially good ethical understanding in this practical sense. Moreover, to the extent Chidi does have some such practical ethical understanding, as a somewhat morally admirable person, it is not in virtue of his knowledge of Kant.<p>\n\nMichael should not be so deferential to Chidi\u2019s expertise, and especially he should not be deferential on the basis of Chidi\u2019s training as a philosopher. If, over the seasons, the characters improve morally, it is, or should be, because they learn from the practical situations they find themselves in, not because of Chidi\u2019s theoretical lessons.<p>\n<i>How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\nThus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics).<p>\n\nWhen the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.overthinkingit.com/2017/10/23/the-good-place-unlocked-season-2-episode-6-the-trolley-problem/\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Update, October 21, 2018:</i><p>\n\nWisecrack has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds\">terrific treatment of the philosophy of <i>The Good Place</i></a>, revealing that the show has a more nuanced view of the role of ethics lessons than one might infer from treating \"The Trolley Problem\" as a stand-alone work.

How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d Thus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics). When the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around.

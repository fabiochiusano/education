Image by Alvesgaspar.\" width=\"94\"/></a>The <em>Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</em>, a statue by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, has received <a href=\"http://theartnewspaper.com/news/conservation/rapture-restored-to-bernini-s-baroque-masterpiece-after-clean-up-reveals-unity-of-design-/\" target=\"_blank\">a thorough cleaning and restoration</a>, the first cleaning in 20 years. There were water stains from a leaking window and layers of black grime from dust accumulation, smog and other airborne pollutants. Now the bright white Carrara marble shines like it did when Bernini first polished it in 1652. Restorers also found something previous interventions overlooked: stucco and paint added to part of the travertine base to make it blend into the background of the chapel walls. Those additions have been removed, restoring to the base, which is not the usual geometric pediment but carved to look like a rising swirl of clouds, its original balance.</p>\n<p>The statue of Christian saint and mystic Teresa of \u00c1vila captured at the moment of religious ecstasy brought on by an angel in the course of repeatedly piercing her heart with an arrow is considered one of the great masterpieces of the High Roman Baroque. It was commissioned by Cardinal Federico Cornaro of the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20184\" target=\"_blank\">patrician Venice family</a> who had chosen Santa Maria della Vittoria as his burial site and wanted it significantly gussied up. He hired Bernini to design the entire chapel with the Saint Teresa group as the centerpiece because Santa Maria della Vittoria belonged to the Discalced Carmelites which was also Saint Teresa\u2019s order. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-self-portrait-ca-1623.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40519\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-self-portrait-ca-1623-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-self-portrait-ca-1623-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-self-portrait-ca-1623-200x260.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gian-Lorenzo-Bernini-self-portrait-ca-1623-430x559.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gian Lorenzo Bernini self-portrait, ca. 1623\" width=\"115\"/></a>Bernini, the leading sculptor of the age and internationally famous years at this point, was taking smaller private commissions from noblemen like Cornaro because he was between papal patrons. Pope Urban VIII, an avid art collector and a major patron of Bernini\u2019s who gave him the most important public jobs like the construction of St. Peter\u2019s Square, had died in 1644 and the new Pope Innocent X, wasn\u2019t a fan. Bernini only got one public job under Innocent, the Fountain of the Four Rivers in Piazza Navona. He got back in the papal graces with the election of Pope Alexander VII in 1655. The creation of <em>Teresa</em> and the chapel took up a good chunk of the interregnum, from 1647 to 1652.</p>\n<p>Saint Teresa was still a fresh face on the saint scene, having died in 1582 and been canonized in 1622, but she had been renown and revered in life thanks to her mystical writings. Bernini\u2019s sculpture depicts a famous episode from her life, an ecstatic vision of the exquisite pain of God\u2019s love. We have Teresa\u2019s own description of this ecstatic vision in <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/SantaTeresaDeAvilaWorksComplete/SaintTeresaOfAvilaCollectedWorksComplete#page/n251/mode/1up\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 29 of her autobiography, <em>The Life of Teresa of Jesus</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I saw close to me toward my left side an angel in bodily form. I don\u2019t usually see angels in bodily form except on rare occasions; although many times angels appear to me, but without my seeing them, as in the intellectual vision I spoke about before. This time, though, the Lord desired that I see the vision in the following way: the angel was not large but small; he was very beautiful, and his face was so aflame that he seemed to be one of those very sublime angels that appear to be all afire. They must belong to those they call the cherubim, for they didn\u2019t tell me their names. But I see clearly that in heaven there is so much difference between some angels and others and between these latter and still others that I wouldn\u2019t know how to explain it. I saw in his hands a large golden dart and at the end of the iron tip there appeared to be a little fire. It seemed to me this angel plunged the dart several times into my heart and that it reached deep within me. When he drew it out, I thought he was carrying off with him the deepest part of me; and he left me all on fire with great love of God. The pain was so great that it made me moan, and the sweetness this greatest pain caused me was so superabundant that there is no desire capable of taking it away; nor is the soul content with less than God.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-40518\" height=\"169\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome-200x169.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome-200x169.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome-150x126.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome-430x363.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria, just before the restoration was complete.

Teresa\u2019s face is the very picture of bliss, a sensual, erotic, lip-parted expression that has been copied and sketched by artists ever since. Bernini carved the whole sculpture out of a single piece of marble, playing with texture and thickness to give the draping of the clothes a natural softness. The areas where the marble is thinnest are almost translucent. The cloud base serves as Teresa\u2019s fainting couch and symbolizes the support of the divine granting her this vision. On the walls of the chapel are two trompe l\u2019oeil theater boxes in which the most illustrious members of the Cornaro family, including Cardinal Federico Cornaro and Doge Giovanni I Cornaro, watch and discuss Teresa\u2019s ecstasy like so many pervie Statlers and Waldorfs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Oculo-e-angelo-dopo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40513\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Oculo-e-angelo-dopo-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Oculo-e-angelo-dopo-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Oculo-e-angelo-dopo-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Oculo-e-angelo-dopo-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Oculo-e-angelo-dopo.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Window and angel after restoration.

Preliminary estimates suggest the church dates to the 5th century and the frescoes that have been revealed so far \u2014 on the ceiling and very tops of the walls \u2014 are still in brilliant color. There are scenes of Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, the Ascension, saints and Old Testament prophets including Moses and Elijah.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nev\u015fehir Mayor Hasan \u00dcnver said the frescoes in the church showed the rise of Jesus the Christ into the sky and the killing of the bad souls. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that such frescoes have so far never been seen in any other church,\u201d \u00dcnver said[\u2026.]</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is reported that some of the frescoes here are unique. There are exciting depictions like fish falling from the hand of Jesus Christ, him rising up into the sky, and the bad souls being killed.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>That reference to bad souls being killed is not clear to me. It could be the Last Judgement, I suppose, but the souls of the wicked are damned, not killed. They wish they were killed! That\u2019s kind of the whole point of Hell. I wonder if it\u2019s a reference to the Harrowing of Hell derived from <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm\" target=\"_blank\">1 Peter 3:19-20</a> that refers to Jesus preaching to evil souls/spirits (ie, Luciferian demons, rather than the souls of dead people) imprisoned in Limbo/Hell/Hades. It was a popular theme in Orthodox art. In fact, it first appears in Orthodox art significantly earlier than in Catholic art. The Western tradition appears to have only begun to borrow it from the Orthodox in the 8th century. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-fresco.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40504\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-fresco-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-fresco-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-fresco-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-fresco-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"Church fresco under Nev\u015fehir Castle.

People have been beehiving under this place for an estimated 5,000 years. They cut out everything from water conduits to private dwellings to hermit cells and Christian churches. Nev\u015fehir Castle Urban Transformation Project has been excavating the tunnels underneath the castle and 11 neighborhoods in the old town center. They\u2019re excited at the prospect that the discovery of such early frescoes with unique iconography could make Nev\u015fehir a site of pilgrimage for Orthodox Christians.</p>\n<p>Nev\u015fehir was in what had once been the kingdom of Cappadocia, absorbed into the Roman Empire by Tiberius in 17 A.D. The tunnels were used as catacombs during the thornier years of Christian persecution, but the practice of cutting whole churches out of the rock grew out of the 4th century anchorite tradition. Cappadocia was an important center of Church thought in the 4th century, known particularly for the Cappadocian Fathers, Basil the Great (bishop and saint), Gregory of Nyssa (bishop and saint) and Gregory of Nazianzus (archbishop and saint), who sought to introduce the Greek philosophical rigor to Christian theology. It was Saint Basil who encouraged the development of nascent anchorite communities where people who wished to withdraw from the world could dedicate the rest of their lives to penance and prayer. In the Nev\u015fehir area, the anchorites made cells for themselves by digging them out of the soft rock. Over time the underground monastic communities carved themselves out increasingly large and elaborate churches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-frescoes-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-40502\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-frescoes-2-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-frescoes-2-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-frescoes-2-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-frescoes-2-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Nev\u015fehir-Castle-church-frescoes-2.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Detail showing beginning of damage to the walls.

The space must be dried gradually to ensure there is no paint loss or fading. From what has already been exposed, archaeologists can see that whole sections of the frescoed walls have collapsed inward, likely due to rain and snow. They hope the fragments may be recoverable in the fill, but won\u2019t be back until the weather warms up this spring and all the moisture has evaporated. At that point they will continue removing the earth, hopefully discovering restorable pieces of the wall paintings or, in the best case scenario, sections of intact side walls as they dig down.</p>\n<p>Once the church is fully excavated, we\u2019ll know its dimensions \u2014 right now we can\u2019t even tell how high it is \u2014 and get a glimpse of what may prove to be very significant early and transitional iconographic elements in the history of Byzantine art. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Early Christian church with unique frescoes found in Turkey\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40501\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40501#comments\">15 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-40491\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40491\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Getty buys Orazio Gentileschi\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Dana\u00eb&lt;/em&gt; for record $30.5 million\">Getty buys Orazio Gentileschi\u2019s <em>Dana\u00eb</em> for record $30.5 million</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, January 29th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OOrazio-Gentileschi-Dana\u00eb-1621.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-40497\" height=\"301\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OOrazio-Gentileschi-Dana\u00eb-1621-430x301.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OOrazio-Gentileschi-Dana\u00eb-1621-430x301.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OOrazio-Gentileschi-Dana\u00eb-1621-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OOrazio-Gentileschi-Dana\u00eb-1621-200x140.jpg 200w\" title=\"Dana\u00eb, by Orazio Gentileschi, ca. 1621.

The entire sale of 61 lots took in a comparatively meager total of $53,473,500. If she were a film, <em>Dana\u00eb</em> would be a summer tentpole.</p>\n<p>The work was part of a series of three paintings commissioned by Giovanni Antonio Sauli, a wealthy nobleman from Genoa, in 1621. Sauli encountered Gentileschi that year when he was in Rome with an ambassadorial delegation to honor the newly elected Pope Gregory XV. Orazio\u2019s brother had already done some work for Sauli, and with Orazio\u2019s reputation as fine artist well-established in Rome, Sauli asked him to come home with him and make some paintings for his palazzo. Orazio accepted the job, which also entailed curating Sauli\u2019s art purchases, and lived in Genoa for three years until he left for France in 1624 to work for Marie de Medici, Regent of France, a pretty dramatic upgrade as patrons go which can be in significant part attributed to the success of the Sauli series.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Orazio-Gentileschi-Penitent-Magdalene-Private-Collection-New-York.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-40492\" height=\"160\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Orazio-Gentileschi-Penitent-Magdalene-Private-Collection-New-York-200x160.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Orazio-Gentileschi-Penitent-Magdalene-Private-Collection-New-York-200x160.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Orazio-Gentileschi-Penitent-Magdalene-Private-Collection-New-York-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Orazio-Gentileschi-Penitent-Magdalene-Private-Collection-New-York-430x344.jpg 430w\" title=\"Penitent Magdalene by Orazio Gentileschi, ca. 1623, Private Collection, New York.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The three works he painted for Sauli are <em>Dana\u00eb</em>, <em>Penitent Magdalene</em> and<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/108894/orazio-gentileschi-lot-and-his-daughters-italian-about-1622/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Lot and his Daughters</em></a>. Drawn from different religious traditions \u2014 Greek mythology, the New Testament, the Hebrew Scriptures \u2014 the three subjects shared a thematic connection of the human connection to the divine and a stylistic connection of being something on the naughty side. They were very popular and immediately well-known, boosting Gentileschi\u2019s fame and triggering a number of commissions from other local noblemen, the Duke of Savoy, and finally the gig with the ruler of France. The <em>Dana\u00eb</em> is generally considered by art historians from the 18th century to the present to be the greatest of the three.</p>\n<p>For centuries <em>Dana\u00eb</em> remained with Sauli\u2019s descendants, only reemerging in 1975.

For many years since it first emerged after centuries of being lost, the Cleveland work was thought to be the rediscovered original, but the original has pentimenti that the copy does not have, and it\u2019s painted in the more rigid, formal manner of a copy. Gentileschi made multiple copies of the other works in the series as well. It was common for artists to make replicas of their most successful and sought-after pieces.</p>\n<p>The Getty is, of course, <a href=\"http://news.getty.edu/article_display.cfm?article_id=6039\" target=\"_blank\">thrilled with its new acquisition</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dana\u00eb-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40494\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dana\u00eb-det-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dana\u00eb-det-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dana\u00eb-det-200x257.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dana\u00eb-det-430x553.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dana\u00eb-det.jpg 1554w\" title=\"Dana\u00eb detail.

Image courtesy NYPL.\" width=\"86\"/></a>The New York Public Library has a collection of more than 45,000 historical restaurant menus from the 1840s to the present. It\u2019s one of the largest menu collections in the world and it\u2019s still growing, with Culinary Collections librarian (such a great job title) <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/staff-profiles/rebecca-federman\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca Federman</a> at the helm. She is the latest in a line descending from a formidable visionary named Miss Frank E. Buttolph who began collecting every menu she could get her hands on, mainly by writing with unstinting dedication to restaurants, palaces, banquet halls, whoever had the goods all over the world. </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a hobby or even about the food for her. Miss Buttolph dedicated her life to collecting menus because she believed they had genuine historical value. She made a point of seeking out menus used by notable personages or that were on the table when momentous events took place around them. Events include the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandria, the Prussian Siege of Paris in 1870, the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo where President McKinley was assassinated and a banquet thrown by Emperor of Japan for William Howard Taft, then Secretary of War, during the 1905 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Katsura_agreement\" target=\"_blank\">Taft\u2013Katsura discussion</a>.</p>\n<p>An article published in the June 3rd, 1906, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9B04E0DF1E3EE733A25750C0A9609C946797D6CF\" target=\"_blank\">issue of the <em>New York Times</em> (pdf)</a> acknowledged the drive for historic preservation underpinning her collection in amusing terms.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Miss Buttolph is making history for the year 2,000 which, should our present carnivorous natures by that time merge into a diet mild and milky, will hold this generation up as an example of brute force that should annihilate all our virtues and leave us in the eyes of our descendants a race of horror and greed, a pack of flesh-eating outcasts remarkable only for our gastronomic endurance.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Astor-House-1843.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40488\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Astor-House-1843-64x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Astor-House-1843-64x150.jpg 64w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Astor-House-1843-128x300.jpg 128w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Astor-House-1843-341x800.jpg 341w\" title=\"Astor House breakfast menu, 1843.

Just like a plate of celery. Coffee and tea appear the most frequently in the collection. Celery takes third place. The real stand-out to me, now that the year 2,000 has come and gone, is how lacking in variety so many of these menus are. Basically, if it\u2019s fine dining, it has to be French or French-adjacent. There is little distinction between an <a href=\"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/9646e498-2bdf-2194-e040-e00a18063eda\" target=\"_blank\">1843 breakfast menu in New York</a> and <a href=\"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47db-1a0f-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\" target=\"_blank\">a dinner menu from 1857 in Mobile, Alabama</a>. It\u2019s a lot of meat with French-like preparations, although at least the Battle House in Mobile had very respectable pie options. It\u2019s all nuts and fruit in New York. Even the <a href=\"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47db-6cc5-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99#/?uuid=510d47db-6cc2-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\" target=\"_blank\">menu from the Streets of Mexico Restaurant</a> at the Pan-American Exposition had far more ragout of beef, boiled trout with hollandaise and roast lamb with mint sauce than food remotely related to Mexico. The tamales and enchiladas (25 cents apiece), chili con carne, salsa and frijoles (15 cents apiece) at the very top of the menu were forced to carry the full burden of Mexicanness.</p>\n<p>In 1899 Miss Frank E. Buttolph offered her collection of menus, already in the thousands, to the New York Public Library and offered to continue adding to the collection. NYPL director Dr. John Shaw Billings accepted both generous offers and Miss Frank collected menus for the library the next 25 years until her death in 1924. The Buttolph Collection of Menus had 25,000 menus in it at the time of her death.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Battle-House-Mobile-Alabama-1857.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40487\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Battle-House-Mobile-Alabama-1857-97x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Battle-House-Mobile-Alabama-1857-97x150.jpg 97w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Battle-House-Mobile-Alabama-1857-194x300.jpg 194w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Battle-House-Mobile-Alabama-1857-430x664.jpg 430w\" title=\"Battle House hotel, Mobile, Alabama, 1857.

The digitization project is ongoing, but it\u2019s not an easy job. Some of the menus are in very delicate condition and require conservation before they can be scanned. Meanwhile, the collection is only searchable at a very basic level. Information that was in the catalogue description \u2014 location, date range, name of hostelry \u2014 is the only data that can be searched digitally. The menu items themselves are not.</p>\n<p>To remedy this, the NYPL started an <a href=\"http://menus.nypl.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">open transcription project</a> where volunteers can hand-enter all the details on the menu from food to wine list to prices. The power of the crowd is more effective in this case than OCR scanning because a lot of the menus have condition issues that make the letters less clear, crooked layouts or handwritten entries. A person would have to edit every OCRd page anyway, so best to cut the middleman.</p>\n<p>It seems like the project is just about caught up right now. Every decade I clicked on showed the menu transcriptions as done, but <a href=\"http://menus.nypl.org/menus/status/new\" target=\"_blank\">bookmark this page</a> and check it out once in a while for a new influx of digitized menus. There are a lot of treasures mentioned in several turn-of-the-century NYT articles that have yet to be digitized. I\u2019d love to catch one of those fresh off the presses.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Browse 18,000 historic menus in the New York Public Library\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40485\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40485#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-40481\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40481\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 2,500-year-old footprints of people, dogs found in Arizona\">2,500-year-old footprints of people, dogs found in Arizona</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, January 27th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>I don\u2019t quite have it in me yet to do a research-intensive post but I can\u2019t stand to be out for three days in a row, especially since you have all been so incredibly solicitous of my health.

The prints of men, women, children and dogs were left in the mud during a wet day. The mud dried into a solid crust and then a few days later a flash flood inundated the area with a layer of sandy silt that preserved the prints in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>The prints are so extensive and clear that it\u2019s possible to trace people\u2019s movements during the course of the day. The imprints of irrigation ditches have also survived, and the business of the print groupings suggest the adults were working assiduously to manage the irrigation system during heavy rain or a rise in the nearby Santa Cruz River. They walked from one irrigation gate to another, building or flattening earthwork dams to direct the extra water to their maize plants. There are prints of an adult walking next to a child and marks left when the adult picked up the child before putting him or her back down. There are prints of adults walking to the irrigation canals while children and a dog follow them.</p>\n<p>While far older footprints have been found in North America (ca. 13,000 years old), these are likely the oldest ever discovered north of Mexico in the Southwest, and they are the earliest evidence of formal farming in the US Southwest.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ancient civilization that lived here represents what archaeologists call the early agricultural period, a time even before people in the region had developed ceramics.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a transition era from a lifestyle defined by hunter-gatherers to a settling down,\u201d said Jerome Hesse, with SWCA Environmental Consultants.</p>\n<p>Exactly how the people here lived their lives or organized their society is unknown, but Hesse said they likely lived at least part of the year at this and other sites in the region, cultivating crops in irrigated fields.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So far 4,300 square feet of the site have been exposed, and there\u2019s likely more to be found, but time is not on archaeology\u2019s side. The construction project will not be delayed or moved and it will destroy this unique discovery. In order to preserve what they can of this treasure, archaeologists have taken latex and epoxy molds of specific footprints, and the site is being documented virtually with high-resolution 3D models.</p>\n<p>Here are a few of the models for you to explore.

ScottishPower Renewables (SPR) and Vattenfall scanned the seabed with advanced sonar technology for two years. They covered more than 6,000 square kilometers (2,317 square miles) and discovered more than 60 wrecks in the process, most of them were known. The submarine came as a surprise.</p>\n<p>When it was first discovered at a depth of 98 feet about 55 miles east of the Norfolk coast, experts couldn\u2019t be sure which wreck it was. The find was reported to the Receiver of Wreck in the UK, but the scanning company, Dutch contractors Fugro, suggested they contact the Royal Netherlands Navy in case the wreck was of a Dutch submarine from World War II the Dutch Navy has been looking for: military submarine HNLMS O13, last seen in June 1940 while on a mission to patrol the sea between Denmark and Norway. It is The Netherlands\u2019 last unaccounted for missing World War II submarine.</p>\n<p>A team of Dutch Navy divers explored the wreck and filmed it in the hopes of getting enough information to conclusively identify the submarine. They found the wreck was 57.6 meters (189 feet) long, 4.1 meters (13.5 feet) wide and 4.6 meters (15 feet) high. Some damage at the bow and stern may have trimmed off some length. Debris found around the wreck suggests it was originally more than 60 meters (197 feet) long. The footage of the submarine captured the conning tower and deck which marked it as a German vessel. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/U-31-model.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-40472\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/U-31-model-200x96.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/U-31-model-200x96.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/U-31-model-150x72.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/U-31-model-430x208.jpg 430w\" title=\"U-31 model. Image courtesy www.militaryhistory.x10.mx\" width=\"200\"/></a>Researchers were able to match it to the Type U-31 German World War I U-boat, the first in a series of eleven sequentially numbered submarines built between 1912 and 1915. Only U-31 and U-34 were known to have been in the area before their disappearance.</p>\n<p>The wreck was found in September of 2012. It has taken more than three years to finally identify it as U-31. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Mark Dunkley, marine archaeologist at Historic England adds: \u201cSM U-31 was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy in September 1914. On 13th January 1915, the U-31 slipped its mooring and sailed north-west from Wilhelmshaven for a routine patrol and disappeared. It is thought that U-31 had struck a mine off England\u2019s east coast and sank with the loss of its entire complement of 4 officers, 31 men.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cThe discovery and identification of SM U-31 by ScottishPower Renewables and Vattenfall, lying some 91km east of Caister-on-Sea, Norfolk, is a significant achievement. After being on the seabed for over a century, the submarine appears to be in a remarkable condition with the conning tower present and the bows partially buried.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelatives and descendants of those lost in the U-31 may now take some comfort in knowing the final resting place of the crew and the discovery serves as a poignant reminder of all those lost at sea, on land and in the air during the First World War.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Because it is an official military maritime grave, the wreck will not be excavated or disturbed. Any future windfarms built in the area will be done without interference with the grave site.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some wonderful raw footage of the dive by Lamlash North Sea Diving. It\u2019s some of the best underwater exploration footage I\u2019ve seen. You get to see the divers at work in the environment, the light adjustments, the changes in visibility; it\u2019s not just still-worthy shots of the U-boat spliced together. Also the crabs rule there now. That blue crab at the end is clearly claiming the vessel as his own.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/5lT3CZs7u9o&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Uncharted WWI U-boat found off English coast\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40469\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40469#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-40456\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40456\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Reviewing the Dare Stone, clue to Lost Colony of Roanoke\">Reviewing the Dare Stone, clue to Lost Colony of Roanoke</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, January 23rd, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Haywood-Pearce-Jr.-with-Emory-colleagues-James-G.-Lester-left-and-Ben-W.-Gibson-put-the-stone-under-the-microscope..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40458\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Haywood-Pearce-Jr.-with-Emory-colleagues-James-G.-Lester-left-and-Ben-W.-Gibson-put-the-stone-under-the-microscope.-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Haywood-Pearce-Jr.-with-Emory-colleagues-James-G.-Lester-left-and-Ben-W.-Gibson-put-the-stone-under-the-microscope.-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Haywood-Pearce-Jr.-with-Emory-colleagues-James-G.-Lester-left-and-Ben-W.-Gibson-put-the-stone-under-the-microscope.-200x177.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Haywood-Pearce-Jr.-with-Emory-colleagues-James-G.-Lester-left-and-Ben-W.-Gibson-put-the-stone-under-the-microscope.-430x382.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Haywood-Pearce-Jr.-with-Emory-colleagues-James-G.-Lester-left-and-Ben-W.-Gibson-put-the-stone-under-the-microscope..jpg 1200w\" title=\"Haywood Pearce, Jr. with Emory colleagues James G.

Hammond who claimed to have discovered it while looking for hickory nuts in a swamp on the east bank of the Chowan River near Edenton, North Carolina, in September of 1937. He couldn\u2019t read the inscription which appeared to be in an unknown foreign language. Two months later he showed the stone to historians at Emory University in Atlanta, among them Dr. Haywood Pearce, Jr., hoping to get the inscription translated. They determined that it was English and made out the names \u201cAnanias Dare &amp; Virginia\u201d on the front of the stone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40462\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-front-109x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-front-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-front-200x274.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-front-430x589.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-front.jpg 875w\" title=\"The first Dare Stone, front.

The daughter of Ananias and Eleanor White Dare, Virginia Dare was the first English child born in North America. She and her parents were part of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28279\" target=\"_blank\">a group of English settlers</a> sent by Sir Walter Raleigh to settle his land claim in the Chesapeake Bay area of Virginia. Eleanor\u2019s father John White dropped the 118 people off on Roanoke Island in July of 1587 and went back to England for supplies a couple of weeks later. His return was delayed by a little contretemps with the Spanish Armada. When he finally reached the shores of Roanoke again three years had passed and the only sign of his daughter, granddaughter and the rest of the colonists was the word \u201cCROATOAN\u201d carved on a wooden post. Neither White nor anyone else that we know of saw any of the Roanoke colonists again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40461\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-back-109x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-back-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-back-200x274.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-back-430x590.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/original-Dare-stone-back.jpg 874w\" title=\"The first Dare Stone, back.

Emory wasn\u2019t interested in pursuing it, so Pearce, who was vice president of Brenau College (today Brenau University) in Gainesville, Georgia, where his father, Haywood Pearce, Sr., was president, recommended the college acquire the stone. It did, for $1,000. Shortly thereafter, Pearce Jr. went with Hammond to the purported find site. Pearce thought it might be a grave marker and hoped to discover the grave of Ananias and Virginia Dare. They found nothing that first time and found nothing the four more times they explored the swamps over the next year and a half, but the locals reported all kinds of stories of having seen other stones, even the mast of a ship, in the swamp. </p>\n<p>Pearce was tantalized by the possibility that there might be more markers with information on the Lost Colony and recklessly offered a $500 reward for any stones connected to the Roanoke colonists. Not surprisingly, inscribed stones suddenly started <a href=\"http://nativeheritageproject.com/2013/12/08/the-dare-stones-1-through-48/\" target=\"_blank\">popping up like weeds</a>. Brenau University wound up with close to 50 of these stones, most of them \u201cdiscovered\u201d by a stonecutter from Fulton County, Georgia, named Bill Eberhardt. Three other people who claimed to have found inscribed stones were later found to be connected to Eberhardt.</p>\n<p>A 1940 preliminary report by a team of 34 historians commissioned by the Smithsonian Institution and headed by Samuel Eliot Morison of Harvard found no evidence the stones were fake and declared that a \u201cpreponderance of evidence points to the authenticity of the stones.\u201d The Dare Stones made big headlines, putting Brenau on the map. Cecil B. DeMille expressed interest in doing a movie about Roanoke based on the stones. </p>\n<p>The good press came to an end on April 26th, 1941, when an <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/ego/iammagi/dare_writ_on_rocke.htm\" target=\"_blank\">article by Boyden Sparkes in the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em></a> exposed the stones as frauds, possibly made in collusion with the Pearces who had received much benefit in prestige and attention. The spelling was too consistent to be Elizabethan, Sparkes\u2019 research concluded, and words like \u201cprimeval\u201d and \u201creconnoiter\u201d in the inscriptions weren\u2019t used in English until a century after the time they were meant to have been carved in stone. Hammond was a shadowy figure that not even the Pinkerton Detective Agency could pin down. The stones were found as far south as the Chattahoochee River just outside Atlanta, an implausible distance for this trail of stone bread crumbs to travel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Whitestone-Motion-Pictures-crew-apply-flour-to-the-Dare-Stones-to-try-and-match-stones-up-with-the-translated-text..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40459\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Whitestone-Motion-Pictures-crew-apply-flour-to-the-Dare-Stones-to-try-and-match-stones-up-with-the-translated-text.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Whitestone-Motion-Pictures-crew-apply-flour-to-the-Dare-Stones-to-try-and-match-stones-up-with-the-translated-text.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Whitestone-Motion-Pictures-crew-apply-flour-to-the-Dare-Stones-to-try-and-match-stones-up-with-the-translated-text.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Whitestone-Motion-Pictures-crew-apply-flour-to-the-Dare-Stones-to-try-and-match-stones-up-with-the-translated-text.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Whitestone Motion Pictures crew apply flour to the Dare Stones to try and match stones up with the translated text for History Channel documentary.

They were kept in the Brenau University basement boiler room and only rarely received attention from scholars and documentarians. They made an appearance in a 1977 episode of the <em>In Search of\u2026</em> series hosted by Leonard Nimoy dedicated to the Lost Colony. (Watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaqG6rC4hIw\" target=\"_blank\">full episode here</a>.) A book published in 1991, <em>A Witness for Eleanor Dare</em>, by Robert W. White, <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/ego/iammagi/dare_chap3.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rebutted Sparkes\u2019 article</a> and weighed in on the side of authenticity. In 2013, the History Channel documentary <a href=\"http://www.history.com/shows/america-unearthed/season-1/episode-7\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mystery of Roanoke</em></a> touched on the stones. Last October, the History Channel <a href=\"https://www.brenau.edu/news/docudrama-bolsters-dare-stone-credibility/\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated a new special</a> to the Dare Stones. <a href=\"http://www.history.com/shows/roanoke-search-for-the-lost-colony\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Roanoke: Search for the Lost Colony</em></a> found new linguistic evidence suggesting that the first stone might be authentic. </p>\n<p>Now Brenau University is <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/is-this-stone-linked-to-the-lost-colony-of-roanoke-1453419623?mod=topix\" target=\"_blank\">taking a fresh look at the first Dare Stone</a>, the only one that has even a chance of being real.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Brenau President Ed] Schrader has begun to assemble a team of experts in various disciplines\u2014archaeology, geology, history and the study of Elizabethan writing\u2014to re-examine the quartz stone. Sometime in this year or next, he wants to launch an expedition to the Chowan River near Edenton, N.C., where the first rock is believed to have been found, to search for more evidence.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it is real, it is the most important pre-colonial artifact by Europeans in the Americas,\u201d the 64-year-old says, softly placing is fingers on the stone. \u201cThe speculation\u2019s gone on long enough.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Reviewing the Dare Stone, clue to Lost Colony of Roanoke\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40456\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40456#comments\">14 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-40441\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40441\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Harihara head and body reunited after 130 years\">Harihara head and body reunited after 130 years</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, January 22nd, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara_Mus\u00e9e_Guimet.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40450\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara_Mus\u00e9e_Guimet-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara_Mus\u00e9e_Guimet-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara_Mus\u00e9e_Guimet-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara_Mus\u00e9e_Guimet-430x572.jpg 430w\" title=\"Head of Harihara statue, 7th c.

From 1874 through 1882 or 1883, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/\u00c9tienne-Aymonier.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40448\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/\u00c9tienne-Aymonier-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/\u00c9tienne-Aymonier-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/\u00c9tienne-Aymonier-200x289.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/\u00c9tienne-Aymonier-430x623.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/\u00c9tienne-Aymonier.jpg 1466w\" title=\"\u00c9tienne Aymonier\" width=\"103\"/></a>Aymonier surveyed ancient temples and monasteries in southern Cambodia and helped himself to a large number of artifacts which he brought back to France with him. Aymonier\u2019s collection of Khmer treasures went on display at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889. The next year they were joined to the Asian collection of the <a href=\"http://www.guimet.fr/fr/\" target=\"_blank\">Guimet Museum</a> in Paris.</p>\n<p>Harihara is a syncretic deity that blends elements of Vishnu and Shiva, the deities of creation and destruction. The iconography of the statue head is typical of Harihara: the elaborate hairstyle of braids bound together in a multilayer bun on one side of the top of the head, a cylindrical mitre on the other side, a third eye on the forehead and a crescent moon in the middle of the hair.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara-body.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-40447\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara-body-122x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara-body-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara-body-200x245.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara-body-430x528.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Harihara-body.jpg 833w\" title=\"Harihara body\" width=\"122\"/></a>While the head was in the museum in France, in 1913 French archaeologist Henri Parmentier found the headless body of a statue in Phnom Da. In 1944 the body was moved to the <a href=\"http://www.cambodiamuseum.info/en_information_visitors.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum of Cambodia</a> in Phnom Penh. Just over a decade later in 1955, Cambodian archaeology expert Pierre Dupont posited that the head in the Guimet and the body in the Phnom Penh museum belonged together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Reattaching-Harihara-statue-head.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-40443\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Reattaching-Harihara-statue-head-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Reattaching-Harihara-statue-head-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Reattaching-Harihara-statue-head-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Reattaching-Harihara-statue-head-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Conservators reattach Harihara head to body\" width=\"150\"/></a>Dupont\u2019s hypothesis was recently proved correct when the restoration workshop of the National Museum made a mold of the upper body and sent it to France. It matched the head perfectly. The head and other artifacts collected by Aymonier now at the Guimet were legally exported, so there was no question of a lawsuit or court case. Aymonier had the permission of King Norodom to export the works to France where they would be exhibited to show the West the importance and beauty of Khmer art. The Guimet and the National Museum made a deal to exchange the head for the recently excavated pedestal of a 10th century that matches a statue in the Guimet collection. Both pieces are on permanent loan, so there\u2019s no official change in legal ownership.</p>\n<p>On January 21st, conservators reattached the head of Harihara to the body at the National Museum in Phnom Penh. The ceremony was attended by 200 people, including government and museum officials, diplomats, foreign dignitaries.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAfter it was separated 130 years ago, we are welcoming the reunification of the head and the torso of Harihara,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Sok An said at the ceremony. \u201cAccording to our Khmer culture, the reunion is symbolic of prosperity.\u201d  </p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cambodian-Deputy-Prime-Minister-Sok-An-sprays-perfume-on-Harihara.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-40442\" height=\"286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cambodian-Deputy-Prime-Minister-Sok-An-sprays-perfume-on-Harihara-430x286.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cambodian-Deputy-Prime-Minister-Sok-An-sprays-perfume-on-Harihara-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cambodian-Deputy-Prime-Minister-Sok-An-sprays-perfume-on-Harihara-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cambodian-Deputy-Prime-Minister-Sok-An-sprays-perfume-on-Harihara-200x133.jpg 200w\" title=\"Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Sok An sprays perfume on rejoined Harihara.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Harihara head and body reunited after 130 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40441\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/40441#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2016/01/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

There were water stains from a leaking window and layers of black grime from dust accumulation, smog and other airborne pollutants. Now the bright white Carrara marble shines like it did when Bernini first polished it in 1652. Restorers also found something previous interventions overlooked: stucco and paint added to part of the travertine base to make it blend into the background of the chapel walls.

Pope Urban VIII, an avid art collector and a major patron of Bernini\u2019s who gave him the most important public jobs like the construction of St. Peter\u2019s Square, had died in 1644 and the new Pope Innocent X, wasn\u2019t a fan. Bernini only got one public job under Innocent, the Fountain of the Four Rivers in Piazza Navona. He got back in the papal graces with the election of Pope Alexander VII in 1655.

We have Teresa\u2019s own description of this ecstatic vision in <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/SantaTeresaDeAvilaWorksComplete/SaintTeresaOfAvilaCollectedWorksComplete#page/n251/mode/1up\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 29 of her autobiography, <em>The Life of Teresa of Jesus</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I saw close to me toward my left side an angel in bodily form. I don\u2019t usually see angels in bodily form except on rare occasions; although many times angels appear to me, but without my seeing them, as in the intellectual vision I spoke about before. This time, though, the Lord desired that I see the vision in the following way: the angel was not large but small; he was very beautiful, and his face was so aflame that he seemed to be one of those very sublime angels that appear to be all afire. They must belong to those they call the cherubim, for they didn\u2019t tell me their names. But I see clearly that in heaven there is so much difference between some angels and others and between these latter and still others that I wouldn\u2019t know how to explain it. I saw in his hands a large golden dart and at the end of the iron tip there appeared to be a little fire. It seemed to me this angel plunged the dart several times into my heart and that it reached deep within me. When he drew it out, I thought he was carrying off with him the deepest part of me; and he left me all on fire with great love of God. The pain was so great that it made me moan, and the sweetness this greatest pain caused me was so superabundant that there is no desire capable of taking it away; nor is the soul content with less than God.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-40518\" height=\"169\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome-200x169.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome-200x169.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome-150x126.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cornaro_chapel_in_Santa_Maria_della_Vittoria_in_Rome-430x363.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria, just before the restoration was complete.

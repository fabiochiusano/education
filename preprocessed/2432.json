{"content": "More details have emerged about a controversial 2015 patient data-sharing arrangement between Google DeepMind and a UK National Health Service Trust which paint a contrasting picture vs the pair\u2019s public narrative about their intended use of 1.6 million citizens\u2019 medical records. DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust signed their initial\u00a0 information sharing agreement \u00a0(ISA) in September 2015 \u2014 ostensibly to co-develop a clinical task management app, called Streams, for early detection of an acute kidney condition using an NHS algorithm. Patients whose fully identifiable medical records were being shared with the Google-owned company were neither asked for their consent nor informed their data was being handed to the commercial entity. Indeed, the arrangement was only announced to the public five months after it was inked \u2014 and months after patient data had already started to flow. And it was only fleshed out in any real detail after a\u00a0 New Scientist \u00a0journalist obtained and published the ISA \u00a0between the pair, in April 2016 \u2014 revealing for the first time, via a Freedom of Information request, quite how much medical data was being shared for an app that targets a single condition. This led to an investigation being opened by the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog into the legality of the arrangement. And as public pressure mounted over the scope and intentions behind the medical records collaboration, the pair stuck to their line that patient data was not being used for training artificial intelligence. They also claimed they did not need to seek patient consent for their medical records to be shared because the resulting app would be used for direct patient care \u2014 a claimed legal basis that has since been demolished by the ICO , which concluded a more than year-long investigation in July. However a series of newly released documents shows that applying AI to the patient data was in fact a goal for DeepMind right from the earliest months of its partnership with the Royal Free \u2014\u00a0with its intention being to utilize the wide-ranging access to and control of publicly-funded medical data it was being granted by the Trust to simultaneously develop its own AI models. In a FAQ note on its website when it publicly announced the collaboration, in February 2016, DeepMind wrote:\u00a0\u201cNo, artificial intelligence is not part of the early-stage pilots we\u2019re announcing today. It\u2019s too early to determine where AI could be applied here, but it\u2019s certainly something we are excited about for the future.\u201d Omitted from that description of its plans was the fact it had already received a favorable ethical opinion from an NHS Health Research Authority research ethics committee to run a two-year AI research study on the same underlying NHS patient data. The newly\u00a0 released documents , obtained via an FOI filed by health data privacy advocacy organization medConfidential , show DeepMind made an ethics application for an AI research project using Royal Free patient data in October 2015 \u2014 with the stated aim of \u201cusing machine learning to improve prediction of acute kidney injury and general patient deterioration\u201d. Earlier still, in May 2015, the company gained confirmation from an insurer to cover its potential liability for the research project \u2014 which it subsequently notes having in place in its project application. And the NHS ethics board granted DeepMind\u2019s AI research project application in November 2015 \u2014 with the two-year AI research project scheduled to start in December 2015 and run until December 2017. A brief outline of the approved research project was previously published on the Health Research Authority\u2019s website, per its standard protocol, but the FOI reveals more details about the scope of the study \u2014 which is summarized in DeepMind\u2019s application as follows: By combining\u00a0classical\u00a0statistical\u00a0methodology\u00a0and\u00a0cutting-edge\u00a0machine\u00a0learning\u00a0algorithms\u00a0(e.g.\u00a0\u2018unsupervised\u00a0and\u00a0 semi\u00adsupervised\u00a0learning\u2019),\u00a0this\u00a0research\u00a0project\u00a0will\u00a0create\u00a0improved\u00a0techniques\u00a0of\u00a0data\u00a0analysis and\u00a0prediction\u00a0of who\u00a0may\u00a0get\u00a0AKI [acute kidney injury],\u00a0more\u00a0accurately\u00a0identify\u00a0cases\u00a0when\u00a0they\u00a0occur,\u00a0and\u00a0better\u00a0alert\u00a0doctors\u00a0to their\u00a0presence. DeepMind\u2019s application claimed that the existing NHS algorithm, which it was deploying via the Streams app, \u201cappears\u201d to be missing and misclassifying some cases of AKI, and generating false positives \u2014 and goes on to suggest: \u201cThe\u00a0problem\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0tool\u00a0which\u00a0DeepMind\u00a0have\u00a0made,\u00a0but\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0 algorithm\u00a0itself. We\u00a0think\u00a0we\u00a0can\u00a0overcome\u00a0these\u00a0problems,\u00a0and\u00a0create\u00a0a\u00a0system\u00a0which\u00a0works\u00a0better.\u201d Although at the time it wrote this application, in October 2015, user tests of the Streams app had not yet begun \u2014 so it\u2019s unclear how DeepMind could so confidently assert there was no \u201cproblem\u201d with a tool it hadn\u2019t yet tested. But presumably it was attempting to convey information about (what it claimed were) \u201cmajor limitations\u201d with the working of the NHS\u2019 national AKI algorithm passed on to it by the Royal Free. (For the record: In an FOI response that TechCrunch received back from the Royal Free in August 2016, the Trust told us that the first Streams user tests were carried out on 12-14 December 2015. It further confirmed: \u201cThe application has not been implemented outside of the controlled user\u00a0 tests .\u201d) Most interestingly, DeepMind\u2019s AI research application shows it told the NHS ethics board that it could process NHS data for the study under \u201cexisting information sharing agreements\u201d with the Royal Free. \u201cDeepMind acting as a data processor, under existing information sharing agreements with the responsible care organisations (in this case the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust), and providing existing services on identifiable patient data, will identify and anonymize the relevant records,\u201d the Google division wrote in the research application. The fact that DeepMind had taken active steps to gain approval for AI research\u00a0on the Royal Free patient data as far back as fall 2015 flies in the face of all the subsequent assertions made by the pair to the press and public \u2014 when they claimed the Royal Free data was not being used to train AI models. For instance, here\u2019s what this publication was told in May last year , after the scope of the data being shared by the Trust with DeepMind had just emerged (emphasis mine): DeepMind confirmed it is not, at this point, performing\u00a0any machine learning/AI processing on\u00a0the data it is receiving , although the company has clearly indicated it would like to do so in future. A note on its website pertaining to\u00a0this ambition\u00a0reads: \u201c[A]rtificial intelligence is not part of the early-stage pilots we\u2019re announcing today. It\u2019s too early to determine where AI could be applied here , but it\u2019s certainly something we are excited about for the future.\u201d The Royal Free spokesman said\u00a0it is not possible, under the current data-sharing agreement between the trust and DeepMind, for the company to apply AI technology to these data-sets and data streams . That type of processing of the data would require another agreement, he confirmed. \u201c The only thing this data is for is direct patient care ,\u201d he added. \u201c It is not being used for research , or anything like that.\u201d As the FOI makes clear, and contrary to the Royal Free spokesman\u2019s claim, DeepMind had in fact been granted ethical approval by the NHS Health Research Authority in November 2015 to conduct AI research on the Royal Free patient data-set \u2014 with DeepMind in control of selecting and anonymizing the PID (patient identifiable data) intended for this purpose. Conducting research on medical data would clearly not constitute an act of direct patient care \u2014 which was the legal basis DeepMind and the Royal Free were at the time claiming for their reliance on implied consent of NHS patients to their data being shared. So, in seeking to paper over the erupting controversy about how many patients\u2019 medical records had been shared without their knowledge or consent, it appears the pair felt the need to publicly de-emphasize their parallel AI research intentions for the data. \u201cIf you have been given data, and then anonymise it to do research on, it\u2019s disingenuous to claim you\u2019re not using the data for research,\u201d said Dr Eerke Boiten, a cyber security professor at De Montfort University whose research interests encompass data privacy and ethics, when asked for his view on the pair\u2019s\u00a0 modus operandi\u00a0 here. \u201cAnd [DeepMind] as computer scientists, some of them with a Ross Anderson pedigree, they should know better than to believe in \u2018anonymised medical data\u2019,\u201d he added \u2014 a reference to how trivially easy it has been shown to be for sensitive medical data to be re-identified once it\u2019s handed over to third parties who can triangulate identities using all sorts of other data holdings. Also commenting on what the documents reveal, Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, told us: \u201cWhat this shows is that Google ignored the rules. The people involved have repeatedly claimed ignorance, as if they couldn\u2019t use a search engine. Now it appears they were very clear indeed about all the rules and contractual arrangements; they just deliberately chose not to follow them.\u201d Asked to respond to criticism that it has deliberately ignored NHS\u2019 information governance rules, a DeepMind spokeswoman said the AI research being referred to \u201chas not taken place\u201d. \u201cTo be clear, no research project has taken place and no AI has been applied to that dataset. We have always said that we would like to undertake research in future, but the work we are delivering for the Royal Free is solely what has been said all along \u2014 delivering Streams,\u201d she added. She also pointed to a blog post the company published this summer after the ICO ruled that the 2015 ISA with the Royal Free had broken UK data protection laws \u2014 in which DeepMind admits it \u201cunderestimated the complexity of NHS rules around patient data\u201d and failed to adequately listen and \u201cbe accountable to and [be] shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole\u201d. \u201cWe made a mistake in not publicising our work when it first began in 2015, so we\u2019ve proactively announced and published the contracts for our subsequent NHS partnerships,\u201d it wrote in July. In one of the sections of DeepMind\u2019s November 2015 AI research study application form, which asks for \u201ca summary of the main ethical, legal or management issues arising from the research project\u201d, the company writes: \u201cWe do not foresee any major ethical, legal or management issues.\u201d Clearly, with hindsight, the data-sharing partnership would quickly run into major ethical and legal problems. So that\u2019s a pretty major failure of foresight by the world\u2019s most famous AI-building entity. (Albeit, it\u2019s worth noting that the rest of a fuller response in this section has been entirely redacted \u2014 but presumably DeepMind is discussing what it considers lesser issues here.) The application also reveals that the company intended not to register the AI research in a public database \u2014 bizarrely claiming that \u201cno appropriate database exists for work such as this\u201d. In this section the application form includes the following guidance note for applicants: \u201cRegistration of research studies is encouraged wherever possible\u201d, and goes on to suggest various possible options for registering a study \u2014 such as via a partner NHS organisation; in a register run by a medical research charity; or via publishing through an open access publisher. DeepMind makes no additional comment on any of these suggestions. When we asked the company why it had not intended to register the AI research the spokeswoman reiterated that \u201cno research project has taken place\u201d, and added: \u201cA description of the initial HRA [Health Research Authority] application is publicly available on the HRA website.\u201d Evidently the company \u2014 whose parent entity Google\u2019s corporate mission statement claims it wants to \u2018organize the world\u2019s information\u2019 \u2014 was in no rush to more widely distribute its plans for applying AI to NHS data at this stage. Details of the size of the study have also been redacted in the FOI response so it\u2019s not possible to ascertain how many of the 1.6M medical records DeepMind intended to use for the AI research, although the document does confirm that children\u2019s medical records would be included in the study. The application confirms that Royal Free NHS patients who have previously opted out of their data being used for any medical research would be excluded from the AI study (as would be required by UK law). As noted above, DeepMind\u2019s application also specifies that the company would be both handling fully identifiable patient data from the Royal Free, for the purposes of developing the clinical task management app Streams, and also identifying and anonymizing a sub-set of this data to run its AI research. This could well raise additional questions over whether the level of control DeepMind was being afforded by the Trust over patients\u2019 data is appropriate for an entity that is described as occupying the secondary role of data processor \u2014 vs the Royal Free claiming it remains the data controller. \u201cA data processor does not determine the purpose of processing \u2014 a data controller does,\u201d said Boiten, commenting on this point. \u201cDoing AI research\u201d is too aspecific as a purpose, so I find it impossible to view DeepMind as only a data processor in this scenario,\u201d he added. One thing is clear: When the DeepMind-Royal Free collaboration was publicly revealed with much fanfare, the fact they had already applied for and been granted ethical approval to perform AI research on the same patient data-set was not \u2014 in their view \u2014 a consideration they deemed merited detailed public discussion. Which is a huge miscalculation when you\u2019re trying to win the public\u2019s trust for the sharing of their most sensitive personal data. Asked why it had not informed the press or the public about the existence and status of the research project at the time, a DeepMind spokeswoman failed to directly respond to the question \u2014 instead she reiterated that: \u201cNo research is underway.\u201d DeepMind and the Royal Free both claim that, despite receiving a favorable ethical opinion on the AI research application in November 2015 from the NHS ethics committee, additional approvals would have been required before the AI research could have gone ahead. \u201cA favourable opinion from a research ethics committee does not constitute full approval. This work could not take place without further approvals,\u201d the DeepMind spokeswoman told us. \u201cThe AKI research application has initial ethical approval from the national research ethics service within the Health Research Authority (HRA), as noted on the HRA website . However, DeepMind does not have the next step of approval required to proceed with the study \u2014 namely full HRA approval (previously called local R&D approval). \u201cIn addition, before any research could be done, DeepMind and the Royal Free would also need a research collaboration agreement,\u201d she added. The HRA\u2019s letter to DeepMind confirming its favorable opinion on the study does indeed note: Management permission or approval must be obtained from each host organisation prior to the start of the study at the site concerned. Management permission (\u201cR&D approval\u201d) should be sought from all NHS organisations involved in the study in accordance with NHS research governance arrangements However since the proposed study was to be conducted purely on a database of patient data, rather than at any NHS locations, and given that the Royal Free already had an information-sharing arrangement inked in place with DeepMind, it\u2019s not clear exactly what additional external approvals they were awaiting. The original (now defunct and ICO sanctioned)\u00a0 ISA between the pair does include the below paragraph \u2014 granting DeepMind the ability to anonymize the Royal Free patient data-set \u201cfor research\u201d purposes. And although this clause lists several bodies, one of which it says would also need to approve any projects under \u201cformal research ethics\u201d, the aforementioned HRA (\u201cthe National Research Ethics Service\u201d) is included in this list. So again, it\u2019s not clear whose rubberstamp they would still have required. At the same time, it\u2019s clear that transparency is a preferred principle of medical research ethics \u2014 hence the NHS encouraging those filling in research applications to publicly register their studies. A UK government-commissioned life science strategy review,\u00a0 published this week , also emphasizes the importance of transparency in engendering and sustaining public trust in health research projects \u2014 arguing it\u2019s an essential component for furthering the march of digital innovation. The same review also recommends that the UK government and the NHS take ownership of training health AIs off of taxpayer-funded health data-sets \u2014 exactly to avoid corporate entities coming in and asset-stripping potential future medical insights. (\u201c Most of the value is the data ,\u201d asserts review author, Sir John Bell, an Oxford University professor of medicine. Data that, in DeepMind\u2019s case, has been so far freely handed over by multiple NHS organizations \u2014 in June , for example, it emerged that another NHS Trust which has inked a five-year data-sharing deal with DeepMind, Taunton & Somerset, is not paying the company for the duration of the contract; unless (and in the unlikely eventuality) that the service support exceeds \u00a315,000 a month. So essentially DeepMind is being \u2018paid\u2019 with access to NHS patients\u2019 data.) Even before the ICO\u2019s damning verdict, the original ISA between DeepMind and the Royal Free had been extensively\u00a0 criticized for lacking robust legal and ethical safeguards on how patient data could be used. (Even as DeepMind\u2019s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman tried to brush off criticism, saying negative headlines were the result of \u201c a group with a particular view to peddle \u201c.) But after the original controversy flared the pair subsequently scrapped the agreement and replaced it, in November 2016 , with a second data-sharing contract which included some additional information governance concessions \u2014 while also continuing to share largely the same quantity and types of identifiable Royal Free patient data as before. Then this\u00a0 July , as noted earlier, the ICO ruled that the original ISA had indeed breached UK privacy law. \u201cPatients would not have reasonably expected their information to have been used in this way, and the Trust could and should have been far more transparent with patients as to what was happening,\u201d it stated in its decision. The ICO also said it had asked the Trust to commit to making changes to address the shortcomings that the regulator had identified. In a statement on\u00a0 its website \u00a0the Trust said it accepted the findings and claimed to have \u201calready made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns\u201d, and to be \u201cdoing much more to keep our patients informed about how their data is used\u201d. \u201cWe would like to reassure patients that their information has been in our control at all times and has never been used for anything other than delivering patient care or ensuring their safety,\u201d the Royal Free\u2019s July statement added. Responding to questions put to it for this report, the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed it was aware of and involved with the 2015 DeepMind AI research study application. \u201cTo be clear, the application was for research on de-personalised data and not the personally identifiable data used in providing Stream,\u201d said a spokeswoman. \u201cNo research project has begun, and it could not begin without further approvals. It is worth noting that fully approved research projects involving de-personalised data generally do not require patient consent,\u201d she added. At the time of writing the spokeswoman had not responded to follow-up questions asking why, in 2016, it had made such explicit public denials about its patient data being used for AI research, and why it chose not to make public the existing application to conduct AI research at that time \u2014 or indeed, at an earlier time. Another curious facet to this saga involves the group of \u201cindependent reviewers\u201d that Suleyman, announced \u00a0the company had signed up in July 2016 to \u2014 as he put it \u2014 \u201cexamine our work and publish their findings\u201d. His intent was clearly to try to reset public perceptions of the DeepMind Health initiative after a bumpy start for transparency, consent, information governance and regulatory best practice \u00a0\u2014 with the wider hope of boosting public trust in what an ad giant wanted with people\u2019s medical data by allowing some external eyeballs to roll in and poke around. What\u2019s curious is that the reviewers make no reference to DeepMind\u2019s AI research study intentions for the Royal Free data-set in their first report \u2014 also published this July. We reached out to the chair of the group, former MP Julian Huppert, to ask whether DeepMind informed the group it was intending to undertake AI research on the same data-set. Huppert confirmed to us that the group had been aware there was \u201cconsideration\u201d of an AI research project using the Royal Free data at the time it was working on its report, but claimed he does not \u201crecall exactly\u201d when the project was first mentioned or by whom. \u201cBoth the application and the decision not to go ahead happened before the panel was formed,\u201d he said, by way of explanation for the memory lapse. Asked why the panel did not think the project worth mentioning in its first annual report, he told TechCrunch: \u201cWe were more concerned with looking at work that DMH had done and were planning to do, than things that they had decided not to go ahead with.\u201d \u201cI understand that no work was ever done on it. If this project were to be taken forward, there would be many more regulatory steps, which we would want to look at,\u201d he added. In their report the independent reviews do flag up some issues of concern regarding DeepMind Health\u2019s operations \u2014 including potential security vulnerabilities around the company\u2019s handling of health data. For example, a datacenter server build review report, conducted by an external auditor looking at part of DeepMind Health\u2019s critical infrastructure on behalf of the external reviewers, identified what it judged a \u201cmedium risk vulnerability\u201d \u2014 noting that:\u00a0\u201cA large number of files are present which can be overwritten by any user on the reviewed servers.\u201d \u201cThis could allow a malicious user to modify or replace existing files to insert malicious content, which would allow attacks to be conducted against the servers storing the files,\u201d the auditor added. Asked how DeepMind Health will work to regain NHS patients\u2019 trust in light of such a string of transparency and regulatory failures to-date, the spokeswoman provided the following statement: \u201cOver the past eighteen months we\u2019ve done a lot to try to set a higher standard of transparency, appointing a panel of Independent Reviewers who scrutinise our work, embarking on a patient involvement program, proactively publishing NHS contracts, and building tools to enable better audits of how data is used to support care . In our recently signed partnership with Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust , for example, we committed to supporting public engagement activity before any patient data is transferred for processing. And at our recent consultation events in London and Manchester, patients provided feedback on DeepMind Health\u2019s work.\u201d Asked whether it had informed the independent reviewers about the existence of the AI research application, the spokeswoman declined to respond directly. Instead she repeater the prior line that: \u201cNo research project is underway.\u201d", "title_html": "<h1 class=\"article__title\">Documents detail DeepMind\u2019s plan to apply AI to NHS data in

href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">controversial</a> 2015 patient data-sharing arrangement between Google DeepMind and a UK National Health Service Trust which paint a contrasting picture vs the pair\u2019s public narrative about their intended use of 1.6 million citizens\u2019 medical records.</p>\n<p>DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust signed their initial\u00a0<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwQ4esYYFC04NFVTRW12TTFFRFE/view\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">information sharing agreement</a>\u00a0(ISA) in September 2015 \u2014 ostensibly to co-develop a clinical task management app, called Streams, for early detection of an acute kidney condition using an NHS algorithm.</p>\n<p>Patients whose fully identifiable medical records were being shared with the Google-owned company were neither asked for their consent nor informed their data was being handed to the commercial entity.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the arrangement was only announced to the public five months after it was inked \u2014 and months after patient data had already started to flow.</p>\n<p>And it was only fleshed out in any real detail after a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New Scientist</a>\u00a0journalist obtained and published the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwQ4esYYFC04NFVTRW12TTFFRFE/view\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ISA</a>\u00a0between the pair, in April 2016 \u2014 revealing for the first time, via a Freedom of Information request, quite how much medical data was being shared for an app that targets a single condition.</p>\n<p>This led to an investigation being opened by the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog into the legality of the arrangement. And as public pressure mounted over the scope and intentions behind the medical records collaboration, the pair stuck to their line that patient data was not being used for training artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>They also claimed they did not need to seek patient consent for their medical records to be shared because the resulting app would be used for direct patient care \u2014 a claimed legal basis that has since been <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uk-data-regulator-says-deepminds-initial-deal-with-the-nhs-broke-privacy-law/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">demolished by the ICO</a>, which concluded a more than year-long investigation in July.</p>\n<p>However a series of newly released documents shows that applying AI to the patient data was in fact a goal for DeepMind right from the earliest months of its partnership with the Royal Free \u2014\u00a0with its intention being to utilize the wide-ranging access to and control of publicly-funded medical data it was being granted by the Trust to simultaneously develop its own AI models.</p>\n<p>In a FAQ note on its website when it publicly announced the collaboration, in February 2016, DeepMind wrote:\u00a0\u201cNo, artificial intelligence is not part of the early-stage pilots we\u2019re announcing today. It\u2019s too early to determine where AI could be applied here, but it\u2019s certainly something we are excited about for the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Omitted from that description of its plans was the fact it had already received a favorable ethical opinion from an NHS Health Research Authority research ethics committee to run a two-year AI research study on the same underlying NHS patient data.</p>\n<h2>DeepMind\u2019s intent was always to apply AI</h2>\n<p>The newly\u00a0<a

href=\"http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/using-machine-learning-to-improve-prediction-of-aki-deterioration/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">brief outline</a> of the approved research project was previously published on the Health Research Authority\u2019s website, per its standard protocol, but the FOI reveals more details about the scope of the study \u2014 which is summarized in DeepMind\u2019s application as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By combining\u00a0classical\u00a0statistical\u00a0methodology\u00a0and\u00a0cutting-edge\u00a0machine\u00a0learning\u00a0algorithms\u00a0(e.g.\u00a0\u2018unsupervised\u00a0and\u00a0 semi\u00adsupervised\u00a0learning\u2019),\u00a0this\u00a0research\u00a0project\u00a0will\u00a0create\u00a0improved\u00a0techniques\u00a0of\u00a0data\u00a0analysis<br/>\nand\u00a0prediction\u00a0of

their\u00a0presence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>DeepMind\u2019s application claimed that the existing NHS algorithm, which it was deploying via the Streams app, \u201cappears\u201d to be missing and misclassifying some cases of AKI, and generating false positives \u2014 and goes on to suggest: \u201cThe\u00a0problem\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0tool\u00a0which\u00a0DeepMind\u00a0have\u00a0made,\u00a0but\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0 algorithm\u00a0itself. We\u00a0think\u00a0we\u00a0can\u00a0overcome\u00a0these\u00a0problems,\u00a0and\u00a0create\u00a0a\u00a0system\u00a0which\u00a0works\u00a0better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Although at the time it wrote this application, in October 2015, user tests of the Streams app had not yet begun \u2014 so it\u2019s unclear how DeepMind could so confidently assert there was no \u201cproblem\u201d with a tool it hadn\u2019t yet tested. But presumably it was attempting to convey information about (what it claimed were) \u201cmajor limitations\u201d with the working of the NHS\u2019 national AKI algorithm passed on to it by the Royal Free.</p>\n<p>(For the record: In an FOI response that TechCrunch received back from the Royal Free in August 2016, the Trust told us that the first Streams user tests were carried out on 12-14 December 2015. It further confirmed: \u201cThe application has not been implemented outside of the controlled user\u00a0<span class=\"il\">tests</span>.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Most interestingly, DeepMind\u2019s AI research application shows it told the NHS ethics board that it could process NHS data for the study under \u201cexisting information sharing agreements\u201d with the Royal Free.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeepMind acting as a data processor, under existing information sharing agreements with the responsible care organisations (in this case the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust), and providing existing services on identifiable patient data, will identify and anonymize the relevant records,\u201d the Google division wrote in the research application.</p>\n<p>The fact that DeepMind had taken active steps to gain approval for AI research\u00a0on the Royal Free patient data as far back as fall 2015 flies in the face of all the subsequent assertions made by the pair to the press and public \u2014 when they claimed the Royal Free data was not being used to train AI models.</p>\n<p>For instance, here\u2019s what this publication was told <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/05/04/concerns-raised-over-broad-scope-of-deepmind-nhs-health-data-sharing-deal/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in May last year</a>, after the scope of the data being shared by the Trust with DeepMind had just emerged (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote><p>DeepMind confirmed it is <strong>not, at this point, performing\u00a0any machine learning/AI processing on\u00a0the data it is receiving</strong>, although the company has clearly indicated it would like to do so in future. A note on its website pertaining to\u00a0this ambition\u00a0reads: \u201c[A]rtificial intelligence is not part of the early-stage pilots we\u2019re announcing today. <strong>It\u2019s too early to determine where AI could be applied here</strong>, but it\u2019s certainly something we are excited about for the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Royal Free spokesman said\u00a0it is <strong>not possible, under the current data-sharing agreement between the trust and DeepMind, for the company to apply AI technology to these data-sets and data streams</strong>.</p>\n<p>That type of processing of the data would require another agreement, he confirmed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>The only thing this data is for is direct patient care</strong>,\u201d he added. \u201c<strong>It is not being used for research</strong>, or anything like that.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the FOI makes clear, and contrary to the Royal Free spokesman\u2019s claim, DeepMind had in fact been granted ethical approval by the NHS Health Research Authority in November 2015 to conduct AI research on the Royal Free patient data-set \u2014 with DeepMind in control of selecting and anonymizing the PID (patient identifiable data) intended for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Conducting research on medical data would clearly not constitute an act of direct patient care \u2014 which was the legal basis DeepMind and the Royal Free were at the time claiming for their reliance on implied consent of NHS patients to their data being shared. So, in seeking to paper over the erupting controversy about how many patients\u2019 medical records had been shared without their knowledge or consent, it appears the pair felt the need to publicly de-emphasize their parallel AI research intentions for the data.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you have been given data, and then anonymise it to do research on, it\u2019s disingenuous to claim you\u2019re not using the data for research,\u201d said Dr Eerke Boiten, a cyber security professor at De Montfort University whose research interests encompass data privacy and ethics, when asked for his view on the pair\u2019s\u00a0<em>modus operandi\u00a0</em>here.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd [DeepMind] as computer scientists, some of them with a <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ross Anderson</a> pedigree, they should know better than to believe in \u2018anonymised medical data\u2019,\u201d he added \u2014 a reference to how trivially easy it has been shown to be for sensitive medical data to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/code-practice-medical-data-vulnerable\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">re-identified</a> once it\u2019s handed over to third parties who can triangulate identities using all sorts of other data holdings.</p>\n<p>Also commenting on what the documents reveal, Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, told us: \u201cWhat this shows is that Google ignored the rules. The people involved have repeatedly claimed ignorance, as if they couldn\u2019t use a search engine. Now it appears they were very clear indeed about all the rules and contractual arrangements; they just deliberately chose not to follow them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Asked to respond to criticism that it has deliberately ignored NHS\u2019 information governance rules, a DeepMind spokeswoman said the AI research being referred to \u201chas not taken place\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be clear, no research project has taken place and no AI has been applied to that dataset. We have always said that we would like to undertake research in future, but the work we are delivering for the Royal Free is solely what has been said all along \u2014 delivering Streams,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>She also pointed to a <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/ico-royal-free/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> the company published this summer after the ICO ruled that the 2015 ISA with the Royal Free had broken UK data protection laws \u2014 in which DeepMind admits it \u201cunderestimated the complexity of NHS rules around patient data\u201d and failed to adequately listen and \u201cbe accountable to and [be] shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe made a mistake in not publicising our work when it first began in 2015, so we\u2019ve proactively announced and published the contracts for our subsequent NHS partnerships,\u201d it wrote in July.</p>\n<h2>\u201cWe do not foresee any major ethical\u2026 issues\u201d</h2>\n<p>In one of the sections of DeepMind\u2019s November 2015 AI research study application form, which asks for \u201ca summary of the main ethical, legal or management issues arising from the research project\u201d, the company writes: \u201cWe do not foresee any major ethical, legal or management issues.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clearly, with hindsight, the data-sharing partnership would quickly run into major ethical and legal problems. So that\u2019s a pretty major failure of foresight by the world\u2019s most famous AI-building entity. (Albeit, it\u2019s worth noting that the rest of a fuller response in this section has been entirely redacted \u2014 but presumably DeepMind is discussing what it considers lesser issues here.)</p>\n<p>The application also reveals that the company intended not to register the AI research in a public database \u2014 bizarrely claiming that \u201cno appropriate database exists for work such as this\u201d.</p>\n<p>In this section the application form includes the following guidance note for applicants: \u201cRegistration of research studies is encouraged wherever possible\u201d, and goes on to suggest various possible options for registering a study \u2014 such as via a partner NHS organisation; in a register run by a medical research charity; or via publishing through an open access publisher.</p>\n<p>DeepMind makes no additional comment on any of these suggestions.</p>\n<p>When we asked the company why it had not intended to register the AI research the spokeswoman reiterated that \u201cno research project has taken place\u201d, and added: \u201cA <a href=\"http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/using-machine-learning-to-improve-prediction-of-aki-deterioration/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">description</a> of the initial HRA [Health Research Authority] application is publicly available on the HRA website.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evidently the company \u2014 whose parent entity Google\u2019s corporate mission statement claims it wants to \u2018organize the world\u2019s information\u2019 \u2014 was in no rush to more widely distribute its plans for applying AI to NHS data at this stage.</p>\n<p>Details of the size of the study have also been redacted in the FOI response so it\u2019s not possible to ascertain how many of the 1.6M medical records DeepMind intended to use for the AI research, although the document does confirm that children\u2019s medical records would be included in the study.</p>\n<p>The application confirms that Royal Free NHS patients who have previously opted out of their data being used for any medical research would be excluded from the AI study (as would be required by UK law).</p>\n<p>As noted above, DeepMind\u2019s application also specifies that the company would be both handling fully identifiable patient data from the Royal Free, for the purposes of developing the clinical task management app Streams, and also identifying and anonymizing a sub-set of this data to run its AI research.</p>\n<p>This could well raise additional questions over whether the level of control DeepMind was being afforded by the Trust over patients\u2019 data is appropriate for an entity that is described as occupying the secondary role of data processor \u2014 vs the Royal Free claiming it remains the data controller.</p>\n<p>\u201cA data processor does not determine the purpose of processing \u2014 a data controller does,\u201d said Boiten, commenting on this point. \u201cDoing AI research\u201d is too aspecific as a purpose, so I find it impossible to view DeepMind as only a data processor in this scenario,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>One thing is clear: When the DeepMind-Royal Free collaboration was publicly revealed with much fanfare, the fact they had already applied for and been granted ethical approval to perform AI research on the same patient data-set was not \u2014 in their view \u2014 a consideration they deemed merited detailed public discussion. Which is a huge miscalculation when you\u2019re trying to win the public\u2019s trust for the sharing of their most sensitive personal data.</p>\n<p>Asked why it had not informed the press or the public about the existence and status of the research project at the time, a DeepMind spokeswoman failed to directly respond to the question \u2014 instead she reiterated that: \u201cNo research is underway.\u201d</p>\n<p>DeepMind and the Royal Free both claim that, despite receiving a favorable ethical opinion on the AI research application in November 2015 from the NHS ethics committee, additional approvals would have been required before the AI research could have gone ahead.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cA favourable opinion from a research ethics committee does not constitute full approval. This work could not take place without further approvals,\u201d the DeepMind spokeswoman told us.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe AKI research application has initial ethical approval from the national research ethics service within the Health Research Authority (HRA), as noted on the <a href=\"http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/using-machine-learning-to-improve-prediction-of-aki-deterioration/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HRA website</a>. However, DeepMind does not have the next step of approval required to proceed with the study \u2014 namely full HRA approval (previously called local R&amp;D approval).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIn addition, before any research could be done, DeepMind and the Royal Free would also need a research collaboration agreement,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The HRA\u2019s letter to DeepMind confirming its favorable opinion on the study does indeed note:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Management permission or approval must be obtained from each host organisation prior to the start of the study at the site concerned.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Management permission (\u201cR&amp;D approval\u201d) should be sought from all NHS organisations involved in the study in accordance with NHS research governance arrangements</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However since the proposed study was to be conducted purely on a database of patient data, rather than at any NHS locations, and given that the Royal Free already had an information-sharing arrangement inked in place with DeepMind, it\u2019s not clear exactly what additional external approvals they were awaiting.</p>\n<p>The original (now defunct and ICO sanctioned)\u00a0<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwQ4esYYFC04NFVTRW12TTFFRFE/view\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ISA</a> between the pair does include the below paragraph \u2014 granting DeepMind the ability to anonymize the Royal Free patient data-set \u201cfor research\u201d purposes. And although this clause lists several bodies, one of which it says would also need to approve any projects under \u201cformal research ethics\u201d, the aforementioned HRA (\u201cthe National Research Ethics Service\u201d) is included in this list.</p>\n<p>So again, it\u2019s not clear whose rubberstamp they would still have required.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/documents-detail-deepminds-plan-to-apply-ai-to-nhs-data-in-2015/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1534687\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1534687\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\" src=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png 554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=150,33 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=300,66 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=50,11 50w\" width=\"554\"/></a></p>\n<h2>The value of transparency</h2>\n<p>At the same time, it\u2019s clear that transparency is a preferred principle of medical research ethics \u2014 hence the NHS encouraging those filling in research applications to publicly register their studies.</p>\n<p>A UK government-commissioned life science strategy review,\u00a0<a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/building-health-ais-should-be-uk-ambition-says-strategy-review/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published this week</a>, also emphasizes the importance of transparency in engendering and sustaining public trust in health research projects \u2014 arguing it\u2019s an essential component for furthering the march of digital innovation.</p>\n<p>The same review also recommends that the UK government and the NHS take ownership of training health AIs off of taxpayer-funded health data-sets \u2014 exactly to avoid corporate entities coming in and asset-stripping potential future medical insights.</p>\n<p>(\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/30/uk-needs-to-act-urgently-to-secure-nhs-data-for-british-public-report-warns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Most of the value is the data</a>,\u201d asserts review author, Sir John Bell, an Oxford University professor of medicine. Data that, in DeepMind\u2019s case, has been so far freely handed over by multiple NHS organizations \u2014 in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/deepmind-health-inks-another-5-year-nhs-app-deal-in-face-of-ongoing-controversy/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">June</a>, for example, it emerged that another NHS Trust which has inked a five-year data-sharing deal with DeepMind, Taunton &amp; Somerset, is not paying the company for the duration of the contract; unless (and in the unlikely eventuality) that the service support exceeds \u00a315,000 a month. So essentially DeepMind is being \u2018paid\u2019 with access to NHS patients\u2019 data.)</p>\n<p>Even before the ICO\u2019s damning verdict, the original ISA between DeepMind and the Royal Free had been extensively\u00a0<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12553-017-0179-1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">criticized for lacking robust legal and ethical safeguards</a> on how patient data could be used. (Even as DeepMind\u2019s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman tried to brush off criticism, saying negative headlines were the result of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-nhs-data-sharing-streams-app-privacy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a group with a particular view to peddle</a>\u201c.)</p>\n<p>But after the original controversy flared the pair subsequently scrapped the agreement and replaced it, in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/deepmind-health-inks-new-deal-with-uks-nhs-to-deploy-streams-app-in-early-2017/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">November 2016</a>, with a second data-sharing contract which included some additional information governance concessions \u2014 while also continuing to share largely the same quantity and types of identifiable Royal Free patient data as before.</p>\n<p>Then this\u00a0<a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uk-data-regulator-says-deepminds-initial-deal-with-the-nhs-broke-privacy-law/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">July</a>, as noted earlier, the ICO ruled that the original ISA had indeed breached UK privacy law. \u201cPatients would not have reasonably expected their information to have been used in this way, and the Trust could and should have been far more transparent with patients as to what was happening,\u201d it stated in its decision.</p>\n<p>The ICO also said it had asked the Trust to commit to making changes to address the shortcomings that the regulator had identified.</p>\n<p>In a statement on\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/news-media/news/royal-free-london-statement-on-the-information-commissioners-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">its website</a>\u00a0the Trust said it accepted the findings and claimed to have \u201calready made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns\u201d, and to be \u201cdoing much more to keep our patients informed about how their data is used\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe would like to reassure patients that their information has been in our control at all times and has never been used for anything other than delivering patient care or ensuring their safety,\u201d the Royal Free\u2019s July statement added.</p>\n<p>Responding to questions put to it for this report, the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed it was aware of and involved with the 2015 DeepMind AI research study application.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be clear, the application was for research on de-personalised data and not the personally identifiable data used in providing Stream,\u201d said a spokeswoman.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo research project has begun, and it could not begin without further approvals. It is worth noting that fully approved research projects involving de-personalised data generally do not require patient consent,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing the spokeswoman had not responded to follow-up questions asking why, in 2016, it had made such explicit public denials about its patient data being used for AI research, and why it chose not to make public the existing application to conduct AI research at that time \u2014 or indeed, at an earlier time.</p>\n<p>Another curious facet to this saga involves the group of \u201cindependent reviewers\u201d that <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mustafasul/deepmind-health-our-commitment-to-the-nhs-ac627c098818\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Suleyman, announced</a>\u00a0the company had signed up in July 2016 to \u2014 as he put it \u2014 \u201cexamine our work and publish their findings\u201d.</p>\n<p>His intent was clearly to try to reset public perceptions of the DeepMind Health initiative after a <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/deepminds-first-nhs-health-app-faces-more-regulatory-bumps/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bumpy start for transparency, consent, information governance and regulatory best practice</a>\u00a0\u2014 with the wider hope of boosting public trust in what an ad giant wanted with people\u2019s medical data by allowing some external eyeballs to roll in and poke around.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s curious is that the reviewers make no reference to DeepMind\u2019s AI research study intentions for the Royal Free data-set in their <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/independent-reviewers-annual-report-2017/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first report</a> \u2014 also published this July.</p>\n<p>We reached out to the chair of the group, former MP Julian Huppert, to ask whether DeepMind informed the group it was intending to undertake AI research on the same data-set.</p>\n<p>Huppert confirmed to us that the group had been aware there was \u201cconsideration\u201d of an AI research project using the Royal Free data at the time it was working on its report, but claimed he does not \u201crecall exactly\u201d when the project was first mentioned or by whom.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth the application and the decision not to go ahead happened before the panel was formed,\u201d he said, by way of explanation for the memory lapse.</p>\n<p>Asked why the panel did not think the project worth mentioning in its first annual report, he told TechCrunch: \u201cWe were more concerned with looking at work that DMH had done and were planning to do, than things that they had decided not to go ahead with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand that no work was ever done on it. If this project were to be taken forward, there would be many more regulatory steps, which we would want to look at,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>In their report the independent reviews do flag up some issues of concern regarding DeepMind Health\u2019s operations \u2014 including potential security vulnerabilities around the company\u2019s handling of health data.</p>\n<p>For example, a datacenter server build review report, conducted by an external auditor looking at part of DeepMind Health\u2019s critical infrastructure on behalf of the external reviewers, identified what it judged a \u201cmedium risk vulnerability\u201d \u2014 noting that:\u00a0\u201cA large number of files are present which can be overwritten by any user on the reviewed servers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis could allow a malicious user to modify or replace existing files to insert malicious content, which would allow attacks to be conducted against the servers storing the files,\u201d the auditor added.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Asked how DeepMind Health will work to regain NHS patients\u2019 trust in light of such a string of transparency and regulatory failures to-date, the spokeswoman provided the following statement: \u201cOver the past eighteen months we\u2019ve done a lot to try to set a higher standard of transparency, appointing a panel of Independent Reviewers who scrutinise our work, embarking on a patient involvement program, proactively publishing NHS contracts, and <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/deepmind-says-no-quick-fix-for-verifying-health-data-access/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">building tools to enable better audits of how data is used to support care</a>. In our recently signed partnership with <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/deepmind-health-inks-another-5-year-nhs-app-deal-in-face-of-ongoing-controversy/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust</a>, for example, we committed to supporting public engagement activity before any patient data is transferred for processing. And at our recent consultation events in London and Manchester, patients provided feedback on DeepMind Health\u2019s work.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Asked whether it had informed the independent reviewers about the existence of the AI research application, the spokeswoman declined to respond directly. Instead she repeater the prior line that: \u201cNo research project is underway.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n<input class=\"shortlink\" readonly=\"\" title=\"Article

to be missing and misclassifying some cases of AKI, and generating false positives &#8212; and goes on to suggest: &#8220;The\\u00a0problem\\u00a0is\\u00a0not\\u00a0with\\u00a0the\\u00a0tool\\u00a0which\\u00a0DeepMind\\u00a0have\\u00a0made,\\u00a0but\\u00a0with\\u00a0the\\u00a0 algorithm\\u00a0itself.

But presumably it was attempting to convey information about (what it claimed were) &#8220;major limitations&#8221; with the working of the NHS&#8217; national AKI algorithm passed on to it by the Royal Free.<\\/p>\\n<p>(For the record: In an FOI response that TechCrunch received back from the Royal Free in August 2016, the Trust told us that the first Streams user tests were carried out on 12-14 December 2015. It further confirmed: &#8220;The application has not been implemented outside of the controlled user\\u00a0<span class=\\\"il\\\">tests<\\/span>.&#8221;)<\\/p>\\n<p>Most interestingly, DeepMind&#8217;s AI research application shows it told the NHS ethics board that it could process NHS data for the study under &#8220;existing information sharing agreements&#8221; with the Royal Free.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;DeepMind acting as a data processor, under existing information sharing agreements with the responsible care organisations (in this case the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust), and providing existing services on identifiable patient data, will identify and anonymize the relevant records,&#8221; the Google division wrote in the research application.<\\/p>\\n<p>The fact that DeepMind had taken active steps to gain approval for AI research\\u00a0on the Royal Free patient data as far back as fall 2015 flies in the face of all the subsequent assertions made by the pair to the press and public &#8212; when they claimed the Royal Free data was not being used to train AI models.<\\/p>\\n<p>For instance, here&#8217;s what this publication was told <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/05\\/04\\/concerns-raised-over-broad-scope-of-deepmind-nhs-health-data-sharing-deal\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">in May last year<\\/a>, after the scope of the data being shared by the Trust with DeepMind had just emerged (emphasis mine):<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p>DeepMind confirmed it is <strong>not, at this point, performing\\u00a0any machine learning\\/AI processing on\\u00a0the data it is receiving<\\/strong>, although the company has clearly indicated it would like to do so in future. A note on its website pertaining to\\u00a0this ambition\\u00a0reads: &#8220;[A]rtificial intelligence is not part of the early-stage pilots we\\u2019re announcing today. <strong>It\\u2019s too early to determine where AI could be applied here<\\/strong>, but it\\u2019s certainly something we are excited about for the future.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The Royal Free spokesman said\\u00a0it is <strong>not possible, under the current data-sharing agreement between the trust and DeepMind, for the company to apply AI technology to these data-sets and data streams<\\/strong>.<\\/p>\\n<p>That type of processing of the data would require another agreement, he confirmed.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201c<strong>The only thing this data is for is direct patient care<\\/strong>,\\u201d he added. \\u201c<strong>It is not being used for research<\\/strong>, or anything like that.\\u201d<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>As the FOI makes clear, and contrary to the Royal Free spokesman&#8217;s claim, DeepMind had in fact been granted ethical approval by the NHS Health Research Authority in November 2015 to conduct AI research on the Royal Free patient data-set &#8212; with DeepMind in control of selecting and anonymizing the PID (patient identifiable data) intended for this purpose.<\\/p>\\n<p>Conducting research on medical data would clearly not constitute an act of direct patient care &#8212; which was the legal basis DeepMind and the Royal Free were at the time claiming for their reliance on implied consent of NHS patients to their data being shared. So, in seeking to paper over the erupting controversy about how many patients&#8217; medical records had been shared without their knowledge or consent, it appears the pair felt the need to publicly de-emphasize their parallel AI research intentions for the data.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;If you have been given data, and then anonymise it to do research on, it&#8217;s disingenuous to claim you&#8217;re not using the data for research,&#8221; said Dr Eerke Boiten, a cyber security professor at De Montfort University whose research interests encompass data privacy and ethics, when asked for his view on the pair&#8217;s\\u00a0<em>modus operandi\\u00a0<\\/em>here.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;And [DeepMind] as computer scientists, some of them with a <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.cl.cam.ac.uk\\/~rja14\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Ross Anderson<\\/a> pedigree, they should know better than to believe in &#8216;anonymised medical data&#8217;,&#8221; he added &#8212; a reference to how trivially easy it has been shown to be for sensitive medical data to be <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/commentisfree\\/2012\\/aug\\/28\\/code-practice-medical-data-vulnerable\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">re-identified<\\/a> once it&#8217;s handed over to third parties who can triangulate identities using all sorts of other data holdings.<\\/p>\\n<p>Also commenting on what the documents reveal, Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, told us: \\u201cWhat this shows is that Google ignored the rules. The people involved have repeatedly claimed ignorance, as if they couldn\\u2019t use a search engine. Now it appears they were very clear indeed about all the rules and contractual arrangements; they just deliberately chose not to follow them.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Asked to respond to criticism that it has deliberately ignored NHS&#8217; information governance rules, a DeepMind spokeswoman said the AI research being referred to &#8220;has not taken place&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;To be clear, no research project has taken place and no AI has been applied to that dataset. We have always said that we would like to undertake research in future, but the work we are delivering for the Royal Free is solely what has been said all along &#8212; delivering Streams,&#8221; she added.<\\/p>\\n<p>She also pointed to a <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/deepmind.com\\/blog\\/ico-royal-free\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">blog post<\\/a> the company published this summer after the ICO ruled that the 2015 ISA with the Royal Free had broken UK data protection laws &#8212; in which DeepMind admits it &#8220;underestimated the complexity of NHS rules around patient data&#8221; and failed to adequately listen and &#8220;be accountable to and [be] shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We made a mistake in not publicising our work when it first began in 2015, so we\\u2019ve proactively announced and published the contracts for our subsequent NHS partnerships,&#8221; it wrote in July.<\\/p>\\n<h2>&#8220;We do not foresee any major ethical&#8230; issues&#8221;<\\/h2>\\n<p>In one of the sections of DeepMind&#8217;s November 2015 AI research study application form, which asks for &#8220;a summary of the main ethical, legal or management issues arising from the research project&#8221;, the company writes: &#8220;We do not foresee any major ethical, legal or management issues.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Clearly, with hindsight, the data-sharing partnership would quickly run into major ethical and legal problems. So that&#8217;s a pretty major failure of foresight by the world&#8217;s most famous AI-building entity. (Albeit, it&#8217;s worth noting that the rest of a fuller response in this section has been entirely redacted &#8212; but presumably DeepMind is discussing what it considers lesser issues here.)<\\/p>\\n<p>The application also reveals that the company intended not to register the AI research in a public database &#8212; bizarrely claiming that &#8220;no appropriate database exists for work such as this&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>In this section the application form includes the following guidance note for applicants: &#8220;Registration of research studies is encouraged wherever possible&#8221;, and goes on to suggest various possible options for registering a study &#8212; such as via a partner NHS organisation; in a register run by a medical research charity; or via publishing through an open access publisher.<\\/p>\\n<p>DeepMind makes no additional comment on any of these suggestions.<\\/p>\\n<p>When we asked the company why it had not intended to register the AI research the spokeswoman reiterated that &#8220;no research project has taken place&#8221;, and added: &#8220;A <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.hra.nhs.uk\\/news\\/research-summaries\\/using-machine-learning-to-improve-prediction-of-aki-deterioration\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">description<\\/a> of the initial HRA [Health Research Authority] application is publicly available on the HRA website.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Evidently the company &#8212; whose parent entity Google&#8217;s corporate mission statement claims it wants to &#8216;organize the world&#8217;s information&#8217; &#8212; was in no rush to more widely distribute its plans for applying AI to NHS data at this stage.<\\/p>\\n<p>Details of the size of the study have also been redacted in the FOI response so it&#8217;s not possible to ascertain how many of the 1.6M medical records DeepMind intended to use for the AI research, although the document does confirm that children&#8217;s medical records would be included in the study.<\\/p>\\n<p>The application confirms that Royal Free NHS patients who have previously opted out of their data being used for any medical research would be excluded from the AI study (as would be required by UK law).<\\/p>\\n<p>As noted above, DeepMind&#8217;s application also specifies that the company would be both handling fully identifiable patient data from the Royal Free, for the purposes of developing the clinical task management app Streams, and also identifying and anonymizing a sub-set of this data to run its AI research.<\\/p>\\n<p>This could well raise additional questions over whether the level of control DeepMind was being afforded by the Trust over patients&#8217; data is appropriate for an entity that is described as occupying the secondary role of data processor &#8212; vs the Royal Free claiming it remains the data controller.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;A data processor does not determine the purpose of processing &#8212; a data controller does,&#8221; said Boiten, commenting on this point. &#8220;Doing AI research&#8221; is too aspecific as a purpose, so I find it impossible to view DeepMind as only a data processor in this scenario,&#8221; he added.<\\/p>\\n<p>One thing is clear: When the DeepMind-Royal Free collaboration was publicly revealed with much fanfare, the fact they had already applied for and been granted ethical approval to perform AI research on the same patient data-set was not &#8212; in their view &#8212; a consideration they deemed merited detailed public discussion. Which is a huge miscalculation when you&#8217;re trying to win the public&#8217;s trust for the sharing of their most sensitive personal data.<\\/p>\\n<p>Asked why it had not informed the press or the public about the existence and status of the research project at the time, a DeepMind spokeswoman failed to directly respond to the question &#8212; instead she reiterated that: &#8220;No research is underway.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>DeepMind and the Royal Free both claim that, despite receiving a favorable ethical opinion on the AI research application in November 2015 from the NHS ethics committee, additional approvals would have been required before the AI research could have gone ahead.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&#8220;A favourable opinion from a research ethics committee does not constitute full approval. This work could not take place without further approvals,&#8221; the DeepMind spokeswoman told us.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&#8220;The AKI research application has initial ethical approval from the national research ethics service within the Health Research Authority (HRA), as noted on the <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.hra.nhs.uk\\/news\\/research-summaries\\/using-machine-learning-to-improve-prediction-of-aki-deterioration\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">HRA website<\\/a>. However, DeepMind does not have the next step of approval required to proceed with the study &#8212; namely full HRA approval (previously called local R&amp;D approval).<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&#8220;In addition, before any research could be done, DeepMind and the Royal Free would also need a research collaboration agreement,&#8221; she added.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The HRA&#8217;s letter to DeepMind confirming its favorable opinion on the study does indeed note:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Management permission or approval must be obtained from each host organisation prior to the start of the study at the site concerned.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Management permission (\\u201cR&amp;D approval\\u201d) should be sought from all NHS organisations involved in the study in accordance with NHS research governance arrangements<\\/p>\\n<\\/blockquote>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">However since the proposed study was to be conducted purely on a database of patient data, rather than at any NHS locations, and given that the Royal Free already had an information-sharing arrangement inked in place with DeepMind, it&#8217;s not clear exactly what additional external approvals they were awaiting.<\\/p>\\n<p>The original (now defunct and ICO sanctioned)\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/drive.google.com\\/file\\/d\\/0BwQ4esYYFC04NFVTRW12TTFFRFE\\/view\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">ISA<\\/a> between the pair does include the below paragraph &#8212; granting DeepMind the ability to anonymize the Royal Free patient data-set &#8220;for research&#8221; purposes. And although this clause lists several bodies, one of which it says would also need to approve any projects under &#8220;formal research ethics&#8221;, the aforementioned HRA (&#8220;the National Research Ethics Service&#8221;) is included in this list.<\\/p>\\n<p>So again, it&#8217;s not clear whose rubberstamp they would still have required.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2017\\/08\\/31\\/documents-detail-deepminds-plan-to-apply-ai-to-nhs-data-in-2015\\/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm\\/\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-1534687\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1534687\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/08\\/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"554\\\" height=\\\"121\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/08\\/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png 554w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/08\\/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=150,33 150w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/08\\/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=300,66 300w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/08\\/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=50,11 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\\\" \\/><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<h2>The value of transparency<\\/h2>\\n<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s clear that transparency is a preferred principle of medical research ethics &#8212; hence the NHS encouraging those filling in research applications to publicly register their studies.<\\/p>\\n<p>A UK government-commissioned life science strategy review,\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2017\\/08\\/31\\/building-health-ais-should-be-uk-ambition-says-strategy-review\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">published this week<\\/a>, also emphasizes the importance of transparency in engendering and sustaining public trust in health research projects &#8212; arguing it&#8217;s an essential component for furthering the march of digital innovation.<\\/p>\\n<p>The same review also recommends that the UK government and the NHS take ownership of training health AIs off of taxpayer-funded health data-sets &#8212; exactly to avoid corporate entities coming in and asset-stripping potential future medical insights.<\\/p>\\n<p>(&#8220;<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/science\\/2017\\/aug\\/30\\/uk-needs-to-act-urgently-to-secure-nhs-data-for-british-public-report-warns\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Most of the value is the data<\\/a>,&#8221; asserts review author, Sir John Bell, an Oxford University professor of medicine.

It is worth noting that fully approved research projects involving de-personalised data generally do not require patient consent,&#8221; she added.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the time of writing the spokeswoman had not responded to follow-up questions asking why, in 2016, it had made such explicit public denials about its patient data being used for AI research, and why it chose not to make public the existing application to conduct AI research at that time &#8212; or indeed, at an earlier time.<\\/p>\\n<p>Another curious facet to this saga involves the group of &#8220;independent reviewers&#8221; that <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/medium.com\\/@mustafasul\\/deepmind-health-our-commitment-to-the-nhs-ac627c098818\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Suleyman, announced<\\/a>\\u00a0the company had signed up in July 2016 to &#8212; as he put it &#8212; &#8220;examine our work and publish their findings&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>His intent was clearly to try to reset public perceptions of the DeepMind Health initiative after a <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/07\\/20\\/deepminds-first-nhs-health-app-faces-more-regulatory-bumps\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">bumpy start for transparency, consent, information governance and regulatory best practice<\\/a>\\u00a0&#8212; with the wider hope of boosting public trust in what an ad giant wanted with people&#8217;s medical data by allowing some external eyeballs to roll in and poke around.<\\/p>\\n<p>What&#8217;s curious is that the reviewers make no reference to DeepMind&#8217;s AI research study intentions for the Royal Free data-set in their <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/deepmind.com\\/blog\\/independent-reviewers-annual-report-2017\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">first report<\\/a> &#8212; also published this July.<\\/p>\\n<p>We reached out to the chair of the group, former MP Julian Huppert, to ask whether DeepMind informed the group it was intending to undertake AI research on the same data-set.<\\/p>\\n<p>Huppert confirmed to us that the group had been aware there was &#8220;consideration&#8221; of an AI research project using the Royal Free data at the time it was working on its report, but claimed he does not &#8220;recall exactly&#8221; when the project was first mentioned or by whom.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Both the application and the decision not to go ahead happened before the panel was formed,&#8221; he said, by way of explanation for the memory lapse.<\\/p>\\n<p>Asked why the panel did not think the project worth mentioning in its first annual report, he told TechCrunch: &#8220;We were more concerned with looking at work that DMH had done and were planning to do, than things that they had decided not to go ahead with.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I understand that no work was ever done on it. If this project were to be taken forward, there would be many more regulatory steps, which we would want to look at,&#8221; he added.<\\/p>\\n<p>In their report the independent reviews do flag up some issues of concern regarding DeepMind Health&#8217;s operations &#8212; including potential security vulnerabilities around the company&#8217;s handling of health data.<\\/p>\\n<p>For example, a datacenter server build review report, conducted by an external auditor looking at part of DeepMind Health&#8217;s critical infrastructure on behalf of the external reviewers, identified what it judged a &#8220;medium risk vulnerability&#8221; &#8212; noting that:\\u00a0&#8220;A large number of files are present which can be overwritten by any user on the reviewed servers.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;This could allow a malicious user to modify or replace existing files to insert malicious content, which would allow attacks to be conducted against the servers storing the files,&#8221; the auditor added.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Asked how DeepMind Health will work to regain NHS patients&#8217; trust in light of such a string of transparency and regulatory failures to-date, the spokeswoman provided the following statement: &#8220;Over the past eighteen months we\\u2019ve done a lot to try to set a higher standard of transparency, appointing a panel of Independent Reviewers who scrutinise our work, embarking on a patient involvement program, proactively publishing NHS contracts, and <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/beta.techcrunch.com\\/2017\\/03\\/09\\/deepmind-says-no-quick-fix-for-verifying-health-data-access\\/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">building tools to enable better audits of how data is used to support care<\\/a>.

arrangement between Google DeepMind and a UK National Health Service Trust which paint a contrasting picture vs the pair\u2019s public narrative about their intended use of 1.6 million citizens\u2019 medical records.</p> <p>DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust signed their initial\u00a0<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwQ4esYYFC04NFVTRW12TTFFRFE/view\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">information sharing agreement</a>\u00a0(ISA) in September 2015 \u2014 ostensibly to co-develop a clinical task management app, called Streams, for early detection of an acute kidney condition using an NHS algorithm.</p> <p>Patients whose fully identifiable medical records were being shared with the Google-owned company were neither asked for their consent nor informed their data was being handed to the commercial entity.</p> <p>Indeed, the arrangement was only announced to the public five months after it was inked \u2014 and months after patient data had already started to flow.</p> <p>And it was only fleshed out in any real detail after a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data/\"

targets a single condition.</p> <p>This led to an investigation being opened by the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog into the legality of the arrangement. And as public pressure mounted over the scope and intentions behind the medical records collaboration, the pair stuck to their line that patient data was not being used for training artificial intelligence.</p> <p>They also claimed they did not need to seek patient consent for their medical records to be shared because the resulting app would be used for direct patient care \u2014 a claimed legal basis that has since been <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uk-data-regulator-says-deepminds-initial-deal-with-the-nhs-broke-privacy-law/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">demolished by the ICO</a>, which concluded a more than year-long investigation in July.</p> <p>However a series of newly released documents shows that applying AI to the patient data was in fact a goal for DeepMind right from the earliest months of its partnership with the Royal Free \u2014\u00a0with its intention being to utilize the wide-ranging access to and control of publicly-funded medical data it was being granted by the Trust to simultaneously develop its own AI models.</p> <p>In a FAQ note on its website when it publicly announced the collaboration, in February 2016, DeepMind wrote:\u00a0\u201cNo, artificial intelligence is not part of the early-stage pilots we\u2019re announcing today. It\u2019s too early to determine where AI could be applied here, but it\u2019s certainly something we are excited about for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Omitted from that description of its plans was the fact it had already received a favorable ethical opinion from an NHS Health Research Authority research ethics committee to run a two-year AI research study on the same underlying NHS patient data.</p> <p>The newly\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/410881/response/1001252/attach/2/1718%20FOI%20011%20HRA%20response%20and%20documentation.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\"

href=\"http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/using-machine-learning-to-improve-prediction-of-aki-deterioration/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">brief outline</a> of the approved research project was previously published on the Health Research Authority\u2019s website, per its standard protocol, but the FOI reveals more details about the scope of the study \u2014 which is summarized in DeepMind\u2019s application as follows:</p> <p>By combining\u00a0classical\u00a0statistical\u00a0methodology\u00a0and\u00a0cutting-edge\u00a0machine\u00a0learning\u00a0algorithms\u00a0(e.g.\u00a0\u2018unsupervised\u00a0and\u00a0 semi\u00adsupervised\u00a0learning\u2019),\u00a0this\u00a0research\u00a0project\u00a0will\u00a0create\u00a0improved\u00a0techniques\u00a0of\u00a0data\u00a0analysis<br/>\nand\u00a0prediction\u00a0of who\u00a0may\u00a0get\u00a0AKI [acute kidney injury],\u00a0more\u00a0accurately\u00a0identify\u00a0cases\u00a0when\u00a0they\u00a0occur,\u00a0and\u00a0better\u00a0alert\u00a0doctors\u00a0to their\u00a0presence.</p> <p>DeepMind\u2019s application claimed that the existing NHS algorithm, which it was deploying via the Streams app, \u201cappears\u201d to be missing and misclassifying some cases of AKI, and generating false positives \u2014 and goes on to suggest: \u201cThe\u00a0problem\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0tool\u00a0which\u00a0DeepMind\u00a0have\u00a0made,\u00a0but\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0 algorithm\u00a0itself. We\u00a0think\u00a0we\u00a0can\u00a0overcome\u00a0these\u00a0problems,\u00a0and\u00a0create\u00a0a\u00a0system\u00a0which\u00a0works\u00a0better.\u201d</p> <p>Although at the time it wrote this application, in October 2015, user tests of the Streams app had not yet begun \u2014 so it\u2019s unclear how DeepMind could so confidently assert there was no \u201cproblem\u201d with a tool it hadn\u2019t yet tested. But presumably it was attempting to convey information about (what it claimed were) \u201cmajor limitations\u201d with the working of the NHS\u2019 national AKI algorithm passed on to it by the Royal Free.</p> <p>(For the record: In an FOI response that TechCrunch received back from the Royal Free in August 2016, the Trust told us that the first Streams user tests were carried out on 12-14 December 2015. It further confirmed: \u201cThe application has not been implemented outside of the controlled user\u00a0<span class=\"il\">tests</span>.\u201d)</p> <p>Most interestingly, DeepMind\u2019s AI research application shows it told the NHS ethics board that it could process NHS data for the study under \u201cexisting information sharing agreements\u201d with the Royal Free.</p> <p>\u201cDeepMind acting as a data processor, under existing information sharing agreements with the responsible care organisations (in this case the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust), and providing existing services on identifiable patient data, will identify and anonymize the relevant records,\u201d the Google division wrote in the research application.</p> <p>The fact that DeepMind had taken active steps to gain approval for AI research\u00a0on the Royal Free patient data as far back as fall 2015 flies in the face of all the subsequent assertions made by the pair to the press and public \u2014 when they claimed the Royal Free data was not being used to train AI models.</p> <p>For instance, here\u2019s what this publication was told <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/05/04/concerns-raised-over-broad-scope-of-deepmind-nhs-health-data-sharing-deal/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in May last year</a>, after the scope of the data being shared by the Trust with DeepMind had just emerged (emphasis mine):</p> <p>DeepMind confirmed it is <strong>not, at this point, performing\u00a0any machine learning/AI processing on\u00a0the data it is receiving</strong>, although the company has clearly indicated it would like to do so in future. A note on its website pertaining to\u00a0this ambition\u00a0reads: \u201c[A]rtificial intelligence is not part of the early-stage pilots we\u2019re announcing today. <strong>It\u2019s too early to determine where AI could be applied here</strong>, but it\u2019s certainly something we are excited about for the future.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal Free spokesman said\u00a0it is <strong>not possible, under the current data-sharing agreement between the trust and DeepMind, for the company to apply AI technology to these data-sets and data streams</strong>.</p> <p>That type of processing of the data would require another agreement, he confirmed.</p> <p>\u201c<strong>The only thing this data is for is direct patient care</strong>,\u201d he added. \u201c<strong>It is not being used for research</strong>, or anything like that.\u201d</p> <p>As the FOI makes clear, and contrary to the Royal Free spokesman\u2019s claim, DeepMind had in fact been granted ethical approval by the NHS Health Research Authority in November 2015 to conduct AI research on the Royal Free patient data-set \u2014 with DeepMind in control of selecting and anonymizing the PID (patient identifiable data) intended for this purpose.</p> <p>Conducting research on medical data would clearly not constitute an act of direct patient care \u2014 which was the legal basis DeepMind and the Royal Free were at the time claiming for their reliance on implied consent of NHS patients to their data being shared. So, in seeking to paper over the erupting controversy about how many patients\u2019 medical records had been shared without their knowledge or consent, it appears the pair felt the need to publicly de-emphasize their parallel AI research intentions for the data.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have been given data, and then anonymise it to do research on, it\u2019s disingenuous to claim you\u2019re not using the data for research,\u201d said Dr Eerke Boiten, a cyber security professor at De Montfort University whose research interests encompass data privacy and ethics, when asked for his view on the pair\u2019s\u00a0<em>modus operandi\u00a0</em>here.</p> <p>\u201cAnd [DeepMind] as computer scientists, some of them with a <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ross Anderson</a> pedigree, they should know better than to believe in \u2018anonymised medical data\u2019,\u201d he added \u2014 a reference to how trivially easy it has been shown to be for sensitive medical data to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/code-practice-medical-data-vulnerable\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">re-identified</a> once it\u2019s handed over to third parties who can triangulate identities using all sorts of other data holdings.</p> <p>Also commenting on what the documents reveal, Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, told us: \u201cWhat this shows is that Google ignored the rules. The people involved have repeatedly claimed ignorance, as if they couldn\u2019t use a search engine. Now it appears they were very clear indeed about all the rules and contractual arrangements; they just deliberately chose not to follow them.\u201d</p> <p>Asked to respond to criticism that it has deliberately ignored NHS\u2019 information governance rules, a DeepMind spokeswoman said the AI research being referred to \u201chas not taken place\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo be clear, no research project has taken place and no AI has been applied to that dataset. We have always said that we would like to undertake research in future, but the work we are delivering for the Royal Free is solely what has been said all along \u2014 delivering Streams,\u201d she added.</p> <p>She also pointed to a <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/ico-royal-free/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> the company published this summer after the ICO ruled that the 2015 ISA with the Royal Free had broken UK data protection laws \u2014 in which DeepMind admits it \u201cunderestimated the complexity of NHS rules around patient data\u201d and failed to adequately listen and \u201cbe accountable to and [be] shaped by patients, the public and the NHS as a whole\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe made a mistake in not publicising our work when it first began in 2015, so we\u2019ve proactively announced and published the contracts for our subsequent NHS partnerships,\u201d it wrote in July.</p> <p>In one of the sections of DeepMind\u2019s November 2015 AI research study application form, which asks for \u201ca summary of the main ethical, legal or management issues arising from the research project\u201d, the company writes: \u201cWe do not foresee any major ethical, legal or management issues.\u201d</p> <p>Clearly, with hindsight, the data-sharing partnership would quickly run into major ethical and legal problems. So that\u2019s a pretty major failure of foresight by the world\u2019s most famous AI-building entity. (Albeit, it\u2019s worth noting that the rest of a fuller response in this section has been entirely redacted \u2014 but presumably DeepMind is discussing what it considers lesser issues here.)</p> <p>The application also reveals that the company intended not to register the AI research in a public database \u2014 bizarrely claiming that \u201cno appropriate database exists for work such as this\u201d.</p> <p>In this section the application form includes the following guidance note for applicants: \u201cRegistration of research studies is encouraged wherever possible\u201d, and goes on to suggest various possible options for registering a study \u2014 such as via a partner NHS organisation; in a register run by a medical research charity; or via publishing through an open access publisher.</p> <p>DeepMind makes no additional comment on any of these suggestions.</p> <p>When we asked the company why it had not intended to register the AI research the spokeswoman reiterated that \u201cno research project has taken place\u201d, and added: \u201cA <a href=\"http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/using-machine-learning-to-improve-prediction-of-aki-deterioration/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">description</a> of the initial HRA [Health Research Authority] application is publicly available on the HRA website.\u201d</p> <p>Evidently the company \u2014 whose parent entity Google\u2019s corporate mission statement claims it wants to \u2018organize the world\u2019s information\u2019 \u2014 was in no rush to more widely distribute its plans for applying AI to NHS data at this stage.</p> <p>Details of the size of the study have also been redacted in the FOI response so it\u2019s not possible to ascertain how many of the 1.6M medical records DeepMind intended to use for the AI research, although the document does confirm that children\u2019s medical records would be included in the study.</p> <p>The application confirms that Royal Free NHS patients who have previously opted out of their data being used for any medical research would be excluded from the AI study (as would be required by UK law).</p> <p>As noted above, DeepMind\u2019s application also specifies that the company would be both handling fully identifiable patient data from the Royal Free, for the purposes of developing the clinical task management app Streams, and also identifying and anonymizing a sub-set of this data to run its AI research.</p> <p>This could well raise additional questions over whether the level of control DeepMind was being afforded by the Trust over patients\u2019 data is appropriate for an entity that is described as occupying the secondary role of data processor \u2014 vs the Royal Free claiming it remains the data controller.</p> <p>\u201cA data processor does not determine the purpose of processing \u2014 a data controller does,\u201d said Boiten, commenting on this point. \u201cDoing AI research\u201d is too aspecific as a purpose, so I find it impossible to view DeepMind as only a data processor in this scenario,\u201d he added.</p> <p>One thing is clear: When the DeepMind-Royal Free collaboration was publicly revealed with much fanfare, the fact they had already applied for and been granted ethical approval to perform AI research on the same patient data-set was not \u2014 in their view \u2014 a consideration they deemed merited detailed public discussion. Which is a huge miscalculation when you\u2019re trying to win the public\u2019s trust for the sharing of their most sensitive personal data.</p> <p>Asked why it had not informed the press or the public about the existence and status of the research project at the time, a DeepMind spokeswoman failed to directly respond to the question \u2014 instead she reiterated that: \u201cNo research is underway.\u201d</p> <p>DeepMind and the Royal Free both claim that, despite receiving a favorable ethical opinion on the AI research application in November 2015 from the NHS ethics committee, additional approvals would have been required before the AI research could have gone ahead.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cA favourable opinion from a research ethics committee does not constitute full approval. This work could not take place without further approvals,\u201d the DeepMind spokeswoman told us.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe AKI research application has initial ethical approval from the national research ethics service within the Health Research Authority (HRA), as noted on the <a href=\"http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/using-machine-learning-to-improve-prediction-of-aki-deterioration/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HRA website</a>. However, DeepMind does not have the next step of approval required to proceed with the study \u2014 namely full HRA approval (previously called local R&amp;D approval).</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIn addition, before any research could be done, DeepMind and the Royal Free would also need a research collaboration agreement,\u201d she added.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The HRA\u2019s letter to DeepMind confirming its favorable opinion on the study does indeed note:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Management permission or approval must be obtained from each host organisation prior to the start of the study at the site concerned.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Management permission (\u201cR&amp;D approval\u201d) should be sought from all NHS organisations involved in the study in accordance with NHS research governance arrangements</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">However since the proposed study was to be conducted purely on a database of patient data, rather than at any NHS locations, and given that the Royal Free already had an information-sharing arrangement inked in place with DeepMind, it\u2019s not clear exactly what additional external approvals they were awaiting.</p> <p>The original (now defunct and ICO sanctioned)\u00a0<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwQ4esYYFC04NFVTRW12TTFFRFE/view\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ISA</a> between the pair does include the below paragraph \u2014 granting DeepMind the ability to anonymize the Royal Free patient data-set \u201cfor research\u201d purposes. And although this clause lists several bodies, one of which it says would also need to approve any projects under \u201cformal research ethics\u201d, the aforementioned HRA (\u201cthe National Research Ethics Service\u201d) is included in this list.</p> <p>So again, it\u2019s not clear whose rubberstamp they would still have required.</p> <p><a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/documents-detail-deepminds-plan-to-apply-ai-to-nhs-data-in-2015/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1534687\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1534687\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px\" src=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png 554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=150,33 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=300,66 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-7-35-46-pm.png?resize=50,11 50w\" width=\"554\"/></a></p> <p>At the same time, it\u2019s clear that transparency is a preferred principle of medical research ethics \u2014 hence the NHS encouraging those filling in research applications to publicly register their studies.</p> <p>A UK government-commissioned life science strategy review,\u00a0<a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/building-health-ais-should-be-uk-ambition-says-strategy-review/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published this week</a>, also emphasizes the importance of transparency in engendering and sustaining public trust in health research projects \u2014 arguing it\u2019s an essential component for furthering the march of digital innovation.</p> <p>The same review also recommends that the UK government and the NHS take ownership of training health AIs off of taxpayer-funded health data-sets \u2014 exactly to avoid corporate entities coming in and asset-stripping potential future medical insights.</p> <p>(\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/30/uk-needs-to-act-urgently-to-secure-nhs-data-for-british-public-report-warns\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Most of the value is the data</a>,\u201d asserts review author, Sir John Bell, an Oxford University professor of medicine. Data that, in DeepMind\u2019s case, has been so far freely handed over by multiple NHS organizations \u2014 in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/deepmind-health-inks-another-5-year-nhs-app-deal-in-face-of-ongoing-controversy/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">June</a>, for example, it emerged that another NHS Trust which has inked a five-year data-sharing deal with DeepMind, Taunton &amp; Somerset, is not paying the company for the duration of the contract; unless (and in the unlikely eventuality) that the service support exceeds \u00a315,000 a month. So essentially DeepMind is being \u2018paid\u2019 with access to NHS patients\u2019 data.)</p> <p>Even before the ICO\u2019s damning verdict, the original ISA between DeepMind and the Royal Free had been extensively\u00a0<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12553-017-0179-1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">criticized for lacking robust legal and ethical safeguards</a> on how patient data could be used. (Even as DeepMind\u2019s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman tried to brush off criticism, saying negative headlines were the result of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-nhs-data-sharing-streams-app-privacy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a group with a particular view to peddle</a>\u201c.)</p> <p>But after the original controversy flared the pair subsequently scrapped the agreement and replaced it, in <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/deepmind-health-inks-new-deal-with-uks-nhs-to-deploy-streams-app-in-early-2017/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">November 2016</a>, with a second data-sharing contract which included some additional information governance concessions \u2014 while also continuing to share largely the same quantity and types of identifiable Royal Free patient data as before.</p> <p>Then this\u00a0<a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uk-data-regulator-says-deepminds-initial-deal-with-the-nhs-broke-privacy-law/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">July</a>, as noted earlier, the ICO ruled that the original ISA had indeed breached UK privacy law. \u201cPatients would not have reasonably expected their information to have been used in this way, and the Trust could and should have been far more transparent with patients as to what was happening,\u201d it stated in its decision.</p> <p>The ICO also said it had asked the Trust to commit to making changes to address the shortcomings that the regulator had identified.</p> <p>In a statement on\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/news-media/news/royal-free-london-statement-on-the-information-commissioners-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">its website</a>\u00a0the Trust said it accepted the findings and claimed to have \u201calready made good progress to address the areas where they have concerns\u201d, and to be \u201cdoing much more to keep our patients informed about how their data is used\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe would like to reassure patients that their information has been in our control at all times and has never been used for anything other than delivering patient care or ensuring their safety,\u201d the Royal Free\u2019s July statement added.</p> <p>Responding to questions put to it for this report, the Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed it was aware of and involved with the 2015 DeepMind AI research study application.</p> <p>\u201cTo be clear, the application was for research on de-personalised data and not the personally identifiable data used in providing Stream,\u201d said a spokeswoman.</p> <p>\u201cNo research project has begun, and it could not begin without further approvals. It is worth noting that fully approved research projects involving de-personalised data generally do not require patient consent,\u201d she added.</p> <p>At the time of writing the spokeswoman had not responded to follow-up questions asking why, in 2016, it had made such explicit public denials about its patient data being used for AI research, and why it chose not to make public the existing application to conduct AI research at that time \u2014 or indeed, at an earlier time.</p> <p>Another curious facet to this saga involves the group of \u201cindependent reviewers\u201d that <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mustafasul/deepmind-health-our-commitment-to-the-nhs-ac627c098818\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Suleyman, announced</a>\u00a0the company had signed up in July 2016 to \u2014 as he put it \u2014 \u201cexamine our work and publish their findings\u201d.</p> <p>His intent was clearly to try to reset public perceptions of the DeepMind Health initiative after a <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/deepminds-first-nhs-health-app-faces-more-regulatory-bumps/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bumpy start for transparency, consent, information governance and regulatory best practice</a>\u00a0\u2014 with the wider hope of boosting public trust in what an ad giant wanted with people\u2019s medical data by allowing some external eyeballs to roll in and poke around.</p> <p>What\u2019s curious is that the reviewers make no reference to DeepMind\u2019s AI research study intentions for the Royal Free data-set in their <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/independent-reviewers-annual-report-2017/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first report</a> \u2014 also published this July.</p> <p>We reached out to the chair of the group, former MP Julian Huppert, to ask whether DeepMind informed the group it was intending to undertake AI research on the same data-set.</p> <p>Huppert confirmed to us that the group had been aware there was \u201cconsideration\u201d of an AI research project using the Royal Free data at the time it was working on its report, but claimed he does not \u201crecall exactly\u201d when the project was first mentioned or by whom.</p> <p>\u201cBoth the application and the decision not to go ahead happened before the panel was formed,\u201d he said, by way of explanation for the memory lapse.</p> <p>Asked why the panel did not think the project worth mentioning in its first annual report, he told TechCrunch: \u201cWe were more concerned with looking at work that DMH had done and were planning to do, than things that they had decided not to go ahead with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand that no work was ever done on it. If this project were to be taken forward, there would be many more regulatory steps, which we would want to look at,\u201d he added.</p> <p>In their report the independent reviews do flag up some issues of concern regarding DeepMind Health\u2019s operations \u2014 including potential security vulnerabilities around the company\u2019s handling of health data.</p> <p>For example, a datacenter server build review report, conducted by an external auditor looking at part of DeepMind Health\u2019s critical infrastructure on behalf of the external reviewers, identified what it judged a \u201cmedium risk vulnerability\u201d \u2014 noting that:\u00a0\u201cA large number of files are present which can be overwritten by any user on the reviewed servers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis could allow a malicious user to modify or replace existing files to insert malicious content, which would allow attacks to be conducted against the servers storing the files,\u201d the auditor added.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Asked how DeepMind Health will work to regain NHS patients\u2019 trust in light of such a string of transparency and regulatory failures to-date, the spokeswoman provided the following statement: \u201cOver the past eighteen months we\u2019ve done a lot to try to set a higher standard of transparency, appointing a panel of Independent Reviewers who scrutinise our work, embarking on a patient involvement program, proactively publishing NHS contracts, and <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/deepmind-says-no-quick-fix-for-verifying-health-data-access/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">building tools to enable better audits of how data is used to support care</a>. In our recently signed partnership with <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/deepmind-health-inks-another-5-year-nhs-app-deal-in-face-of-ongoing-controversy/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust</a>, for example, we committed to supporting public engagement activity before any patient data is transferred for processing. And at our recent consultation events in London and Manchester, patients provided feedback on DeepMind Health\u2019s work.\u201d</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Asked whether it had informed the independent reviewers about the existence of the AI research application, the spokeswoman declined to respond directly. Instead she repeater the prior line that: \u201cNo research project is underway.\u201d</p> ", "website": "techcrunch"}

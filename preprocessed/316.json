They rode the wave in one sharp-toothed tsunami, penetrating the dolphin tank with open mouths, chasing the dolphins into new parts of the park.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c07d\" name=\"c07d\">Down came the manatee tank, the penguin\u2019s pen, and the piglet squid viewing room. The flamingo hut and the snake house withstood the pressure but flooded with water, the animals\u2019 terrestrial enclosures suddenly transformed into muddy aquariums. Noah\u2019s ark was now subject to a Darwinian reorganization in which for a few breathless seconds, snakes became exotic fish, tails dropping vertically like flutes bobbing in the water until they finally sank to the floor. Nearby, the flamingos honked in terror, their pink necks popping up above the waves like unfastened hooks, tangling in each other until they dropped below the surface.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3d01\" name=\"3d01\">As the water from the tanks expanded to the edges of the park, the depths once housing the sea\u2019s greatest creatures were now reduced to mere puddles. Fish were left flapping against the asphalt; the beluga whale flattened seahorses and starfish as it barreled its way through the park in search of arctic water. No longer traveling forward with carnivorous glee, the sharks came to a stop near the snack bar and began rolling about on their dolphin-stuffed bellies, emitting wimpy cries that would have delighted fish lower on the totem pole were they too not gasping in their newly parched environment. Within minutes, self-pity transformed to anger, and in their final moments, the sharks turned on each other in a cannibalistic bloodbath.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3641\" name=\"3641\">It all happened so quickly that by the time the rescue crews arrived, there was little left to salvage. The crew moved swiftly from one section of the park to the next, their faces increasingly grim. The manta rays spread flat like leathery carpets, the snakes roping above them in a bloated tangle. Colorful fish lay on their sides, mouths gaping, scales shifting like crystals in the slowly rising sun.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2e7f\" name=\"2e7f\">Word quickly spread of the catastrophe, and television news helicopters soon circled above. Everyone was looking for Belbo, Palo Alto\u2019s beloved walrus and official mascot. The rescue crew finally discovered the aquarium\u2019s prized pinniped underneath one of the felled walls, her death exacted by a slab of heavy concrete.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9bcd\" name=\"9bcd\">As the leader of the rescue crew turned to declare the end of their efforts, a loud croak bellowed from the northwest corner of the park. The crew ran toward the sound, which now repeated, like a foghorn, over and over. It was coming from the marine-themed jungle gym, one of the few structures that had survived the flood, thanks to its distance from the shark and dolphin tanks. As the crew approached, they saw a gray mass swaying atop the slide, partially blocking the sun. The rescuers shielded their eyes for a better view, and soon its form grew clearer. It was a one-eyed sea lion with a patch on its left eye.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08a3\" name=\"08a3\">At the sight of the rescue team, the sea lion barked again and clapped its hands. It balanced a ball on its nose, then put its weight on its front flippers and lifted its tail up behind its head. Without thinking, the rescue crew laughed and clapped.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5c13\" name=\"5c13\">Then the sea lion jumped onto its belly and sailed down the slide, landing on its stomach, flappers out to its side and a smile on its face. The crew rushed to hug the sea lion, to applaud its survival skills, to hail the new mascot of Palo Alto. The animal clapped its hands again and croaked three times, and across Silicon Valley, the sea lion\u2019s bark dried the tears of the children watching the live news broadcasts. The sea lion showed them hope amid this sea of destruction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f779\" name=\"f779\">One of the newscasters named it Fred.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bae0\" name=\"bae0\">A few months later, when the ground had finally dried and the bitter memories of the lost aquarium had faded for all but lawyers and insurance companies, the lot was purchased by a young internet company called Anahata. The founder of the company demanded that Fred be included as part of the property deal.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"95c2\" name=\"95c2\">Fred was given his own wading pool next to the founder\u2019s office but spent most of his time waddling about the company\u2019s halls, pooping in the cubicles and barking at employees he didn\u2019t like, forcing Anahata\u2019s engineers to purchase sound-reduction headphones so they could work undisturbed. Fred did as he pleased and, in doing so, impressed everyone with his stubborn refusal to change his ways.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d12\" name=\"8d12\">When Fred died of old age a few years later, all the employees gathered to pay their respects. During the dedication of a commemorative aquarium in the company\u2019s main building, the founder of Anahata, a man named Bobby Bonilo, told his employees that it was Fred who had taught him how to run his company. Fred, he said, had proven that it was fine to have one eye and waddle if you were better than anyone else at doing those things.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5520\" name=\"5520\">No one understood the metaphor, but all the employees committed it to memory as important career advice.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0aa4\" name=\"0aa4\">The commemorative aquarium was soon filled with brightly colored fish and crustaceans, as well as a giant squid the founder flew back from a remote island in the Pacific. The squid wowed the crowd with its undulating arms, which extended almost the full length of the tank, and its chomping mouth, which tore apart most of the fish the moment they were dropped in the water.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0ce9\" name=\"0ce9\">Nearly a decade on, the squid is nearly the size of a school bus and the aquarium\u2019s only remaining inhabitant. It floats in the central building of Anahata, today the world\u2019s largest and most powerful technology company.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"33e0\" name=\"33e0\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"7465\" name=\"7465\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"7707\" name=\"7707\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">To</span> interview at Anahata was a privilege. And the next, nearly inevitable step\u200a\u2014\u200ato be rejected from Anahata\u200a\u2014\u200awas a great honor. Just making it into the company\u2019s lobby already indicated that one was superior to 99.39 percent of the world\u2019s population. To be accepted, of course, required passing an even higher bar.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b009\" name=\"b009\">One by one, the gobsmacked Rejects filed past the Hopefuls sitting in the lobby, as unsure of their steps as they now were of their qualifications. They turned back to catch a final glimpse of Anahata\u2019s collection of gleaming white buildings, and smiled then, just briefly, knowing that despite their failure\u200a\u2014\u200aa failure from which they might never recover\u200a\u2014\u200aat least they were among the few to have glimpsed the world hidden behind the company\u2019s doors.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9880\" name=\"9880\">Arsyen Aimo surveyed his surroundings. It couldn\u2019t have been a friendlier place: wide green sofas, a gigantic refrigerator full of fresh juices, and a flight simulator to help pass the time in the unlikely event of a delay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed38\" name=\"ed38\">Sitting on the very edge of the first couch was a young man, hair uncombed, T-shirt wrinkled, emitting a faint odor of sweat. Crumbs of breakfast cereal cast a pebbled road across his chest. A thin folder jittered in his hand, its transparency revealing a document whose tidy bullet points and blurbs belied the man\u2019s unkempt appearance. His knees bounced lightly up and down, and he rocked as he sat, lips moving silently as though he were counting to himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cac4\" name=\"cac4\">On the second couch was another man, this one in his mid-thirties and wearing a suit, his cologne the essence of a crisp morning in the mountains. His back was against the sofa, one ankle thrown across the opposite knee, an arm thrown over the cushion as if he were there to watch Sunday football. He kept checking his watch, darting glances both anxious and dismissive at the female receptionists.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08d9\" name=\"08d9\">Arsyen immediately recognized their types. The first was an engineer, the second a salesman. And there was no reason for Arsyen to think any more of either of them\u200a\u2014\u200aor the other fifteen iterations also waiting in the lobby\u200a\u2014\u200aas he had seen enough of both during his time in the Valley to identify their species by smell alone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b2a\" name=\"5b2a\">Arsyen had other things on his mind; he was there to conquer his job interview. For he was Arsyen, Prince of Pyrrhia.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"875f\" name=\"875f\">Or rather, a former prince who due to unfortunate circumstances had been reduced to working as a janitor in Silicon Valley.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80bd\" name=\"80bd\">Or, as he preferred to refer to it, a sanitation engineer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7f9f\" name=\"7f9f\">Not that he liked cleaning. He hated it. Prince Arsyen had not been raised in the Order of the Red Woodpecker\u200a\u2014\u200abuffed and preened and rubbed and polished to perfection by handmaidens each morning\u200a\u2014\u200awith the idea that he would leave the royal palace and clean people\u2019s toilets in America. (As a child, Arsyen didn\u2019t even know how to use a toilet, thanks to the service of his royal wipers.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6069\" name=\"6069\">But like most everything he undertook in life, Arsyen excelled at janitorial work\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was so good, in fact, that he usually finished his work in half the time of other janitors. Previous employers had occasionally misinterpreted his skill as laziness and accused him of not having logged sufficient time with the mop. But Arsyen knew that a truly exceptional company would see it differently.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ce7b\" name=\"ce7b\">Anahata was that company, and this was no ordinary janitorial job. It paid better than any other Silicon Valley company by a full $3 an hour. If all went according to plan, in a few decades, Arsyen would save enough money to raise an army and reverse the unfortunate circumstances that had driven him from his country. His future, and the future of his adoring minions, depended on the outcome of this interview.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"17ff\" name=\"17ff\">A recruiter entered the room, and the crowd of hopefuls looked his way.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>His casual good looks and affable demeanor struck Arsyen as an effective ambassador for a company whose public image was one of approachable superiority.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8a17\" name=\"8a17\">\u201cArsyen Aimo?\u201d the recruiter read from a sheet of paper.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d3c3\" name=\"d3c3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Prince Arsyen, </em>Arsyen silently corrected him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bfdb\" name=\"bfdb\">The recruiter used a badge to push past the security doors, and Arsyen\u2019s mouth moved in a silent <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Wow </em>as he entered the building. The cheerful but simple lobby area had not prepared him for this. The recruiter stopped\u200a\u2014\u200aa seemingly well-rehearsed pause of ten seconds\u200a\u2014\u200ato let Arsyen take it all in.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c0f4\" name=\"c0f4\">The building was a light-filled air hangar with expansive skylights and shoulder-height cubicles of varying geometric configurations. One could see across the entire building in a glance. Colorful beanbags were sprinkled here and there, and sleep capsules lined the walls, emitting the faint lullaby of snoring engineers. Each corner and space was maximized to project a sense of possibility, and employees seemed to congregate wherever the mood struck\u200a\u2014\u200aa beanbag suddenly the appropriate place for a conference call; a foosball or pingpong table a surface to plop one\u2019s computer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3f94\" name=\"3f94\">\u201cExtra. Ordinary,\u201d said Arsyen, the English emerging from his tongue like an insult rather than a superlative.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e5cc\" name=\"e5cc\">The recruiter didn\u2019t respond\u200a\u2014\u200ahis smile was stretched too far across his face to allow any spillage of words. He simply nodded and then motioned for Arsyen to follow. They made their way toward the opposite end of the building, then exited into a sunny courtyard and an immense stretch of pert, healthy grass that should never have been able to grow in California\u2019s desert landscape but seemed the natural complement to the bright, white buildings encircling the lawn. Palm trees swayed to an invisible breeze, casting the image of an island paradise in the expansive windows of each structure. For a brief moment, as they walked across a glass bridge over a small creek, Anahata\u2019s green, watery visions of itself surrounding them on all sides, Arsyen wondered which way was up. Legs and sand suddenly joined to palm trees in the reflections, and Arsyen turned, scanning the lawn for their origin. After a few seconds, he found them: a group of tanned girls in their early twenties playing volleyball on a sand court.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b525\" name=\"b525\">Arsyen studied their long limbs and sun-bleached ponytails. They leaped across the sand like lip-glossed gazelles. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I love America</em>, he thought to himself. But he wasn\u2019t the only one watching. Amid the palm and water reflections on the windows, Arsyen could spot a face here and there, male onlookers with cheeks pressed up against the glass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b20c\" name=\"b20c\">They entered a new building, similar to the previous one, and Arsyen was ushered into a small, white room. It looked like a normal office, except all the walls were made of glass\u200a\u2014\u200aa familiar layout in Silicon Valley. For most employees, these spaces were a symbol of transparency and openness. For sanitation engineers like Arsyen, they were just an invitation for dirty fingerprints.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5bc1\" name=\"5bc1\">The recruiter sat Arsyen at a table in the center of the room.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dd74\" name=\"dd74\">\u201cWe\u2019ve found that it\u2019s most efficient for everyone to take a test before we invest in a conversation,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"211e\" name=\"211e\">\u201cSorry?\u201d said Arsyen, perpetually annoyed that the English language required him to apologize when it was others who were unclear.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4969\" name=\"4969\">\u201cYou\u2019re going to take a test now. If you pass, then someone will come interview you,\u201d the recruiter said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"742c\" name=\"742c\">\u201cAnd then I meet Bobby Bonilo?\u201d Arsyen asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1726\" name=\"1726\">\u201cThe founder of Anahata? At your interview? Uh\u2014\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"53b3\" name=\"53b3\">\u201cI give great interview,\u201d said Arsyen, rising to his feet. He placed his hands on his hips and raised his chin as his father, the king, used to do.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"afc9\" name=\"afc9\">The recruiter\u2019s smile collapsed for a split second before rebounding.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ff69\" name=\"ff69\">\u201cHow about we first see if you can find the error on this page.\u201d He pulled a paper from the top of his stack and handed it to Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"202c\" name=\"202c\">Arsyen looked down and gasped at the dark incantations before him: nonsensical numbers and letters enclosed in &lt; &gt;.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f344\" name=\"f344\">It wasn\u2019t that Arsyen had never seen computer code before. It was inescapable in the Valley\u200a\u2014\u200aon buses and billboards, hats and T-shirts. Valley people spoke of code like it was an act of progress, on par with a social movement. Over the years, as he mopped and scrubbed in the background, Arsyen had overheard more than a few hallway conversations in which scrawny men talked about using their code to change the world.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"823a\" name=\"823a\">But knowing how to recognize code and knowing<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> how</em> to code were two very different things. Surely there was no way he could be expected to perform such a task. Arsyen grunted. It was in moments like this that he particularly missed his home country of Pyrrhia. There he would have had any number of servants who could have learned computer programming on his behalf.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"100b\" name=\"100b\">Perhaps this was the right moment to inform the recruiter of his royal lineage. There had been no applicable dropdown box in the online application; no way for Arsyen to signal that he was not simply a great janitor, but someone whose very greatness had once been written into his country\u2019s constitution.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1431\" name=\"1431\">But such a direct declaration struck Arsyen as rather crass\u200a\u2014\u200aroyalty was to be recognized, not announced.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d2ea\" name=\"d2ea\">Of course, that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t help things along with a discreet nod toward his heritage. Arsyen ignored the recruiter\u2019s prompt to find the coding error\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had no clue, and in any case, such details were for clerks and commoners. Instead, he sketched a crude outline of a pointy crown across the length of the page.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bd50\" name=\"bd50\">\u201cDone,\u201d announced Arsyen, pushing the paper across the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b46\" name=\"2b46\">The recruiter glanced at Arsyen\u2019s paper and did a double take. \u201cWell, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that\u2019s</em> a bold statement,\u201d he said finally, then excused himself and left the room.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c55\" name=\"7c55\">Minutes later, a slightly balding man in his thirties entered carrying a brown paper bag. He was wearing a purple T-shirt with an orange cartoon character on the front; the sandals on his feet were made of red plastic. Arsyen was surprised by the ensemble. From what he had seen during his time in America, most sanitation engineers dressed inconspicuously, their very livelihood dependent on being able to make dirt\u200a\u2014\u200aand themselves\u200a\u2014\u200aas invisible as possible to the general population.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"934e\" name=\"934e\">This man looked more like a court jester.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"58a7\" name=\"58a7\">\u201cHi, I\u2019m Roni,\u201d he said, setting Arsyen\u2019s test on the table and extending his hand. \u201cYou got a r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0cdd\" name=\"0cdd\">Arsyen shook his head.

I mean, a piece of paper\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s like, so corporate, you know? We don\u2019t need \u2019em. Let\u2019s just talk like equals, like regular guys who went to Stanford together.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d33b\" name=\"d33b\">He sat down in the chair opposite Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"80da\" name=\"80da\">\u201cSo, how long have you been an engineer?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"04ab\" name=\"04ab\">Arsyen felt his heart jump. It was the first time someone had properly called him an \u201cengineer.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4b3d\" name=\"4b3d\">\u201cFour years,\u201d he answered, and then paused. Now was the time. He cleared his throat and lowered his voice, consciously making it as booming and sonorous as the Aimo name deserved. \u201cI am also\u2026prince.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9248\" name=\"9248\">Roni chuckled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that one before. Actually, most of the engineers here think they are kings.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bf0a\" name=\"bf0a\">\u201cBut there only one king,\u201d said Arsyen, making the sign of the red-breasted woodpecker.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6fac\" name=\"6fac\">\u201cSo true, so true,\u201d Roni said. \u201cAnd what a king we have here at Anahata.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a71\" name=\"7a71\">Roni\u2019s gaze floated skyward, as if communicating with an otherworldly being. Arsyen also looked up but saw nothing more than a halogen lamp with a sticker touting its energy efficiency.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d738\" name=\"d738\">Roni snapped back to life.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"697a\" name=\"697a\">\u201cNow, where were you before this?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8b52\" name=\"8b52\">\u201cGalt.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd21\" name=\"cd21\">Roni\u2019s eyebrows leaped up in a flash, but then, equally quickly, were dragged downward\u200a\u2014\u200aa clear attempt by their owner to anchor his admiration. Galt was one of the Valley\u2019s hottest startups, famous for having created a bunch of apps and tools that eliminated the tedium of journalism, research, essays, and speeches by reducing all thought and opinion to easily shareable, bite-sized chunks. Everything they did was about minimization\u200a\u2014\u200amaking the world \u201ceasier to digest.\u201d Some people predicted Galt was the next Anahata, though personally, Arsyen had found the company lacked any creativity or vision and was always asking him to take a second pass at the men\u2019s stalls.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"68c9\" name=\"68c9\">\u201cGalt, eh? Well, that explains this,\u201d said Roni, pointing at the crown Arsyen had sketched across his test, lassoing most of the page\u2019s code.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1873\" name=\"1873\">\u201cPretty ballsy to suggest all of our code is a mess,\u201d Roni said. \u201cI would respectfully disagree, but I applaud your moxie. You must be good at debugging.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e469\" name=\"e469\">Arsyen\u2019s face pruned. \u201cBugs,\u201d he spit. \u201cI kill them every day.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"69aa\" name=\"69aa\">\u201cAwesome. Me too, me too. Obviously, there\u2019s no coding in a P.M. job, but people here will respect you a lot more if you have an engineering background.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"efbf\" name=\"efbf\">Arsyen didn\u2019t know what Roni meant by \u201cP.M. job.\u201d Was it a powerful mopper? A plumbing manager?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f08a\" name=\"f08a\">Roni dipped his hand into the brown paper bag and slowly pulled out an enormous sandwich. Arsyen watched as he slowly removed the plastic and unfolded a paper napkin, square by square, until finally smoothing it before him. Roni paused and bent his head toward his sandwich, lifting his hands just slightly in prayer. And then, suddenly, the hands disappeared, the plastic wrap was on the other side of the table, and the sandwich was half hanging out of Roni\u2019s mouth. Turds of tuna fell onto the napkin below.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2bed\" name=\"2bed\">\u201cLet\u2019s get going, shall we? I only ask one big question in my interviews. I\u2019m kinda known for that. It\u2019s all about the process, about how you go after it. It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what</em> you say, okay?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c27c\" name=\"c27c\">Arsyen nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"20f7\" name=\"20f7\">\u201cSo,\u201d began Roni. \u201cYou\u2019re a pirate and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"598f\" name=\"598f\">\u201cNo, a prince.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d206\" name=\"d206\">\u201cHuh? Oh right, haha. Well, for the purpose of this question, you\u2019re a pirate. If you want, you can be the captain of the pirate ship. Does that work?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a6d2\" name=\"a6d2\">\u201cA captain is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">king</em> of the pirate ship?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5ada\" name=\"5ada\">\u201cExactly. Now you and your crew discover a treasure chest with one hundred gold coins, and you have to find a way to split it up.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2dcb\" name=\"2dcb\">\u201cI give no gold. Gold is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">mine</em>,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e6a7\" name=\"e6a7\">\u201cWell, now wait, that\u2019s the catch. If you don\u2019t give the other pirates anything, they will throw you off the ship. In order not to be killed, you have to come up with a way to distribute the coins so that at least half of the pirates agree with your proposal.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f130\" name=\"f130\">\u201cI kill them and take gold,\u201d said Arsyen, dismissing the question with a wave of his hand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0e06\" name=\"0e06\">\u201cNot so fast,\u201d Roni said. \u201cYou\u2019re the captain, but you\u2019re outnumbered. So you can\u2019t kill them\u200a\u2014\u200athough I like your aggressiveness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"42c0\" name=\"42c0\">\u201cNow, if you get killed, another pirate will have to come up with a proposal, but then he could be killed, too, so it goes to the next pirate. And so on and so on. So it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to agree on a proposal right from the start\u200a\u2014\u200abut also maximize their profit. It\u2019s basically a distribution problem. Actually, you know, I was given the same problem when I came to interview at Anahata. Except my interviewer used the Easter Bunny and a bunch of eggs, and the pirates were actually little kids and\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cbaa\" name=\"cbaa\">But Arsyen had already stopped listening. His family had plundered plenty of ancient treasure over the centuries, swindling mercenaries, gangsters, and, yes, occasionally pirates\u200a\u2014\u200astealing from the very worst of mankind to give to the good people of Pyrrhia.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e678\" name=\"e678\">\u201cYou can use this whiteboard here to work through the problem,\u201d said Roni, pointing to one of the walls. \u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8bf1\" name=\"8bf1\">\u201cOne gold coin,\u201d answered Arsyen. \u201cYou give pirates one coin each.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"91dd\" name=\"91dd\">Roni\u2019s eyes bulged.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"537b\" name=\"537b\">\u201cWow, uh, okay, that was quick. I mean, how did you\u2026I mean, the whiteboard\u2026Like, if there\u2019s two pirates and then you figure out\u2026Wait, how did you do this so fast? Talk me through the math.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e17\" name=\"7e17\">\u201cIn time to do math, other pirates kill captain,\u201d Arsyen answered. \u201cCapitan use brain.\u201d He tapped the side of his head, just in case Roni wasn\u2019t sure where the brain was located. Roni seemed a bit dim; he clearly had never been a pirate or even known one.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4fc1\" name=\"4fc1\">\u201cOh yeah, like, totally,\u201d said Roni, regaining his composure. \u201cI mean, yeah, it\u2019s not difficult. But, um, we still have some time left, so\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cbf4\" name=\"cbf4\">Roni looked around the room, then jumped up from the table and scribbled something on the whiteboard.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c9a6\" name=\"c9a6\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">How do you use data to make your decisions?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ea8b\" name=\"ea8b\">He stood back, shook his head, then erased it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb27\" name=\"fb27\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Describe how you would improve your favorite Anahata product.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c633\" name=\"c633\">He erased that one just as quickly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"28f1\" name=\"28f1\">Then he tried something else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f27f\" name=\"f27f\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Automation.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"030e\" name=\"030e\">He grinned and returned to the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0899\" name=\"0899\">\u201cOkay, pick something in the modern home and tell me what technologies you would use to automate it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b5b0\" name=\"b5b0\">\u201cNo automation. Hire more servants,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"57c4\" name=\"57c4\">\u201cHuh? Uh, no, you can\u2019t have more servants,\u201d said Roni, shaking his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6587\" name=\"6587\">\u201cWhy? Because someone killed them?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bfc6\" name=\"bfc6\">\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d said Roni, his face reddening slightly, fingers pressing into his napkin. \u201cI want a technical framework for how you would go about automating something in your house.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"38b7\" name=\"38b7\">Arsyen couldn\u2019t resist a smirk. Everyone in the Valley wanted to automate everything, but to what end? All they were really doing was getting rid of people\u2019s jobs, which of course meant the peasants would eventually rise up and slaughter them. Technologists were so naive.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1b83\" name=\"1b83\">\u201cNot all innovation so good,\u201d said Arsyen, shaking his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b604\" name=\"b604\">\u201cWrong! One hundred percent wrong!\u201d Roni screamed, jumping out of his chair and waving a mayo-covered finger in Arsyen\u2019s face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c60\" name=\"1c60\">Roni stood and stormed to the door. \u201cRecruiter!\u201d he shouted. \u201cRecruiter!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9322\" name=\"9322\">He stomped out of the room and began to pace, mostly muttering to himself, occasionally yelling \u201cinternet of things!\u201d and then hitting the side of his head with his palm over and over again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"591e\" name=\"591e\">Arsyen sighed inwardly\u200a\u2014\u200aanother janitor diva. He wondered what sort of extraordinary cleaning product or technique Roni had invented for Anahata to put up with such behavior. Or maybe he was just one of those early hires the company never managed to get rid of.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2374\" name=\"2374\">A tall man with a crew cut walked by and Roni waved him down.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b14f\" name=\"b14f\">\u201cGregor!\u201d he shouted. The man stopped but did not seem particularly pleased to see him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a49a\" name=\"a49a\">Roni was gesturing rapidly, shaking his head, pointing at Arsyen in the room. Arsyen couldn\u2019t entirely make out what he was saying, but he was sure he heard the word \u201cGalt.\u201d The man turned to look at Arsyen, and the Prince of Pyrrhia sat up straight and puffed out his chest. But the man\u2019s blank expression gave nothing away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7db0\" name=\"7db0\">A moment later, both men were standing before him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"91cb\" name=\"91cb\">\u201cWhat did you work on at Galt?\u201d demanded the tall man with the crew cut.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f0d0\" name=\"f0d0\">\u201cBathrooms, hallways, computer screens. Much innovation,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cb33\" name=\"cb33\">Roni and the crew cut exchanged glances.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1c85\" name=\"1c85\">\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get anything out of him.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c8bd\" name=\"c8bd\">\u201cBut he surely knows things,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6d9e\" name=\"6d9e\">\u201cDo you know things?\u201d Roni asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e2f\" name=\"3e2f\">Arsyen nodded vigorously. He had enough experience in his father\u2019s court to know that it was always best to agree with an important person\u200a\u2014\u200aunless they were interrogating you about murder or adultery.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aaa0\" name=\"aaa0\">The crew cut stared at Arsyen for a beat longer, then turned to Roni, whispering a few words Arsyen couldn\u2019t make out. Then, without a goodbye or any acknowledgement of Arsyen\u2019s presence, he turned on his heel and marched out the door.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0248\" name=\"0248\">A second later, Roni was grinning, his hand extending again to Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5cea\" name=\"5cea\">\u201cCongrats\u200a\u2014\u200athe job is yours!\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"de9e\" name=\"de9e\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"27c8\" name=\"27c8\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>rsyen was sure he had seen her before\u200a\u2014\u200athough certainly not here, in the Anahata reception area, seated at a long white desk, her figure backlit by a neon \u201cwelcome!\u201d sign.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f3e\" name=\"5f3e\">He studied her face\u200a\u2014\u200athe brown hair moving in slow waves past her shoulders, the slightly raised cheekbones. Her lips moved silently, murmuring secrets and chants\u200a\u2014\u200athings Arsyen wanted to know. His gaze moved again across her face, settling on her blue, almond-shaped eyes. And then he knew.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0d69\" name=\"0d69\">The woman was Xeri. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">His</em> Xeri. But she was a Xeri scrubbed clean, stripped of her crossbow and pointy elfin ears, her dirty wolf cape and leather skirt that hid a dagger in the belt loop. With her long, gauzy dress and random assortment of beaded necklaces, this Xeri was more flower child than assassin. And while that was less of a turn-on, this Xeri had one big thing going for her. She was much better than his <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">World of Warcraft</em> girlfriend. She was real.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"79a2\" name=\"79a2\">It wouldn\u2019t have been such a shock had Arsyen not already resigned himself to the idea that this breed of woman didn\u2019t exist in his corner of America. In his four years of working in Silicon Valley, Arsyen had run into plenty of her gender: ogre women, mustachioed women, circus women. But none like this: an attractive woman. It was like she was from another part of California entirely.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a93e\" name=\"a93e\">Minutes passed as the woman typed on her computer, pale-pink fingernails knocking against the keyboard like little woodpeckers. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tap tap tap.</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tap tap tap.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"833f\" name=\"833f\">He caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass wall behind her\u200a\u2014\u200aa strong Pyrrhian man, with muscles as ropey as the hair on his arms, and a powerful chin whose virile charms were enhanced by the large and uniquely crooked Aimo nose. He was white like the glossy coat of the rare Pyrrhian ram.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bc77\" name=\"bc77\">His reflection frowned back at him. Would she find him a bit short?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8417\" name=\"8417\">Of course not. Back in Pyrrhia, the women always complimented him on his height.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"59ac\" name=\"59ac\">\u201cArsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b9df\" name=\"b9df\">The woman was looking up at him, her smile the product of America\u2019s strong belief in orthodontics. Good humor was cheap currency in this country, but the woman\u2019s smile was different, it was angelic, it was \u2014</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fbb6\" name=\"fbb6\">Arsyen decided then he would make her his queen. Her big white teeth would be admired by all his people.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f155\" name=\"f155\">\u201cUh\u2026Arsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1388\" name=\"1388\">Arsyen snapped back into focus. He had a girlfriend back in Pyrrhia who was dreaming of him and only him every night. He was at Anahata for his job\u200a\u2014\u200athe job that would free his people from the starvation and terrors of the current regime. He didn\u2019t have time for beautiful women\u200a\u2014\u200aat least not the ones who didn\u2019t accept cash.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"57a0\" name=\"57a0\">\u201cYou\u2019re all set up as a new Anahata employee, or Anahatis, as we call ourselves.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"78e7\" name=\"78e7\">The woman walked out from behind the desk and extended her hand. She smelled vaguely of vanilla.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cae5\" name=\"cae5\">\u201cI\u2019m Jennie,\u201d she said cheerfully, seemingly unaware of the mild earthquake that shook Arsyen as their palms touched. \u201cHere\u2019s your badge. Don\u2019t lose it\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s what gives you access to everything here.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f6c9\" name=\"f6c9\">Jennie badged them into the main part of the building, a different one than Arsyen had visited for his job interview. An enormous skylight stretched the building\u2019s length; Arsyen could even see clouds moving across the blue sky above. Suspended from the ceiling by wires and blocking the sun\u2019s glare, an old NASA rocket and a fiberglass <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">T. rex</em> charged at each other from opposite ends of the building.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e13a\" name=\"e13a\">To Arsyen\u2019s left, running along the outside wall of one cubicle, a ticker tape documented connections made through the company\u2019s latest product, Moodify, a social network designed to connect people based on their moods, heart rates, and favorite video games. Although he didn\u2019t know much about technology, Arsyen had recently bought a Moodify bracelet. It pained him that his video game and gadget expenditures had to come out of his throne reclamation fund, but it was very important that the future leader of Pyrrhia be up to date on the latest technology and first-person-shooter attack and defense techniques.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7fcb\" name=\"7fcb\">Arsyen\u2019s Moodify bracelet glowed red\u200a\u2014\u200athe same color, he was certain, as Jennie\u2019s. He waited to see their names cross the ticker tape in a flashing red arrow, suggesting a love connection, but the Moodify technology seemed to be broken. He turned to speak, but Jennie was already on the other side of the hall, standing before an enormous aquarium that stretched the length of the wall. Her bracelet pulsed with blue light. Arsyen shook his head and double-checked to see if his bracelet had changed colors. Maybe he just needed to stand closer. He ran to catch up with his future queen.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"baa6\" name=\"baa6\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"b234\" name=\"b234\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"66b9\" name=\"66b9\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">J</span>ennie spotted the squid from across the floor, its peach mass hovering above a cluster of neon corals and sea plants. The squid was no longer part of the company tour\u200a\u2014\u200anowadays animals were included only if they were robotic\u200a\u2014\u200abut Jennie liked to stop by at least once a week to say hello.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1277\" name=\"1277\">\u201cHi friend,\u201d said Jennie, tapping the glass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"214e\" name=\"214e\">The squid wove its tentacles around a cluster of kelp, ripping the plant from its seabed and pressing it against the glass as if in offering.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c126\" name=\"c126\">\u201cSo sweet,\u201d Jennie giggled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"034f\" name=\"034f\">\u201cWhat this?\u201d said a man\u2019s voice behind her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"782d\" name=\"782d\">Oh\u2026him. Jennie had almost forgotten about him. Who was he\u200a\u2014\u200aArse\u2026Arsi\u2026Ass? She glanced down at her HR form. Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3b7b\" name=\"3b7b\">\u201cThis is our squid,\u201d said Jennie, stretching her receptionist\u2019s smile toothy and wide as she turned to face him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"376b\" name=\"376b\">As far as product managers went, he seemed particularly underwhelming\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019d already been walking for ten minutes and he hadn\u2019t even tried to lecture her about anything. How was it that Anahata could overlook people like Jennie in favor of dopey guys like Arsyen? Jennie had applied to ten internal jobs this quarter alone, ranging from online sales assistant to VP of infrastructure engineering, and hadn\u2019t gotten a single bite. Most of the time they told her she wasn\u2019t the right \u201cculture fit.\u201d Sometimes they claimed she wasn\u2019t qualified\u200a\u2014\u200aJennie, who had an almost-PhD in Russian literature and fifteen online entrepreneurship degrees and had watched every single TED Talk ever recorded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0c25\" name=\"0c25\">\u201cBig fish,\u201d said Arsyen, clearly demonstrating his superior intellect. \u201cOther fish here too?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3c9d\" name=\"3c9d\">\u201cNot anymore. We used to have other fish, but they just kept disappearing while the squid here kept getting bigger and bigger. So it\u2019s just him now. Some people think he ate the smaller fish, but I think he\u2019s just a misunderstood giant.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"135f\" name=\"135f\">Jennie wanted to point out to Arsyen that she had just created a metaphor. She was obviously the squid, but prettier.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a6a0\" name=\"a6a0\">But instead she just smiled. Jennie knew her poetry would be lost on someone with an engineering degree.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"05d4\" name=\"05d4\">\u201cYou can visit him whenever you want,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you make it past the first week, you can even sign up to feed him.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8472\" name=\"8472\">\u201cThe first week\u2026?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4747\" name=\"4747\">Jennie did a double take.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"869a\" name=\"869a\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you read your offer letter?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a205\" name=\"a205\">\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c3b\" name=\"0c3b\">Jennie rifled through the HR paperwork. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, thrusting a paper at Arsyen and tapping the middle of the page with a pink fingernail.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"abf9\" name=\"abf9\">\u201c\u2018Anahata reserves the right to terminate your contract at any point during your first week,\u2019\u201d Jennie quoted. \u201cAnd by \u2018any point,\u2019 they mean even during the first five minutes.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"06c9\" name=\"06c9\">Jennie saw the panic that flashed across Arsyen\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t resist pushing things a bit further.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3a13\" name=\"3a13\">\u201cI should probably fire you right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2521\" name=\"2521\">Jennie ripped Arsyen\u2019s red badge out of his hand and started to walk away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7d9c\" name=\"7d9c\">\u201cBut I\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aed0\" name=\"aed0\">Jennie stopped and sighed. The truth was she had no power to fire anyone at Anahata. It was fun to mess with Arsyen, but if she wasn\u2019t careful, he could end up firing her. The only power receptionists had was over the refrigerator in the reception area.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dcda\" name=\"dcda\">She turned to face him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"899f\" name=\"899f\">\u201cIf you had read your contract, you\u2019d know that I can\u2019t fire you,\u201d Jennie said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"072b\" name=\"072b\">\u201cPhew!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bb9c\" name=\"bb9c\">Jennie scribbled a note on Arsyen\u2019s HR form: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Employee</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">did not read contract</em>. In another profession, that would have been a ding against Arsyen, but at Anahata, managers seemed to view noncompliance among their technical staff as a sign of genius.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d9b3\" name=\"d9b3\">\u201cWhat you doing?\u201d said Arsyen, lifting onto his toes to catch a glimpse of what Jennie had written.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1e9e\" name=\"1e9e\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Jennie, waving away his concern as she pushed him out of the building and onto the lawn. \u201cThe only thing you need to do is keep your manager happy and, well, watch out for other engineers.\u201d She gestured toward a group of men sitting on a picnic table, gathered around a computer. \u201cI can\u2019t fire you, but <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">they</em> can.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5e2\" name=\"f5e2\">The largest man in the group turned in their direction, stretching his arms above his head. Jennie recognized him from the previous week, when she had seen him fire a new engineer for choosing a Diet Coke instead of a Red Bull from the micro-kitchen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9fa3\" name=\"9fa3\">The engineer\u2019s mouth roared in a wide, silent yawn, and his eyes scanned the area around him, moving across the various employees walking across the grass. His gaze fell on Arsyen and a trigger within him seemed to be pulled. He threw his pale, hairy legs over the bench and began to lope toward them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8e30\" name=\"8e30\">\u201cQuick!\u201d hissed Jennie, pushing Arsyen into the nearest building.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3569\" name=\"3569\">She didn\u2019t care about Arsyen, but she did care about her orientation success rate. To date, she was the only Anahata receptionist who had completed all of her new employee tours without having a single employee fired.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3796\" name=\"3796\">Jennie found an empty meeting room and closed the door behind them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3f24\" name=\"3f24\">\u201cThat was close!\u201d she said. \u201cSorry, I should have explained earlier. My badge is white, but your badge is red.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7492\" name=\"7492\">\u201cRed is for special employees?\u201d asked Arsyen, puffing out his chest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c20c\" name=\"c20c\">\u201cI guess you could say that,\u201d shrugged Jennie. \u201cMost of the employees with red badges are contractors. Those are the employees we like\u2026but not so much as to give them health care\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know, like cafeteria workers and security guards. The other people who get red badges are like you\u200a\u2014\u200aprovisional employees who need to pass their first week. Anyway, the point is you\u2019ll need your badge to get into buildings, but the rest of the time you should hide it in your pocket.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"779b\" name=\"779b\">Jennie poked her head out the door. The engineer was pacing the hall. She shut the door and turned to face Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7012\" name=\"7012\">\u201cNever show fear. Engineers can smell it a mile away. Half of succeeding here is just acting like you\u2019re right about stuff even when you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f112\" name=\"f112\">Jennie glanced at Arsyen\u2019s HR sheet. He was assigned to Building 7, which housed some of the company\u2019s coolest projects, like Social Car and Builder. Maybe she could butter up to him and he could get her a job there. Though, on second thought, Arsyen seemed a little creepy and could misinterpret her intentions. The last thing Jennie needed was another work drama. A few weeks earlier she had made the mistake of hooking up with Niels Smeardon, Anahata\u2019s SVP of sales. She had done everything he wanted\u200a\u2014\u200atold him that his penis and sales strategy presentation were the biggest she had ever seen; she even let him balance his computer on her back so he could send a few urgent emails right after they had sex. And all of that had gotten her nothing but a reassignment by the HR team to the main reception area, far away from the sales buildings.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a038\" name=\"a038\">Jennie continued to stew about her Niels hookup as she began to rattle off other campus facts to Arsyen. Sales were in Buildings 10 to 15, Operations from 15 to 20, anything supporting those teams from 20 to 27, and facilities and janitorial staff in Building 28. She saw Arsyen nod when she mentioned the janitors and wondered if he was one of those social activist employees, the type who made six figures but liked to spend the majority of his work hours railing about The Man and trying to make the cafeterias go full vegan.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6292\" name=\"6292\">Jennie found those employees a bit annoying\u200a\u2014\u200athey were always complaining about the juice selection in the reception area\u200a\u2014\u200abut she still preferred them to people like Niels. He had taken home more than $100 million dollars last year in executive pay but hadn\u2019t even offered to order her a car ride home.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"039c\" name=\"039c\">\u201cWhat do you do at Anahata?\u201d asked Arsyen, interrupting Jennie\u2019s thoughts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"edb3\" name=\"edb3\">Was he just trying to make conversation, or was he questioning her competence? At Anahata, one could never be sure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"14bd\" name=\"14bd\">\u201cI\u2019m a campus guide and do some reception work,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important role, because if you don\u2019t have someone like me who shows new people around, they may never understand Anahata and could get lost.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe20\" name=\"fe20\">She paused and searched Arsyen\u2019s face for a reaction. It was totally blank, as if he wasn\u2019t even listening to her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b1bc\" name=\"b1bc\">\u201cOf course, I mean \u2018getting lost\u2019 both figuratively and literally,\u201d continued Jennie, feeling anger build in her stomach. \u201cMany of your lot only understand the latter point, not the former, and so you see, that is why we humanities majors are so valuable here.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d930\" name=\"d930\">Arsyen nodded but now seemed fixated on the Moodify bracelet on his wrist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c682\" name=\"c682\">Had he even heard a word she said? He was like the rest of them\u200a\u2014\u200afull of himself, convinced of his own brilliance, sure that a lowly receptionist was completely irrelevant to the mighty things he had to do during his day. But what did he know about the world, anyway? Coding didn\u2019t teach you about culture. It didn\u2019t teach you empathy or emotional intelligence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"67f6\" name=\"67f6\">\u201cI was a Russian lit PhD before I dropped out to join Anahata, so I know a lot about what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cThere are people starving, people who don\u2019t have clean water. So after Anahata, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do\u200a\u2014\u200achange some of those things. Or maybe I\u2019ll do it here. I haven\u2019t figured it out yet. The point is, do <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you</em> have a social conscience? A big purpose, Arsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d54\" name=\"8d54\">Arsyen looked up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4b6e\" name=\"4b6e\">\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI will save my people and kill very bad dictator.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b56\" name=\"5b56\">Good lord. This tour was proving even more tedious than her last one\u200a\u2014\u200aan engineer who made whale sounds out of his nose while they hid in a broom closet. She leaned out the door.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e576\" name=\"e576\">\u201cAll clear.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd1b\" name=\"cd1b\">She popped her head back in and pointed at Arsyen\u2019s badge to remind him to hide it in his pocket.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a0f3\" name=\"a0f3\">They made it safely to the other parts of the campus, each building revealing a well-orchestrated surprise for Anahata\u2019s new employee. Building 3 had frozen yogurt machines in each cubicle. In Building 4, there was a service for engineers who wanted someone to tuck them in at night in the campus beds. Building 2 had moving walkways that would reverse direction every fifteen minutes\u200a\u2014\u200aa challenge to either time one\u2019s movements precisely or exercise by moving against the current.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0f94\" name=\"0f94\">\u201cPast that door is the volleyball court,\u201d said Jennie, pointing just beyond the reversible walkway, \u201cand to the right is the swimming pool. Our founder, Bobby Bonilo, wanted to set an example for the rest of the Valley that health and fitness should be an important part of an employee\u2019s well-being.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"27bf\" name=\"27bf\">\u201cLike Galt,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7118\" name=\"7118\">Jennie shot Arsyen a glance. What kind of idiot joined Anahata and spent their first day talking about its biggest competitor?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c9da\" name=\"c9da\">\u201cAnahata did it <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">first</em>,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWe were the first to make health a priority. The first to say you should drink lots of water and get lots of sleep. Galt copies everything we do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0e8c\" name=\"0e8c\">She made another note on his HR form: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Cocky</em>.<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> Insulted Anahata.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"387c\" name=\"387c\">Yet another point racked up for Arsyen. This guy had to be one of the more arrogant employees she had ever met. He\u2019d probably be a big success here.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"7eaf\" name=\"7eaf\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"f8cb\" name=\"f8cb\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"5f32\" name=\"5f32\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>hey stopped in front of the medieval-themed cafeteria in Building 5, and for a moment Arsyen was transported back to Poodlekek, standing in a cave next to Sklartar, his manservant.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22b3\" name=\"22b3\">But what had first looked like Sklartar was now, at second glance, clearly a robot, and there were no bodies scattered at his feet. Nor were there any henchmen to wait on Arsyen, or maidens to help feed and clothe him. And there was certainly no one to help clean up after him. To think if his people knew that Arsyen was now cleaning the toilets of America!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aeee\" name=\"aeee\">It was never supposed to be like this. If the peasants hadn\u2019t gotten so mad about the potato tax, if the neighboring country of Embria hadn\u2019t sensed weakness and attacked from the north, Arsyen would still be in Poodlekek now, having his bottom wiped by the royal wiper, occasionally exerting himself at a game of croquet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6539\" name=\"6539\">But the Embrian barbarians had surrounded his family\u2019s palace, with Arsyen narrowly missing execution as he snuck across the border and into a U.N. refugee camp. The Pyrrhian military successfully restored the country to order, but just as Arsyen was prepared to return, General Korpeko declared a coup and foisted the helpless Aimo family from power.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"237e\" name=\"237e\">Arsyen was bounced between various immigrant detention camps, eventually ending up in California, where he was released into the wilds of Silicon Valley. There, he found work as a janitor in Stanford\u2019s chemistry department. Then, from there, on to a few small startups and eventually Galt. And now Anahata, where he would finally make his mark.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f05b\" name=\"f05b\">Arsyen glanced over at his future queen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0d0f\" name=\"0d0f\">Jennie\u2019s mouth was moving again. It seemed to move a lot. Arsyen knew that women liked the opportunity to speak, but beautiful women were most beautiful when they were silent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7423\" name=\"7423\">\u201cAnd so you can see,\u201d she was saying, \u201cthat the composting techniques developed in Russia in the early twentieth century had a profound impact in how we compost now in Palo Alto.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"118d\" name=\"118d\">\u201cYes,\u201d said Arsyen, looking down to see if their Moodify bracelets had finally synced.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d960\" name=\"d960\">They still weren\u2019t working.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6557\" name=\"6557\">Jennie stopped in front of another building. It was an echo of all previous buildings they had toured: an enormous white complex with a plain, charmless exterior. \u201cYour new home,\u201d she announced.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"18c8\" name=\"18c8\">Hadn\u2019t Jennie said janitorial services were in Building 28? This one had an enormous black \u201c7\u201d painted near its entrance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"38aa\" name=\"38aa\">The metal doors banged open, and a large group of men walked out, laughing about something. Arsyen had never seen such diversity\u200a\u2014\u200aso many white, Chinese, and Indian male janitors all working in the same company.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e1f9\" name=\"e1f9\">Behind them was another man, also white, walking slowly across the lawn, chomping on an enormous carrot. It was the same guy Arsyen had met at his interview. He had already forgotten his name, but the man\u2019s shirt reminded him: R-O-N-I, spelled out in big block letters sewn clumsily across the chest. This was him, the king of the cleaning crew.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"72e8\" name=\"72e8\">Roni greeted Arsyen with a wave. Arsyen turned to say something to Jennie, but she had already disappeared.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b92\" name=\"6b92\">Roni signaled to Arsyen to follow, pointing out different landmarks as they made their way around campus: \u201cHere\u2019s where you can pick up four different kinds of cupcakes each day at three p.m.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s the secret underground passageway that leads to the volleyball court.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s where you can get a full-body massage\u200a\u2014\u200aand if you book the tropical forest room, tell them no rainmaker!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d260\" name=\"d260\">Arsyen was amazed by the amenities, but he was even more excited about his paycheck. With the extraordinary salary they were paying him\u200a\u2014\u200aten times more than the job listing had originally advertised\u200a\u2014\u200ahis reclamation of Pyrrhia drew much, much closer. This year\u2019s salary alone would purchase twenty Pyrrhian mercenary troops and several thousand horses, as well as one million sacks of flour to be distributed to the poor (eight hundred thousand if he had his portrait printed on the sacks, which could be an important revolution/coup marketing strategy).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"23f2\" name=\"23f2\">If he kept on this path, he could reclaim the throne in just a few years. He could probably even fly Natia, his Pyrrhian internet girlfriend, out to the United States so he could finally have sex with her. Though maybe it would be better to dump Natia, date Jennie, and spend the extra money on some new video games. Being a ruler meant setting clear priorities.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"13a6\" name=\"13a6\">They walked down a nondescript hall that dumped them into a maze of cubicles. Each contained a handful of desks, and occasionally a table. The white walls were only shoulder height, and Arsyen could easily see who was inside. The view was the same no matter where he turned: square after square of men staring at their computer screens. The layout reminded him of ice cube trays.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f337\" name=\"f337\">Roni stopped next to a poster that read \u201cEntering a No Galt Zone!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a7bc\" name=\"a7bc\">\u201cVoil\u00e0!,\u201d exclaimed Roni, his arm gesturing at the cubicle before him like a game show host. Its simple layout mirrored that of every other cubicle they had passed. There were three desks\u200a\u2014\u200aonly two of which were occupied\u200a\u2014\u200aand a whiteboard covered in code hieroglyphs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a83\" name=\"5a83\">There were two men in the cubicle, but neither turned, continuing instead to focus intently on their screens. Arsyen wondered why his fellow sanitation engineers were working on computers, and why there were no cleaning materials anywhere in sight. Perhaps cleaning happened differently at Anahata. Thoughts of unknown methods immediately filled his head, his exhilaration only slightly tempered by the sight of Red Bull cans stacked in a pyramid atop a side table. Roni grabbed an unopened can and tossed it to Arsyen. \u201cLife blood,\u201d he joked, grabbing one for himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4bb9\" name=\"4bb9\">Roni tapped one of the cubicle dwellers on the shoulder.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5a75\" name=\"5a75\">\u201cJonas, meet Arsyen,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4413\" name=\"4413\">The seated figure turned slowly, and Arsyen realized that the gangly, pimply boy before him couldn\u2019t be more than sixteen. His skin was a shifting kaleidoscope of sallow and dark blotches. Enormous glasses covered his face from the eyebrows to the tip of the nose. Through the frames, his eyes studied Arsyen, and then moved to Roni, and then suddenly seemed to register the purpose of the introduction. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, in a thick but familiar accent. \u201cIt is nice to make your acquaintance. Arsyen\u200a\u2014\u200a<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">bish mena kakaya</em>?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e4e2\" name=\"e4e2\">Arsyen hesitated. The words, the accent, the singsong of the phrase all sounded so familiar, and yet he had no idea what the teenager had just said to him. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1e2e\" name=\"1e2e\">\u201cOh, my most sincere apologies,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI thought from your name\u2026you see, Arsyen is a name we have in my country, Embria. And your face could pass for Embrian.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f69\" name=\"5f69\">Arsyen\u2019s left eye twitched. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Embria!</em> The country that had started the Fifth Great War, the country responsible for having raped and pillaged his native land for thousands of years. The rivalry between the two countries was legendary. The greatest insult in the Pyrrhian language was to call someone a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">klok-klok</em>\u200a\u2014\u200aa chicken from Embria.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08f9\" name=\"08f9\">Arsyen offered his hand. \u201cI am from Pyrrhia,\u201d he said, proudly trilling the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">r</em>and making the sign of the red-breasted woodpecker.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"85b6\" name=\"85b6\">But Jonas\u2019 expression didn\u2019t change, as if it was simply an input of information, meaning no more to him than if Arsyen had said he was from Los Angeles. He turned back to his computer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4171\" name=\"4171\">Roni pointed to the desk across the room, where a very blond head sat atop a very long body.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"630e\" name=\"630e\">\u201cThat\u2019s Sven. He\u2019s from Sweden and is ex-Microsoft, but he\u2019s a bit embarrassed about that, so don\u2019t bring it up with him. He lives with his mom, which is another topic to avoid. But he\u2019s got a thousand startup ideas\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s always a safe subject.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5012\" name=\"5012\">Roni pulled the headphones off the blond mop of hair, and Sven swiveled his chair. He grinned and shook Arsyen\u2019s hand. Then he readjusted his headphones and banged his knees against the desk as he turned back to face his screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e7b9\" name=\"e7b9\">Roni pointed at an empty desk between Jonas and Sven. \u201cHere\u2019s your space.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c26\" name=\"1c26\">Arsyen\u2019s eyes ran across the desk. There was nothing on it but an enormous computer. He opened a drawer. No sponges, no commercial cleaning agents, no chemicals for him to mix.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fed4\" name=\"fed4\">\u201cRoni, where my supplies?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"87ef\" name=\"87ef\">\u201cOh, there\u2019s a tech center down the hall where you can get everything\u200a\u2014\u200aa mouse, big monitor, pens\u200a\u2014\u200aif you are one of those people who still writes things by hand, that is. Anyway, take your time getting set up. I\u2019ve got an important meeting to attend, but when I come back I\u2019ll get you briefed on everything.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0a15\" name=\"0a15\">Arsyen took a seat at his desk and studied the area around him. The floor throughout the cubicle was covered in potato chip particles\u200a\u2014\u200apresumably from the open bag on Sven\u2019s desk. A piece of dried putty had begun a slow, snail-like trudge down the wall above Jonas\u2019 desk. Across the room, a series of dark symbols glared at Arsyen from the whiteboard.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4079\" name=\"4079\">This was the messiest janitor\u2019s office he had ever seen.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"96f3\" name=\"96f3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"7936\" name=\"7936\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he first order of business was to get his cleaning supplies. Roni\u2019s instructions had seemed simple enough\u200a\u2014\u200astraight down the hall, a right at the first opportunity, then the second left. But no sooner had he made the first turn then Arsyen found himself lost in a labyrinth of cubicles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d61\" name=\"9d61\">He approached a map posted on the wall, tracing his finger along the rows in search of something resembling a supply closet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d861\" name=\"d861\">Arsyen felt a tap on his shoulder.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ace3\" name=\"ace3\">\u201cAre you lost? New here, maybe?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93b1\" name=\"93b1\">Arsyen turned to face a freckled, red-headed kid, not much older than Jonas.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"67f4\" name=\"67f4\">Arsyen\u2019s hidden red badge poked into his thigh, reminding him to be careful.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"48e5\" name=\"48e5\">\u201cAre you an engineer?\u201d the kid asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e921\" name=\"e921\">Arsyen nodded. The kid looked skinny and weak. Arsyen was sure he could outrun him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1e1e\" name=\"1e1e\">The kid\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7224\" name=\"7224\">\u201cOkay, then. I want to know all the words in English that have X as the second letter and N as the second to last.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0a97\" name=\"0a97\">Arsyen spotted an exit sign at the far end of the hall. He decided to make a run for it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ecfe\" name=\"ecfe\">\u201cHey! Hey!\u201d screamed the kid, yelling after him. \u201cTell me how you would make an object model of a pig!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"37d1\" name=\"37d1\">Arsyen dashed down the hall, the sound of the kid\u2019s plastic Crocs squeaking closely behind him. He pushed open the door, ran to his right, past the volleyball court, over a bridge made of Legos, dodged through a group of employees fighting with light sabers, and ducked into a nearby building.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6e60\" name=\"6e60\">Arsyen glanced behind him. The kid was nowhere in sight. He caught his breath and surveyed his surroundings.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"db16\" name=\"db16\">He hadn\u2019t been in this building before. It seemed largely empty\u200a\u2014\u200anothing more than a series of plain white corridors. There wasn\u2019t even anyone walking about.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a47\" name=\"7a47\">He spotted another building map and traced his finger down the corridors. At the end of the northwest hall was an exit door that appeared to lead in the direction of Building 7\u200a\u2014\u200aArsyen\u2019s building.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3489\" name=\"3489\">He headed in that direction, keeping an eye out for predatory engineers. But there wasn\u2019t a soul in sight.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"85dd\" name=\"85dd\">Just before reaching the exit, Arsyen stopped, and his face lit up in a smile. To his right was a white door labeled in simple black lettering: SUPPLY CLOSET</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0314\" name=\"0314\">Finally!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c9b0\" name=\"c9b0\">Arsyen paused before the door. This was a big moment. The tools he chose here would determine the success of his first week at Anahata. A lobby broom was a good choice for one-handed cleaning and getting at some of the trickier corners of Arsyen\u2019s cubicle. But a midsize broom would be better for general sweeping.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"56d9\" name=\"56d9\">He knew his co-workers would judge him closely for his choices, so he took a deep breath and placed his hand on the knob.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"9d1d\" name=\"9d1d\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"20f1\" name=\"20f1\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> the other side of the door, Gregor Guntlag\u2019s gaze alternated between the doorknob, which he thought he had seen rattle, and the clock, whose minute hand was broken. It wobbled between one tick and the next, as though no longer sure of the direction in which time moved.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"19e7\" name=\"19e7\">The existence of a clock on a wall of the world\u2019s most important technology company was itself a quaint reminder of a different era, a period in which time was measured differently, the various positions of its hands signifying official, institutionalized periods of work and rest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b7ab\" name=\"b7ab\">That clock\u200a\u2014\u200athe only one on campus\u200a\u2014\u200awas a crucial addition to the Anahata board room, aka the supply closet. The company\u2019s CEO, Bobby Bonilo, had forbidden the use of any electronic devices in the room, and the clock was the only way his management team could measure the progress of their interminable meetings. According to its current movements, one minute (soon to be minus one minute) had passed since Bobby had begun his latest yoga pose. Gregor Guntlag, Anahata\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, had many projects in the works to speed up time, but to date, even he couldn\u2019t manage to accelerate Bobby\u2019s sun salutations.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"979f\" name=\"979f\">\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa,\u201d came a deep, raspy sound from the back of Bobby\u2019s throat. He was on all fours at the head of the table, his butt thrust toward the ceiling, the top of his white shirt falling to expose a pale back covered with moles. Bobby rested his knees on the table and sat back on his legs, a small gut spilling over his waistband like freshly baked bread. His eyes remained closed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6332\" name=\"6332\">\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d The sound intensified. \u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa! Haaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"120d\" name=\"120d\">The daily management meeting was itself an exercise in yogic patience and discipline, with all five members of the team doing a generally poor job of tolerating each other.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c694\" name=\"c694\">Although they were a small group, the men spread themselves out around the table, allowing spaces of two or three chairs between them. In addition to Gregor, there was Old Al, the company\u2019s only gray-haired engineer, occasionally useful for his fifty-four years of wisdom. A few seats down sat Greg Fischer, the chief financial and corporate affairs officer (CFCAO), who ran all the departments\u200a\u2014\u200alegal, finance, marketing, and PR\u200a\u2014\u200athat were seen as necessary evils in helping run a large company. Equal in irrelevance was HR Paul, the head of the human resources department, who was generally regarded as a nincompoop psychology PhD with a flatulence problem. And then there was Niels, aka The Salesman.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a515\" name=\"a515\">The master engineer and the master salesman did not like each other, but today Niels seemed to be paying Gregor no attention. Gregor grimaced as Niels bent his gel-slicked head over the small notepad that he carried around in his front pocket. He found the mere existence of Niels\u2019 notepad an insult to the advances of technology and word processing software.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f6e\" name=\"8f6e\">Gregor had disliked Anahata\u2019s new head of advertising from the instant he spotted him on campus, a plastic smile fixed on his face, fancy designer suit falling from his shoulders like a second skin. With his wingtips pointed sharply in the direction of his target, Niels had approached Gregor to suggest the engineering team fix the advertising system interface so that Anahata\u2019s advertisers could more easily place their ads online. Gregor quickly informed Niels that Anahata was about its users first and foremost, and that its users\u200a\u2014\u200aand just as important, Anahata\u2019s engineers\u200a\u2014\u200adid not care about an improved advertising system. Implicit in his explanation was the unwritten philosophical hierarchy of Anahata: Engineers at the top, then users, and then, long after that, cheerleaders, janitors, creationists, and, finally, the Anahata sales team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e90\" name=\"3e90\">But Niels was slow on the uptake. He kept pushing for the change, eventually escalating the issue to Bobby. Bobby, in turn, sent Gregor and Niels an email asking them to speak to each other and not bother him with such small problems. Six years later, the two men still had not managed to do so. They only met in Bobby\u2019s management meetings, where they sat on opposite ends of the table and took opposing stances in almost any argument.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"55f9\" name=\"55f9\">\u201cHaaaaaaaaaa\u2026Haaaaaaaaaa\u2026Haaaaaaa\u2026Ha! Ha! Ha!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d862\" name=\"d862\">Suddenly, Bobby was on his feet, arms outstretched.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"802a\" name=\"802a\">\u201cOur minds are clear,\u201d he said, opening his eyes and bowing to his management team. Bobby sat down on top of the table, crossing his legs in the lotus position. \u201cLet us begin.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f7d7\" name=\"f7d7\">Just then, the door opened and a man entered, wearing an enormous grin.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3eaa\" name=\"3eaa\">Gregor thought he recognized this short, swarthy man, but he could not place him. The intruder also seemed confused: He scanned the room, past Gregor, past Niels, and landed on Bobby. His eyes bulged, the grin vanished, and he took a step back. His hand fiddled with the doorknob.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0be3\" name=\"0be3\">\u201cWait,\u201d said Bobby, looking him over. \u201cClearly you must be smart to have found me like this. I am elusive, you know. A bit like a panther\u200a\u2014\u200aif panthers were also progressive Buddhists.\u201d Bobby pawed the air with his claws.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d16d\" name=\"d16d\">The man nodded vigorously.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"33e2\" name=\"33e2\">Gregor\u2019s tongue roamed his mouth, searching for particles of stray food. He always brushed his teeth after lunch, but today he had lost track of time while troubleshooting a server issue with the infrastructure team. The lack of order in his mouth was mildly distressing\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like this intruder, who he wished would leave. Where had he seen him before?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b533\" name=\"b533\">\u201cI suppose you have joined us because you know of our open-door meeting policy,\u201d said Bobby, referring to a core Anahata principle that Gregor and the rest of the management team all actually hated.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c96c\" name=\"c96c\">\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Bobby asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3df3\" name=\"3df3\">\u201cArsyen Aimo,\u201d the man said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3740\" name=\"3740\">\u201cJoin us, Arsyen.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c378\" name=\"c378\">\u201cBut, Bobby, \u201d said Fischer, the CFCAO, \u201cwe have confidential things to discuss.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ec3b\" name=\"ec3b\">\u201cTrust is the cornerstone of truth. If we cannot trust our employees, our house will fall upon itself.\u201d Bobby turned to Arsyen and gestured at a seat at the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e952\" name=\"e952\">Arsyen took the chair closest to the door, gripping its arms oddly, rigidly, as if he were sitting on a throne. Suddenly Gregor recalled where he had seen him. This was the product manager candidate Roni had pointed out, the one from Galt. They had decided to hire him just to bleed Galt of some of its top talent. Over the past month, Anahata had lost several of its best engineers to the startup.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"23a4\" name=\"23a4\">Gregor gave Arsyen another look. He was still panting a bit; dark hairs peeked out from a very wet collar. He did not seem like an exceptional human being. Still\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1018\" name=\"1018\">\u201cWhat\u2019s up first?\u201d asked Bobby, turning to his assistant. She was in attendance that day as part of what Bobby called \u201cradical transparency,\u201d a philosophy that, while often cited by Bobby, seemed to be in effect only every third Thursday. His assistant leaned over and showed him a list\u200a\u2014\u200aand some generous cleavage.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3590\" name=\"3590\">\u201cOkay, everyone,\u201d said Bobby, nodding at her breasts. \u201cLet\u2019s show Arsyen what innovation looks like!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5517\" name=\"5517\">Bobby\u2019s assistant opened the door, and a product manager and his engineering team shuffled toward the table in an awkward, heaving lump. They kept their heads down, shooting furtive glances at Bobby as they prepared to present their work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4347\" name=\"4347\">The product manager coughed. \u201cWhen, um, we set out to design the new interface for Rovix, we had, uh, three goals in mind.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e556\" name=\"e556\">\u201cWhy do you need a presentation to tell me your goals?\u201d Old Al barked. \u201cKeep things simple. You don\u2019t need two hundred slides to tell me what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a0ed\" name=\"a0ed\">\u201cIt\u2019s just a few slides,\u201d the product manager mumbled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6fda\" name=\"6fda\">\u201cAl\u2019s right,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t tell us your idea in thirty seconds, it\u2019s not an idea. It\u2019s a presentation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6681\" name=\"6681\">The product manager closed his computer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6a12\" name=\"6a12\">\u201cSo, uh, there were three goals. First, to simplify the user interface. Second, to make it easier for people to share content across all of our products. And third, to ensure we had the right structure in place to eventually run ads next to the content\u200a\u2014\u200aif,\u201d his eyes darted over at Gregor, \u201cwe ever decided that was something we would want to do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"32a9\" name=\"32a9\">Gregor\u2019s radar shot to attention. Had they actually just suggested putting advertising on this product? Niels\u2019 team must have lobbied for it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9382\" name=\"9382\">\u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d said Old Al, shaking his finger at the team. \u201cBobby invented the concept of cloud computing on a high school cafeteria napkin twenty years ago. Big ideas should be simple. Napkinable.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f6e3\" name=\"f6e3\">\u201cHere,\u201d said Fischer, pulling a napkin out of his takeaway carton. \u201cUse this. Show us Rovix on a napkin.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"014c\" name=\"014c\">The product manager fumbled with his backpack and pulled out a pen. He began to draw on Fischer\u2019s napkin. Soon, the napkin had various arrows and bullet points scattered across it, in addition to a small glob of mayonnaise.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3249\" name=\"3249\">Bobby glanced at the drawing and frowned. \u201cArsyen, take a look and tell us what you would do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0ef0\" name=\"0ef0\">The napkin made its way down the table to Arsyen. His nose wrinkled as his fingers daintily pinched the clean edge.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e76a\" name=\"e76a\">\u201cSpeak up!\u201d shouted Old Al as he adjusted his hearing aid.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ad5a\" name=\"ad5a\">\u201cThrow it away,\u201d said Arsyen, pushing the napkin toward the middle of the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9e38\" name=\"9e38\">Bobby\u2019s eyes lit up, and he turned to the Rovix team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cd9f\" name=\"cd9f\">\u201cYou heard Arsyen. There\u2019s clearly something wrong with your product\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll leave you all to figure out what that is. But remember: Big ideas have simple solutions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a772\" name=\"a772\">\u201cAlso remember: Solutionize. Iterate. Solutionize. Iterate.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6ac0\" name=\"6ac0\">\u201cAnd really remember: Sometimes failure is success, and other times success is failure.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e88e\" name=\"e88e\">\u201cThank you,\u201d said the product manager, inclining slightly in a half-bow. He glanced at Old Al and then Gregor, likely hoping for additional feedback or some indication of whether the meeting had gone well. But Gregor wasn\u2019t in the mood to give feedback, and Old Al had fallen asleep.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c28\" name=\"1c28\">The assistant shut the door behind them, and Fischer belched noisily.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8c98\" name=\"8c98\">Gregor rolled his eyes. He found the whole lot of them to be idiots, minus Bobby and occasionally Old Al. But then he caught a similar disgust on Niels\u2019 face and recoiled. He would not permit himself to share an emotion with that man.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2408\" name=\"2408\">\u201cAre we done?\u201d Gregor asked. He needed to talk to Bobby, and no productive dialog could take place as long as The Salesman was around.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"da03\" name=\"da03\">Bobby\u2019s assistant consulted the agenda. \u201cWe have a proposal from Niels,\u201d she said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fbc3\" name=\"fbc3\">Niels flashed the assistant his best grin, then launched into his pitch.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"096c\" name=\"096c\">\u201cWe have a huge, untapped opportunity before us,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the chance to make over a billion dollars in the first year alone just by\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a2c9\" name=\"a2c9\">\u201cNiels, stop right there!\u201d Bobby yelped. \u201cDon\u2019t you see who is in the room? Arsyen!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a7b2\" name=\"a7b2\">Everyone turned in his direction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"64a3\" name=\"64a3\">The weight of the group\u2019s gaze seemed to sink Arsyen even lower in his chair\u200a\u2014\u200aan observation that did not displease Gregor. This Arsyen seemed to be a rather unremarkable individual. What had Galt seen in him? Had Gregor and Roni made a mistake in hiring him?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ca85\" name=\"ca85\">\u201cIt is inevitable that the rest of us must discuss it, but I don\u2019t know if our engineer should hear this kind of talk. You <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">are</em> an engineer, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"533f\" name=\"533f\">Arsyen nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5368\" name=\"5368\">Gregor shook his head but didn\u2019t say anything. Product managers were such frauds, always trying to pretend they were real engineers instead of MBAs with a few coding classes under their belts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"10f3\" name=\"10f3\">\u201cYou see, Arsyen,\u201d continued Bobby, \u201cwe\u2019re going to talk about money. Or more specifically, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">advertising</em>.\u201d Bobby spit out the last word like a piece of rotten food.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b7fa\" name=\"b7fa\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">That\u2019ll show him</em>, thought Gregor, shooting a smug glance at Niels.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"60f2\" name=\"60f2\">But Niels only smiled in response. His confidence enraged Gregor\u200a\u2014\u200aand fed his self-doubt. What if Bobby didn\u2019t really hate advertising <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">or</em> Niels? What if his disgust was just an act?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"db97\" name=\"db97\">\u201cBobby, you make an excellent point, as always,\u201d Niels said. \u201cBut I think it would be good for engineers like Arsyen to understand how the sales team funds<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>their innovations.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b51a\" name=\"b51a\">\u201cFine with me,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for our new employee to understand who really runs this company.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b9ad\" name=\"b9ad\">Gregor looked to Bobby, but the founder said nothing. He seemed to be distracted by some dirt underneath his fingernails.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd89\" name=\"dd89\">Niels introduced his proposal\u200a\u2014\u200aa project in which Anahata would run ads on Moodify bracelets. Within minutes, Gregor was on the attack. No matter what revenue projection or partnership expansion Niels raised, Gregor countered with the Anahata commandment to never hurt the user experience in the name of revenue.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d093\" name=\"d093\">Despite his reputation, Gregor was not actually opposed to advertising. He knew the company needed to make money, and, like Bobby, he himself was a very rich man thanks to Anahata\u2019s online ads. But Gregor was willing to put additional material gain aside in the name of thwarting his nemesis.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c56\" name=\"0c56\">After an extensive back-and-forth\u200a\u2014\u200aand a lengthy digression from Old Al, who had woken from his nap to explain how advertising had worked back before the internet was invented\u200a\u2014\u200athe battle finally puttered to a halt. Gregor wasn\u2019t sure he had won\u200a\u2014\u200aBobby had refused to make a decision and then closed his eyes to meditate\u200a\u2014\u200abut the frustrated look on Niels\u2019 face was satisfaction enough.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f021\" name=\"f021\">Fischer offered a temporary d\u00e9tente by raising an issue they had discussed the previous week: a newly released Galt productivity tool that reduced people\u2019s lengthy business presentations into a four-sentence sales pitch, thereby shortening business meetings and helping society advance capitalism at three times the current rate. It was nearly identical to a project Anahata was set to launch the following month. That Galt had beaten Anahata to market was no surprise: The startup had lured away two of Anahata\u2019s best productivity engineers the previous fall. In fact, it seemed that all of Anahata\u2019s work and thinking had made it into the final Galt tool.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9b9e\" name=\"9b9e\">\u201cI always said we would lose those engineers to Galt,\u201d growled Old Al, shaking a finger at HR Paul. \u201cWe knew they were getting calls from the recruiters every week, and we did nothing to stop it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"906a\" name=\"906a\">\u201cThat\u2019s not true Al, and I don\u2019t feel like you are speaking to me in a productive manner,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe gave them strong counteroffers, and even took one of their mothers on a hot-air balloon ride. But in the end, both said Galt was scrappier and less bureaucratic.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1ddd\" name=\"1ddd\">\u201cWe should sue Galt and show them they can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d Old Al retorted. \u201cThey\u2019ve already poached several of our top engineers, and now they\u2019re beating us to the market with products. We can\u2019t just sit by and let them do this. You know, back when I was at Bell Labs, we had a policy that\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"88d6\" name=\"88d6\">\u201cMy team,\u201d said Bobby, raising his palm to silence the group. Gregor glared at Niels across the room as Bobby counted aloud to five.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3a25\" name=\"3a25\">Bobby opened his eyes. \u201cWhen a duck grows big, people forget about its webbed feet. They forget that it can swim.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ec9f\" name=\"ec9f\">Gregor tried to remember whether Bobby had used this aphorism before.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f57\" name=\"2f57\">Bobby waited another minute for someone to respond, but Gregor didn\u2019t seem to be the only one who was lost. No one said anything. Finally, Bobby sighed loudly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d840\" name=\"d840\">\u201cThe fundamental issue here is Galt,\u201d he said. \u201cOur engineers are leaving us for Galt because they think it\u2019s faster and more innovative. Just look at Arsyen.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d5e\" name=\"4d5e\">All heads swiveled toward Arsyen, and the little man sunk lower in his chair.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c599\" name=\"c599\">\u201cArsyen, look up again for us. Good. Do you all see that\u200a\u2014\u200athe fear in his eyes? Watching us, watching the Rovix team just now, he has clearly been asking himself why he is working at Anahata. Isn\u2019t that right, Arsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aeeb\" name=\"aeeb\">Arsyen nodded vigorously.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1fe7\" name=\"1fe7\">Gregor still wasn\u2019t convinced the guy was that remarkable, but at least Arsyen was smart enough to know to agree with Bobby. Bobby was always right in the long run.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dcb3\" name=\"dcb3\">\u201cWe could add more of those organic juicers to each building?\u201d offered HR Paul. \u201cOr a pet hedgehog? Once you bond with them, you\u2019ll find it much harder to leave the company.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6785\" name=\"6785\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t about giving them more amenities,\u201d groaned Niels, rolling his eyes. \u201cOur engineers are spoiled enough as it is. You\u2019ll notice that none of the sales team has defected to Galt\u200a\u2014\u200adespite their recruiters trying to ambush my guys in the parking lots. It\u2019s because we run a tight ship in sales. We\u2019re not out there handing out free jet packs every day like engineering does. The only freebie I hand out is my book of master negotiator tips.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a015\" name=\"a015\">Niels waved a shiny copy of the red manual he issued to all sales employees.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f6b0\" name=\"f6b0\">\u201cThe reason you haven\u2019t lost many people to Galt is that sales will be the last to go,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cThe innovative minds go first. If ten percent of our sales workforce had gone to Galt\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of our engineering staff\u200a\u2014\u200awe wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation right now.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ccc8\" name=\"ccc8\">Niels looked to HR Paul for support, but his colleague nodded in agreement with Gregor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"773f\" name=\"773f\">Niels turned to Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f473\" name=\"f473\">\u201cWe need to create more of a war mentality here. Wars are very productive for unity. Every Anahata employee should want nothing more than to kill Galt and rip their little startup hearts out. People need enemies. Enemies drive us forward.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ce95\" name=\"ce95\">Niels scanned the room, stopping on Gregor. His eyes narrowed to lizard slits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8722\" name=\"8722\">\u201cWrong,\u201d said Gregor, not breaking Niels\u2019 gaze. \u201cBobby\u2019s point is that if we want to remain the world\u2019s most innovative company, we have to keep our engineers. And to do that, we have to be fast. We have to let the engineers work on exciting projects, and in an environment where they and their projects are isolated from the temptations of Galt.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9245\" name=\"9245\">\u201cVery realistic,\u201d Niels said. \u201cLet\u2019s just put them on an island then. Get them some fruity cocktails.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7068\" name=\"7068\">Fischer and HR Paul chuckled at the far end of the table. Bobby picked at the flap of his sandal.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2533\" name=\"2533\">\u201cAn island is obviously inappropriate. For one, fresh water would be an issue,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cBut rest assured we have a plan.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6f7b\" name=\"6f7b\">Gregor shifted in his chair to face Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3951\" name=\"3951\">\u201cSoon there will be no reason for you or any other engineer to ever want to leave Anahata.\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"459a\" name=\"459a\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"5b7c\" name=\"5b7c\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*tesbx-nIfQBW_kXy3q545w.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*tesbx-nIfQBW_kXy3q545w.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*tesbx-nIfQBW_kXy3q545w.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tesbx-nIfQBW_kXy3q545w.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tesbx-nIfQBW_kXy3q545w.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"f8d8\" name=\"f8d8\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">L</span>egend had it that Bobby reserved his most important discussions for the bathroom because he was convinced that Galt had bugged all the Anahata meeting rooms.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"51cc\" name=\"51cc\">While an outsider might have thought it odd, Roni knew it was simply more evidence of the founder\u2019s cunning. He was sure Bobby chose the bathroom\u200a\u2014\u200awith its occasional disagreeable smells and sounds and the eventual, inevitable intrusion by an outsider\u200a\u2014\u200ato keep the length of any meeting to a minimum. This allowed him more time in his day to think of greater things. It was the mark of an exceptional leader.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e8dd\" name=\"e8dd\">Roni often recalled his first and only bathroom meeting with Bobby. Eight other employees had been present, each jockeying for position. They all wanted to stand next to him, near the hand dryer, but Roni beat them to it. Although the meeting lasted just four minutes and Bobby uttered only one sentence, they were a very long four minutes, and it was one very important sentence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b28\" name=\"6b28\">Ever since that day, Roni favored that same Building 3, southwest corner bathroom. Its gentle pale-blue walls and piped-in ocean sounds were the perfect setting for his daily hour-long meditation sessions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d33\" name=\"4d33\">With the stall door closed and his patchouli candle lit, Roni would lean back on the heated Japanese toilet seat, press the soles of his Crocs against the wall, close his eyes, and insert his finger into his nose. The dry Northern California air lent itself to large, easily removable finds, particularly during the days when the region was hit by the Diablo winds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"df6c\" name=\"df6c\">But today no amount of nostril exploration could ease the mild anxiety building within him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a9a\" name=\"4a9a\">When Roni first started at Anahata, he was one of its superstars, leading a project to do real-time monitoring of all of the world\u2019s nuclear hazards. People on campus called him \u201cRadioactive Roni,\u201d and someone even organized a Chernobyl-themed party in his honor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b50\" name=\"6b50\">He was now into his seventh year at Anahata. Roni was making a ton of money; all his needs were met. But he no longer felt a part of the in-crowd, privy to the hottest projects or latest internal gossip. He increasingly felt like the heart of the company was beating elsewhere. It was only a vague sense, but one akin to that of the young dragon slayer approaching the bridge, one careful step after another, the fog slowly clearing before him to reveal\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d09\" name=\"2d09\">Was it because he had recently become a Republican?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9a86\" name=\"9a86\">In any case, Roni was sure something was afoot. Gregor had recently installed biometric screening at the entrance to Building 1, and conversations between Building 1 employees abruptly stopped whenever Roni joined them at the company cafeteria.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6588\" name=\"6588\">The funny thing was that if you asked most Anahatis, Roni had a dream job. He was the technical lead of Social Car, one of the hottest, most anticipated projects at the company. But Roni had been at Anahata long enough to know a quirky project from a crucial one. And Social Car just felt a bit too much like the former. Roni wondered if it was just a distraction\u200a\u2014\u200aa deft sleight of hand by Bobby to divert attention from the true gamble of something much, much bigger taking form in Building 1.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d73\" name=\"8d73\">He had made a few passes to uncover the truth. One of Roni\u2019s friends worked in Building 1. He had proved impenetrable to inquiry, claiming he was just \u201ctinkering with the ads algorithm.\u201d Gregor had likewise stonewalled him, mentioning something about Building 1\u2019s commitment to \u201cbreakthrough enterprise software products.\u201d Roni was enough of a Valley veteran to know that when an engineer feigned enthusiasm for business software, he was either lying about the software or lying about being an engineer. And that couldn\u2019t have been more true than with Gregor Guntlag, who was well known for his dislike of business, sales, and anything connected to advancing the dirty affairs of capitalism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e867\" name=\"e867\">So Roni had thrown himself into other projects alongside his work on Social Car. Most notably, he had become the organizer of the company\u2019s quarterly hackathons, designed to bring engineers together from across the company to detect bugs and fix core software. But while he enjoyed mentoring the younger engineers, Roni was beginning to feel like an aging school dance chaperon who furnished the pizza and Red Bull and hung out awkwardly at the back of the hall. What he was doing didn\u2019t feel tangible or significant.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"31d1\" name=\"31d1\">Roni sighed and pumped his Crocs against the door in a pitter patter of plastic. He sighed again, and then again and again, beginning to enjoy the sound of his breath echoing through the bathroom. He imagined an audience beyond the stall door, sitting on the blue tiles, crowding in to listen to his wise words about an important engineering topic.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"465b\" name=\"465b\">\u201cLet me tell you the truth about cloud computing,\u201d Roni said aloud in mock tenor. \u201cThere is no cloud. It is a myth. Your data is actually in my nose. Right above the\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1a10\" name=\"1a10\">Roni stopped as he heard two voices outside the bathroom. The door opened, and Roni heard a shuffling of feet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8e50\" name=\"8e50\">\u201cHello? Is anyone here?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was vaguely familiar.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e0f7\" name=\"e0f7\">\u201cAll clear,\u201d said another voice, the accent thick, like a knife trying to find its way out of taffy. Roni recognized its owner immediately: Gregor Guntlag.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b71b\" name=\"b71b\">\u201cSo, like I was saying in the meeting,\u201d the first man said. \u201cLife extension. We aren\u2019t working on it, and I am certain Galt is doing it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ecd7\" name=\"ecd7\">\u201cWhich is why Project Y is so important,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about an issue we\u2019re having with\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ca2e\" name=\"ca2e\">\u201cImagine,\u201d the first man said. \u201cIf Galt outlives us, just imagine what that means for the planet.

I have a new idea. Project Y needs an army. We will never beat Galt if we don\u2019t have an army supporting Y. Our employees must be an army. And then that army brings in more soldiers for an even bigger army.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7930\" name=\"7930\">\u201cAn army?\u201d Gregor asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"34f4\" name=\"34f4\">\u201cA figurative army. No, wait, an army with weapons. No, the kind of army Gandhi would have had.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"66ae\" name=\"66ae\">\u201cBobby, I\u2019m not sure I understand.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"56ad\" name=\"56ad\">Roni\u2019s eyes popped.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed48\" name=\"ed48\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">It was Bobby\u200a\u2014\u200aof course! </em>Bobby was the only one in the company who could give Gregor orders; the only one who quoted Ghandhi and whose license plate read \u201cMAHATMA.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6659\" name=\"6659\">Roni heard footsteps cross the bathroom, like someone was pacing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3cbc\" name=\"3cbc\">\u201cYes, yes, our peaceful army <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">will</em> be armed,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cBut its arms will be technology, and therefore not arms, but also arms.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"971d\" name=\"971d\">\u201cI don\u2019t follow,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"994c\" name=\"994c\">Bobby sighed loudly, as if it was his eternal burden to explain himself. \u201cWhen we are ready to push the button on Project Y, we will need a group of engineers who will already be converts and will spread the word. And then, of course, we also need engineers like Jonas who will infiltrate the enemy\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2529\" name=\"2529\">Roni\u2019s Crocs nearly dropped from their perch at the sound of his employee\u2019s name.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f8c8\" name=\"f8c8\">Gregor replied, but one of them was now using the urinal and Roni couldn\u2019t make out the words. He leaned forward in his seat, careful to keep his feet suspended against the door. There were more unintelligible words. A urinal was flushed. Something knocked against something else. An object fell to the ground. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The drama! What next?</em> He heard the faucets running, footsteps exiting, and the door closing. Roni was alone again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5044\" name=\"5044\">Roni\u2019s mind raced across and above and behind itself, the idea of a mysterious Project Y bolting about in his head, ricocheting off his skull, toward his ear, past Jonas\u2019 name. But no matter how he fit the bits together, he couldn\u2019t make sense of it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4921\" name=\"4921\">He started over. There was something called Project Y\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe that was the secret thing happening in Building 1. Project Y needed to build an army. And they needed people like Jonas to infiltrate \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Why didn\u2019t they want Roni? Roni had a black belt in karate. It was from when he was twelve, but still.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0193\" name=\"0193\">They couldn\u2019t know that he was on to them. Roni stood on the toilet seat and used his Swiss army knife to quickly loosen the bolts on the ventilator above his stall. Stepping onto the toilet tank, he lifted himself into the air shaft and onto his belly. He began to shimmy his way forward in the darkness. Roni had done this once before\u200a\u2014\u200amany years earlier, when he misinterpreted his manager\u2019s instructions to build a product in \u201cstealth mode.\u201d He knew this shaft would eventually take him to the building\u2019s northern corner, where he could safely drop down through another bathroom.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"79a8\" name=\"79a8\">The metal shaft felt cool against his stomach, and Roni moved through it with greater ease than he had remembered. All the apocalypse survival training he had been doing during the weekends was paying off.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9781\" name=\"9781\">But Roni was on edge. He could feel his fingers tingling, hear his heart pumping in the stifling air around him. Project Y was so close! And yet he had nothing but a trail of vague clues. He was following a thread through the dark labyrinth, the derisive laugh of his elusive dragon echoing through the air shafts.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"7875\" name=\"7875\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"a402\" name=\"a402\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"6e0e\" name=\"6e0e\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>rsyen burst into the cubicle, eager to tell Sven and Jonas all about his encounter with the famous Bobby Bonilo. But his co-workers faced their screens in silence. The only acknowledgment of his presence was an open can atop the Red Bull pyramid, which rattled left and right, then plummeted toward the carpet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6ca1\" name=\"6ca1\">\u201cHello, hello!\u201d boomed a voice from the corridor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"02a3\" name=\"02a3\">Roni entered the cubicle and made a beeline for the whiteboard. He grabbed an eraser and began wiping away the graffiti. Arsyen breathed a sigh of relief; finally, they were going to clean.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c31f\" name=\"c31f\">Instead, Roni motioned for Arsyen to approach.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fbe2\" name=\"fbe2\">\u201cI want to tell you about our super-duper top-secret project.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"94bc\" name=\"94bc\">A few years earlier, Anahata unveiled a driverless car that drove itself while the passenger sat, hands free, in the front or back seat. The project gained tons of attention in the press, and even Arsyen had heard of it. But he didn\u2019t understand the excitement. His father had invented an equally effective driverless car decades ago in Pyrrhia\u200a\u2014\u200aroyal chariots, entirely voice activated, that traveled on the backs of a pack of corgis imported from England.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4acc\" name=\"4acc\">Roni said their team had been assigned the next stage of the driverless car project. It was called \u201cSocial Car,\u201d internal code name: \u201cPad Thai.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ccba\" name=\"ccba\">While the passenger relaxed in the car, enjoying a stress-free commute, a console would announce who was sitting in the nearby vehicles. Profile photos of the other passengers would pop up, along with additional information like profession and gender. Passengers could also easily chat and message each other directly through the console.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"92c7\" name=\"92c7\">In short, Anahata was making the car journey a social experience.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ef6a\" name=\"ef6a\">\u201cOr as Bobby has put it,\u201d Roni said, \u201cwe\u2019re improving humankind by eliminating loneliness.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7ca0\" name=\"7ca0\">Arsyen wanted to ask why someone wouldn\u2019t prefer to just wait to talk to other people at their destination, but he decided that was one of those stupid questions Jennie had warned him not to ask. After all, why would the team build something that wasn\u2019t needed?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c01d\" name=\"c01d\">What worried him more was just how a sanitation engineer fit into the project. From the way Roni described it, Arsyen didn\u2019t see any janitorial work needed for Social Car\u200a\u2014\u200aunless, that is, he was supposed to clean the cars before they launched.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2581\" name=\"2581\">\u201cRoni, what do I clean here?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"97f6\" name=\"97f6\">\u201cWell, the real dirty work is for them,\u201d said Roni, nodding in the direction of Sven and Jonas. \u201cAs you know, being a P.M. is more about leading than doing. Your role is mainly to keep things organized, keep everyone focused, and lead the final polishing of the product. You know, the same stuff you did at Galt. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take the lead for now, until you have the hang of things.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b3d\" name=\"5b3d\">Sven and Jonas scooted their chairs toward the whiteboard. Arsyen noted the computers on their laps and followed their lead, but the machine balancing on his thighs felt less like a work accessory than the physical weight of his doubt. Roni had said he would be polishing Social Car, but Arsyen had yet to spot a single microfiber cloth or tub of wax. And what was this P.M. title Roni kept referring to\u200a\u2014\u200apoop manager? Arsyen would draw the line at poop; there were some things a prince should never, ever do.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3f2b\" name=\"3f2b\">Roni cleared his throat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"620a\" name=\"620a\">\u201cOkay, guys, to recap: Car A detects someone in Car B. But Car B is traveling at a faster rate than Car A. Do we have Car A automatically speed up\u200a\u2014\u200aall within say ten miles per hour of the speed limit\u200a\u2014\u200aso it can keep pace and the Car A and B passengers can speak to each other? We\u2019re more likely to have people interacting if their cars can keep pace.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5fc0\" name=\"5fc0\">Arsyen frowned. Why<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>were his co-workers talking about car speeds?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d3fc\" name=\"d3fc\">\u201cBut what if Car B is speeding? And Car A speeds up but then ends up with a speeding ticket?\u201d asked Sven. \u201cThat would be bad, unless\u2026\u201d His eyes drifted away from the whiteboard, then snapped back. \u201cUnless, that is, the person in Car B is a woman and she turns out to be really hot. Then, if I\u2019m in Car A, I wouldn\u2019t be so angry about the speeding ticket.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0006\" name=\"0006\">\u201cAll you care about are girls,\u201d Jonas groaned.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7df3\" name=\"7df3\">\u201cYou laugh, but just you wait till puberty hits. Then that\u2019ll be all you\u2019ll think about.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0cdb\" name=\"0cdb\">\u201cImpossible.

That way, you shouldn\u2019t get a ticket.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4b58\" name=\"4b58\">\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that</em>,\u201d said Sven, shaking his head. \u201cWhat I mean is the real problem is how to decide whether the Car B passenger is actually attractive enough for Car A to risk the speeding ticket.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"23f8\" name=\"23f8\">\u201cAh, got it, got it,\u201d said Roni, turning to the whiteboard and writing \u201cAttraction Index.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6278\" name=\"6278\">\u201cWe\u2019ll need to work that into the algorithm, but that shouldn\u2019t be hard. We take your profile information, and from your height, weight, and so on, we assign you a wellness score. And then we combine that score with an attractiveness score that will use your photo, measured against the Symmetry Enhancement project.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d436\" name=\"d436\">Roni turned to face the group, and Arsyen noticed an inkspot the size of a baby\u2019s fist quickly spreading across his shirt pocket. Roni\u2019s white shirt was going to be ruined. Arsyen signaled with his hand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b4a9\" name=\"b4a9\">\u201cOh, sorry, Arsyen, I should have explained. Symmetry Enhancement is a project we have to make all images on the web look better. That way, the world just looks nicer to people. We mainly use it for low-resolution images\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"739b\" name=\"739b\">\u201cAnd porn,\u201d said Sven, turning to Arsyen. \u201cDid you know that most women\u2019s breasts aren\u2019t symmetrical? Our tool fixes that.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c92\" name=\"1c92\">Roni\u2019s face flushed, but he pressed on. \u201cBut the cool thing is you can also use Symmetry Enhancement on people\u2019s faces. We can calculate how symmetrical your face is, then make adjustments to give it better symmetry. For Social Car, we wouldn\u2019t redo your entire face, but we could just do the first part of calculating symmetry, since it\u2019s a proxy for attractiveness. That would feed into the algorithm and determine whether the person in the other car is worth the risk associated with speeding. So, if the person is significantly uglier than you, then your car slows down and tries to match up with a new car. But if the person is on par or better looking, then it\u2019s all systems go.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1bc3\" name=\"1bc3\">\u201cWe could eventually monetize the symmetry feature,\u201d said Jonas, without looking up from his computer. \u201cFor example, we could make you more attractive to other passengers if you paid to have your image adjusted.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"89d1\" name=\"89d1\">Roni stiffened. \u201cJonas, let\u2019s not talk about money. Our goal is to build a great product for our users.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0d28\" name=\"0d28\">Arsyen was catching bits and pieces of his colleagues\u2019 words, but nothing made much sense. Meanwhile, Roni\u2019s stain was pushing into new territory, now working its way toward his armpit. But he seemed totally unaware, or if he was aware, he simply didn\u2019t care, his hands jumping about as he got increasingly excited about the conversation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a0c5\" name=\"a0c5\">\u201cWe combine all these factors\u200a\u2014\u200ayour attractiveness, your healthiness, and so forth\u200a\u2014\u200aand we create a matching algorithm that puts your car in touch with the people you want to meet\u200a\u2014\u200athe people you don\u2019t mind getting a speeding ticket for.\u201d Roni paused. \u201cI guess that means ugly and unhealthy people won\u2019t get to talk to anyone, but maybe that\u2019s a good thing for society in the long run?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"77ae\" name=\"77ae\">Roni turned and made a few new marks on the whiteboard, his various lines and symbols now abutting his crude car drawings like primitive weapons.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8469\" name=\"8469\">Arsyen placed his fingers on his temples and moved them in slow circles, closing his eyes and then reopening them. The black hole on Roni\u2019s shirt gaped at Arsyen like the mouth of a hungry Pyrrhian orphan. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Save me, Arsyen!</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"63d4\" name=\"63d4\">\u201cMake them all disappear,\u201d he whispered in Pyrrhian. \u201cMake them disappear.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0204\" name=\"0204\">It was a chant that had always proven effective in Pyrrhia. Servants and peasants alike vanished whenever Arsyen issued the command.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6068\" name=\"6068\">He opened his eyes. The problem was still there; dashes and numbers on the board seemed to be converging. And Roni was still talking nonsense.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7f66\" name=\"7f66\">\u201cLuckily we have our new product manager here\u2026Arsyen?

A big mistake.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"abb3\" name=\"abb3\">They had given him the wrong job.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"c9f0\" name=\"c9f0\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"cab8\" name=\"cab8\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">It</span> all suddenly made sense\u200a\u2014\u200athe coding test at his interview, the salary that was ten times what he had originally been quoted, the total lack of cleaning supplies in his cubicle.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c1f8\" name=\"c1f8\">Arsyen\u2019s gaze shifted to Roni\u2019s eager face, crossed over to the gibberish-filled whiteboard, then to the skeptical faces of his two co-workers, who had spent the entire day hypnotized by their dark screens. They were both incredibly pale, like their faces had never seen the sun. Because, of course\u200a\u2014\u200athey were engineers. And he was their product manager. The person who managed the product.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0701\" name=\"0701\">They were going to figure it out and fire him. And if he was fired, he would lose everything\u200a\u2014\u200athe chance to feed all of those hungry Pyrrhian orphans, the chance to liberate his country from tyranny, the chance to speak to his girlfriend without the aid of an internet chat application. And he would be back to cleaning toilets in some startup filled with malodorous men.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"82f0\" name=\"82f0\">There was no other solution\u200a\u2014\u200ahe would just have to fake it. Besides, how hard could it be to be a product manager? For decades, Arsyen had watched his father manage a country; he could certainly manage a bunch of talking cars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9cdd\" name=\"9cdd\">Arsyen sat up tall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"12be\" name=\"12be\">\u201cBe clear on problem,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4cd2\" name=\"4cd2\">\u201cRight, right, I should be more specific,\u201d Roni nodded. He pointed at his drawing of Car A.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"91ef\" name=\"91ef\">\u201cAt this point, my car has detected a cute woman around me. So, my car is going to speed up or slow down to keep pace so that I can talk to her.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ef58\" name=\"ef58\">\u201cWhat if woman don\u2019t want to be found?\u201d Arsyen asked. He couldn\u2019t imagine having such a problem himself, but not all men had his charm.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"20ca\" name=\"20ca\">\u201cYou\u2019re right, we should consider edge cases,\u201d Roni said. \u201cBut realistically, what\u2019s not to like about this? After all, women love attention.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"94b9\" name=\"94b9\">\u201cWe should consider edge cases,\u201d repeated Arsyen, not seeing any edge or cases but certain that in this world, as in most, repetition served as effective flattery.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c14c\" name=\"c14c\">\u201cLet\u2019s ask women what they think <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">after</em> the beta launch,\u201d Roni said. \u201cIt would take too much time to do it now, and anyway, there\u2019s an increasing body of legit scientific research that demonstrates that women don\u2019t ever know what they want. Sound good?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ef9\" name=\"9ef9\">Arsyen nodded calmly, but inside he was anything but.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f1af\" name=\"f1af\">\u201cExcuse me, bathroom!\u201d he shouted, and leaped up from his seat, dashing into the men\u2019s room across the hall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8437\" name=\"8437\">He locked himself in one of the stalls and pulled out his phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e72f\" name=\"e72f\">Arsyen looked up \u201cproduct manager\u201d on the internet and, after a few minutes of reading, felt his confidence return.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd3f\" name=\"fd3f\">There was really no reason to worry. Product managers were apparently in charge of the big picture, deciding why a product was needed, what it would be, and how the company could bring it to life. As one blog post put it:</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e28c\" name=\"e28c\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">As a product manager, you are tasked with leading a team and bringing an idea to life.

But then he reconsidered: Other than the receptionists, he had yet to meet any women at Anahata. He probably didn\u2019t need to worry about being treated like one of them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5621\" name=\"5621\">Arsyen skimmed a few more blogs, trying to memorize the P.M.\u2019s language\u200a\u2014\u200awords like \u201caction items,\u201d \u201cB2B solutions,\u201d and \u201cuse cases,\u201d and then something mystic called a \u201croadmap,\u201d which as far as Arsyen could tell had little to do with either roads or maps. There was an even greater obsession with \u201calignment,\u201d a concept Arsyen struggled with as his translation app told him that the equivalent word in Pyrrhian was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">pokaya</em>, meaning to place the chicken coop parallel to one\u2019s home.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd97\" name=\"fd97\">Suddenly there was a banging on the stall door.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"449c\" name=\"449c\">\u201cArsyen? You in there?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6e5a\" name=\"6e5a\">It was Sven.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a873\" name=\"a873\">\u201cListen, you\u2019ve been in there long enough. Only senior engineers get to work in the bathroom. Roni has some sort of roadmap question for you, so come on back.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aaf0\" name=\"aaf0\">Arsyen washed his hands and returned to the cubicle, armed with his new vocabulary.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"72f8\" name=\"72f8\">When Roni asked Arsyen about prioritization, Arsyen asked, \u201cIs this on the roadmap?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d99\" name=\"9d99\">When Sven suggested adding images of attractive women to the car dashboard, Arsyen rubbed his chin.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6c6a\" name=\"6c6a\">\u201cDoes this align with our strategy?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b10\" name=\"6b10\">When all three looked to him for an opinion in how best to implement Symmetry Enhancement, Arsyen stood and put his hands on his hips.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cf2f\" name=\"cf2f\">\u201cDoes this align with the strategy on our roadmap?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"865f\" name=\"865f\">No one seemed to notice anything was amiss.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>If anything, it seemed like product managers just asked questions that other people had to answer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2106\" name=\"2106\">\u201cGood brainstorm, everyone. Let\u2019s break for lunch,\u201d Roni said. \u201cOh, and Arsyen, this is still very confidential, so let\u2019s get this whiteboard cleaned off.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"727c\" name=\"727c\">Arsyen jumped up and began to wipe the whiteboard clean as Sven and Jonas scooted their chairs back to their desks. Arsyen was pleased that product managers seemed to have some janitorial tasks in their role. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t be such a stretch after all.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"6932\" name=\"6932\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"8a0f\" name=\"8a0f\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he food in Fried Fred\u2019s glistened with the shine of oil, and neon signs blinked to a loud techno beat, suggesting an urgent need to consume the dishes on offer.

He likes to do his own garbage collection.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"19bd\" name=\"19bd\">\u201cI do not!\u201d Arsyen snapped, and then mumbled, \u201cI mean, I <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">do</em> collect my garbage\u2026here in America.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cbcd\" name=\"cbcd\">\u201cAll right then, which did you learn first, Linux or Windows?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f97\" name=\"8f97\">Arsyen paused. Windows were clear, transparent, and easy to clean. A Linux was\u2026well, he didn\u2019t know. But in this game of one-upmanship, surely the more unfamiliar thing was the most impressive. Much like operating some types of carpet cleaners, operating a Linux was probably a skill that once mastered was then lorded over everyone else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"16f1\" name=\"16f1\">\u201cLinux,\u201d guessed Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"80ee\" name=\"80ee\">\u201cCorrect,\u201d Sven said.

Arsyen began to count the number of pimples scattered across his cheeks. He got to about twenty before Jonas opened his mouth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"082c\" name=\"082c\">\u201cWhat about your first video game?\u201d he asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"be70\" name=\"be70\">Arsyen grinned.

Video games had ceased being platformers. Techno was birthing thousands of deformed children in Europe. In some parts of the world, people were already learning to text, and their thumbs were growing ganglia. People\u2019s brains had begun to function differently! You clearly came of age in a different world\u200a\u2014\u200aone that doesn\u2019t know latency or patience.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f5ad\" name=\"f5ad\">\u201cI am disappointed by this conversation and am done speaking for now,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cPlease carry on by yourselves.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fa52\" name=\"fa52\">He stabbed his fork into his pile of noodles, then began twirling them with great concentration.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"04b5\" name=\"04b5\">Arsyen felt as though he himself were in a video game, his life meter, a flashing red heart, beeping at low levels as he desperately searched for a wizard or magic plant to replenish his strength.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f0b5\" name=\"f0b5\">He silently cursed his mother. As a child, Arsyen repeatedly asked her for a video game console, but she refused, claiming the nobility should focus on croquet, not cartoons dancing across a screen. She was lucky the king hadn\u2019t allowed Arsyen to send her to the dungeon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f169\" name=\"f169\">Arsyen breathed deeply and closed his eyes, willing his heartbeat to slow. If he could just keep his P.M. job long enough to become a permanent employee, he could eventually have his army behead Sven and Jonas.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf1c\" name=\"bf1c\">Arsyen lingered over the image of a guillotine snapping Jonas\u2019 neck until he felt his pulse steady. He opened his eyes. His co-workers were staring at him, expecting something. Arsyen needed to redirect the conversation\u200a\u2014\u200amake them do the talking rather than him. He turned toward Sven, who was clearly an easier target than Jonas.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ae04\" name=\"ae04\">\u201cRoni says you have startup project?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8582\" name=\"8582\">Sven brightened and reached for a fry on Arsyen\u2019s plate. \u201cTwo, actually. The first is called Fingerbell. It\u2019s like a dumbbell, but on your mobile phone. You try to move an animated weight up the screen by using one finger. With each level, the resistance increases and it gets harder to move the weight.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"53e1\" name=\"53e1\">\u201cBut why\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5137\" name=\"5137\">\u201cBecause there\u2019s a real obesity problem in this country these days.

Jonas, are you listening to this?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"939c\" name=\"939c\">Jonas ignored them. He now seemed preoccupied with separating his noodles into individual pods on his plate.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4a1e\" name=\"4a1e\">\u201cHere\u2019s how it works,\u201d said Sven, leaning in. \u201cAll you have to do is come up with an idea for a startup, build it, and get users. The important thing is that your users are growing\u200a\u2014\u200aeven better if you can tell everyone your growth is exponential.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4502\" name=\"4502\">\u201cIt is rare that anything is truly exponential,\u201d said Jonas, suddenly looking up. \u201cMost growth is linear, but then most people are stupid.\u201d He lowered his head again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"90f3\" name=\"90f3\">\u201cNext,\u201d said Sven, \u201ca venture capitalist sees all this growth and they start doling out cash like it\u2019s candy. You get rich before you\u2019ve even proven your product can make money. Then a big company like Anahata comes along and buys your startup. Sometimes it\u2019s just to acquire your employees\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can make millions of dollars if you just tell people you employ experts in A.I. and machine learning. Computer security, biohacking, and micro-algae are also good areas. Worse comes to worst, you just tell people you\u2019re making robots\u200a\u2014\u200athere isn\u2019t a single CEO in the Valley who doesn\u2019t get a hard-on over robots.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6108\" name=\"6108\">\u201cNow, if you\u2019re really lucky, the company isn\u2019t after your employees but your actual product. They want to buy it so they can kill it and keep you from competing with them. That\u2019s where you really get into the big money. And, yeah, it kind of sucks that all your hard work and years of no sleep and sex will be destroyed, but hey, you\u2019re rich now, and you can go and invest money in things you really care about, like food security cameras or currency for sea animals or\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5128\" name=\"5128\">\u201cBikek,\u201d said Jonas, looking up. \u201cBikek is the capital of Embria. It has a temperate climate, and in its surrounding mountains one can grow delicious apples in the winter.

He built a computer by looking at the stars and calculating from the astrological patterns how he could construct a mainframe.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5d5f\" name=\"5d5f\">\u201cSven\u2026,\u201d began Jonas, lifting his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e1e\" name=\"7e1e\">\u201cAnd then there was a documentary filmmaker from the BBC who happened to be in town filming the plight of some rare yak in Bikek. He was staying at the hotel across the street on the day Jonas hooked his computer up and started a fire that nearly burned down his apartment building. Overnight, Jonas became the most famous boy in Embria, and Anahata, which has its Progressa program\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a59d\" name=\"a59d\">\u201cProgressa?\u201d asked Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bc5d\" name=\"bc5d\">\u201cProgressa brings technology to poor people like Jonas,\u201d said Sven. \u201cThey are begging for food and water, and Progressa shows up with a computer and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2cf5\" name=\"2cf5\">\u201cThat is incorrect,\u201d Jonas said.

It\u2019s gonna make me rich.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2ce5\" name=\"2ce5\">He pulled out his mobile phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"56be\" name=\"56be\">\u201cI wanted to solve a problem that all of us have: getting rid of things we don\u2019t want to do.

The word \u201cDogtown\u201d emerged, written in light blue across a black background. Underneath, a cartoon dog with a bone in its mouth looked out lovingly from the screen, its tail wagging back and forth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6846\" name=\"6846\">\u201cWe all have problems we don\u2019t want to deal with ourselves\u200a\u2014\u200alike laundry. So what I\u2019ve done is create an app that helps you outsource <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">everything</em>. You list your problem and then send it out into the Dogtown community. Whatever dog\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s what I call our members\u200a\u2014\u200awants to do the task, he responds to \u2018fetch\u2019 it for you, and you work out the details. Then you pay him in dog food.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7f29\" name=\"7f29\">\u201cDog food?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fe91\" name=\"fe91\">\u201cWell, money. On the app, money is called \u2018dog food.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22e4\" name=\"22e4\">Arsyen liked the idea of outsourcing his battle to reclaim Pyrrhia. Someone else could just go off and do it for him, leaving Arsyen to play video games and hang out in California until Pyrrhia was ready for him. The laundry scenario, however, seemed complicated.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a6d3\" name=\"a6d3\">\u201cSo, someone come to my apartment, wash my clothes, wait while clothes dry\u2026seem easier for me to do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3e84\" name=\"3e84\">\u201cYou just need to embrace the concept of outsourcing your life,\u201d Sven said. \u201cThere may be a few people in your house, but once you accept that they are there to perform a function that ultimately benefits you, they are just there\u200a\u2014\u200alike moving furniture. I mean, I just used Dogtown a few hours ago, right Jonas?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f7ec\" name=\"f7ec\">Sven waved a fry below Jonas\u2019 nose, and the teenager looked up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1988\" name=\"1988\">\u201cThis morning, Jonas was slurping his Red Bull so loudly I could hear it through my headphones. So I sent out a call on Dogtown to ask someone to take care of it for me. A guy in San Francisco saw my request, I gave him Jonas\u2019 email address, and the guy emailed him telling him to shut up. Worked like a charm.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4bed\" name=\"4bed\">\u201cBut he sit next to you. You can just tell him or send him email,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ccdf\" name=\"ccdf\">\u201cI consider myself a pacifist. I don\u2019t like conflict.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8622\" name=\"8622\">Arsyen nodded but didn\u2019t really understand. Conflict in the janitor community was always solved through direct conversation. And sometimes mop fights. But never through an app. What kind of person would think it was better to argue over the internet rather than speak directly?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3de1\" name=\"3de1\">\u201cBy receiving an email, I was able to process the information quickly and stop slurping,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cIf Sven had stopped my work to speak with me, I would have found it quite disrupted.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4fbc\" name=\"4fbc\">\u201cDisrup<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tive</em>,\u201d Sven corrected.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"661a\" name=\"661a\">\u201cDisrup<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tive</em>,\u201d Jonas repeated. \u201cTechnology is disrup<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tive</em>, but I, Jonas, do not like to be disrup<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ted</em>.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c86f\" name=\"c86f\">\u201cVery good,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNow if we can just tell that brainiac processing center of yours to incorporate some contractions into your English, it will be flawless.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3069\" name=\"3069\">\u201cWe have discussed this previously,\u201d Jonas sighed. \u201cContractions are not elegant. Moreover, many times they are grammatically incorrect. I will not have my speech sullied by\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d Jonas\u2019 eyes caught sight of something in the distance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"db2b\" name=\"db2b\">\u201cHe is here,\u201d Jonas whispered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"06c5\" name=\"06c5\">Sven turned and gasped. \u201cWhat do you think he will eat?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"444c\" name=\"444c\">\u201cWho?\u201d Arsyen asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2e3e\" name=\"2e3e\">\u201cBobby Bonilo,\u201d they answered in unison.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f83\" name=\"1f83\">Arsyen scanned the entrance and quickly pinpointed the object of their attention, not because the figure was remarkable or distinguished in any way, but rather because the effect of the man\u2019s presence was universal. The cafeteria fell silent. Those waiting at the stands of Fried Fred\u2019s pushed themselves against the buffet rails to allow ample room for the man to pass. Mouths froze in mid-sentence. Hamburgers were forgotten on their plates.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9df1\" name=\"9df1\">It was the second time that day Arsyen found himself in the presence of Anahata\u2019s elusive founder.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5164\" name=\"5164\">Bobby stopped at the Mexican food stand and surveyed its offerings. He dipped a finger into the guacamole bowl, and the chefs held their breath, waiting for his verdict. Showing no reaction, he then continued on to the sushi bar, then the Asian fusion stand, at one point looking as though he was set to take a dumpling. Then he abruptly turned on his heel and walked three steps to the salad bar. Arsyen could hear Jonas\u2019 legs shaking under the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"627d\" name=\"627d\">Bobby circled the salad bar once clockwise, then stopped and changed direction. Finally, he picked up a bagel, nodded as though in communication with the tub of cream cheese in the buffet, and glided out of Fried Fred\u2019s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"432c\" name=\"432c\">As soon as the door closed behind him, the cafeteria exploded in sound.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bf97\" name=\"bf97\">\u201cWow, do you know who that was?\u201d Sven asked Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"15bd\" name=\"15bd\">Arsyen nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f16f\" name=\"f16f\">Frankly, he didn\u2019t get the fuss. Sure, Bobby Bonilo\u2019s story was impressive\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had started Anahata from his college dorm, convinced a rich guy to invest in his idea, and, a few years later, became a trillionaire. But Bobby\u2019s physical appearance was utterly ordinary, with a pale, slightly puffy face falling into a neck that connected to the gently disintegrating body of a man approaching middle age. He looked nothing like the pictures Arsyen had seen in magazines. There, Bobby\u2019s chiseled face seemed straight out of a cologne ad. He was always dressed in white T-shirts that showed off massive biceps, and in more than one article, a small glow circling the top of his brown, curly hair gave the impression of a celestial aura.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f842\" name=\"f842\">\u201cEveryone so quiet. Do people not talk to him?\u201d Arsyen asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bb4e\" name=\"bb4e\">\u201cWell, you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">can</em> talk to him. But he speaks in puzzles,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNot everyone is capable of understanding him. So, if you\u2019re going to talk to him, you just better make sure that what you have to say is really, really smart. Like the smartest thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3358\" name=\"3358\">\u201cBobby <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is </em>Anahata,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cHe created it, built it, runs it. He is a genius. And seeing him here is a momentous occasion. Most of the time he is in Building 1. That is the locked building. It is said, \u2018No one goes in, and no one comes out.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"04fb\" name=\"04fb\">\u201cThough of course they do,\u201d Sven jumped in. \u201cBut it\u2019s really only the senior engineers that are allowed in there. I heard Bobby decided to get rid of all the chairs and desks in Building 1. He said they stopped people from thinking. So everyone works standing up, roaming about and having their thoughts collide in the hallways. It\u2019s supposed to encourage innovation and collaboration. And phones\u200a\u2014\u200athere are desk phones\u200a\u2014\u200athough of course they are placed on the floor since there are supposedly no desks. Bobby apparently had them installed to encourage people to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">speak</em> to each other.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"81e7\" name=\"81e7\">\u201cI heard that all responses to questions in Building 1 have to start with \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d Jonas added. \u201cYou are not permitted to say no unless you have said yes first, because Bobby believes that if you start from believing things are not possible, nothing will ever be achieved.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"46f9\" name=\"46f9\">\u201cIt\u2019s one of the ten Anahata commandments,\u201d Sven said. \u201cThey\u2019re like the company\u2019s guiding principles. One of them is to always start with the word \u2018yes.\u2019 And the rest, well, there is one about speed, and another about innovation\u2026and putting our users first\u2026oh, and changing the world. We must improve humankind!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1827\" name=\"1827\">\u201cHumankind?\u201d Arsyen didn\u2019t recognize the word. Did Anahata want to make humans be kinder to each other? That sounded like something a silly communist would dream up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1303\" name=\"1303\">\u201cBobby believes that with every product, we should be able to ask ourselves what serious world problem we are solving.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d7a6\" name=\"d7a6\">Arsyen immediately thought of Moodify and the scores of Anahata products that largely just seemed to exist to waste time and have fun.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ad2e\" name=\"ad2e\">\u201cReally? <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Every</em> product must solve world problem?\u201d he asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a93a\" name=\"a93a\">Jonas shrugged. \u201cThat is for the marketing and PR team to figure out. We build the product, and then they communicate to the public how it improves humankind. So, for example, Anahata\u2019s search engine\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6c09\" name=\"6c09\">\u201cIs democratizing knowledge,\u201d Sven filled in.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b40d\" name=\"b40d\">\u201cAnd Anahata ads\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4718\" name=\"4718\">\u201cAre enabling opportunity for small businesses.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2896\" name=\"2896\">\u201cAnahata Maps\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"24f7\" name=\"24f7\">\u201cAre making it possible for poor children like Jonas, who have no access to food or clothing, to discover faraway places on the internet.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"53c4\" name=\"53c4\">The men bussed their plates. Outside, the sun was blinding. Arsyen, temporarily disoriented, veered to the left.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a361\" name=\"a361\">\u201cOh, Arsyen,\u201d said Sven in a singsong. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go there if I were you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0dd1\" name=\"0dd1\">Arsyen turned. The path to his left looked exactly the same as the path to his right.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cc11\" name=\"cc11\">\u201cGoing left is always a bad idea,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4585\" name=\"4585\">\u201cBut what if I come from\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201c</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9bfb\" name=\"9bfb\">\u201cNever ask questions the rest of us know the answer to,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cSuch inquiries are a sign of weakness unless employed as rhetorical devices, or if, in their pointed framing, they are designed to undercut one\u2019s interlocutor.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ffd1\" name=\"ffd1\">\u201cStay close to us, and remember to keep that red badge hidden,\u201d Sven said. \u201cJust for this week, of course. No one gets fired after the first week.

For the past three days, Arsyen had been talking about sponges, complaining about the brand they stocked in the micro-kitchen. \u201cAnahata should disrupt sponges,\u201d he was saying. \u201cAlign sponges with roadmap.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa77\" name=\"aa77\">It was typical product manager speak\u200a\u2014\u200abig vision statements with little understanding of the technical difficulties.

As a technical lead, it was his job to let product managers like Arsyen think he cared about their opinions. Still, Arsyen\u2019s opinions often seemed particularly random and difficult to endorse.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"63a6\" name=\"63a6\">\u201cI make manifesto,\u201d Arsyen announced to the team that morning. \u201cAs good P.M., I know manifesto key to successful product.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8368\" name=\"8368\">He began to read aloud.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8778\" name=\"8778\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Social Car is Anahata technology to eliminate loneliness. Every day we drive somewhere thinking we go somewhere. But really, we go nowhere, because part of journey is lost to us all. That is human part.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"57ba\" name=\"57ba\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">By using latest cutting-edge innovation technology, combined with old social networking, Social Car connect you to people in other cars. Thanks to Social Car, you make conversation with them and begin lifelong friendship. Because relationship is in cloud, you do not have to worry about catching sex disease or awkward moment where you realize other person is missing arm. The person is real and not real, like your journey, like life.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55e8\" name=\"55e8\">Roni\u2019s brain started to spin. This Arsyen was such a mystery. He spent half his time in the bathroom, and when he did materialize, you couldn\u2019t be sure whether you were about to hear the stupidest or most brilliant idea of all time. One moment he was suggesting they attach mops to the wheels of Social Car in order to clean the road while driving, and the next moment he was busting out an amazing product manifesto. It reminded Roni of his first day on the job at Anahata, when Bobby smoked pot with him and the other NASA recruits, dropping some crazy science on them all about unicorns and space elevators. Both sounded totally stupid until you realized Bobby was a genius.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"571a\" name=\"571a\">Perhaps Arsyen was also a genius.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8e5b\" name=\"8e5b\">If he was, that helped Roni, too: Managing a genius was always a good career move.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fc89\" name=\"fc89\">\u201cThat\u2019s pretty deep,\u201d Roni said to Arsyen. \u201cLife is like an empty journey unless you have Social Car. It really makes you realize how our technology is changing humankind for the better.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5dd5\" name=\"5dd5\">\u201cI had never thought of the one-armed-person use case before,\u201d Sven said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ea75\" name=\"ea75\">\u201cIt is statistically very unlikely that you will meet a one-armed person while driving,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"12f2\" name=\"12f2\">\u201cMaybe in the past, smartass,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNow that cars don\u2019t need drivers, you may see a whole bunch of armless and legless people out on the road.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"85fe\" name=\"85fe\">\u201cBut there should also be fewer armless people on the planet since driverless cars are safer. Car accidents cause 8.18 percent of armlessness in the United States,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1868\" name=\"1868\">\u201cBut\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cf78\" name=\"cf78\">\u201cGuys, guys, let\u2019s stay focused,\u201d Roni said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4af1\" name=\"4af1\">\u201cI also have other idea,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cI think about your problem\u200a\u2014\u200aclassic product management problem. I see problem many times in B2B solutions. I give you example from Pyrrhia social media roadmap. Sometimes when we in countryside, I have boys wash my car. But they lazy. They throw soap on car and then put water on car. But the car not shiny. It because they didn\u2019t start at beginning\u200a\u2014\u200awith water, in the cloud. I tell them, \u2018Wash car first or I feed you to dogs,\u2019 and finally they do it right. It\u2019s like\u2026software as a service for internet of things.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4838\" name=\"4838\">Roni frowned. Arsyen\u2019s brain was moving too fast for him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3c44\" name=\"3c44\">Arsyen turned to the whiteboard and drew a rough sketch of two cars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"92db\" name=\"92db\">\u201cYou all talk about what happen with Social Car when you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">on</em> the road,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cBut what about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">before</em> you get in car? Start at beginning of problem\u200a\u2014\u200anot in middle like little Pyrrhian boys. Social Car can tell me who around me now. But what if I can tell Social Car who I want to meet when I first get in car?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0649\" name=\"0649\">\u201cYou mean, program it to take you to an address or someone\u2019s house?\u201d Sven asked. \u201cWelcome to the modern world, Arsyen. Cars already have that. It\u2019s called a GPS.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2b88\" name=\"2b88\">\u201cNo, this not about taking you to friend\u2019s house. It for people and places you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">don\u2019t </em>know. So you have your app and want to meet other engineers. Well, Social Car take you to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Trek</em> convention. Or say you want to pitch businessman on your startup. Social Car take you to hotel bar or fancy-person strip club. Then, once cars close together, you can begin conversation with your target.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ed80\" name=\"ed80\">\u201cI see, I see, so it\u2019s a more targeted way to meet new people. Kinda like a business networking tool?\u201d Roni asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6f2b\" name=\"6f2b\">\u201cYes,\u201d Arsyen nodded. \u201cBusiness networking tool\u2026in the cloud. Social. B2B. Alignment.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1cae\" name=\"1cae\">\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d said Jonas, looking up from his computer. \u201cYou are not describing a business networking tool. This is what one would call a hookup app.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aee9\" name=\"aee9\">Roni studied the drawing on the whiteboard. It looked like two rectangular men in suits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"15cc\" name=\"15cc\">\u201cHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s totally about meeting hot girls!\u201d Sven jumped out of his chair and hopped to the whiteboard, grabbing a pen and adding a pair of breasts to the roof of one of Arsyen\u2019s cars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"23e4\" name=\"23e4\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ohhh</em>,\u201d said Roni, as the idea came to life before him, his businessmen transforming into busty coeds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"203a\" name=\"203a\">\u201cA user inputs into Social Car what he wants in terms of age, gender, and sexuality,\u201d Sven explained. \u201cSocial Car does the rest. All it has to do is scan the profiles from all the other Social Car\u2013enabled vehicles. And we give them pickup lines to help kick-start the conversation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ed9d\" name=\"ed9d\">\u201cGreat idea,\u201d grinned Roni, slapping Arsyen on the back.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4161\" name=\"4161\">\u201cAlso, I think about woman problem again,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cYou know, about woman who not want to be found. I think I have answer: We give her choice to turn off Social Car.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3052\" name=\"3052\">\u201cYou mean, let women <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">choose</em> whether to let people find her?\u201d Roni asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"99fd\" name=\"99fd\">Arsyen nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7399\" name=\"7399\">\u201cAre you crazy!?\u201d Sven cried.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d234\" name=\"d234\">Roni shook his head. How could this be the same employee who had authored that manifesto?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b06\" name=\"5b06\">He reached into his backpack and grabbed Arsyen\u2019s HR form (damn HR, always wanting him to use paper!). No genius would ever propose listening to users\u2019 opinions. As Roni made a little tick on the form, he saw a cloud of worry pass over Arsyen\u2019s face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"20cc\" name=\"20cc\">\u201cIf girls get to choose whether to use the feature, then we\u2019re only going to have a bunch of dudes on Social Car,\u201d Sven explained.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5263\" name=\"5263\">Roni nodded. \u201cPeople get confused by choice\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s our job to tell them what they want. Besides, you\u2019ve got three guys in here saying they love it. What other proof do you need?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e7f7\" name=\"e7f7\">But it was clear Arsyen was no longer listening. He was staring at the HR form in Roni\u2019s hand, as if worried he had done something wrong. For that alone, Roni made another tick. The fact that Arsyen could even believe he had done something wrong once again indicated his inferiority. Geniuses weren\u2019t ever wrong, even when they were.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"10fa\" name=\"10fa\">Which was also why Roni needed to be right about having hired Arsyen.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"4c02\" name=\"4c02\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"4e8f\" name=\"4e8f\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"232d\" name=\"232d\">Jonas cornered Arsyen later that morning.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"458c\" name=\"458c\">\u201cWhat do you want me to do about those pickup lines?\u201d asked Jonas, standing between Arsyen\u2019s desk and the cubicle entrance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c6f6\" name=\"c6f6\">\u201cPickup lines?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd9f\" name=\"bd9f\">Arsyen stood.

He decided to spend the rest of the day working on his croquet strokes. After all, if Jonas couldn\u2019t find him, he couldn\u2019t get mad at him.

He had spent the entire night thinking up ways to postpone the team from settling on a clear direction. If he gave the engineers something new to consider, Arsyen wouldn\u2019t have to flesh anything out until after his trial period was over. And once he was a permanent employee, he\u2019d have plenty of time to learn how to be a real product manager.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"48c2\" name=\"48c2\">\u201cI want purple and green cars,\u201d said Arsyen, invoking the Anahata colors. \u201cNow, sorry, but HR team needs paperwork from me. Back later.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfad\" name=\"dfad\">Arsyen made his way to the video game console down the hall, holding his sponge in front of him like an offering. He had discovered that Anahata\u2019s engineers let him roam wherever he wanted if he was carrying cleaning supplies, clearly uninterested in firing someone whose work they didn\u2019t wish to perform themselves.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"573b\" name=\"573b\">He returned late in the afternoon and was relieved to see Jonas transfixed by his screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22a0\" name=\"22a0\">Sven waved but didn\u2019t look up; he was studying a bunch of cartoon dogs that were lined up vertically on his phone. Each \u201cdog\u201d had the face of a real human being.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e7bb\" name=\"e7bb\">\u201cHow Dogtown going?\u201d he asked, hoping to score points with the nicer of his two co-workers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"63f6\" name=\"63f6\">Sven sighed and explained that he had run into a snag. A local journalist had posted something in praise of Dogtown, and as a result, a few thousand people between San Francisco and the South Bay had downloaded it to their phones. While that should have been reason to celebrate, it instead led to a supply-demand imbalance: There seemed to be far more people who wanted to perform disagreeable tasks than there were people who needed disagreeable tasks to be performed for them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2abc\" name=\"2abc\">\u201cThere are too many guilty liberals on Dogtown,\u201d Sven moaned. \u201cI\u2019ve essentially got everyone bidding on the same tasks.\u201d He showed Arsyen the long list of white faces volunteering to perform menial tasks for people of color. \u201cI tried to get someone to pick up a tub of ice cream for my fake Asian female profile last night, and the bidding war was so intense that I ended up getting it delivered for free. It\u2019s even more exaggerated if I use my Latino or African-American profiles. Every white person in San Francisco seems desperate to run errands for free just to prove they\u2019re really progressive. They even want me to design badges they can put on their profile pictures to prove to everyone else they\u2019re not racist.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b56e\" name=\"b56e\">\u201cBut that a good problem, right?

I just want to create a bidding system for errands. I\u2019ll pay you to go pick up my dry cleaning. I don\u2019t want to know who you are, what you do, or what you look like. Just pick up my damn dry cleaning.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"373d\" name=\"373d\">Just then, Sven\u2019s phone rang. His eyes rolled as he picked it up, mouthing \u201cmom\u201d to Arsyen. He muttered a desultory greeting in Swedish as he left the cubicle.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"59fc\" name=\"59fc\">Arsyen heard something move behind him and turned to find Jonas standing there, arms crossed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7612\" name=\"7612\">\u201cDespite your lack of guidance, I went ahead and programmed part of the hookup feature,\u201d said Jonas, pointing to his screen. He had chosen a handful of key attributes to generate the pickup lines\u200a\u2014\u200acar type, model, color, passenger gender and age. He showed Arsyen a list of computer-generated interactions between Car A and Car B.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"31e0\" name=\"31e0\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I think women in Cadillacs are interesting and compassionate.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5be8\" name=\"5be8\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I did not know women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four liked Cadillacs.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8835\" name=\"8835\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Where did you buy your 2015 blue Cadillac ATS?

None came close to his extraordinary Anahata salary. It would take him decades to save enough money to raise an army and storm the imperial palace. By then, his nemesis, General Korpeko, would be waiting for him in some fancy laser-shooting wheelchair, and Arsyen would be done for before he could even dismount from the only old, decrepit donkey he was able to afford.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3684\" name=\"3684\">A little red icon blinked at the bottom of his computer screen, desperate for his attention.

They rode the wave in one sharp-toothed tsunami, penetrating the dolphin tank with open mouths, chasing the dolphins into new parts of the park.Down came the manatee tank, the penguin\u2019s pen, and the piglet squid viewing room. The flamingo hut and the snake house withstood the pressure but flooded with water, the animals\u2019 terrestrial enclosures suddenly transformed into muddy aquariums. Noah\u2019s ark was now subject to a Darwinian reorganization in which for a few breathless seconds, snakes became exotic fish, tails dropping vertically like flutes bobbing in the water until they finally sank to the floor. Nearby, the flamingos honked in terror, their pink necks popping up above the waves like unfastened hooks, tangling in each other until they dropped below the surface.As the water from the tanks expanded to the edges of the park, the depths once housing the sea\u2019s greatest creatures were now reduced to mere puddles. Fish were left flapping against the asphalt; the beluga whale flattened seahorses and starfish as it barreled its way through the park in search of arctic water. No longer traveling forward with carnivorous glee, the sharks came to a stop near the snack bar and began rolling about on their dolphin-stuffed bellies, emitting wimpy cries that would have delighted fish lower on the totem pole were they too not gasping in their newly parched environment. Within minutes, self-pity transformed to anger, and in their final moments, the sharks turned on each other in a cannibalistic bloodbath.It all happened so quickly that by the time the rescue crews arrived, there was little left to salvage. The crew moved swiftly from one section of the park to the next, their faces increasingly grim. The manta rays spread flat like leathery carpets, the snakes roping above them in a bloated tangle. Colorful fish lay on their sides, mouths gaping, scales shifting like crystals in the slowly rising sun.Word quickly spread of the catastrophe, and television news helicopters soon circled above. Everyone was looking for Belbo, Palo Alto\u2019s beloved walrus and official mascot. The rescue crew finally discovered the aquarium\u2019s prized pinniped underneath one of the felled walls, her death exacted by a slab of heavy concrete.As the leader of the rescue crew turned to declare the end of their efforts, a loud croak bellowed from the northwest corner of the park. The crew ran toward the sound, which now repeated, like a foghorn, over and over. It was coming from the marine-themed jungle gym, one of the few structures that had survived the flood, thanks to its distance from the shark and dolphin tanks. As the crew approached, they saw a gray mass swaying atop the slide, partially blocking the sun. The rescuers shielded their eyes for a better view, and soon its form grew clearer. It was a one-eyed sea lion with a patch on its left eye.At the sight of the rescue team, the sea lion barked again and clapped its hands. It balanced a ball on its nose, then put its weight on its front flippers and lifted its tail up behind its head. Without thinking, the rescue crew laughed and clapped.Then the sea lion jumped onto its belly and sailed down the slide, landing on its stomach, flappers out to its side and a smile on its face. The crew rushed to hug the sea lion, to applaud its survival skills, to hail the new mascot of Palo Alto. The animal clapped its hands again and croaked three times, and across Silicon Valley, the sea lion\u2019s bark dried the tears of the children watching the live news broadcasts. The sea lion showed them hope amid this sea of destruction.One of the newscasters named it Fred.A few months later, when the ground had finally dried and the bitter memories of the lost aquarium had faded for all but lawyers and insurance companies, the lot was purchased by a young internet company called Anahata. The founder of the company demanded that Fred be included as part of the property deal.Fred was given his own wading pool next to the founder\u2019s office but spent most of his time waddling about the company\u2019s halls, pooping in the cubicles and barking at employees he didn\u2019t like, forcing Anahata\u2019s engineers to purchase sound-reduction headphones so they could work undisturbed. Fred did as he pleased and, in doing so, impressed everyone with his stubborn refusal to change his ways.When Fred died of old age a few years later, all the employees gathered to pay their respects. During the dedication of a commemorative aquarium in the company\u2019s main building, the founder of Anahata, a man named Bobby Bonilo, told his employees that it was Fred who had taught him how to run his company. Fred, he said, had proven that it was fine to have one eye and waddle if you were better than anyone else at doing those things.No one understood the metaphor, but all the employees committed it to memory as important career advice.The commemorative aquarium was soon filled with brightly colored fish and crustaceans, as well as a giant squid the founder flew back from a remote island in the Pacific. The squid wowed the crowd with its undulating arms, which extended almost the full length of the tank, and its chomping mouth, which tore apart most of the fish the moment they were dropped in the water.Nearly a decade on, the squid is nearly the size of a school bus and the aquarium\u2019s only remaining inhabitant. It floats in the central building of Anahata, today the world\u2019s largest and most powerful technology company.To interview at Anahata was a privilege. And the next, nearly inevitable step\u200a\u2014\u200ato be rejected from Anahata\u200a\u2014\u200awas a great honor. Just making it into the company\u2019s lobby already indicated that one was superior to 99.39 percent of the world\u2019s population. To be accepted, of course, required passing an even higher bar.One by one, the gobsmacked Rejects filed past the Hopefuls sitting in the lobby, as unsure of their steps as they now were of their qualifications. They turned back to catch a final glimpse of Anahata\u2019s collection of gleaming white buildings, and smiled then, just briefly, knowing that despite their failure\u200a\u2014\u200aa failure from which they might never recover\u200a\u2014\u200aat least they were among the few to have glimpsed the world hidden behind the company\u2019s doors.Arsyen Aimo surveyed his surroundings. It couldn\u2019t have been a friendlier place: wide green sofas, a gigantic refrigerator full of fresh juices, and a flight simulator to help pass the time in the unlikely event of a delay.Sitting on the very edge of the first couch was a young man, hair uncombed, T-shirt wrinkled, emitting a faint odor of sweat. Crumbs of breakfast cereal cast a pebbled road across his chest. A thin folder jittered in his hand, its transparency revealing a document whose tidy bullet points and blurbs belied the man\u2019s unkempt appearance. His knees bounced lightly up and down, and he rocked as he sat, lips moving silently as though he were counting to himself.On the second couch was another man, this one in his mid-thirties and wearing a suit, his cologne the essence of a crisp morning in the mountains. His back was against the sofa, one ankle thrown across the opposite knee, an arm thrown over the cushion as if he were there to watch Sunday football. He kept checking his watch, darting glances both anxious and dismissive at the female receptionists.Arsyen immediately recognized their types. The first was an engineer, the second a salesman. And there was no reason for Arsyen to think any more of either of them\u200a\u2014\u200aor the other fifteen iterations also waiting in the lobby\u200a\u2014\u200aas he had seen enough of both during his time in the Valley to identify their species by smell alone.Arsyen had other things on his mind; he was there to conquer his job interview. For he was Arsyen, Prince of Pyrrhia.Or rather, a former prince who due to unfortunate circumstances had been reduced to working as a janitor in Silicon Valley.Or, as he preferred to refer to it, a sanitation engineer.Not that he liked cleaning. He hated it. Prince Arsyen had not been raised in the Order of the Red Woodpecker\u200a\u2014\u200abuffed and preened and rubbed and polished to perfection by handmaidens each morning\u200a\u2014\u200awith the idea that he would leave the royal palace and clean people\u2019s toilets in America. (As a child, Arsyen didn\u2019t even know how to use a toilet, thanks to the service of his royal wipers.)But like most everything he undertook in life, Arsyen excelled at janitorial work\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was so good, in fact, that he usually finished his work in half the time of other janitors. Previous employers had occasionally misinterpreted his skill as laziness and accused him of not having logged sufficient time with the mop. But Arsyen knew that a truly exceptional company would see it differently.Anahata was that company, and this was no ordinary janitorial job. It paid better than any other Silicon Valley company by a full $3 an hour. If all went according to plan, in a few decades, Arsyen would save enough money to raise an army and reverse the unfortunate circumstances that had driven him from his country. His future, and the future of his adoring minions, depended on the outcome of this interview.A recruiter entered the room, and the crowd of hopefuls looked his way. His casual good looks and affable demeanor struck Arsyen as an effective ambassador for a company whose public image was one of approachable superiority.\u201cArsyen Aimo?\u201d the recruiter read from a sheet of paper.Prince Arsyen, Arsyen silently corrected him.The recruiter used a badge to push past the security doors, and Arsyen\u2019s mouth moved in a silent Wow as he entered the building. The cheerful but simple lobby area had not prepared him for this. The recruiter stopped\u200a\u2014\u200aa seemingly well-rehearsed pause of ten seconds\u200a\u2014\u200ato let Arsyen take it all in.The building was a light-filled air hangar with expansive skylights and shoulder-height cubicles of varying geometric configurations. One could see across the entire building in a glance. Colorful beanbags were sprinkled here and there, and sleep capsules lined the walls, emitting the faint lullaby of snoring engineers. Each corner and space was maximized to project a sense of possibility, and employees seemed to congregate wherever the mood struck\u200a\u2014\u200aa beanbag suddenly the appropriate place for a conference call; a foosball or pingpong table a surface to plop one\u2019s computer.\u201cExtra. Ordinary,\u201d said Arsyen, the English emerging from his tongue like an insult rather than a superlative.The recruiter didn\u2019t respond\u200a\u2014\u200ahis smile was stretched too far across his face to allow any spillage of words. He simply nodded and then motioned for Arsyen to follow. They made their way toward the opposite end of the building, then exited into a sunny courtyard and an immense stretch of pert, healthy grass that should never have been able to grow in California\u2019s desert landscape but seemed the natural complement to the bright, white buildings encircling the lawn. Palm trees swayed to an invisible breeze, casting the image of an island paradise in the expansive windows of each structure. For a brief moment, as they walked across a glass bridge over a small creek, Anahata\u2019s green, watery visions of itself surrounding them on all sides, Arsyen wondered which way was up. Legs and sand suddenly joined to palm trees in the reflections, and Arsyen turned, scanning the lawn for their origin. After a few seconds, he found them: a group of tanned girls in their early twenties playing volleyball on a sand court.Arsyen studied their long limbs and sun-bleached ponytails. They leaped across the sand like lip-glossed gazelles. I love America, he thought to himself. But he wasn\u2019t the only one watching. Amid the palm and water reflections on the windows, Arsyen could spot a face here and there, male onlookers with cheeks pressed up against the glass.They entered a new building, similar to the previous one, and Arsyen was ushered into a small, white room. It looked like a normal office, except all the walls were made of glass\u200a\u2014\u200aa familiar layout in Silicon Valley. For most employees, these spaces were a symbol of transparency and openness. For sanitation engineers like Arsyen, they were just an invitation for dirty fingerprints.The recruiter sat Arsyen at a table in the center of the room.\u201cWe\u2019ve found that it\u2019s most efficient for everyone to take a test before we invest in a conversation,\u201d he said.\u201cSorry?\u201d said Arsyen, perpetually annoyed that the English language required him to apologize when it was others who were unclear.\u201cYou\u2019re going to take a test now. If you pass, then someone will come interview you,\u201d the recruiter said.\u201cAnd then I meet Bobby Bonilo?\u201d Arsyen asked.\u201cThe founder of Anahata? At your interview? Uh\u2014\u201d\u201cI give great interview,\u201d said Arsyen, rising to his feet. He placed his hands on his hips and raised his chin as his father, the king, used to do.The recruiter\u2019s smile collapsed for a split second before rebounding.\u201cHow about we first see if you can find the error on this page.\u201d He pulled a paper from the top of his stack and handed it to Arsyen.Arsyen looked down and gasped at the dark incantations before him: nonsensical numbers and letters enclosed in .It wasn\u2019t that Arsyen had never seen computer code before. It was inescapable in the Valley\u200a\u2014\u200aon buses and billboards, hats and T-shirts. Valley people spoke of code like it was an act of progress, on par with a social movement. Over the years, as he mopped and scrubbed in the background, Arsyen had overheard more than a few hallway conversations in which scrawny men talked about using their code to change the world.But knowing how to recognize code and knowing how to code were two very different things. Surely there was no way he could be expected to perform such a task. Arsyen grunted. It was in moments like this that he particularly missed his home country of Pyrrhia. There he would have had any number of servants who could have learned computer programming on his behalf.Perhaps this was the right moment to inform the recruiter of his royal lineage. There had been no applicable dropdown box in the online application; no way for Arsyen to signal that he was not simply a great janitor, but someone whose very greatness had once been written into his country\u2019s constitution.But such a direct declaration struck Arsyen as rather crass\u200a\u2014\u200aroyalty was to be recognized, not announced.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t help things along with a discreet nod toward his heritage. Arsyen ignored the recruiter\u2019s prompt to find the coding error\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had no clue, and in any case, such details were for clerks and commoners. Instead, he sketched a crude outline of a pointy crown across the length of the page.\u201cDone,\u201d announced Arsyen, pushing the paper across the table.The recruiter glanced at Arsyen\u2019s paper and did a double take. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a bold statement,\u201d he said finally, then excused himself and left the room.Minutes later, a slightly balding man in his thirties entered carrying a brown paper bag. He was wearing a purple T-shirt with an orange cartoon character on the front; the sandals on his feet were made of red plastic. Arsyen was surprised by the ensemble. From what he had seen during his time in America, most sanitation engineers dressed inconspicuously, their very livelihood dependent on being able to make dirt\u200a\u2014\u200aand themselves\u200a\u2014\u200aas invisible as possible to the general population.This man looked more like a court jester.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Roni,\u201d he said, setting Arsyen\u2019s test on the table and extending his hand. \u201cYou got a r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201dArsyen shook his head. No one had ever asked him for a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 before.\u201cI get it, I get it,\u201d Roni said. \u201cI think they\u2019re dumb, too. I mean, a piece of paper\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s like, so corporate, you know? We don\u2019t need \u2019em. Let\u2019s just talk like equals, like regular guys who went to Stanford together.\u201dHe sat down in the chair opposite Arsyen.\u201cSo, how long have you been an engineer?\u201dArsyen felt his heart jump. It was the first time someone had properly called him an \u201cengineer.\u201d\u201cFour years,\u201d he answered, and then paused. Now was the time. He cleared his throat and lowered his voice, consciously making it as booming and sonorous as the Aimo name deserved. \u201cI am also\u2026prince.\u201dRoni chuckled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that one before. Actually, most of the engineers here think they are kings.\u201d\u201cBut there only one king,\u201d said Arsyen, making the sign of the red-breasted woodpecker.\u201cSo true, so true,\u201d Roni said. \u201cAnd what a king we have here at Anahata.\u201dRoni\u2019s gaze floated skyward, as if communicating with an otherworldly being. Arsyen also looked up but saw nothing more than a halogen lamp with a sticker touting its energy efficiency.Roni snapped back to life.\u201cNow, where were you before this?\u201d\u201cGalt.\u201dRoni\u2019s eyebrows leaped up in a flash, but then, equally quickly, were dragged downward\u200a\u2014\u200aa clear attempt by their owner to anchor his admiration. Galt was one of the Valley\u2019s hottest startups, famous for having created a bunch of apps and tools that eliminated the tedium of journalism, research, essays, and speeches by reducing all thought and opinion to easily shareable, bite-sized chunks. Everything they did was about minimization\u200a\u2014\u200amaking the world \u201ceasier to digest.\u201d Some people predicted Galt was the next Anahata, though personally, Arsyen had found the company lacked any creativity or vision and was always asking him to take a second pass at the men\u2019s stalls.\u201cGalt, eh? Well, that explains this,\u201d said Roni, pointing at the crown Arsyen had sketched across his test, lassoing most of the page\u2019s code.\u201cPretty ballsy to suggest all of our code is a mess,\u201d Roni said. \u201cI would respectfully disagree, but I applaud your moxie. You must be good at debugging.\u201dArsyen\u2019s face pruned. \u201cBugs,\u201d he spit. \u201cI kill them every day.\u201d\u201cAwesome. Me too, me too. Obviously, there\u2019s no coding in a P.M. job, but people here will respect you a lot more if you have an engineering background.\u201dArsyen didn\u2019t know what Roni meant by \u201cP.M. job.\u201d Was it a powerful mopper? A plumbing manager?Roni dipped his hand into the brown paper bag and slowly pulled out an enormous sandwich. Arsyen watched as he slowly removed the plastic and unfolded a paper napkin, square by square, until finally smoothing it before him. Roni paused and bent his head toward his sandwich, lifting his hands just slightly in prayer. And then, suddenly, the hands disappeared, the plastic wrap was on the other side of the table, and the sandwich was half hanging out of Roni\u2019s mouth. Turds of tuna fell onto the napkin below.\u201cLet\u2019s get going, shall we? I only ask one big question in my interviews. I\u2019m kinda known for that. It\u2019s all about the process, about how you go after it. It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s what you say, okay?\u201dArsyen nodded.\u201cSo,\u201d began Roni. \u201cYou\u2019re a pirate and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cNo, a prince.\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh right, haha. Well, for the purpose of this question, you\u2019re a pirate. If you want, you can be the captain of the pirate ship. Does that work?\u201d\u201cA captain is king of the pirate ship?\u201d\u201cExactly. Now you and your crew discover a treasure chest with one hundred gold coins, and you have to find a way to split it up.\u201d\u201cI give no gold. Gold is mine,\u201d Arsyen said.\u201cWell, now wait, that\u2019s the catch. If you don\u2019t give the other pirates anything, they will throw you off the ship. In order not to be killed, you have to come up with a way to distribute the coins so that at least half of the pirates agree with your proposal.\u201d\u201cI kill them and take gold,\u201d said Arsyen, dismissing the question with a wave of his hand.\u201cNot so fast,\u201d Roni said. \u201cYou\u2019re the captain, but you\u2019re outnumbered. So you can\u2019t kill them\u200a\u2014\u200athough I like your aggressiveness.\u201cNow, if you get killed, another pirate will have to come up with a proposal, but then he could be killed, too, so it goes to the next pirate. And so on and so on. So it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to agree on a proposal right from the start\u200a\u2014\u200abut also maximize their profit. It\u2019s basically a distribution problem. Actually, you know, I was given the same problem when I came to interview at Anahata. Except my interviewer used the Easter Bunny and a bunch of eggs, and the pirates were actually little kids and\u2026\u201dBut Arsyen had already stopped listening. His family had plundered plenty of ancient treasure over the centuries, swindling mercenaries, gangsters, and, yes, occasionally pirates\u200a\u2014\u200astealing from the very worst of mankind to give to the good people of Pyrrhia.\u201cYou can use this whiteboard here to work through the problem,\u201d said Roni, pointing to one of the walls. \u201cTake your time.\u201d\u201cOne gold coin,\u201d answered Arsyen. \u201cYou give pirates one coin each.\u201dRoni\u2019s eyes bulged.\u201cWow, uh, okay, that was quick. I mean, how did you\u2026I mean, the whiteboard\u2026Like, if there\u2019s two pirates and then you figure out\u2026Wait, how did you do this so fast? Talk me through the math.\u201d\u201cIn time to do math, other pirates kill captain,\u201d Arsyen answered. \u201cCapitan use brain.\u201d He tapped the side of his head, just in case Roni wasn\u2019t sure where the brain was located. Roni seemed a bit dim; he clearly had never been a pirate or even known one.\u201cOh yeah, like, totally,\u201d said Roni, regaining his composure. \u201cI mean, yeah, it\u2019s not difficult. But, um, we still have some time left, so\u2026\u201dRoni looked around the room, then jumped up from the table and scribbled something on the whiteboard.How do you use data to make your decisions?He stood back, shook his head, then erased it.Describe how you would improve your favorite Anahata product.He erased that one just as quickly.Then he tried something else.Automation.He grinned and returned to the table.\u201cOkay, pick something in the modern home and tell me what technologies you would use to automate it.\u201cNo automation. Hire more servants,\u201d Arsyen said.\u201cHuh? Uh, no, you can\u2019t have more servants,\u201d said Roni, shaking his head.\u201cWhy? Because someone killed them?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d said Roni, his face reddening slightly, fingers pressing into his napkin. \u201cI want a technical framework for how you would go about automating something in your house.\u201dArsyen couldn\u2019t resist a smirk. Everyone in the Valley wanted to automate everything, but to what end? All they were really doing was getting rid of people\u2019s jobs, which of course meant the peasants would eventually rise up and slaughter them. Technologists were so naive.\u201cNot all innovation so good,\u201d said Arsyen, shaking his head.\u201cWrong! One hundred percent wrong!\u201d Roni screamed, jumping out of his chair and waving a mayo-covered finger in Arsyen\u2019s face.Roni stood and stormed to the door. \u201cRecruiter!\u201d he shouted. \u201cRecruiter!\u201dHe stomped out of the room and began to pace, mostly muttering to himself, occasionally yelling \u201cinternet of things!\u201d and then hitting the side of his head with his palm over and over again.Arsyen sighed inwardly\u200a\u2014\u200aanother janitor diva. He wondered what sort of extraordinary cleaning product or technique Roni had invented for Anahata to put up with such behavior. Or maybe he was just one of those early hires the company never managed to get rid of.A tall man with a crew cut walked by and Roni waved him down.\u201cGregor!\u201d he shouted. The man stopped but did not seem particularly pleased to see him.Roni was gesturing rapidly, shaking his head, pointing at Arsyen in the room. Arsyen couldn\u2019t entirely make out what he was saying, but he was sure he heard the word \u201cGalt.\u201d The man turned to look at Arsyen, and the Prince of Pyrrhia sat up straight and puffed out his chest. But the man\u2019s blank expression gave nothing away.A moment later, both men were standing before him.\u201cWhat did you work on at Galt?\u201d demanded the tall man with the crew cut.\u201cBathrooms, hallways, computer screens. Much innovation,\u201d Arsyen said.Roni and the crew cut exchanged glances.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get anything out of him.\u201d\u201cBut he surely knows things,\u201d Gregor said.\u201cDo you know things?\u201d Roni asked.Arsyen nodded vigorously. He had enough experience in his father\u2019s court to know that it was always best to agree with an important person\u200a\u2014\u200aunless they were interrogating you about murder or adultery.The crew cut stared at Arsyen for a beat longer, then turned to Roni, whispering a few words Arsyen couldn\u2019t make out. Then, without a goodbye or any acknowledgement of Arsyen\u2019s presence, he turned on his heel and marched out the door.A second later, Roni was grinning, his hand extending again to Arsyen.\u201cCongrats\u200a\u2014\u200athe job is yours!\u201dArsyen was sure he had seen her before\u200a\u2014\u200athough certainly not here, in the Anahata reception area, seated at a long white desk, her figure backlit by a neon \u201cwelcome!\u201d sign.He studied her face\u200a\u2014\u200athe brown hair moving in slow waves past her shoulders, the slightly raised cheekbones. Her lips moved silently, murmuring secrets and chants\u200a\u2014\u200athings Arsyen wanted to know. His gaze moved again across her face, settling on her blue, almond-shaped eyes. And then he knew.The woman was Xeri. His Xeri. But she was a Xeri scrubbed clean, stripped of her crossbow and pointy elfin ears, her dirty wolf cape and leather skirt that hid a dagger in the belt loop. With her long, gauzy dress and random assortment of beaded necklaces, this Xeri was more flower child than assassin. And while that was less of a turn-on, this Xeri had one big thing going for her. She was much better than his World of Warcraft girlfriend. She was real.It wouldn\u2019t have been such a shock had Arsyen not already resigned himself to the idea that this breed of woman didn\u2019t exist in his corner of America. In his four years of working in Silicon Valley, Arsyen had run into plenty of her gender: ogre women, mustachioed women, circus women. But none like this: an attractive woman. It was like she was from another part of California entirely.Minutes passed as the woman typed on her computer, pale-pink fingernails knocking against the keyboard like little woodpeckers. Tap tap tap. Tap tap tap.He caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass wall behind her\u200a\u2014\u200aa strong Pyrrhian man, with muscles as ropey as the hair on his arms, and a powerful chin whose virile charms were enhanced by the large and uniquely crooked Aimo nose. He was white like the glossy coat of the rare Pyrrhian ram.His reflection frowned back at him. Would she find him a bit short?Of course not. Back in Pyrrhia, the women always complimented him on his height.\u201cArsyen?\u201dThe woman was looking up at him, her smile the product of America\u2019s strong belief in orthodontics. Good humor was cheap currency in this country, but the woman\u2019s smile was different, it was angelic, it was \u2014Arsyen decided then he would make her his queen. Her big white teeth would be admired by all his people.\u201cUh\u2026Arsyen?\u201dArsyen snapped back into focus. He had a girlfriend back in Pyrrhia who was dreaming of him and only him every night. He was at Anahata for his job\u200a\u2014\u200athe job that would free his people from the starvation and terrors of the current regime. He didn\u2019t have time for beautiful women\u200a\u2014\u200aat least not the ones who didn\u2019t accept cash.\u201cYou\u2019re all set up as a new Anahata employee, or Anahatis, as we call ourselves.\u201dThe woman walked out from behind the desk and extended her hand. She smelled vaguely of vanilla.\u201cI\u2019m Jennie,\u201d she said cheerfully, seemingly unaware of the mild earthquake that shook Arsyen as their palms touched. \u201cHere\u2019s your badge. Don\u2019t lose it\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s what gives you access to everything here.\u201dJennie badged them into the main part of the building, a different one than Arsyen had visited for his job interview. An enormous skylight stretched the building\u2019s length; Arsyen could even see clouds moving across the blue sky above. Suspended from the ceiling by wires and blocking the sun\u2019s glare, an old NASA rocket and a fiberglass T. rex charged at each other from opposite ends of the building.To Arsyen\u2019s left, running along the outside wall of one cubicle, a ticker tape documented connections made through the company\u2019s latest product, Moodify, a social network designed to connect people based on their moods, heart rates, and favorite video games. Although he didn\u2019t know much about technology, Arsyen had recently bought a Moodify bracelet. It pained him that his video game and gadget expenditures had to come out of his throne reclamation fund, but it was very important that the future leader of Pyrrhia be up to date on the latest technology and first-person-shooter attack and defense techniques.Arsyen\u2019s Moodify bracelet glowed red\u200a\u2014\u200athe same color, he was certain, as Jennie\u2019s. He waited to see their names cross the ticker tape in a flashing red arrow, suggesting a love connection, but the Moodify technology seemed to be broken. He turned to speak, but Jennie was already on the other side of the hall, standing before an enormous aquarium that stretched the length of the wall. Her bracelet pulsed with blue light. Arsyen shook his head and double-checked to see if his bracelet had changed colors. Maybe he just needed to stand closer. He ran to catch up with his future queen.Jennie spotted the squid from across the floor, its peach mass hovering above a cluster of neon corals and sea plants. The squid was no longer part of the company tour\u200a\u2014\u200anowadays animals were included only if they were robotic\u200a\u2014\u200abut Jennie liked to stop by at least once a week to say hello.\u201cHi friend,\u201d said Jennie, tapping the glass.The squid wove its tentacles around a cluster of kelp, ripping the plant from its seabed and pressing it against the glass as if in offering.\u201cSo sweet,\u201d Jennie giggled.\u201cWhat this?\u201d said a man\u2019s voice behind her.Oh\u2026him. Jennie had almost forgotten about him. Who was he\u200a\u2014\u200aArse\u2026Arsi\u2026Ass? She glanced down at her HR form. Arsyen.\u201cThis is our squid,\u201d said Jennie, stretching her receptionist\u2019s smile toothy and wide as she turned to face him.As far as product managers went, he seemed particularly underwhelming\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019d already been walking for ten minutes and he hadn\u2019t even tried to lecture her about anything. How was it that Anahata could overlook people like Jennie in favor of dopey guys like Arsyen? Jennie had applied to ten internal jobs this quarter alone, ranging from online sales assistant to VP of infrastructure engineering, and hadn\u2019t gotten a single bite. Most of the time they told her she wasn\u2019t the right \u201cculture fit.\u201d Sometimes they claimed she wasn\u2019t qualified\u200a\u2014\u200aJennie, who had an almost-PhD in Russian literature and fifteen online entrepreneurship degrees and had watched every single TED Talk ever recorded.\u201cBig fish,\u201d said Arsyen, clearly demonstrating his superior intellect. \u201cOther fish here too?\u201d\u201cNot anymore. We used to have other fish, but they just kept disappearing while the squid here kept getting bigger and bigger. So it\u2019s just him now. Some people think he ate the smaller fish, but I think he\u2019s just a misunderstood giant.\u201dJennie wanted to point out to Arsyen that she had just created a metaphor. She was obviously the squid, but prettier.But instead she just smiled. Jennie knew her poetry would be lost on someone with an engineering degree.\u201cYou can visit him whenever you want,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you make it past the first week, you can even sign up to feed him.\u201d\u201cThe first week\u2026?\u201dJennie did a double take.\u201cDidn\u2019t you read your offer letter?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dJennie rifled through the HR paperwork. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, thrusting a paper at Arsyen and tapping the middle of the page with a pink fingernail.\u201c\u2018Anahata reserves the right to terminate your contract at any point during your first week,\u2019\u201d Jennie quoted. \u201cAnd by \u2018any point,\u2019 they mean even during the first five minutes.\u201dJennie saw the panic that flashed across Arsyen\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t resist pushing things a bit further.\u201cI should probably fire you right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dJennie ripped Arsyen\u2019s red badge out of his hand and started to walk away.\u201cBut I\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dJennie stopped and sighed. The truth was she had no power to fire anyone at Anahata. It was fun to mess with Arsyen, but if she wasn\u2019t careful, he could end up firing her. The only power receptionists had was over the refrigerator in the reception area.She turned to face him.\u201cIf you had read your contract, you\u2019d know that I can\u2019t fire you,\u201d Jennie said.\u201cPhew!\u201dJennie scribbled a note on Arsyen\u2019s HR form: Employee did not read contract. In another profession, that would have been a ding against Arsyen, but at Anahata, managers seemed to view noncompliance among their technical staff as a sign of genius.\u201cWhat you doing?\u201d said Arsyen, lifting onto his toes to catch a glimpse of what Jennie had written.\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Jennie, waving away his concern as she pushed him out of the building and onto the lawn. \u201cThe only thing you need to do is keep your manager happy and, well, watch out for other engineers.\u201d She gestured toward a group of men sitting on a picnic table, gathered around a computer. \u201cI can\u2019t fire you, but they can.\u201dThe largest man in the group turned in their direction, stretching his arms above his head. Jennie recognized him from the previous week, when she had seen him fire a new engineer for choosing a Diet Coke instead of a Red Bull from the micro-kitchen.The engineer\u2019s mouth roared in a wide, silent yawn, and his eyes scanned the area around him, moving across the various employees walking across the grass. His gaze fell on Arsyen and a trigger within him seemed to be pulled. He threw his pale, hairy legs over the bench and began to lope toward them.\u201cQuick!\u201d hissed Jennie, pushing Arsyen into the nearest building.She didn\u2019t care about Arsyen, but she did care about her orientation success rate. To date, she was the only Anahata receptionist who had completed all of her new employee tours without having a single employee fired.Jennie found an empty meeting room and closed the door behind them.\u201cThat was close!\u201d she said. \u201cSorry, I should have explained earlier. My badge is white, but your badge is red.\u201d\u201cRed is for special employees?\u201d asked Arsyen, puffing out his chest.\u201cI guess you could say that,\u201d shrugged Jennie. \u201cMost of the employees with red badges are contractors. Those are the employees we like\u2026but not so much as to give them health care\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know, like cafeteria workers and security guards. The other people who get red badges are like you\u200a\u2014\u200aprovisional employees who need to pass their first week. Anyway, the point is you\u2019ll need your badge to get into buildings, but the rest of the time you should hide it in your pocket.\u201dJennie poked her head out the door. The engineer was pacing the hall. She shut the door and turned to face Arsyen.\u201cNever show fear. Engineers can smell it a mile away. Half of succeeding here is just acting like you\u2019re right about stuff even when you aren\u2019t.\u201dJennie glanced at Arsyen\u2019s HR sheet. He was assigned to Building 7, which housed some of the company\u2019s coolest projects, like Social Car and Builder. Maybe she could butter up to him and he could get her a job there. Though, on second thought, Arsyen seemed a little creepy and could misinterpret her intentions. The last thing Jennie needed was another work drama. A few weeks earlier she had made the mistake of hooking up with Niels Smeardon, Anahata\u2019s SVP of sales. She had done everything he wanted\u200a\u2014\u200atold him that his penis and sales strategy presentation were the biggest she had ever seen; she even let him balance his computer on her back so he could send a few urgent emails right after they had sex. And all of that had gotten her nothing but a reassignment by the HR team to the main reception area, far away from the sales buildings.Jennie continued to stew about her Niels hookup as she began to rattle off other campus facts to Arsyen. Sales were in Buildings 10 to 15, Operations from 15 to 20, anything supporting those teams from 20 to 27, and facilities and janitorial staff in Building 28. She saw Arsyen nod when she mentioned the janitors and wondered if he was one of those social activist employees, the type who made six figures but liked to spend the majority of his work hours railing about The Man and trying to make the cafeterias go full vegan.Jennie found those employees a bit annoying\u200a\u2014\u200athey were always complaining about the juice selection in the reception area\u200a\u2014\u200abut she still preferred them to people like Niels. He had taken home more than $100 million dollars last year in executive pay but hadn\u2019t even offered to order her a car ride home.\u201cWhat do you do at Anahata?\u201d asked Arsyen, interrupting Jennie\u2019s thoughts.Was he just trying to make conversation, or was he questioning her competence? At Anahata, one could never be sure.\u201cI\u2019m a campus guide and do some reception work,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important role, because if you don\u2019t have someone like me who shows new people around, they may never understand Anahata and could get lost.\u201dShe paused and searched Arsyen\u2019s face for a reaction. It was totally blank, as if he wasn\u2019t even listening to her.\u201cOf course, I mean \u2018getting lost\u2019 both figuratively and literally,\u201d continued Jennie, feeling anger build in her stomach. \u201cMany of your lot only understand the latter point, not the former, and so you see, that is why we humanities majors are so valuable here.\u201dArsyen nodded but now seemed fixated on the Moodify bracelet on his wrist.Had he even heard a word she said? He was like the rest of them\u200a\u2014\u200afull of himself, convinced of his own brilliance, sure that a lowly receptionist was completely irrelevant to the mighty things he had to do during his day. But what did he know about the world, anyway? Coding didn\u2019t teach you about culture. It didn\u2019t teach you empathy or emotional intelligence.\u201cI was a Russian lit PhD before I dropped out to join Anahata, so I know a lot about what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cThere are people starving, people who don\u2019t have clean water. So after Anahata, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do\u200a\u2014\u200achange some of those things. Or maybe I\u2019ll do it here. I haven\u2019t figured it out yet. The point is, do you have a social conscience? A big purpose, Arsyen?\u201dArsyen looked up.\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI will save my people and kill very bad dictator.\u201dGood lord. This tour was proving even more tedious than her last one\u200a\u2014\u200aan engineer who made whale sounds out of his nose while they hid in a broom closet. She leaned out the door.\u201cAll clear.\u201dShe popped her head back in and pointed at Arsyen\u2019s badge to remind him to hide it in his pocket.They made it safely to the other parts of the campus, each building revealing a well-orchestrated surprise for Anahata\u2019s new employee. Building 3 had frozen yogurt machines in each cubicle. In Building 4, there was a service for engineers who wanted someone to tuck them in at night in the campus beds. Building 2 had moving walkways that would reverse direction every fifteen minutes\u200a\u2014\u200aa challenge to either time one\u2019s movements precisely or exercise by moving against the current.\u201cPast that door is the volleyball court,\u201d said Jennie, pointing just beyond the reversible walkway, \u201cand to the right is the swimming pool. Our founder, Bobby Bonilo, wanted to set an example for the rest of the Valley that health and fitness should be an important part of an employee\u2019s well-being.\u201d\u201cLike Galt,\u201d Arsyen said.Jennie shot Arsyen a glance. What kind of idiot joined Anahata and spent their first day talking about its biggest competitor?\u201cAnahata did it first,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWe were the first to make health a priority. The first to say you should drink lots of water and get lots of sleep. Galt copies everything we do.\u201dShe made another note on his HR form: Cocky. Insulted Anahata.Yet another point racked up for Arsyen. This guy had to be one of the more arrogant employees she had ever met. He\u2019d probably be a big success here.They stopped in front of the medieval-themed cafeteria in Building 5, and for a moment Arsyen was transported back to Poodlekek, standing in a cave next to Sklartar, his manservant.But what had first looked like Sklartar was now, at second glance, clearly a robot, and there were no bodies scattered at his feet. Nor were there any henchmen to wait on Arsyen, or maidens to help feed and clothe him. And there was certainly no one to help clean up after him. To think if his people knew that Arsyen was now cleaning the toilets of America!It was never supposed to be like this. If the peasants hadn\u2019t gotten so mad about the potato tax, if the neighboring country of Embria hadn\u2019t sensed weakness and attacked from the north, Arsyen would still be in Poodlekek now, having his bottom wiped by the royal wiper, occasionally exerting himself at a game of croquet.But the Embrian barbarians had surrounded his family\u2019s palace, with Arsyen narrowly missing execution as he snuck across the border and into a U.N. refugee camp. The Pyrrhian military successfully restored the country to order, but just as Arsyen was prepared to return, General Korpeko declared a coup and foisted the helpless Aimo family from power.Arsyen was bounced between various immigrant detention camps, eventually ending up in California, where he was released into the wilds of Silicon Valley. There, he found work as a janitor in Stanford\u2019s chemistry department. Then, from there, on to a few small startups and eventually Galt. And now Anahata, where he would finally make his mark.Arsyen glanced over at his future queen.Jennie\u2019s mouth was moving again. It seemed to move a lot. Arsyen knew that women liked the opportunity to speak, but beautiful women were most beautiful when they were silent.\u201cAnd so you can see,\u201d she was saying, \u201cthat the composting techniques developed in Russia in the early twentieth century had a profound impact in how we compost now in Palo Alto.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Arsyen, looking down to see if their Moodify bracelets had finally synced.They still weren\u2019t working.Jennie stopped in front of another building. It was an echo of all previous buildings they had toured: an enormous white complex with a plain, charmless exterior. \u201cYour new home,\u201d she announced.Hadn\u2019t Jennie said janitorial services were in Building 28? This one had an enormous black \u201c7\u201d painted near its entrance.The metal doors banged open, and a large group of men walked out, laughing about something. Arsyen had never seen such diversity\u200a\u2014\u200aso many white, Chinese, and Indian male janitors all working in the same company.Behind them was another man, also white, walking slowly across the lawn, chomping on an enormous carrot. It was the same guy Arsyen had met at his interview. He had already forgotten his name, but the man\u2019s shirt reminded him: R-O-N-I, spelled out in big block letters sewn clumsily across the chest. This was him, the king of the cleaning crew.Roni greeted Arsyen with a wave. Arsyen turned to say something to Jennie, but she had already disappeared.Roni signaled to Arsyen to follow, pointing out different landmarks as they made their way around campus: \u201cHere\u2019s where you can pick up four different kinds of cupcakes each day at three p.m.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s the secret underground passageway that leads to the volleyball court.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s where you can get a full-body massage\u200a\u2014\u200aand if you book the tropical forest room, tell them no rainmaker!\u201dArsyen was amazed by the amenities, but he was even more excited about his paycheck. With the extraordinary salary they were paying him\u200a\u2014\u200aten times more than the job listing had originally advertised\u200a\u2014\u200ahis reclamation of Pyrrhia drew much, much closer. This year\u2019s salary alone would purchase twenty Pyrrhian mercenary troops and several thousand horses, as well as one million sacks of flour to be distributed to the poor (eight hundred thousand if he had his portrait printed on the sacks, which could be an important revolution/coup marketing strategy).If he kept on this path, he could reclaim the throne in just a few years. He could probably even fly Natia, his Pyrrhian internet girlfriend, out to the United States so he could finally have sex with her. Though maybe it would be better to dump Natia, date Jennie, and spend the extra money on some new video games. Being a ruler meant setting clear priorities.They walked down a nondescript hall that dumped them into a maze of cubicles. Each contained a handful of desks, and occasionally a table. The white walls were only shoulder height, and Arsyen could easily see who was inside. The view was the same no matter where he turned: square after square of men staring at their computer screens. The layout reminded him of ice cube trays.Roni stopped next to a poster that read \u201cEntering a No Galt Zone!\u201d\u201cVoil\u00e0!,\u201d exclaimed Roni, his arm gesturing at the cubicle before him like a game show host. Its simple layout mirrored that of every other cubicle they had passed. There were three desks\u200a\u2014\u200aonly two of which were occupied\u200a\u2014\u200aand a whiteboard covered in code hieroglyphs.There were two men in the cubicle, but neither turned, continuing instead to focus intently on their screens. Arsyen wondered why his fellow sanitation engineers were working on computers, and why there were no cleaning materials anywhere in sight. Perhaps cleaning happened differently at Anahata. Thoughts of unknown methods immediately filled his head, his exhilaration only slightly tempered by the sight of Red Bull cans stacked in a pyramid atop a side table. Roni grabbed an unopened can and tossed it to Arsyen. \u201cLife blood,\u201d he joked, grabbing one for himself.Roni tapped one of the cubicle dwellers on the shoulder.\u201cJonas, meet Arsyen,\u201d he said.The seated figure turned slowly, and Arsyen realized that the gangly, pimply boy before him couldn\u2019t be more than sixteen. His skin was a shifting kaleidoscope of sallow and dark blotches. Enormous glasses covered his face from the eyebrows to the tip of the nose. Through the frames, his eyes studied Arsyen, and then moved to Roni, and then suddenly seemed to register the purpose of the introduction. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, in a thick but familiar accent. \u201cIt is nice to make your acquaintance. Arsyen\u200a\u2014\u200abish mena kakaya?\u201dArsyen hesitated. The words, the accent, the singsong of the phrase all sounded so familiar, and yet he had no idea what the teenager had just said to him. \u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cOh, my most sincere apologies,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI thought from your name\u2026you see, Arsyen is a name we have in my country, Embria. And your face could pass for Embrian.\u201dArsyen\u2019s left eye twitched. Embria! The country that had started the Fifth Great War, the country responsible for having raped and pillaged his native land for thousands of years. The rivalry between the two countries was legendary. The greatest insult in the Pyrrhian language was to call someone a klok-klok\u200a\u2014\u200aa chicken from Embria.Arsyen offered his hand. \u201cI am from Pyrrhia,\u201d he said, proudly trilling the rand making the sign of the red-breasted woodpecker.But Jonas\u2019 expression didn\u2019t change, as if it was simply an input of information, meaning no more to him than if Arsyen had said he was from Los Angeles. He turned back to his computer.Roni pointed to the desk across the room, where a very blond head sat atop a very long body.\u201cThat\u2019s Sven. He\u2019s from Sweden and is ex-Microsoft, but he\u2019s a bit embarrassed about that, so don\u2019t bring it up with him. He lives with his mom, which is another topic to avoid. But he\u2019s got a thousand startup ideas\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s always a safe subject.\u201dRoni pulled the headphones off the blond mop of hair, and Sven swiveled his chair. He grinned and shook Arsyen\u2019s hand. Then he readjusted his headphones and banged his knees against the desk as he turned back to face his screen.Roni pointed at an empty desk between Jonas and Sven. \u201cHere\u2019s your space.\u201dArsyen\u2019s eyes ran across the desk. There was nothing on it but an enormous computer. He opened a drawer. No sponges, no commercial cleaning agents, no chemicals for him to mix.\u201cRoni, where my supplies?\u201d\u201cOh, there\u2019s a tech center down the hall where you can get everything\u200a\u2014\u200aa mouse, big monitor, pens\u200a\u2014\u200aif you are one of those people who still writes things by hand, that is. Anyway, take your time getting set up. I\u2019ve got an important meeting to attend, but when I come back I\u2019ll get you briefed on everything.\u201dArsyen took a seat at his desk and studied the area around him. The floor throughout the cubicle was covered in potato chip particles\u200a\u2014\u200apresumably from the open bag on Sven\u2019s desk. A piece of dried putty had begun a slow, snail-like trudge down the wall above Jonas\u2019 desk. Across the room, a series of dark symbols glared at Arsyen from the whiteboard.This was the messiest janitor\u2019s office he had ever seen.The first order of business was to get his cleaning supplies. Roni\u2019s instructions had seemed simple enough\u200a\u2014\u200astraight down the hall, a right at the first opportunity, then the second left. But no sooner had he made the first turn then Arsyen found himself lost in a labyrinth of cubicles.He approached a map posted on the wall, tracing his finger along the rows in search of something resembling a supply closet.Arsyen felt a tap on his shoulder.\u201cAre you lost? New here, maybe?\u201dArsyen turned to face a freckled, red-headed kid, not much older than Jonas.Arsyen\u2019s hidden red badge poked into his thigh, reminding him to be careful.\u201cAre you an engineer?\u201d the kid asked.Arsyen nodded. The kid looked skinny and weak. Arsyen was sure he could outrun him.The kid\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cOkay, then. I want to know all the words in English that have X as the second letter and N as the second to last.\u201dArsyen spotted an exit sign at the far end of the hall. He decided to make a run for it.\u201cHey! Hey!\u201d screamed the kid, yelling after him. \u201cTell me how you would make an object model of a pig!\u201dArsyen dashed down the hall, the sound of the kid\u2019s plastic Crocs squeaking closely behind him. He pushed open the door, ran to his right, past the volleyball court, over a bridge made of Legos, dodged through a group of employees fighting with light sabers, and ducked into a nearby building.Arsyen glanced behind him. The kid was nowhere in sight. He caught his breath and surveyed his surroundings.He hadn\u2019t been in this building before. It seemed largely empty\u200a\u2014\u200anothing more than a series of plain white corridors. There wasn\u2019t even anyone walking about.He spotted another building map and traced his finger down the corridors. At the end of the northwest hall was an exit door that appeared to lead in the direction of Building 7\u200a\u2014\u200aArsyen\u2019s building.He headed in that direction, keeping an eye out for predatory engineers. But there wasn\u2019t a soul in sight.Just before reaching the exit, Arsyen stopped, and his face lit up in a smile. To his right was a white door labeled in simple black lettering: SUPPLY CLOSETFinally!Arsyen paused before the door. This was a big moment. The tools he chose here would determine the success of his first week at Anahata. A lobby broom was a good choice for one-handed cleaning and getting at some of the trickier corners of Arsyen\u2019s cubicle. But a midsize broom would be better for general sweeping.He knew his co-workers would judge him closely for his choices, so he took a deep breath and placed his hand on the knob.On the other side of the door, Gregor Guntlag\u2019s gaze alternated between the doorknob, which he thought he had seen rattle, and the clock, whose minute hand was broken. It wobbled between one tick and the next, as though no longer sure of the direction in which time moved.The existence of a clock on a wall of the world\u2019s most important technology company was itself a quaint reminder of a different era, a period in which time was measured differently, the various positions of its hands signifying official, institutionalized periods of work and rest.That clock\u200a\u2014\u200athe only one on campus\u200a\u2014\u200awas a crucial addition to the Anahata board room, aka the supply closet. The company\u2019s CEO, Bobby Bonilo, had forbidden the use of any electronic devices in the room, and the clock was the only way his management team could measure the progress of their interminable meetings. According to its current movements, one minute (soon to be minus one minute) had passed since Bobby had begun his latest yoga pose. Gregor Guntlag, Anahata\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, had many projects in the works to speed up time, but to date, even he couldn\u2019t manage to accelerate Bobby\u2019s sun salutations.\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa,\u201d came a deep, raspy sound from the back of Bobby\u2019s throat. He was on all fours at the head of the table, his butt thrust toward the ceiling, the top of his white shirt falling to expose a pale back covered with moles. Bobby rested his knees on the table and sat back on his legs, a small gut spilling over his waistband like freshly baked bread. His eyes remained closed.\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d The sound intensified. \u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa! Haaaaaaaaaaa!\u201dThe daily management meeting was itself an exercise in yogic patience and discipline, with all five members of the team doing a generally poor job of tolerating each other.Although they were a small group, the men spread themselves out around the table, allowing spaces of two or three chairs between them. In addition to Gregor, there was Old Al, the company\u2019s only gray-haired engineer, occasionally useful for his fifty-four years of wisdom. A few seats down sat Greg Fischer, the chief financial and corporate affairs officer (CFCAO), who ran all the departments\u200a\u2014\u200alegal, finance, marketing, and PR\u200a\u2014\u200athat were seen as necessary evils in helping run a large company. Equal in irrelevance was HR Paul, the head of the human resources department, who was generally regarded as a nincompoop psychology PhD with a flatulence problem. And then there was Niels, aka The Salesman.The master engineer and the master salesman did not like each other, but today Niels seemed to be paying Gregor no attention. Gregor grimaced as Niels bent his gel-slicked head over the small notepad that he carried around in his front pocket. He found the mere existence of Niels\u2019 notepad an insult to the advances of technology and word processing software.Gregor had disliked Anahata\u2019s new head of advertising from the instant he spotted him on campus, a plastic smile fixed on his face, fancy designer suit falling from his shoulders like a second skin. With his wingtips pointed sharply in the direction of his target, Niels had approached Gregor to suggest the engineering team fix the advertising system interface so that Anahata\u2019s advertisers could more easily place their ads online. Gregor quickly informed Niels that Anahata was about its users first and foremost, and that its users\u200a\u2014\u200aand just as important, Anahata\u2019s engineers\u200a\u2014\u200adid not care about an improved advertising system. Implicit in his explanation was the unwritten philosophical hierarchy of Anahata: Engineers at the top, then users, and then, long after that, cheerleaders, janitors, creationists, and, finally, the Anahata sales team.But Niels was slow on the uptake. He kept pushing for the change, eventually escalating the issue to Bobby. Bobby, in turn, sent Gregor and Niels an email asking them to speak to each other and not bother him with such small problems. Six years later, the two men still had not managed to do so. They only met in Bobby\u2019s management meetings, where they sat on opposite ends of the table and took opposing stances in almost any argument.\u201cHaaaaaaaaaa\u2026Haaaaaaaaaa\u2026Haaaaaaa\u2026Ha! Ha! Ha!\u201dSuddenly, Bobby was on his feet, arms outstretched.\u201cOur minds are clear,\u201d he said, opening his eyes and bowing to his management team. Bobby sat down on top of the table, crossing his legs in the lotus position. \u201cLet us begin.\u201dJust then, the door opened and a man entered, wearing an enormous grin.Gregor thought he recognized this short, swarthy man, but he could not place him. The intruder also seemed confused: He scanned the room, past Gregor, past Niels, and landed on Bobby. His eyes bulged, the grin vanished, and he took a step back. His hand fiddled with the doorknob.\u201cWait,\u201d said Bobby, looking him over. \u201cClearly you must be smart to have found me like this. I am elusive, you know. A bit like a panther\u200a\u2014\u200aif panthers were also progressive Buddhists.\u201d Bobby pawed the air with his claws.The man nodded vigorously.Gregor\u2019s tongue roamed his mouth, searching for particles of stray food. He always brushed his teeth after lunch, but today he had lost track of time while troubleshooting a server issue with the infrastructure team. The lack of order in his mouth was mildly distressing\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like this intruder, who he wished would leave. Where had he seen him before?\u201cI suppose you have joined us because you know of our open-door meeting policy,\u201d said Bobby, referring to a core Anahata principle that Gregor and the rest of the management team all actually hated.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Bobby asked.\u201cArsyen Aimo,\u201d the man said.\u201cJoin us, Arsyen.\u201d\u201cBut, Bobby, \u201d said Fischer, the CFCAO, \u201cwe have confidential things to discuss.\u201d\u201cTrust is the cornerstone of truth. If we cannot trust our employees, our house will fall upon itself.\u201d Bobby turned to Arsyen and gestured at a seat at the table.Arsyen took the chair closest to the door, gripping its arms oddly, rigidly, as if he were sitting on a throne. Suddenly Gregor recalled where he had seen him. This was the product manager candidate Roni had pointed out, the one from Galt. They had decided to hire him just to bleed Galt of some of its top talent. Over the past month, Anahata had lost several of its best engineers to the startup.Gregor gave Arsyen another look. He was still panting a bit; dark hairs peeked out from a very wet collar. He did not seem like an exceptional human being. Still\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s up first?\u201d asked Bobby, turning to his assistant. She was in attendance that day as part of what Bobby called \u201cradical transparency,\u201d a philosophy that, while often cited by Bobby, seemed to be in effect only every third Thursday. His assistant leaned over and showed him a list\u200a\u2014\u200aand some generous cleavage.\u201cOkay, everyone,\u201d said Bobby, nodding at her breasts. \u201cLet\u2019s show Arsyen what innovation looks like!\u201dBobby\u2019s assistant opened the door, and a product manager and his engineering team shuffled toward the table in an awkward, heaving lump. They kept their heads down, shooting furtive glances at Bobby as they prepared to present their work.The product manager coughed. \u201cWhen, um, we set out to design the new interface for Rovix, we had, uh, three goals in mind.\u201d\u201cWhy do you need a presentation to tell me your goals?\u201d Old Al barked. \u201cKeep things simple. You don\u2019t need two hundred slides to tell me what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a few slides,\u201d the product manager mumbled.\u201cAl\u2019s right,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t tell us your idea in thirty seconds, it\u2019s not an idea. It\u2019s a presentation.\u201dThe product manager closed his computer.\u201cSo, uh, there were three goals. First, to simplify the user interface. Second, to make it easier for people to share content across all of our products. And third, to ensure we had the right structure in place to eventually run ads next to the content\u200a\u2014\u200aif,\u201d his eyes darted over at Gregor, \u201cwe ever decided that was something we would want to do.\u201dGregor\u2019s radar shot to attention. Had they actually just suggested putting advertising on this product? Niels\u2019 team must have lobbied for it.\u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d said Old Al, shaking his finger at the team. \u201cBobby invented the concept of cloud computing on a high school cafeteria napkin twenty years ago. Big ideas should be simple. Napkinable.\u201d\u201cHere,\u201d said Fischer, pulling a napkin out of his takeaway carton. \u201cUse this. Show us Rovix on a napkin.\u201dThe product manager fumbled with his backpack and pulled out a pen. He began to draw on Fischer\u2019s napkin. Soon, the napkin had various arrows and bullet points scattered across it, in addition to a small glob of mayonnaise.Bobby glanced at the drawing and frowned. \u201cArsyen, take a look and tell us what you would do.\u201dThe napkin made its way down the table to Arsyen. His nose wrinkled as his fingers daintily pinched the clean edge.\u201cSpeak up!\u201d shouted Old Al as he adjusted his hearing aid.\u201cThrow it away,\u201d said Arsyen, pushing the napkin toward the middle of the table.Bobby\u2019s eyes lit up, and he turned to the Rovix team.\u201cYou heard Arsyen. There\u2019s clearly something wrong with your product\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll leave you all to figure out what that is. But remember: Big ideas have simple solutions.\u201cAlso remember: Solutionize. Iterate. Solutionize. Iterate.\u201cAnd really remember: Sometimes failure is success, and other times success is failure.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d said the product manager, inclining slightly in a half-bow. He glanced at Old Al and then Gregor, likely hoping for additional feedback or some indication of whether the meeting had gone well. But Gregor wasn\u2019t in the mood to give feedback, and Old Al had fallen asleep.The assistant shut the door behind them, and Fischer belched noisily.Gregor rolled his eyes. He found the whole lot of them to be idiots, minus Bobby and occasionally Old Al. But then he caught a similar disgust on Niels\u2019 face and recoiled. He would not permit himself to share an emotion with that man.\u201cAre we done?\u201d Gregor asked. He needed to talk to Bobby, and no productive dialog could take place as long as The Salesman was around.Bobby\u2019s assistant consulted the agenda. \u201cWe have a proposal from Niels,\u201d she said.Niels flashed the assistant his best grin, then launched into his pitch.\u201cWe have a huge, untapped opportunity before us,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the chance to make over a billion dollars in the first year alone just by\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cNiels, stop right there!\u201d Bobby yelped. \u201cDon\u2019t you see who is in the room? Arsyen!\u201dEveryone turned in his direction.The weight of the group\u2019s gaze seemed to sink Arsyen even lower in his chair\u200a\u2014\u200aan observation that did not displease Gregor. This Arsyen seemed to be a rather unremarkable individual. What had Galt seen in him? Had Gregor and Roni made a mistake in hiring him?\u201cIt is inevitable that the rest of us must discuss it, but I don\u2019t know if our engineer should hear this kind of talk. You are an engineer, right?\u201dArsyen nodded.Gregor shook his head but didn\u2019t say anything. Product managers were such frauds, always trying to pretend they were real engineers instead of MBAs with a few coding classes under their belts.\u201cYou see, Arsyen,\u201d continued Bobby, \u201cwe\u2019re going to talk about money. Or more specifically, advertising.\u201d Bobby spit out the last word like a piece of rotten food.That\u2019ll show him, thought Gregor, shooting a smug glance at Niels.But Niels only smiled in response. His confidence enraged Gregor\u200a\u2014\u200aand fed his self-doubt. What if Bobby didn\u2019t really hate advertising or Niels? What if his disgust was just an act?\u201cBobby, you make an excellent point, as always,\u201d Niels said. \u201cBut I think it would be good for engineers like Arsyen to understand how the sales team funds their innovations.\u201d\u201cFine with me,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for our new employee to understand who really runs this company.\u201dGregor looked to Bobby, but the founder said nothing. He seemed to be distracted by some dirt underneath his fingernails.Niels introduced his proposal\u200a\u2014\u200aa project in which Anahata would run ads on Moodify bracelets. Within minutes, Gregor was on the attack. No matter what revenue projection or partnership expansion Niels raised, Gregor countered with the Anahata commandment to never hurt the user experience in the name of revenue.Despite his reputation, Gregor was not actually opposed to advertising. He knew the company needed to make money, and, like Bobby, he himself was a very rich man thanks to Anahata\u2019s online ads. But Gregor was willing to put additional material gain aside in the name of thwarting his nemesis.After an extensive back-and-forth\u200a\u2014\u200aand a lengthy digression from Old Al, who had woken from his nap to explain how advertising had worked back before the internet was invented\u200a\u2014\u200athe battle finally puttered to a halt. Gregor wasn\u2019t sure he had won\u200a\u2014\u200aBobby had refused to make a decision and then closed his eyes to meditate\u200a\u2014\u200abut the frustrated look on Niels\u2019 face was satisfaction enough.Fischer offered a temporary d\u00e9tente by raising an issue they had discussed the previous week: a newly released Galt productivity tool that reduced people\u2019s lengthy business presentations into a four-sentence sales pitch, thereby shortening business meetings and helping society advance capitalism at three times the current rate. It was nearly identical to a project Anahata was set to launch the following month. That Galt had beaten Anahata to market was no surprise: The startup had lured away two of Anahata\u2019s best productivity engineers the previous fall. In fact, it seemed that all of Anahata\u2019s work and thinking had made it into the final Galt tool.\u201cI always said we would lose those engineers to Galt,\u201d growled Old Al, shaking a finger at HR Paul. \u201cWe knew they were getting calls from the recruiters every week, and we did nothing to stop it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true Al, and I don\u2019t feel like you are speaking to me in a productive manner,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe gave them strong counteroffers, and even took one of their mothers on a hot-air balloon ride. But in the end, both said Galt was scrappier and less bureaucratic.\u201d\u201cWe should sue Galt and show them they can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d Old Al retorted. \u201cThey\u2019ve already poached several of our top engineers, and now they\u2019re beating us to the market with products. We can\u2019t just sit by and let them do this. You know, back when I was at Bell Labs, we had a policy that\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cMy team,\u201d said Bobby, raising his palm to silence the group. Gregor glared at Niels across the room as Bobby counted aloud to five.Bobby opened his eyes. \u201cWhen a duck grows big, people forget about its webbed feet. They forget that it can swim.\u201dGregor tried to remember whether Bobby had used this aphorism before.Bobby waited another minute for someone to respond, but Gregor didn\u2019t seem to be the only one who was lost. No one said anything. Finally, Bobby sighed loudly.\u201cThe fundamental issue here is Galt,\u201d he said. \u201cOur engineers are leaving us for Galt because they think it\u2019s faster and more innovative. Just look at Arsyen.\u201dAll heads swiveled toward Arsyen, and the little man sunk lower in his chair.\u201cArsyen, look up again for us. Good. Do you all see that\u200a\u2014\u200athe fear in his eyes? Watching us, watching the Rovix team just now, he has clearly been asking himself why he is working at Anahata. Isn\u2019t that right, Arsyen?\u201dArsyen nodded vigorously.Gregor still wasn\u2019t convinced the guy was that remarkable, but at least Arsyen was smart enough to know to agree with Bobby. Bobby was always right in the long run.\u201cWe could add more of those organic juicers to each building?\u201d offered HR Paul. \u201cOr a pet hedgehog? Once you bond with them, you\u2019ll find it much harder to leave the company.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t about giving them more amenities,\u201d groaned Niels, rolling his eyes. \u201cOur engineers are spoiled enough as it is. You\u2019ll notice that none of the sales team has defected to Galt\u200a\u2014\u200adespite their recruiters trying to ambush my guys in the parking lots. It\u2019s because we run a tight ship in sales. We\u2019re not out there handing out free jet packs every day like engineering does. The only freebie I hand out is my book of master negotiator tips.\u201dNiels waved a shiny copy of the red manual he issued to all sales employees.\u201cThe reason you haven\u2019t lost many people to Galt is that sales will be the last to go,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cThe innovative minds go first. If ten percent of our sales workforce had gone to Galt\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of our engineering staff\u200a\u2014\u200awe wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation right now.\u201dNiels looked to HR Paul for support, but his colleague nodded in agreement with Gregor.Niels turned to Bobby.\u201cWe need to create more of a war mentality here. Wars are very productive for unity. Every Anahata employee should want nothing more than to kill Galt and rip their little startup hearts out. People need enemies. Enemies drive us forward.\u201dNiels scanned the room, stopping on Gregor. His eyes narrowed to lizard slits.\u201cWrong,\u201d said Gregor, not breaking Niels\u2019 gaze. \u201cBobby\u2019s point is that if we want to remain the world\u2019s most innovative company, we have to keep our engineers. And to do that, we have to be fast. We have to let the engineers work on exciting projects, and in an environment where they and their projects are isolated from the temptations of Galt.\u201d\u201cVery realistic,\u201d Niels said. \u201cLet\u2019s just put them on an island then. Get them some fruity cocktails.\u201dFischer and HR Paul chuckled at the far end of the table. Bobby picked at the flap of his sandal.\u201cAn island is obviously inappropriate. For one, fresh water would be an issue,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cBut rest assured we have a plan.\u201dGregor shifted in his chair to face Arsyen.\u201cSoon there will be no reason for you or any other engineer to ever want to leave Anahata.\u201dLegend had it that Bobby reserved his most important discussions for the bathroom because he was convinced that Galt had bugged all the Anahata meeting rooms.While an outsider might have thought it odd, Roni knew it was simply more evidence of the founder\u2019s cunning. He was sure Bobby chose the bathroom\u200a\u2014\u200awith its occasional disagreeable smells and sounds and the eventual, inevitable intrusion by an outsider\u200a\u2014\u200ato keep the length of any meeting to a minimum. This allowed him more time in his day to think of greater things. It was the mark of an exceptional leader.Roni often recalled his first and only bathroom meeting with Bobby. Eight other employees had been present, each jockeying for position. They all wanted to stand next to him, near the hand dryer, but Roni beat them to it. Although the meeting lasted just four minutes and Bobby uttered only one sentence, they were a very long four minutes, and it was one very important sentence.Ever since that day, Roni favored that same Building 3, southwest corner bathroom. Its gentle pale-blue walls and piped-in ocean sounds were the perfect setting for his daily hour-long meditation sessions.With the stall door closed and his patchouli candle lit, Roni would lean back on the heated Japanese toilet seat, press the soles of his Crocs against the wall, close his eyes, and insert his finger into his nose. The dry Northern California air lent itself to large, easily removable finds, particularly during the days when the region was hit by the Diablo winds.But today no amount of nostril exploration could ease the mild anxiety building within him.When Roni first started at Anahata, he was one of its superstars, leading a project to do real-time monitoring of all of the world\u2019s nuclear hazards. People on campus called him \u201cRadioactive Roni,\u201d and someone even organized a Chernobyl-themed party in his honor.He was now into his seventh year at Anahata. Roni was making a ton of money; all his needs were met. But he no longer felt a part of the in-crowd, privy to the hottest projects or latest internal gossip. He increasingly felt like the heart of the company was beating elsewhere. It was only a vague sense, but one akin to that of the young dragon slayer approaching the bridge, one careful step after another, the fog slowly clearing before him to reveal\u2026Was it because he had recently become a Republican?In any case, Roni was sure something was afoot. Gregor had recently installed biometric screening at the entrance to Building 1, and conversations between Building 1 employees abruptly stopped whenever Roni joined them at the company cafeteria.The funny thing was that if you asked most Anahatis, Roni had a dream job. He was the technical lead of Social Car, one of the hottest, most anticipated projects at the company. But Roni had been at Anahata long enough to know a quirky project from a crucial one. And Social Car just felt a bit too much like the former. Roni wondered if it was just a distraction\u200a\u2014\u200aa deft sleight of hand by Bobby to divert attention from the true gamble of something much, much bigger taking form in Building 1.He had made a few passes to uncover the truth. One of Roni\u2019s friends worked in Building 1. He had proved impenetrable to inquiry, claiming he was just \u201ctinkering with the ads algorithm.\u201d Gregor had likewise stonewalled him, mentioning something about Building 1\u2019s commitment to \u201cbreakthrough enterprise software products.\u201d Roni was enough of a Valley veteran to know that when an engineer feigned enthusiasm for business software, he was either lying about the software or lying about being an engineer. And that couldn\u2019t have been more true than with Gregor Guntlag, who was well known for his dislike of business, sales, and anything connected to advancing the dirty affairs of capitalism.So Roni had thrown himself into other projects alongside his work on Social Car. Most notably, he had become the organizer of the company\u2019s quarterly hackathons, designed to bring engineers together from across the company to detect bugs and fix core software. But while he enjoyed mentoring the younger engineers, Roni was beginning to feel like an aging school dance chaperon who furnished the pizza and Red Bull and hung out awkwardly at the back of the hall. What he was doing didn\u2019t feel tangible or significant.Roni sighed and pumped his Crocs against the door in a pitter patter of plastic. He sighed again, and then again and again, beginning to enjoy the sound of his breath echoing through the bathroom. He imagined an audience beyond the stall door, sitting on the blue tiles, crowding in to listen to his wise words about an important engineering topic.\u201cLet me tell you the truth about cloud computing,\u201d Roni said aloud in mock tenor. \u201cThere is no cloud. It is a myth. Your data is actually in my nose. Right above the\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dRoni stopped as he heard two voices outside the bathroom. The door opened, and Roni heard a shuffling of feet.\u201cHello? Is anyone here?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was vaguely familiar.\u201cAll clear,\u201d said another voice, the accent thick, like a knife trying to find its way out of taffy. Roni recognized its owner immediately: Gregor Guntlag.\u201cSo, like I was saying in the meeting,\u201d the first man said. \u201cLife extension. We aren\u2019t working on it, and I am certain Galt is doing it.\u201d\u201cWhich is why Project Y is so important,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about an issue we\u2019re having with\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cImagine,\u201d the first man said. \u201cIf Galt outlives us, just imagine what that means for the planet. They\u2019ll probably reduce all of us humans to tiny bugs!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure we could tackle it after we solved our Project Y\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cLife extension,\u201d repeated the first man. \u201cI want you to make me a plan to tackle life extension.\u201dRoni thought he heard Gregor sigh.\u201cWe can work on life extension,\u201d he said after a moment.\u201cAlso, I want to breed animals. Did you see that article this morning on Tech Geek? Galt is breeding small plants that will replace animals. Those bastards. We\u2019ll show them. We\u2019ll breed animals that will eat their plants!\u201d\u201cI suppose that could be better for the environment,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cLess carbon dioxide emissions\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll turn the animals back into plants!\u201d the first man said.\u201cI\u2019ll look into both,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cBut first, Project Y\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, yes, I wanted to talk to you about that. I have a new idea. Project Y needs an army. We will never beat Galt if we don\u2019t have an army supporting Y. Our employees must be an army. And then that army brings in more soldiers for an even bigger army.\u201d\u201cAn army?\u201d Gregor asked.\u201cA figurative army. No, wait, an army with weapons. No, the kind of army Gandhi would have had.\u201d\u201cBobby, I\u2019m not sure I understand.\u201dRoni\u2019s eyes popped.It was Bobby\u200a\u2014\u200aof course! Bobby was the only one in the company who could give Gregor orders; the only one who quoted Ghandhi and whose license plate read \u201cMAHATMA.\u201dRoni heard footsteps cross the bathroom, like someone was pacing.\u201cYes, yes, our peaceful army will be armed,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cBut its arms will be technology, and therefore not arms, but also arms.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t follow,\u201d Gregor said.Bobby sighed loudly, as if it was his eternal burden to explain himself. \u201cWhen we are ready to push the button on Project Y, we will need a group of engineers who will already be converts and will spread the word. And then, of course, we also need engineers like Jonas who will infiltrate the enemy\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dRoni\u2019s Crocs nearly dropped from their perch at the sound of his employee\u2019s name.Gregor replied, but one of them was now using the urinal and Roni couldn\u2019t make out the words. He leaned forward in his seat, careful to keep his feet suspended against the door. There were more unintelligible words. A urinal was flushed. Something knocked against something else. An object fell to the ground. The drama! What next? He heard the faucets running, footsteps exiting, and the door closing. Roni was alone again.Roni\u2019s mind raced across and above and behind itself, the idea of a mysterious Project Y bolting about in his head, ricocheting off his skull, toward his ear, past Jonas\u2019 name. But no matter how he fit the bits together, he couldn\u2019t make sense of it.He started over. There was something called Project Y\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe that was the secret thing happening in Building 1. Project Y needed to build an army. And they needed people like Jonas to infiltrate \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Why didn\u2019t they want Roni? Roni had a black belt in karate. It was from when he was twelve, but still.They couldn\u2019t know that he was on to them. Roni stood on the toilet seat and used his Swiss army knife to quickly loosen the bolts on the ventilator above his stall. Stepping onto the toilet tank, he lifted himself into the air shaft and onto his belly. He began to shimmy his way forward in the darkness. Roni had done this once before\u200a\u2014\u200amany years earlier, when he misinterpreted his manager\u2019s instructions to build a product in \u201cstealth mode.\u201d He knew this shaft would eventually take him to the building\u2019s northern corner, where he could safely drop down through another bathroom.The metal shaft felt cool against his stomach, and Roni moved through it with greater ease than he had remembered. All the apocalypse survival training he had been doing during the weekends was paying off.But Roni was on edge. He could feel his fingers tingling, hear his heart pumping in the stifling air around him. Project Y was so close! And yet he had nothing but a trail of vague clues. He was following a thread through the dark labyrinth, the derisive laugh of his elusive dragon echoing through the air shafts.Arsyen burst into the cubicle, eager to tell Sven and Jonas all about his encounter with the famous Bobby Bonilo. But his co-workers faced their screens in silence. The only acknowledgment of his presence was an open can atop the Red Bull pyramid, which rattled left and right, then plummeted toward the carpet.\u201cHello, hello!\u201d boomed a voice from the corridor.Roni entered the cubicle and made a beeline for the whiteboard. He grabbed an eraser and began wiping away the graffiti. Arsyen breathed a sigh of relief; finally, they were going to clean.Instead, Roni motioned for Arsyen to approach.\u201cI want to tell you about our super-duper top-secret project.\u201dA few years earlier, Anahata unveiled a driverless car that drove itself while the passenger sat, hands free, in the front or back seat. The project gained tons of attention in the press, and even Arsyen had heard of it. But he didn\u2019t understand the excitement. His father had invented an equally effective driverless car decades ago in Pyrrhia\u200a\u2014\u200aroyal chariots, entirely voice activated, that traveled on the backs of a pack of corgis imported from England.Roni said their team had been assigned the next stage of the driverless car project. It was called \u201cSocial Car,\u201d internal code name: \u201cPad Thai.\u201dWhile the passenger relaxed in the car, enjoying a stress-free commute, a console would announce who was sitting in the nearby vehicles. Profile photos of the other passengers would pop up, along with additional information like profession and gender. Passengers could also easily chat and message each other directly through the console.In short, Anahata was making the car journey a social experience.\u201cOr as Bobby has put it,\u201d Roni said, \u201cwe\u2019re improving humankind by eliminating loneliness.\u201dArsyen wanted to ask why someone wouldn\u2019t prefer to just wait to talk to other people at their destination, but he decided that was one of those stupid questions Jennie had warned him not to ask. After all, why would the team build something that wasn\u2019t needed?What worried him more was just how a sanitation engineer fit into the project. From the way Roni described it, Arsyen didn\u2019t see any janitorial work needed for Social Car\u200a\u2014\u200aunless, that is, he was supposed to clean the cars before they launched.\u201cRoni, what do I clean here?\u201d\u201cWell, the real dirty work is for them,\u201d said Roni, nodding in the direction of Sven and Jonas. \u201cAs you know, being a P.M. is more about leading than doing. Your role is mainly to keep things organized, keep everyone focused, and lead the final polishing of the product. You know, the same stuff you did at Galt. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take the lead for now, until you have the hang of things.\u201dSven and Jonas scooted their chairs toward the whiteboard. Arsyen noted the computers on their laps and followed their lead, but the machine balancing on his thighs felt less like a work accessory than the physical weight of his doubt. Roni had said he would be polishing Social Car, but Arsyen had yet to spot a single microfiber cloth or tub of wax. And what was this P.M. title Roni kept referring to\u200a\u2014\u200apoop manager? Arsyen would draw the line at poop; there were some things a prince should never, ever do.Roni cleared his throat.\u201cOkay, guys, to recap: Car A detects someone in Car B. But Car B is traveling at a faster rate than Car A. Do we have Car A automatically speed up\u200a\u2014\u200aall within say ten miles per hour of the speed limit\u200a\u2014\u200aso it can keep pace and the Car A and B passengers can speak to each other? We\u2019re more likely to have people interacting if their cars can keep pace.\u201dArsyen frowned. Why were his co-workers talking about car speeds?\u201cBut what if Car B is speeding? And Car A speeds up but then ends up with a speeding ticket?\u201d asked Sven. \u201cThat would be bad, unless\u2026\u201d His eyes drifted away from the whiteboard, then snapped back. \u201cUnless, that is, the person in Car B is a woman and she turns out to be really hot. Then, if I\u2019m in Car A, I wouldn\u2019t be so angry about the speeding ticket.\u201d\u201cAll you care about are girls,\u201d Jonas groaned.\u201cYou laugh, but just you wait till puberty hits. Then that\u2019ll be all you\u2019ll think about.\u201d\u201cImpossible. I am very capable of processing many things simultaneously.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Roni was saying, \u201cwe just make sure that when your car speeds up, it never goes beyond ten miles per hour above the speed limit. That way, you shouldn\u2019t get a ticket.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care about that,\u201d said Sven, shaking his head. \u201cWhat I mean is the real problem is how to decide whether the Car B passenger is actually attractive enough for Car A to risk the speeding ticket.\u201d\u201cAh, got it, got it,\u201d said Roni, turning to the whiteboard and writing \u201cAttraction Index.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll need to work that into the algorithm, but that shouldn\u2019t be hard. We take your profile information, and from your height, weight, and so on, we assign you a wellness score. And then we combine that score with an attractiveness score that will use your photo, measured against the Symmetry Enhancement project.\u201dRoni turned to face the group, and Arsyen noticed an inkspot the size of a baby\u2019s fist quickly spreading across his shirt pocket. Roni\u2019s white shirt was going to be ruined. Arsyen signaled with his hand.\u201cOh, sorry, Arsyen, I should have explained. Symmetry Enhancement is a project we have to make all images on the web look better. That way, the world just looks nicer to people. We mainly use it for low-resolution images\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cAnd porn,\u201d said Sven, turning to Arsyen. \u201cDid you know that most women\u2019s breasts aren\u2019t symmetrical? Our tool fixes that.\u201dRoni\u2019s face flushed, but he pressed on. \u201cBut the cool thing is you can also use Symmetry Enhancement on people\u2019s faces. We can calculate how symmetrical your face is, then make adjustments to give it better symmetry. For Social Car, we wouldn\u2019t redo your entire face, but we could just do the first part of calculating symmetry, since it\u2019s a proxy for attractiveness. That would feed into the algorithm and determine whether the person in the other car is worth the risk associated with speeding. So, if the person is significantly uglier than you, then your car slows down and tries to match up with a new car. But if the person is on par or better looking, then it\u2019s all systems go.\u201d\u201cWe could eventually monetize the symmetry feature,\u201d said Jonas, without looking up from his computer. \u201cFor example, we could make you more attractive to other passengers if you paid to have your image adjusted.\u201dRoni stiffened. \u201cJonas, let\u2019s not talk about money. Our goal is to build a great product for our users.\u201dArsyen was catching bits and pieces of his colleagues\u2019 words, but nothing made much sense. Meanwhile, Roni\u2019s stain was pushing into new territory, now working its way toward his armpit. But he seemed totally unaware, or if he was aware, he simply didn\u2019t care, his hands jumping about as he got increasingly excited about the conversation.\u201cWe combine all these factors\u200a\u2014\u200ayour attractiveness, your healthiness, and so forth\u200a\u2014\u200aand we create a matching algorithm that puts your car in touch with the people you want to meet\u200a\u2014\u200athe people you don\u2019t mind getting a speeding ticket for.\u201d Roni paused. \u201cI guess that means ugly and unhealthy people won\u2019t get to talk to anyone, but maybe that\u2019s a good thing for society in the long run?\u201dRoni turned and made a few new marks on the whiteboard, his various lines and symbols now abutting his crude car drawings like primitive weapons.Arsyen placed his fingers on his temples and moved them in slow circles, closing his eyes and then reopening them. The black hole on Roni\u2019s shirt gaped at Arsyen like the mouth of a hungry Pyrrhian orphan. Save me, Arsyen!\u201cMake them all disappear,\u201d he whispered in Pyrrhian. \u201cMake them disappear.\u201dIt was a chant that had always proven effective in Pyrrhia. Servants and peasants alike vanished whenever Arsyen issued the command.He opened his eyes. The problem was still there; dashes and numbers on the board seemed to be converging. And Roni was still talking nonsense.\u201cLuckily we have our new product manager here\u2026Arsyen? Arsyen?\u201dRoni was pointing a whiteboard marker in Arsyen\u2019s direction.\u201cArsyen, why don\u2019t you give us a P.M.\u2019s opinion on all this?\u201dProduct manager. So that\u2019s what a P.M. was.Arsyen had heard the title before. There had been product managers at Galt; they worked with the engineers but were somehow different. They seemed to dress slightly better and shower more often than the engineers but were considered less intelligent.That was about all he knew\u200a\u2014\u200athat, and the fact that he clearly wasn\u2019t a product manager himself. Which meant someone had made a mistake. A big mistake.They had given him the wrong job.It all suddenly made sense\u200a\u2014\u200athe coding test at his interview, the salary that was ten times what he had originally been quoted, the total lack of cleaning supplies in his cubicle.Arsyen\u2019s gaze shifted to Roni\u2019s eager face, crossed over to the gibberish-filled whiteboard, then to the skeptical faces of his two co-workers, who had spent the entire day hypnotized by their dark screens. They were both incredibly pale, like their faces had never seen the sun. Because, of course\u200a\u2014\u200athey were engineers. And he was their product manager. The person who managed the product.They were going to figure it out and fire him. And if he was fired, he would lose everything\u200a\u2014\u200athe chance to feed all of those hungry Pyrrhian orphans, the chance to liberate his country from tyranny, the chance to speak to his girlfriend without the aid of an internet chat application. And he would be back to cleaning toilets in some startup filled with malodorous men.There was no other solution\u200a\u2014\u200ahe would just have to fake it. Besides, how hard could it be to be a product manager? For decades, Arsyen had watched his father manage a country; he could certainly manage a bunch of talking cars.Arsyen sat up tall.\u201cBe clear on problem,\u201d he said.\u201cRight, right, I should be more specific,\u201d Roni nodded. He pointed at his drawing of Car A.\u201cAt this point, my car has detected a cute woman around me. So, my car is going to speed up or slow down to keep pace so that I can talk to her.\u201d\u201cWhat if woman don\u2019t want to be found?\u201d Arsyen asked. He couldn\u2019t imagine having such a problem himself, but not all men had his charm.\u201cYou\u2019re right, we should consider edge cases,\u201d Roni said. \u201cBut realistically, what\u2019s not to like about this? After all, women love attention.\u201d\u201cWe should consider edge cases,\u201d repeated Arsyen, not seeing any edge or cases but certain that in this world, as in most, repetition served as effective flattery.\u201cLet\u2019s ask women what they think after the beta launch,\u201d Roni said. \u201cIt would take too much time to do it now, and anyway, there\u2019s an increasing body of legit scientific research that demonstrates that women don\u2019t ever know what they want. Sound good?\u201dArsyen nodded calmly, but inside he was anything but.\u201cExcuse me, bathroom!\u201d he shouted, and leaped up from his seat, dashing into the men\u2019s room across the hall.He locked himself in one of the stalls and pulled out his phone.Arsyen looked up \u201cproduct manager\u201d on the internet and, after a few minutes of reading, felt his confidence return.There was really no reason to worry. Product managers were apparently in charge of the big picture, deciding why a product was needed, what it would be, and how the company could bring it to life. As one blog post put it:As a product manager, you are tasked with leading a team and bringing an idea to life. You are the visionary who must direct not just engineers but also marketers, sales teams, lawyers, and others. You are a mini-CEO, the ruler of your product!\u201cJust like king!\u201d Arsyen shouted to the empty stalls.Of course, there is one important difference: You have no direct authority over anyone, and you must lead through influence.\u201cHmmph, more like queen,\u201d Arsyen grumbled. But then he reconsidered: Other than the receptionists, he had yet to meet any women at Anahata. He probably didn\u2019t need to worry about being treated like one of them.Arsyen skimmed a few more blogs, trying to memorize the P.M.\u2019s language\u200a\u2014\u200awords like \u201caction items,\u201d \u201cB2B solutions,\u201d and \u201cuse cases,\u201d and then something mystic called a \u201croadmap,\u201d which as far as Arsyen could tell had little to do with either roads or maps. There was an even greater obsession with \u201calignment,\u201d a concept Arsyen struggled with as his translation app told him that the equivalent word in Pyrrhian was pokaya, meaning to place the chicken coop parallel to one\u2019s home.Suddenly there was a banging on the stall door.\u201cArsyen? You in there?\u201dIt was Sven.\u201cListen, you\u2019ve been in there long enough. Only senior engineers get to work in the bathroom. Roni has some sort of roadmap question for you, so come on back.\u201dArsyen washed his hands and returned to the cubicle, armed with his new vocabulary.When Roni asked Arsyen about prioritization, Arsyen asked, \u201cIs this on the roadmap?\u201dWhen Sven suggested adding images of attractive women to the car dashboard, Arsyen rubbed his chin.\u201cDoes this align with our strategy?\u201dWhen all three looked to him for an opinion in how best to implement Symmetry Enhancement, Arsyen stood and put his hands on his hips.\u201cDoes this align with the strategy on our roadmap?\u201dNo one seemed to notice anything was amiss. If anything, it seemed like product managers just asked questions that other people had to answer.\u201cGood brainstorm, everyone. Let\u2019s break for lunch,\u201d Roni said. \u201cOh, and Arsyen, this is still very confidential, so let\u2019s get this whiteboard cleaned off.\u201dArsyen jumped up and began to wipe the whiteboard clean as Sven and Jonas scooted their chairs back to their desks. Arsyen was pleased that product managers seemed to have some janitorial tasks in their role. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t be such a stretch after all.The food in Fried Fred\u2019s glistened with the shine of oil, and neon signs blinked to a loud techno beat, suggesting an urgent need to consume the dishes on offer. The Mexican stand, the Chinese buffet, even the salad bar\u200a\u2014\u200athey all smelled of hot lard. Next to the soda dispenser, a robot butler plucked samples from a six-foot-high pyramid of calamari, popping one into Arsyen\u2019s mouth as he walked past.\u201cSo, Arsyennnn,\u201d drawled Sven as they sat down, \u201ctell us about yourself. Like, what are your favorite languages?\u201d\u201cWell, Pyrrhian, of course. But my English not so good.\u201d\u201cHa, ha, very funny. I mean computing languages. You like PHP? What about Ruby?\u201d\u201cRuby? Like diamond?\u201dSven wrinkled his nose. \u201cIt is not like Diamond,\u201d he said, turning to Jonas. \u201cI bet this guy likes low-level languages. He likes to do his own garbage collection.\u201d\u201cI do not!\u201d Arsyen snapped, and then mumbled, \u201cI mean, I do collect my garbage\u2026here in America.\u201d\u201cAll right then, which did you learn first, Linux or Windows?\u201dArsyen paused. Windows were clear, transparent, and easy to clean. A Linux was\u2026well, he didn\u2019t know. But in this game of one-upmanship, surely the more unfamiliar thing was the most impressive. Much like operating some types of carpet cleaners, operating a Linux was probably a skill that once mastered was then lorded over everyone else.\u201cLinux,\u201d guessed Arsyen.\u201cCorrect,\u201d Sven said. He elbowed Jonas next to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to ask him something?\u201dJonas lifted his head and glanced at Arsyen without speaking. Arsyen began to count the number of pimples scattered across his cheeks. He got to about twenty before Jonas opened his mouth.\u201cWhat about your first video game?\u201d he asked.Arsyen grinned. Finally they were speaking his language.\u201cLeague of Legends II,\u201d he said proudly.His co-workers leaned forward, studying Arsyen like a rare animal.\u201cBut Arsyen,\u201d said Jonas, \u201cif I recall correctly\u200a\u2014\u200aand I always do\u200a\u2014\u200aLeague of Legends II was only released a few years ago. That means you did not commence playing video games until relatively recently.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026disturbing,\u201d Sven said.\u201cGrowing up in Embria, we did not have any electricity in our house,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cBut from the start, even I knew the importance of Nintendo, Myst, and the various castles and caverns where a princess could be hidden.\u201d\u201cBut I love video games,\u201d protested Arsyen, feeling his face burn.\u201cThe point is, you came to gaming very late in life\u200a\u2014\u200ayou never learned the fundamentals,\u201d said Sven, wagging his finger.\u201cMy father helped me pick the locks of rich people\u2019s houses so that I could play their game systems,\u201d said Jonas, his eyes watering. \u201cWe were caught, and they cut off his hand.\u201d\u201cYou see?!?\u201d Sven said. \u201cPeople like Jonas\u2019 dad almost died so that their sons could have a better future, all while you were out playing hopscotch or some other primitive offline game. You have no sense of history or sacrifice!\u201d\u201cBut I love video games,\u201d Arsyen repeated.\u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d Sven shook his head. \u201cBy the time League of Legends came around, the world had completely changed. Video games had ceased being platformers. Techno was birthing thousands of deformed children in Europe. In some parts of the world, people were already learning to text, and their thumbs were growing ganglia. People\u2019s brains had begun to function differently! You clearly came of age in a different world\u200a\u2014\u200aone that doesn\u2019t know latency or patience.\u201d\u201cI am disappointed by this conversation and am done speaking for now,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cPlease carry on by yourselves.\u201dHe stabbed his fork into his pile of noodles, then began twirling them with great concentration.Arsyen felt as though he himself were in a video game, his life meter, a flashing red heart, beeping at low levels as he desperately searched for a wizard or magic plant to replenish his strength.He silently cursed his mother. As a child, Arsyen repeatedly asked her for a video game console, but she refused, claiming the nobility should focus on croquet, not cartoons dancing across a screen. She was lucky the king hadn\u2019t allowed Arsyen to send her to the dungeon.Arsyen breathed deeply and closed his eyes, willing his heartbeat to slow. If he could just keep his P.M. job long enough to become a permanent employee, he could eventually have his army behead Sven and Jonas.Arsyen lingered over the image of a guillotine snapping Jonas\u2019 neck until he felt his pulse steady. He opened his eyes. His co-workers were staring at him, expecting something. Arsyen needed to redirect the conversation\u200a\u2014\u200amake them do the talking rather than him. He turned toward Sven, who was clearly an easier target than Jonas.\u201cRoni says you have startup project?\u201dSven brightened and reached for a fry on Arsyen\u2019s plate. \u201cTwo, actually. The first is called Fingerbell. It\u2019s like a dumbbell, but on your mobile phone. You try to move an animated weight up the screen by using one finger. With each level, the resistance increases and it gets harder to move the weight.\u201d\u201cBut why\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cBecause there\u2019s a real obesity problem in this country these days. Fingerbell is about revolutionizing exercise\u200a\u2014\u200astarting with your fingers.\u201d\u201cHow it make money?\u201dSven threw up his hands. \u201cWhat world do you live in, Arsyen? Jonas, are you listening to this?\u201dJonas ignored them. He now seemed preoccupied with separating his noodles into individual pods on his plate.\u201cHere\u2019s how it works,\u201d said Sven, leaning in. \u201cAll you have to do is come up with an idea for a startup, build it, and get users. The important thing is that your users are growing\u200a\u2014\u200aeven better if you can tell everyone your growth is exponential.\u201d\u201cIt is rare that anything is truly exponential,\u201d said Jonas, suddenly looking up. \u201cMost growth is linear, but then most people are stupid.\u201d He lowered his head again.\u201cNext,\u201d said Sven, \u201ca venture capitalist sees all this growth and they start doling out cash like it\u2019s candy. You get rich before you\u2019ve even proven your product can make money. Then a big company like Anahata comes along and buys your startup. Sometimes it\u2019s just to acquire your employees\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can make millions of dollars if you just tell people you employ experts in A.I. and machine learning. Computer security, biohacking, and micro-algae are also good areas. Worse comes to worst, you just tell people you\u2019re making robots\u200a\u2014\u200athere isn\u2019t a single CEO in the Valley who doesn\u2019t get a hard-on over robots.\u201cNow, if you\u2019re really lucky, the company isn\u2019t after your employees but your actual product. They want to buy it so they can kill it and keep you from competing with them. That\u2019s where you really get into the big money. And, yeah, it kind of sucks that all your hard work and years of no sleep and sex will be destroyed, but hey, you\u2019re rich now, and you can go and invest money in things you really care about, like food security cameras or currency for sea animals or\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cBikek,\u201d said Jonas, looking up. \u201cBikek is the capital of Embria. It has a temperate climate, and in its surrounding mountains one can grow delicious apples in the winter. Embria boasts a modern railway system, as well as three national highways and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cNo one wants to hear about the transportation system in your obscure country,\u201d said Sven, rolling his eyes.Jonas scowled, but Arsyen saw an opportunity to score a point with his co-worker.\u201cYour English good, Jonas,\u201d said Arsyen, trying out his Magnanimous Leader smile.Jonas nodded, his eyes lifting slightly from his tray.\u201cHis English gets better each day,\u201d Sven said. \u201cIt\u2019s like training a machine learning model. Correct him once and he doesn\u2019t repeat the mistake.\u201d\u201cThat is the goal,\u201d Jonas said.\u201cYou come to America for school?\u201d Arsyen asked.Jonas shook his head, his eyes still fixed on his tray.\u201cThere is a video about it online,\u201d interjected Sven. \u201cBasically, Jonas was like a mad-scientist teenager genius working out of his parents\u2019 apartment. He built a computer by looking at the stars and calculating from the astrological patterns how he could construct a mainframe.\u201d\u201cSven\u2026,\u201d began Jonas, lifting his head.\u201cAnd then there was a documentary filmmaker from the BBC who happened to be in town filming the plight of some rare yak in Bikek. He was staying at the hotel across the street on the day Jonas hooked his computer up and started a fire that nearly burned down his apartment building. Overnight, Jonas became the most famous boy in Embria, and Anahata, which has its Progressa program\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cProgressa?\u201d asked Arsyen.\u201cProgressa brings technology to poor people like Jonas,\u201d said Sven. \u201cThey are begging for food and water, and Progressa shows up with a computer and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cThat is incorrect,\u201d Jonas said. He turned toward Arsyen. \u201cProgressa is the philanthropic branch of Anahata, designed to tackle the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian problems.\u201d\u201cAnd so young Jonas got on a boat\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d began Sven.\u201cAn airplane, actually.\u201d\u201cAn airplane, and came to the United States of America. Where loving Anahata taught him to program.\u201d\u201cWe will not discuss my situation further,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cArsyen, I suggest you ask about Sven\u2019s other startup idea if your hope is to have a conversation.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Sven said. \u201cThis one\u2019s almost as good as Fingerbell. It\u2019s gonna make me rich.\u201dHe pulled out his mobile phone.\u201cI wanted to solve a problem that all of us have: getting rid of things we don\u2019t want to do. Like, what\u2019s one thing you wish someone else could do for you?\u201d\u201cKill evil ruler of my country.\u201d\u201cRiiiight,\u201d Sven said. \u201cMaybe something a bit more day-to-day?\u201d\u201cMy laundry?\u201d Arsyen offered.\u201cGreat,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNow what if I told you I could make that problem disappear with one simple app?\u201dWith an abracadabra flourish of the hand, Sven tapped a button on his phone. The word \u201cDogtown\u201d emerged, written in light blue across a black background. Underneath, a cartoon dog with a bone in its mouth looked out lovingly from the screen, its tail wagging back and forth.\u201cWe all have problems we don\u2019t want to deal with ourselves\u200a\u2014\u200alike laundry. So what I\u2019ve done is create an app that helps you outsource everything. You list your problem and then send it out into the Dogtown community. Whatever dog\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s what I call our members\u200a\u2014\u200awants to do the task, he responds to \u2018fetch\u2019 it for you, and you work out the details. Then you pay him in dog food.\u201d\u201cDog food?\u201d\u201cWell, money. On the app, money is called \u2018dog food.\u2019\u201dArsyen liked the idea of outsourcing his battle to reclaim Pyrrhia. Someone else could just go off and do it for him, leaving Arsyen to play video games and hang out in California until Pyrrhia was ready for him. The laundry scenario, however, seemed complicated.\u201cSo, someone come to my apartment, wash my clothes, wait while clothes dry\u2026seem easier for me to do.\u201d\u201cYou just need to embrace the concept of outsourcing your life,\u201d Sven said. \u201cThere may be a few people in your house, but once you accept that they are there to perform a function that ultimately benefits you, they are just there\u200a\u2014\u200alike moving furniture. I mean, I just used Dogtown a few hours ago, right Jonas?\u201dSven waved a fry below Jonas\u2019 nose, and the teenager looked up.\u201cThis morning, Jonas was slurping his Red Bull so loudly I could hear it through my headphones. So I sent out a call on Dogtown to ask someone to take care of it for me. A guy in San Francisco saw my request, I gave him Jonas\u2019 email address, and the guy emailed him telling him to shut up. Worked like a charm.\u201d\u201cBut he sit next to you. You can just tell him or send him email,\u201d Arsyen said.\u201cI consider myself a pacifist. I don\u2019t like conflict.\u201dArsyen nodded but didn\u2019t really understand. Conflict in the janitor community was always solved through direct conversation. And sometimes mop fights. But never through an app. What kind of person would think it was better to argue over the internet rather than speak directly?\u201cBy receiving an email, I was able to process the information quickly and stop slurping,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cIf Sven had stopped my work to speak with me, I would have found it quite disrupted.\u201d\u201cDisruptive,\u201d Sven corrected.\u201cDisruptive,\u201d Jonas repeated. \u201cTechnology is disruptive, but I, Jonas, do not like to be disrupted.\u201d\u201cVery good,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNow if we can just tell that brainiac processing center of yours to incorporate some contractions into your English, it will be flawless.\u201d\u201cWe have discussed this previously,\u201d Jonas sighed. \u201cContractions are not elegant. Moreover, many times they are grammatically incorrect. I will not have my speech sullied by\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d Jonas\u2019 eyes caught sight of something in the distance.\u201cHe is here,\u201d Jonas whispered.Sven turned and gasped. \u201cWhat do you think he will eat?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Arsyen asked.\u201cBobby Bonilo,\u201d they answered in unison.Arsyen scanned the entrance and quickly pinpointed the object of their attention, not because the figure was remarkable or distinguished in any way, but rather because the effect of the man\u2019s presence was universal. The cafeteria fell silent. Those waiting at the stands of Fried Fred\u2019s pushed themselves against the buffet rails to allow ample room for the man to pass. Mouths froze in mid-sentence. Hamburgers were forgotten on their plates.It was the second time that day Arsyen found himself in the presence of Anahata\u2019s elusive founder.Bobby stopped at the Mexican food stand and surveyed its offerings. He dipped a finger into the guacamole bowl, and the chefs held their breath, waiting for his verdict. Showing no reaction, he then continued on to the sushi bar, then the Asian fusion stand, at one point looking as though he was set to take a dumpling. Then he abruptly turned on his heel and walked three steps to the salad bar. Arsyen could hear Jonas\u2019 legs shaking under the table.Bobby circled the salad bar once clockwise, then stopped and changed direction. Finally, he picked up a bagel, nodded as though in communication with the tub of cream cheese in the buffet, and glided out of Fried Fred\u2019s.As soon as the door closed behind him, the cafeteria exploded in sound.\u201cWow, do you know who that was?\u201d Sven asked Arsyen.Arsyen nodded.Frankly, he didn\u2019t get the fuss. Sure, Bobby Bonilo\u2019s story was impressive\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had started Anahata from his college dorm, convinced a rich guy to invest in his idea, and, a few years later, became a trillionaire. But Bobby\u2019s physical appearance was utterly ordinary, with a pale, slightly puffy face falling into a neck that connected to the gently disintegrating body of a man approaching middle age. He looked nothing like the pictures Arsyen had seen in magazines. There, Bobby\u2019s chiseled face seemed straight out of a cologne ad. He was always dressed in white T-shirts that showed off massive biceps, and in more than one article, a small glow circling the top of his brown, curly hair gave the impression of a celestial aura.\u201cEveryone so quiet. Do people not talk to him?\u201d Arsyen asked.\u201cWell, you can talk to him. But he speaks in puzzles,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNot everyone is capable of understanding him. So, if you\u2019re going to talk to him, you just better make sure that what you have to say is really, really smart. Like the smartest thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d\u201cBobby is Anahata,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cHe created it, built it, runs it. He is a genius. And seeing him here is a momentous occasion. Most of the time he is in Building 1. That is the locked building. It is said, \u2018No one goes in, and no one comes out.\u2019\u201d\u201cThough of course they do,\u201d Sven jumped in. \u201cBut it\u2019s really only the senior engineers that are allowed in there. I heard Bobby decided to get rid of all the chairs and desks in Building 1. He said they stopped people from thinking. So everyone works standing up, roaming about and having their thoughts collide in the hallways. It\u2019s supposed to encourage innovation and collaboration. And phones\u200a\u2014\u200athere are desk phones\u200a\u2014\u200athough of course they are placed on the floor since there are supposedly no desks. Bobby apparently had them installed to encourage people to speak to each other.\u201d\u201cI heard that all responses to questions in Building 1 have to start with \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d Jonas added. \u201cYou are not permitted to say no unless you have said yes first, because Bobby believes that if you start from believing things are not possible, nothing will ever be achieved.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one of the ten Anahata commandments,\u201d Sven said. \u201cThey\u2019re like the company\u2019s guiding principles. One of them is to always start with the word \u2018yes.\u2019 And the rest, well, there is one about speed, and another about innovation\u2026and putting our users first\u2026oh, and changing the world. We must improve humankind!\u201d\u201cHumankind?\u201d Arsyen didn\u2019t recognize the word. Did Anahata want to make humans be kinder to each other? That sounded like something a silly communist would dream up.\u201cBobby believes that with every product, we should be able to ask ourselves what serious world problem we are solving.\u201dArsyen immediately thought of Moodify and the scores of Anahata products that largely just seemed to exist to waste time and have fun.\u201cReally? Every product must solve world problem?\u201d he asked.Jonas shrugged. \u201cThat is for the marketing and PR team to figure out. We build the product, and then they communicate to the public how it improves humankind. So, for example, Anahata\u2019s search engine\u2026\u201d\u201cIs democratizing knowledge,\u201d Sven filled in.\u201cAnd Anahata ads\u2026\u201d\u201cAre enabling opportunity for small businesses.\u201d\u201cAnahata Maps\u2026\u201d\u201cAre making it possible for poor children like Jonas, who have no access to food or clothing, to discover faraway places on the internet.\u201dThe men bussed their plates. Outside, the sun was blinding. Arsyen, temporarily disoriented, veered to the left.\u201cOh, Arsyen,\u201d said Sven in a singsong. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go there if I were you.\u201dArsyen turned. The path to his left looked exactly the same as the path to his right.\u201cGoing left is always a bad idea,\u201d Jonas said.\u201cBut what if I come from\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201c\u201cNever ask questions the rest of us know the answer to,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cSuch inquiries are a sign of weakness unless employed as rhetorical devices, or if, in their pointed framing, they are designed to undercut one\u2019s interlocutor.\u201d\u201cStay close to us, and remember to keep that red badge hidden,\u201d Sven said. \u201cJust for this week, of course. No one gets fired after the first week. It\u2019s, like, too mean to fire people after they\u2019ve worked here for a week.\u201d\u201cYes, Sven and I might form an emotional attachment to you by then, and it might hinder our productivity for us to lose a team member,\u201d Jonas said.He paused, then took a step toward Arsyen.\u201cTo be clear, that attachment has not yet formed.\u201d\u201cPlus,\u201d Sven added, \u201cyou could steal all of our secrets and take them to a competitor like Galt. Anahata will do anything to keep you from going to Galt.\u201d\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d Jonas added, \u201cdo not go anywhere without us. You are safe while you are with us. That is, unless we choose to fire you.\u201dRoni found himself staring dumbfounded once again at the hairy little man before him. For the past three days, Arsyen had been talking about sponges, complaining about the brand they stocked in the micro-kitchen. \u201cAnahata should disrupt sponges,\u201d he was saying. \u201cAlign sponges with roadmap.\u201dIt was typical product manager speak\u200a\u2014\u200abig vision statements with little understanding of the technical difficulties. Did Arsyen know just how complex modern sponges had become over the past twenty years?Whenever Arsyen spoke, Roni just nodded in response. As a technical lead, it was his job to let product managers like Arsyen think he cared about their opinions. Still, Arsyen\u2019s opinions often seemed particularly random and difficult to endorse.\u201cI make manifesto,\u201d Arsyen announced to the team that morning. \u201cAs good P.M., I know manifesto key to successful product.\u201dHe began to read aloud.Social Car is Anahata technology to eliminate loneliness. Every day we drive somewhere thinking we go somewhere. But really, we go nowhere, because part of journey is lost to us all. That is human part.By using latest cutting-edge innovation technology, combined with old social networking, Social Car connect you to people in other cars. Thanks to Social Car, you make conversation with them and begin lifelong friendship. Because relationship is in cloud, you do not have to worry about catching sex disease or awkward moment where you realize other person is missing arm. The person is real and not real, like your journey, like life.Roni\u2019s brain started to spin. This Arsyen was such a mystery. He spent half his time in the bathroom, and when he did materialize, you couldn\u2019t be sure whether you were about to hear the stupidest or most brilliant idea of all time. One moment he was suggesting they attach mops to the wheels of Social Car in order to clean the road while driving, and the next moment he was busting out an amazing product manifesto. It reminded Roni of his first day on the job at Anahata, when Bobby smoked pot with him and the other NASA recruits, dropping some crazy science on them all about unicorns and space elevators. Both sounded totally stupid until you realized Bobby was a genius.Perhaps Arsyen was also a genius.If he was, that helped Roni, too: Managing a genius was always a good career move.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty deep,\u201d Roni said to Arsyen. \u201cLife is like an empty journey unless you have Social Car. It really makes you realize how our technology is changing humankind for the better.\u201d\u201cI had never thought of the one-armed-person use case before,\u201d Sven said.\u201cIt is statistically very unlikely that you will meet a one-armed person while driving,\u201d Jonas said.\u201cMaybe in the past, smartass,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNow that cars don\u2019t need drivers, you may see a whole bunch of armless and legless people out on the road.\u201d\u201cBut there should also be fewer armless people on the planet since driverless cars are safer. Car accidents cause 8.18 percent of armlessness in the United States,\u201d Jonas said.\u201cBut\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cGuys, guys, let\u2019s stay focused,\u201d Roni said.\u201cI also have other idea,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cI think about your problem\u200a\u2014\u200aclassic product management problem. I see problem many times in B2B solutions. I give you example from Pyrrhia social media roadmap. Sometimes when we in countryside, I have boys wash my car. But they lazy. They throw soap on car and then put water on car. But the car not shiny. It because they didn\u2019t start at beginning\u200a\u2014\u200awith water, in the cloud. I tell them, \u2018Wash car first or I feed you to dogs,\u2019 and finally they do it right. It\u2019s like\u2026software as a service for internet of things.\u201dRoni frowned. Arsyen\u2019s brain was moving too fast for him.Arsyen turned to the whiteboard and drew a rough sketch of two cars.\u201cYou all talk about what happen with Social Car when you on the road,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cBut what about before you get in car? Start at beginning of problem\u200a\u2014\u200anot in middle like little Pyrrhian boys. Social Car can tell me who around me now. But what if I can tell Social Car who I want to meet when I first get in car?\u201d\u201cYou mean, program it to take you to an address or someone\u2019s house?\u201d Sven asked. \u201cWelcome to the modern world, Arsyen. Cars already have that. It\u2019s called a GPS.\u201d\u201cNo, this not about taking you to friend\u2019s house. It for people and places you don\u2019t know. So you have your app and want to meet other engineers. Well, Social Car take you to Star Trek convention. Or say you want to pitch businessman on your startup. Social Car take you to hotel bar or fancy-person strip club. Then, once cars close together, you can begin conversation with your target.\u201d\u201cI see, I see, so it\u2019s a more targeted way to meet new people. Kinda like a business networking tool?\u201d Roni asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Arsyen nodded. \u201cBusiness networking tool\u2026in the cloud. Social. B2B. Alignment.\u201d\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d said Jonas, looking up from his computer. \u201cYou are not describing a business networking tool. This is what one would call a hookup app.\u201dRoni studied the drawing on the whiteboard. It looked like two rectangular men in suits.\u201cHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s totally about meeting hot girls!\u201d Sven jumped out of his chair and hopped to the whiteboard, grabbing a pen and adding a pair of breasts to the roof of one of Arsyen\u2019s cars.\u201cOhhh,\u201d said Roni, as the idea came to life before him, his businessmen transforming into busty coeds.\u201cA user inputs into Social Car what he wants in terms of age, gender, and sexuality,\u201d Sven explained. \u201cSocial Car does the rest. All it has to do is scan the profiles from all the other Social Car\u2013enabled vehicles. And we give them pickup lines to help kick-start the conversation.\u201d\u201cGreat idea,\u201d grinned Roni, slapping Arsyen on the back.\u201cAlso, I think about woman problem again,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cYou know, about woman who not want to be found. I think I have answer: We give her choice to turn off Social Car.\u201d\u201cYou mean, let women choose whether to let people find her?\u201d Roni asked.Arsyen nodded.\u201cAre you crazy!?\u201d Sven cried.Roni shook his head. How could this be the same employee who had authored that manifesto?He reached into his backpack and grabbed Arsyen\u2019s HR form (damn HR, always wanting him to use paper!). No genius would ever propose listening to users\u2019 opinions. As Roni made a little tick on the form, he saw a cloud of worry pass over Arsyen\u2019s face.\u201cIf girls get to choose whether to use the feature, then we\u2019re only going to have a bunch of dudes on Social Car,\u201d Sven explained.Roni nodded. \u201cPeople get confused by choice\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s our job to tell them what they want. Besides, you\u2019ve got three guys in here saying they love it. What other proof do you need?\u201dBut it was clear Arsyen was no longer listening. He was staring at the HR form in Roni\u2019s hand, as if worried he had done something wrong. For that alone, Roni made another tick. The fact that Arsyen could even believe he had done something wrong once again indicated his inferiority. Geniuses weren\u2019t ever wrong, even when they were.Which was also why Roni needed to be right about having hired Arsyen.Jonas cornered Arsyen later that morning.\u201cWhat do you want me to do about those pickup lines?\u201d asked Jonas, standing between Arsyen\u2019s desk and the cubicle entrance.\u201cPickup lines?\u201dArsyen stood. He had learned it was best to minimize his interactions with Jonas. The boy was too smart, always staring just a bit too long and hard when Arsyen spoke about roadmaps and priorities.He took a step to try to move past him, but Jonas shifted to his left and again blocked Arsyen\u2019s path.\u201cThe feature we discussed yesterday,\u201d Jonas said, \u201cthe one that helps Car A and Car B start a conversation. How should I proceed?\u201d\u201cWell, I just think we should look at roadmap and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your obsession with roadmaps, anyway?\u201d asked Sven, entering the cubicle. \u201cI thought you came from Galt. Since when do startups have a plan or roadmap or really any strategy at all?\u201d\u201cI, I\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\u201cSo what do you want me to do?\u201d Jonas said.Arsyen frowned. Why was Jonas suddenly talking so much? And why hadn\u2019t he taken care of that enormous pimple on his nose?\u201cArsyen?\u201d\u201cPut it in the cloud,\u201d Arsyen said loudly, \u201cNOW.\u201d As an afterthought, he put his hands on his hips and sneered slightly, mimicking his father.Jonas didn\u2019t seem to notice Arsyen\u2019s power pose. \u201cSomething that is already in the cloud cannot be put in the cloud again,\u201d he said.\u201cWe create innovative double double cloud,\u201d Arsyen said.\u201cYou are not clear,\u201d Jonas said.Such insolence! Arsyen gripped the sponge in his pocket, imagining he was squeezing Jonas\u2019 neck. He slowly released it and felt the tension ease in his shoulders.\u201cI set up meeting to discuss,\u201d he said. \u201cI bring many action items.\u201d\u201cMeetings are where all good things die,\u201d Sven groaned. \u201cLet\u2019s just figure it out now.\u201d\u201cMust go to bathroom!\u201d Arsyen yelled. He darted past Jonas and out the cubicle, making a beeline for the bathroom a few feet away.Safe within its blue walls, he took a deep breath and stared at himself in the mirror. The sharp line of his chin jutted outward with authority; his mop-trained muscles nearly intimidated his own reflection.\u201cYou can do this. You must do this,\u201d Arsyen told himself, making the sign of the red-breasted woodpecker.He marched over to the cleaning closet, where he found a jute broom and some detergent pods. He decided to spend the rest of the day working on his croquet strokes. After all, if Jonas couldn\u2019t find him, he couldn\u2019t get mad at him. There was nothing unprincely about avoidance if it was strategic avoidance.Twenty-four hours later, Arsyen returned to his cubicle and informed Jonas and Sven that he wanted Social Car to change colors depending on the mood of the passenger.\u201cI also want you to design car so it clean itself. There should be automatic vacuum and air-freshener function.\u201d\u201cCool, that\u2019s, like, robotics,\u201d Sven said.\u201cYes,\u201d said Arsyen, remembering from his online research that adding a robot to one\u2019s roadmap was the touch of any good Silicon Valley product manager. \u201cEvery car come with broom robot. Robot Broom. Broom Robot. Bro-bot. With robot\u2019s deep learning sweeping dirt into neural net.\u201d\u201cArrrsyen,\u201d Jonas growled. \u201cYou cannot send us in one direction and then another. This is a totally different idea from the hookup feature we discussed two days ago.\u201d\u201cCar color and clean very important to user,\u201d said Arsyen, shaking his head.It was even more important to Arsyen. He had spent the entire night thinking up ways to postpone the team from settling on a clear direction. If he gave the engineers something new to consider, Arsyen wouldn\u2019t have to flesh anything out until after his trial period was over. And once he was a permanent employee, he\u2019d have plenty of time to learn how to be a real product manager.\u201cI want purple and green cars,\u201d said Arsyen, invoking the Anahata colors. \u201cNow, sorry, but HR team needs paperwork from me. Back later.\u201dArsyen made his way to the video game console down the hall, holding his sponge in front of him like an offering. He had discovered that Anahata\u2019s engineers let him roam wherever he wanted if he was carrying cleaning supplies, clearly uninterested in firing someone whose work they didn\u2019t wish to perform themselves.He returned late in the afternoon and was relieved to see Jonas transfixed by his screen.Sven waved but didn\u2019t look up; he was studying a bunch of cartoon dogs that were lined up vertically on his phone. Each \u201cdog\u201d had the face of a real human being.\u201cHow Dogtown going?\u201d he asked, hoping to score points with the nicer of his two co-workers.Sven sighed and explained that he had run into a snag. A local journalist had posted something in praise of Dogtown, and as a result, a few thousand people between San Francisco and the South Bay had downloaded it to their phones. While that should have been reason to celebrate, it instead led to a supply-demand imbalance: There seemed to be far more people who wanted to perform disagreeable tasks than there were people who needed disagreeable tasks to be performed for them.\u201cThere are too many guilty liberals on Dogtown,\u201d Sven moaned. \u201cI\u2019ve essentially got everyone bidding on the same tasks.\u201d He showed Arsyen the long list of white faces volunteering to perform menial tasks for people of color. \u201cI tried to get someone to pick up a tub of ice cream for my fake Asian female profile last night, and the bidding war was so intense that I ended up getting it delivered for free. It\u2019s even more exaggerated if I use my Latino or African-American profiles. Every white person in San Francisco seems desperate to run errands for free just to prove they\u2019re really progressive. They even want me to design badges they can put on their profile pictures to prove to everyone else they\u2019re not racist.\u201d\u201cBut that a good problem, right? You rework power balance. Fight the Men!\u201d Arsyen cheered.\u201cI prefer to leave saving the world to Anahata. I just want to create a bidding system for errands. I\u2019ll pay you to go pick up my dry cleaning. I don\u2019t want to know who you are, what you do, or what you look like. Just pick up my damn dry cleaning.\u201dJust then, Sven\u2019s phone rang. His eyes rolled as he picked it up, mouthing \u201cmom\u201d to Arsyen. He muttered a desultory greeting in Swedish as he left the cubicle.Arsyen heard something move behind him and turned to find Jonas standing there, arms crossed.\u201cDespite your lack of guidance, I went ahead and programmed part of the hookup feature,\u201d said Jonas, pointing to his screen. He had chosen a handful of key attributes to generate the pickup lines\u200a\u2014\u200acar type, model, color, passenger gender and age. He showed Arsyen a list of computer-generated interactions between Car A and Car B.I think women in Cadillacs are interesting and compassionate.I did not know women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four liked Cadillacs.Where did you buy your 2015 blue Cadillac ATS? It is the best of affordable luxury.I want to put my key in your Cadillac.Arsyen reread the pickup lines. They didn\u2019t strike him as particularly compelling.\u201cSeem okay,\u201d Arsyen said.\u201cOkay?\u201d Jonas said. \u201cI ask you for use cases and you disappear. Then I show you what I have done and that is all you say?\u201d\u201cYou very good at job,\u201d Arsyen smiled. \u201cYou better than roadmap.\u201dJonas\u2019 face tightened. \u201cYou said you were at Galt before this and that you had also worked at Stanford and other startups. Is that correct?\u2019Arsyen nodded. He noticed that the enormous, pulsing boil from the previous day had heaved its way farther across Jonas\u2019 nose.\u201cI spent last summer memorizing all the computer science professors and students in America\u2019s top ten PhD programs. I also memorized the names of everyone in the San Francisco, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Cupertino phone books in the event I might meet them one day. I do not recall your name from any of these exercises. \u201d\u201cMaybe you forget name?\u201d\u201cIt is next to impossible that I would have forgotten a name, and even less so, a Pyrrhian one.\u201dArsyen shrugged.\u201cWhat was the name of one of the products you built?\u201dArsyen tried to think of his video games and gadgets, or any of the Valley software he had heard about, but instead his head filled with images of his old Stanford broom closet, the supplies under his kitchen sink, the soaps in his bathroom.\u201cClorox,\u201d he blurted out.\u201cClorox?\u201d\u201cCloroxy,\u201d said Arsyen, scrambling to remember his product management reading. \u201cYoung, new, hot startup, Cloroxy. Problem remover. Removes all problems. We get power users. We make API. We use social graph and provide real-time solutions for gamification. Machine learning explosion.\u201d\u201cArsyen, I know you are lying. In fact, I have proof that you are lying.\u201dArsyen lowered his head. The game was up.\u201cI will expose you,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cYou will not make it past this week.\u201dArsyen remembered then what his father had said right before surrendering to the Embrian king: It is ignoble to fight an obvious defeat. Bish lena, bish lena.He knelt to grab his backpack, and a piece of paper on the ground caught his eye. It was a blueprint for something unrecognizable, almost like a sea creature, with intricate blue lines intersecting at right angles, forming tentacles radiating from a central oval body.Arsyen crawled out from under the desk and studied the thin blue paper again in the light. He decided it wasn\u2019t an animal but an arm, with fingers extending to the edge of the page. The fingertips were purple and green, just like the Anahata logo.\u201cWhere did you find that?\u201d snapped Jonas, drawing closer. He reached for the paper, but Arsyen swept his hand behind his back. He was keeping this for himself\u200a\u2014\u200ait was all he had to show for his one week at the greatest company in America.Jonas\u2019 face hardened.\u201cSo this is how you want to play it?\u201d His pimple pulsed with anger.Arsyen shook his head. One day he would have Jonas decapitated, but for now, there was no point in further conversation. He moved to the side, but Jonas blocked his path.\u201cYou know I know. And I know you know,\u201d Jonas said.Arsyen shifted to the left and again tried to move past him.\u201cYou do not seem to understand.\u201d Jonas\u2019 scrawny arm executed a surprisingly strong push against Arsyen\u2019s shoulder, and he stumbled back into his desk. \u201cYou cannot tell anyone about this. This is an incredibly important part of the project.\u201d\u201cThe project\u2026,\u201d Arsyen repeated Jonas\u2019 words, his mind racing to keep up. Jonas was worried Arsyen would say something about\u2026something. The blueprint? Social Car?It didn\u2019t matter\u200a\u2014\u200athis was an opportunity.\u201cDon\u2019t fire me, and I keep your secret safe.\u201d\u201cFine,\u201d Jonas said immediately. \u201cYour incompetence is a small price to pay.\u201dArsyen clapped his hands.\u201cThank you!\u201dVisions of piles of cash, a new apartment, and long lunches with Jennie filled Arsyen\u2019s head.\u201cWe will not discuss this again,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cPut the paper on my desk and I will see it is returned to its rightful place.\u201dJonas stomped back to his computer and threw on his headphones, turning his techno to its highest volume as if to ensure no other thoughts could trespass.Arsyen couldn\u2019t make sense of what had happened with Jonas, but he spent the final day of his trial week trying to thank him for what he hoped was his complicity. But Jonas had a funny way of showing his support, muttering \u201cimposter\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d each time Arsyen drew near.Fearing the worst, Arsyen began to browse job sites for janitorial jobs. None came close to his extraordinary Anahata salary. It would take him decades to save enough money to raise an army and storm the imperial palace. By then, his nemesis, General Korpeko, would be waiting for him in some fancy laser-shooting wheelchair, and Arsyen would be done for before he could even dismount from the only old, decrepit donkey he was able to afford.A little red icon blinked at the bottom of his computer screen, desperate for his attention. Although he had ignored its persistent signal for days, Arsyen clicked it this time.It was his Anahata email account.More than nine hundred messages were waiting for him\u200a\u2014\u200afrom mass email lists to product mocks and notes from Roni. Arsyen didn\u2019t know where to start. He opened the message at the top of his inbox:On the subject of engineers\u2019 shoelessness.He saw that the message had been sent to the random@anahata.com alias, which Jennie had explained was an open forum where anyone in the company could post anything they wanted about any subject that wouldn\u2019t fit into the other company lists (of which she said there were about sixty thousand, running the gamut from anahatanews@ and bug_testing@ to westernbuddhists@, fatahatas@, tallahatas@, and cafeteria_complaints@). Although the message had been sent at eleven o\u2019clock the previous night, there were already two hundred responses. Arsyen scrolled to the original message that had kicked things off.To: random@anahata.comFrom: Chuck Smoop (smoop@anahata.com )Subject: On the subject of engineers\u2019 shoelessnessA plague is upon us, Anahatis! Every time I go to the cafeteria, I notice an increasing number of barefoot employees. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter to this dirty band of marauders that they are bringing their foot diseases close to the food I eat. They seem to revel in this act as though it were a Dionysian orgy of verucas, fungus, and foodstuffs.Do they lack money to buy shoes? Am I punishing the weak for something they cannot change?No, my friends. They are simply\u2026engineers. It seems the \u201claunch\u201d of shoelessness started as a simple 1% rollout, with our engineering friends limiting the cool breeze between their toes to just our cafeterias. But now, over the past two weeks, these barefoot creatures have taken their practice beyond our hallowed food halls. Now I see bare feet in the bathrooms. I see bare feet in the meeting rooms. I see bare feet in my nightmares. My brain is getting athlete\u2019s foot just thinking about it.Please, engineering colleagues, please can you wear your shoes? It is not so much to ask.- Chuck", "tfidf": {"logidf": {"gentl": 2.84168957926, "layout": 2.71032034964, "roll": 1.4529683597299998, "poop": 6.45368798903, "reclam": 4.2744011123900005, "unicorn":

graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"4291\" name=\"4291\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he only animal left standing was a one-eyed sea lion named Fred.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9e78\" name=\"9e78\">The northwest wall of the Palo Alto Sea Park shark tank broke at four a.m. on a hot August night, releasing into the park 780,000 gallons of water and fourteen angry sharks. They rode the wave in one sharp-toothed tsunami, penetrating the dolphin tank with open mouths, chasing the dolphins into new parts of the park.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c07d\" name=\"c07d\">Down came the manatee tank, the penguin\u2019s pen, and the piglet squid viewing room. The flamingo hut and the snake house withstood the pressure but flooded with water, the animals\u2019 terrestrial enclosures suddenly transformed into muddy aquariums. Noah\u2019s ark was now subject to a Darwinian reorganization in which for a few breathless seconds, snakes became exotic fish, tails dropping vertically like flutes bobbing in the water until they finally sank to the floor. Nearby, the flamingos honked in terror, their pink necks popping up above the waves like unfastened hooks, tangling in each other until they dropped below the surface.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3d01\" name=\"3d01\">As the water from the tanks expanded to the edges of the park, the depths once housing the sea\u2019s greatest creatures were now reduced to mere puddles. Fish were left flapping against the asphalt; the beluga whale flattened seahorses and starfish as it barreled its way through the park in search of arctic water. No longer traveling forward with carnivorous glee, the sharks came to a stop near the snack bar and began rolling about on their dolphin-stuffed bellies, emitting wimpy cries that would have delighted fish lower on the totem pole were they too not gasping in their newly parched environment. Within minutes, self-pity transformed to anger, and in their final moments, the sharks turned on each other in a cannibalistic bloodbath.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3641\" name=\"3641\">It all happened so quickly that by the time the rescue crews arrived, there was little left to salvage. The crew moved swiftly from one section of the park to the next, their faces increasingly grim. The manta rays spread flat like leathery carpets, the snakes roping above them in a bloated tangle. Colorful fish lay on their sides, mouths gaping, scales shifting like crystals in the slowly rising sun.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2e7f\" name=\"2e7f\">Word quickly spread of the catastrophe, and television news helicopters soon circled above. Everyone was looking for Belbo, Palo Alto\u2019s beloved walrus and official mascot. The rescue crew finally discovered the aquarium\u2019s prized pinniped underneath one of the felled walls, her death exacted by a slab of heavy concrete.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9bcd\" name=\"9bcd\">As the leader of the rescue crew turned to declare the end of their efforts, a loud croak bellowed from the northwest corner of the park. The crew ran toward the sound, which now repeated, like a foghorn, over and over. It was coming from the marine-themed jungle gym, one of the few structures that had survived the flood, thanks to its distance from the shark and dolphin tanks. As the crew approached, they saw a gray mass swaying atop the slide, partially blocking the sun. The rescuers shielded their eyes for a better view, and soon its form grew clearer. It was a one-eyed sea lion with a patch on its left eye.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08a3\" name=\"08a3\">At the sight of the rescue team, the sea lion barked again and clapped its hands. It balanced a ball on its nose, then put its weight on its front flippers and lifted its tail up behind its head. Without thinking, the rescue crew laughed and clapped.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5c13\" name=\"5c13\">Then the sea lion jumped onto its belly and sailed down the slide, landing on its stomach, flappers out to its side and a smile on its face. The crew rushed to hug the sea lion, to applaud its survival skills, to hail the new mascot of Palo Alto. The animal clapped its hands again and croaked three times, and across Silicon Valley, the sea lion\u2019s bark dried the tears of the children watching the live news broadcasts. The sea lion showed them hope amid this sea of destruction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f779\" name=\"f779\">One of the newscasters named it Fred.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bae0\" name=\"bae0\">A few months later, when the ground had finally dried and the bitter memories of the lost aquarium had faded for all but lawyers and insurance companies, the lot was purchased by a young internet company called Anahata. The founder of the company demanded that Fred be included as part of the property deal.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"95c2\" name=\"95c2\">Fred was given his own wading pool next to the founder\u2019s office but spent most of his time waddling about the company\u2019s halls, pooping in the cubicles and barking at employees he didn\u2019t like, forcing Anahata\u2019s engineers to purchase sound-reduction headphones so they could work undisturbed. Fred did as he pleased and, in doing so, impressed everyone with his stubborn refusal to change his ways.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d12\" name=\"8d12\">When Fred died of old age a few years later, all the employees gathered to pay their respects. During the dedication of a commemorative aquarium in the company\u2019s main building, the founder of Anahata, a man named Bobby Bonilo, told his employees that it was Fred who had taught him how to run his company. Fred, he said, had proven that it was fine to have one eye and waddle if you were better than anyone else at doing those things.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5520\" name=\"5520\">No one understood the metaphor, but all the employees committed it to memory as important career advice.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0aa4\" name=\"0aa4\">The commemorative aquarium was soon filled with brightly colored fish and crustaceans, as well as a giant squid the founder flew back from a remote island in the Pacific. The squid wowed the crowd with its undulating arms, which extended almost the full length of the tank, and its chomping mouth, which tore apart most of the fish the moment they were dropped in the water.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0ce9\" name=\"0ce9\">Nearly a decade on, the squid is nearly the size of a school bus and the aquarium\u2019s only remaining inhabitant. It floats in the central building of Anahata, today the world\u2019s largest and most powerful technology company.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"33e0\" name=\"33e0\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"7465\" name=\"7465\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"7707\" name=\"7707\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">To</span> interview at Anahata was a privilege. And the next, nearly inevitable step\u200a\u2014\u200ato be rejected from Anahata\u200a\u2014\u200awas a great honor. Just making it into the company\u2019s lobby already indicated that one was superior to 99.39 percent of the world\u2019s population. To be accepted, of course, required passing an even higher bar.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b009\" name=\"b009\">One by one, the gobsmacked Rejects filed past the Hopefuls sitting in the lobby, as unsure of their steps as they now were of their qualifications. They turned back to catch a final glimpse of Anahata\u2019s collection of gleaming white buildings, and smiled then, just briefly, knowing that despite their failure\u200a\u2014\u200aa failure from which they might never recover\u200a\u2014\u200aat least they were among the few to have glimpsed the world hidden behind the company\u2019s doors.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9880\" name=\"9880\">Arsyen Aimo surveyed his surroundings. It couldn\u2019t have been a friendlier place: wide green sofas, a gigantic refrigerator full of fresh juices, and a flight simulator to help pass the time in the unlikely event of a delay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed38\" name=\"ed38\">Sitting on the very edge of the first couch was a young man, hair uncombed, T-shirt wrinkled, emitting a faint odor of sweat. Crumbs of breakfast cereal cast a pebbled road across his chest. A thin folder jittered in his hand, its transparency revealing a document whose tidy bullet points and blurbs belied the man\u2019s unkempt appearance. His knees bounced lightly up and down, and he rocked as he sat, lips moving silently as though he were counting to himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cac4\" name=\"cac4\">On the second couch was another man, this one in his mid-thirties and wearing a suit, his cologne the essence of a crisp morning in the mountains. His back was against the sofa, one ankle thrown across the opposite knee, an arm thrown over the cushion as if he were there to watch Sunday football. He kept checking his watch, darting glances both anxious and dismissive at the female receptionists.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08d9\" name=\"08d9\">Arsyen immediately recognized their types. The first was an engineer, the second a salesman. And there was no reason for Arsyen to think any more of either of them\u200a\u2014\u200aor the other fifteen iterations also waiting in the lobby\u200a\u2014\u200aas he had seen enough of both during his time in the Valley to identify their species by smell alone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b2a\" name=\"5b2a\">Arsyen had other things on his mind; he was there to conquer his job interview. For he was Arsyen, Prince of Pyrrhia.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"875f\" name=\"875f\">Or rather, a former prince who due to unfortunate circumstances had been reduced to working as a janitor in Silicon Valley.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80bd\" name=\"80bd\">Or, as he preferred to refer to it, a sanitation engineer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7f9f\" name=\"7f9f\">Not that he liked cleaning. He hated it. Prince Arsyen had not been raised in the Order of the Red Woodpecker\u200a\u2014\u200abuffed and preened and rubbed and polished to perfection by handmaidens each morning\u200a\u2014\u200awith the idea that he would leave the royal palace and clean people\u2019s toilets in America. (As a child, Arsyen didn\u2019t even know how to use a toilet, thanks to the service of his royal wipers.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6069\" name=\"6069\">But like most everything he undertook in life, Arsyen excelled at janitorial work\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was so good, in fact, that he usually finished his work in half the time of other janitors. Previous employers had occasionally misinterpreted his skill as laziness and accused him of not having logged sufficient time with the mop. But Arsyen knew that a truly exceptional company would see it differently.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ce7b\" name=\"ce7b\">Anahata was that company, and this was no ordinary janitorial job. It paid better than any other Silicon Valley company by a full $3 an hour. If all went according to plan, in a few decades, Arsyen would save enough money to raise an army and reverse the unfortunate circumstances that had driven him from his country. His future, and the future of his adoring minions, depended on the outcome of this interview.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"17ff\" name=\"17ff\">A recruiter entered the room, and the crowd of hopefuls looked his way.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>His casual good looks and affable demeanor struck Arsyen as an effective ambassador for a company whose public image was one of approachable superiority.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8a17\" name=\"8a17\">\u201cArsyen Aimo?\u201d the recruiter read from a sheet of paper.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d3c3\" name=\"d3c3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Prince Arsyen, </em>Arsyen silently corrected him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bfdb\" name=\"bfdb\">The recruiter used a badge to push past the security doors, and Arsyen\u2019s mouth moved in a silent <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Wow </em>as he entered the building. The cheerful but simple lobby area had not prepared him for this. The recruiter stopped\u200a\u2014\u200aa seemingly well-rehearsed pause of ten seconds\u200a\u2014\u200ato let Arsyen take it all in.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c0f4\" name=\"c0f4\">The building was a light-filled air hangar with expansive skylights and shoulder-height cubicles of varying geometric configurations. One could see across the entire building in a glance. Colorful beanbags were sprinkled here and there, and sleep capsules lined the walls, emitting the faint lullaby of snoring engineers. Each corner and space was maximized to project a sense of possibility, and employees seemed to congregate wherever the mood struck\u200a\u2014\u200aa beanbag suddenly the appropriate place for a conference call; a foosball or pingpong table a surface to plop one\u2019s computer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3f94\" name=\"3f94\">\u201cExtra. Ordinary,\u201d said Arsyen, the English emerging from his tongue like an insult rather than a superlative.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e5cc\" name=\"e5cc\">The recruiter didn\u2019t respond\u200a\u2014\u200ahis smile was stretched too far across his face to allow any spillage of words. He simply nodded and then motioned for Arsyen to follow. They made their way toward the opposite end of the building, then exited into a sunny courtyard and an immense stretch of pert, healthy grass that should never have been able to grow in California\u2019s desert landscape but seemed the natural complement to the bright, white buildings encircling the lawn. Palm trees swayed to an invisible breeze, casting the image of an island paradise in the expansive windows of each structure. For a brief moment, as they walked across a glass bridge over a small creek, Anahata\u2019s green, watery visions of itself surrounding them on all sides, Arsyen wondered which way was up. Legs and sand suddenly joined to palm trees in the reflections, and Arsyen turned, scanning the lawn for their origin. After a few seconds, he found them: a group of tanned girls in their early twenties playing volleyball on a sand court.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b525\" name=\"b525\">Arsyen studied their long limbs and sun-bleached ponytails. They leaped across the sand like lip-glossed gazelles. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I love America</em>, he thought to himself. But he wasn\u2019t the only one watching. Amid the palm and water reflections on the windows, Arsyen could spot a face here and there, male onlookers with cheeks pressed up against the glass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b20c\" name=\"b20c\">They entered a new building, similar to the previous one, and Arsyen was ushered into a small, white room. It looked like a normal office, except all the walls were made of glass\u200a\u2014\u200aa familiar layout in Silicon Valley. For most employees, these spaces were a symbol of transparency and openness. For sanitation engineers like Arsyen, they were just an invitation for dirty fingerprints.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5bc1\" name=\"5bc1\">The recruiter sat Arsyen at a table in the center of the room.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dd74\" name=\"dd74\">\u201cWe\u2019ve found that it\u2019s most efficient for everyone to take a test before we invest in a conversation,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"211e\" name=\"211e\">\u201cSorry?\u201d said Arsyen, perpetually annoyed that the English language required him to apologize when it was others who were unclear.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4969\" name=\"4969\">\u201cYou\u2019re going to take a test now. If you pass, then someone will come interview you,\u201d the recruiter said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"742c\" name=\"742c\">\u201cAnd then I meet Bobby Bonilo?\u201d Arsyen asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1726\" name=\"1726\">\u201cThe founder of Anahata? At your interview? Uh\u2014\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"53b3\" name=\"53b3\">\u201cI give great interview,\u201d said Arsyen, rising to his feet. He placed his hands on his hips and raised his chin as his father, the king, used to do.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"afc9\" name=\"afc9\">The recruiter\u2019s smile collapsed for a split second before rebounding.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ff69\" name=\"ff69\">\u201cHow about we first see if you can find the error on this page.\u201d He pulled a paper from the top of his stack and handed it to Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"202c\" name=\"202c\">Arsyen looked down and gasped at the dark incantations before him: nonsensical numbers and letters enclosed in &lt; &gt;.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f344\" name=\"f344\">It wasn\u2019t that Arsyen had never seen computer code before. It was inescapable in the Valley\u200a\u2014\u200aon buses and billboards, hats and T-shirts. Valley people spoke of code like it was an act of progress, on par with a social movement. Over the years, as he mopped and scrubbed in the background, Arsyen had overheard more than a few hallway conversations in which scrawny men talked about using their code to change the world.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"823a\" name=\"823a\">But knowing how to recognize code and knowing<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> how</em> to code were two very different things. Surely there was no way he could be expected to perform such a task. Arsyen grunted. It was in moments like this that he particularly missed his home country of Pyrrhia. There he would have had any number of servants who could have learned computer programming on his behalf.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"100b\" name=\"100b\">Perhaps this was the right moment to inform the recruiter of his royal lineage. There had been no applicable dropdown box in the online application; no way for Arsyen to signal that he was not simply a great janitor, but someone whose very greatness had once been written into his country\u2019s constitution.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1431\" name=\"1431\">But such a direct declaration struck Arsyen as rather crass\u200a\u2014\u200aroyalty was to be recognized, not announced.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d2ea\" name=\"d2ea\">Of course, that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t help things along with a discreet nod toward his heritage. Arsyen ignored the recruiter\u2019s prompt to find the coding error\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had no clue, and in any case, such details were for clerks and commoners. Instead, he sketched a crude outline of a pointy crown across the length of the page.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bd50\" name=\"bd50\">\u201cDone,\u201d announced Arsyen, pushing the paper across the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b46\" name=\"2b46\">The recruiter glanced at Arsyen\u2019s paper and did a double take. \u201cWell, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that\u2019s</em> a bold statement,\u201d he said finally, then excused himself and left the room.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c55\" name=\"7c55\">Minutes later, a slightly balding man in his thirties entered carrying a brown paper bag. He was wearing a purple T-shirt with an orange cartoon character on the front; the sandals on his feet were made of red plastic. Arsyen was surprised by the ensemble. From what he had seen during his time in America, most sanitation engineers dressed inconspicuously, their very livelihood dependent on being able to make dirt\u200a\u2014\u200aand themselves\u200a\u2014\u200aas invisible as possible to the general population.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"934e\" name=\"934e\">This man looked more like a court jester.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"58a7\" name=\"58a7\">\u201cHi, I\u2019m Roni,\u201d he said, setting Arsyen\u2019s test on the table and extending his hand. \u201cYou got a r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0cdd\" name=\"0cdd\">Arsyen shook his head. No one had ever asked him for a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 before.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6008\" name=\"6008\">\u201cI get it, I get it,\u201d Roni said. \u201cI think they\u2019re dumb, too. I mean, a piece of paper\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s like, so corporate, you know? We don\u2019t need \u2019em. Let\u2019s just talk like equals, like regular guys who went to Stanford together.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d33b\" name=\"d33b\">He sat down in the chair opposite Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"80da\" name=\"80da\">\u201cSo, how long have you been an engineer?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"04ab\" name=\"04ab\">Arsyen felt his heart jump. It was the first time someone had properly called him an \u201cengineer.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4b3d\" name=\"4b3d\">\u201cFour years,\u201d he answered, and then paused. Now was the time. He cleared his throat and lowered his voice, consciously making it as booming and sonorous as the Aimo name deserved. \u201cI am also\u2026prince.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9248\" name=\"9248\">Roni chuckled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that one before. Actually, most of the engineers here think they are kings.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bf0a\" name=\"bf0a\">\u201cBut there only one king,\u201d said Arsyen, making the sign of the red-breasted woodpecker.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6fac\" name=\"6fac\">\u201cSo true, so true,\u201d Roni said. \u201cAnd what a king we have here at Anahata.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a71\" name=\"7a71\">Roni\u2019s gaze floated skyward, as if communicating with an otherworldly being. Arsyen also looked up but saw nothing more than a halogen lamp with a sticker touting its energy efficiency.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d738\" name=\"d738\">Roni snapped back to life.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"697a\" name=\"697a\">\u201cNow, where were you before this?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8b52\" name=\"8b52\">\u201cGalt.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd21\" name=\"cd21\">Roni\u2019s eyebrows leaped up in a flash, but then, equally quickly, were dragged downward\u200a\u2014\u200aa clear attempt by their owner to anchor his admiration. Galt was one of the Valley\u2019s hottest startups, famous for having created a bunch of apps and tools that eliminated the tedium of journalism, research, essays, and speeches by reducing all thought and opinion to easily shareable, bite-sized chunks. Everything they did was about minimization\u200a\u2014\u200amaking the world \u201ceasier to digest.\u201d Some people predicted Galt was the next Anahata, though personally, Arsyen had found the company lacked any creativity or vision and was always asking him to take a second pass at the men\u2019s stalls.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"68c9\" name=\"68c9\">\u201cGalt, eh? Well, that explains this,\u201d said Roni, pointing at the crown Arsyen had sketched across his test, lassoing most of the page\u2019s code.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1873\" name=\"1873\">\u201cPretty ballsy to suggest all of our code is a mess,\u201d Roni said. \u201cI would respectfully disagree, but I applaud your moxie. You must be good at debugging.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e469\" name=\"e469\">Arsyen\u2019s face pruned. \u201cBugs,\u201d he spit. \u201cI kill them every day.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"69aa\" name=\"69aa\">\u201cAwesome. Me too, me too. Obviously, there\u2019s no coding in a P.M. job, but people here will respect you a lot more if you have an engineering background.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"efbf\" name=\"efbf\">Arsyen didn\u2019t know what Roni meant by \u201cP.M. job.\u201d Was it a powerful mopper? A plumbing manager?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f08a\" name=\"f08a\">Roni dipped his hand into the brown paper bag and slowly pulled out an enormous sandwich. Arsyen watched as he slowly removed the plastic and unfolded a paper napkin, square by square, until finally smoothing it before him. Roni paused and bent his head toward his sandwich, lifting his hands just slightly in prayer. And then, suddenly, the hands disappeared, the plastic wrap was on the other side of the table, and the sandwich was half hanging out of Roni\u2019s mouth. Turds of tuna fell onto the napkin below.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2bed\" name=\"2bed\">\u201cLet\u2019s get going, shall we? I only ask one big question in my interviews. I\u2019m kinda known for that. It\u2019s all about the process, about how you go after it. It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what</em> you say, okay?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c27c\" name=\"c27c\">Arsyen nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"20f7\" name=\"20f7\">\u201cSo,\u201d began Roni. \u201cYou\u2019re a pirate and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"598f\" name=\"598f\">\u201cNo, a prince.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d206\" name=\"d206\">\u201cHuh? Oh right, haha. Well, for the purpose of this question, you\u2019re a pirate. If you want, you can be the captain of the pirate ship. Does that work?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a6d2\" name=\"a6d2\">\u201cA captain is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">king</em> of the pirate ship?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5ada\" name=\"5ada\">\u201cExactly. Now you and your crew discover a treasure chest with one hundred gold coins, and you have to find a way to split it up.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2dcb\" name=\"2dcb\">\u201cI give no gold. Gold is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">mine</em>,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e6a7\" name=\"e6a7\">\u201cWell, now wait, that\u2019s the catch. If you don\u2019t give the other pirates anything, they will throw you off the ship. In order not to be killed, you have to come up with a way to distribute the coins so that at least half of the pirates agree with your proposal.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f130\" name=\"f130\">\u201cI kill them and take gold,\u201d said Arsyen, dismissing the question with a wave of his hand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0e06\" name=\"0e06\">\u201cNot so fast,\u201d Roni said. \u201cYou\u2019re the captain, but you\u2019re outnumbered. So you can\u2019t kill them\u200a\u2014\u200athough I like your aggressiveness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"42c0\" name=\"42c0\">\u201cNow, if you get killed, another pirate will have to come up with a proposal, but then he could be killed, too, so it goes to the next pirate. And so on and so on. So it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to agree on a proposal right from the start\u200a\u2014\u200abut also maximize their profit. It\u2019s basically a distribution problem. Actually, you know, I was given the same problem when I came to interview at Anahata. Except my interviewer used the Easter Bunny and a bunch of eggs, and the pirates were actually little kids and\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cbaa\" name=\"cbaa\">But Arsyen had already stopped listening. His family had plundered plenty of ancient treasure over the centuries, swindling mercenaries, gangsters, and, yes, occasionally pirates\u200a\u2014\u200astealing from the very worst of mankind to give to the good people of Pyrrhia.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e678\" name=\"e678\">\u201cYou can use this whiteboard here to work through the problem,\u201d said Roni, pointing to one of the walls. \u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8bf1\" name=\"8bf1\">\u201cOne gold coin,\u201d answered Arsyen. \u201cYou give pirates one coin each.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"91dd\" name=\"91dd\">Roni\u2019s eyes bulged.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"537b\" name=\"537b\">\u201cWow, uh, okay, that was quick. I mean, how did you\u2026I mean, the whiteboard\u2026Like, if there\u2019s two pirates and then you figure out\u2026Wait, how did you do this so fast? Talk me through the math.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e17\" name=\"7e17\">\u201cIn time to do math, other pirates kill captain,\u201d Arsyen answered. \u201cCapitan use brain.\u201d He tapped the side of his head, just in case Roni wasn\u2019t sure where the brain was located. Roni seemed a bit dim; he clearly had never been a pirate or even known one.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4fc1\" name=\"4fc1\">\u201cOh yeah, like, totally,\u201d said Roni, regaining his composure. \u201cI mean, yeah, it\u2019s not difficult. But, um, we still have some time left, so\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cbf4\" name=\"cbf4\">Roni looked around the room, then jumped up from the table and scribbled something on the whiteboard.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c9a6\" name=\"c9a6\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">How do you use data to make your decisions?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ea8b\" name=\"ea8b\">He stood back, shook his head, then erased it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb27\" name=\"fb27\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Describe how you would improve your favorite Anahata product.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c633\" name=\"c633\">He erased that one just as quickly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"28f1\" name=\"28f1\">Then he tried something else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f27f\" name=\"f27f\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Automation.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"030e\" name=\"030e\">He grinned and returned to the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0899\" name=\"0899\">\u201cOkay, pick something in the modern home and tell me what technologies you would use to automate it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b5b0\" name=\"b5b0\">\u201cNo automation. Hire more servants,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"57c4\" name=\"57c4\">\u201cHuh? Uh, no, you can\u2019t have more servants,\u201d said Roni, shaking his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6587\" name=\"6587\">\u201cWhy? Because someone killed them?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bfc6\" name=\"bfc6\">\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d said Roni, his face reddening slightly, fingers pressing into his napkin. \u201cI want a technical framework for how you would go about automating something in your house.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"38b7\" name=\"38b7\">Arsyen couldn\u2019t resist a smirk. Everyone in the Valley wanted to automate everything, but to what end? All they were really doing was getting rid of people\u2019s jobs, which of course meant the peasants would eventually rise up and slaughter them. Technologists were so naive.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1b83\" name=\"1b83\">\u201cNot all innovation so good,\u201d said Arsyen, shaking his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b604\" name=\"b604\">\u201cWrong! One hundred percent wrong!\u201d Roni screamed, jumping out of his chair and waving a mayo-covered finger in Arsyen\u2019s face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c60\" name=\"1c60\">Roni stood and stormed to the door. \u201cRecruiter!\u201d he shouted. \u201cRecruiter!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9322\" name=\"9322\">He stomped out of the room and began to pace, mostly muttering to himself, occasionally yelling \u201cinternet of things!\u201d and then hitting the side of his head with his palm over and over again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"591e\" name=\"591e\">Arsyen sighed inwardly\u200a\u2014\u200aanother janitor diva. He wondered what sort of extraordinary cleaning product or technique Roni had invented for Anahata to put up with such behavior. Or maybe he was just one of those early hires the company never managed to get rid of.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2374\" name=\"2374\">A tall man with a crew cut walked by and Roni waved him down.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b14f\" name=\"b14f\">\u201cGregor!\u201d he shouted. The man stopped but did not seem particularly pleased to see him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a49a\" name=\"a49a\">Roni was gesturing rapidly, shaking his head, pointing at Arsyen in the room. Arsyen couldn\u2019t entirely make out what he was saying, but he was sure he heard the word \u201cGalt.\u201d The man turned to look at Arsyen, and the Prince of Pyrrhia sat up straight and puffed out his chest. But the man\u2019s blank expression gave nothing away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7db0\" name=\"7db0\">A moment later, both men were standing before him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"91cb\" name=\"91cb\">\u201cWhat did you work on at Galt?\u201d demanded the tall man with the crew cut.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f0d0\" name=\"f0d0\">\u201cBathrooms, hallways, computer screens. Much innovation,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cb33\" name=\"cb33\">Roni and the crew cut exchanged glances.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1c85\" name=\"1c85\">\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get anything out of him.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c8bd\" name=\"c8bd\">\u201cBut he surely knows things,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6d9e\" name=\"6d9e\">\u201cDo you know things?\u201d Roni asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e2f\" name=\"3e2f\">Arsyen nodded vigorously. He had enough experience in his father\u2019s court to know that it was always best to agree with an important person\u200a\u2014\u200aunless they were interrogating you about murder or adultery.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aaa0\" name=\"aaa0\">The crew cut stared at Arsyen for a beat longer, then turned to Roni, whispering a few words Arsyen couldn\u2019t make out. Then, without a goodbye or any acknowledgement of Arsyen\u2019s presence, he turned on his heel and marched out the door.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0248\" name=\"0248\">A second later, Roni was grinning, his hand extending again to Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5cea\" name=\"5cea\">\u201cCongrats\u200a\u2014\u200athe job is yours!\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"de9e\" name=\"de9e\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"27c8\" name=\"27c8\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>rsyen was sure he had seen her before\u200a\u2014\u200athough certainly not here, in the Anahata reception area, seated at a long white desk, her figure backlit by a neon \u201cwelcome!\u201d sign.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f3e\" name=\"5f3e\">He studied her face\u200a\u2014\u200athe brown hair moving in slow waves past her shoulders, the slightly raised cheekbones. Her lips moved silently, murmuring secrets and chants\u200a\u2014\u200athings Arsyen wanted to know. His gaze moved again across her face, settling on her blue, almond-shaped eyes. And then he knew.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0d69\" name=\"0d69\">The woman was Xeri. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">His</em> Xeri. But she was a Xeri scrubbed clean, stripped of her crossbow and pointy elfin ears, her dirty wolf cape and leather skirt that hid a dagger in the belt loop. With her long, gauzy dress and random assortment of beaded necklaces, this Xeri was more flower child than assassin. And while that was less of a turn-on, this Xeri had one big thing going for her. She was much better than his <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">World of Warcraft</em> girlfriend. She was real.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"79a2\" name=\"79a2\">It wouldn\u2019t have been such a shock had Arsyen not already resigned himself to the idea that this breed of woman didn\u2019t exist in his corner of America. In his four years of working in Silicon Valley, Arsyen had run into plenty of her gender: ogre women, mustachioed women, circus women. But none like this: an attractive woman. It was like she was from another part of California entirely.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a93e\" name=\"a93e\">Minutes passed as the woman typed on her computer, pale-pink fingernails knocking against the keyboard like little woodpeckers. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tap tap tap.</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tap tap tap.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"833f\" name=\"833f\">He caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass wall behind her\u200a\u2014\u200aa strong Pyrrhian man, with muscles as ropey as the hair on his arms, and a powerful chin whose virile charms were enhanced by the large and uniquely crooked Aimo nose. He was white like the glossy coat of the rare Pyrrhian ram.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bc77\" name=\"bc77\">His reflection frowned back at him. Would she find him a bit short?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8417\" name=\"8417\">Of course not. Back in Pyrrhia, the women always complimented him on his height.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"59ac\" name=\"59ac\">\u201cArsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b9df\" name=\"b9df\">The woman was looking up at him, her smile the product of America\u2019s strong belief in orthodontics. Good humor was cheap currency in this country, but the woman\u2019s smile was different, it was angelic, it was \u2014</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fbb6\" name=\"fbb6\">Arsyen decided then he would make her his queen.

He had a girlfriend back in Pyrrhia who was dreaming of him and only him every night. He was at Anahata for his job\u200a\u2014\u200athe job that would free his people from the starvation and terrors of the current regime. He didn\u2019t have time for beautiful women\u200a\u2014\u200aat least not the ones who didn\u2019t accept cash.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"57a0\" name=\"57a0\">\u201cYou\u2019re all set up as a new Anahata employee, or Anahatis, as we call ourselves.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"78e7\" name=\"78e7\">The woman walked out from behind the desk and extended her hand. She smelled vaguely of vanilla.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cae5\" name=\"cae5\">\u201cI\u2019m Jennie,\u201d she said cheerfully, seemingly unaware of the mild earthquake that shook Arsyen as their palms touched. \u201cHere\u2019s your badge. Don\u2019t lose it\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s what gives you access to everything here.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f6c9\" name=\"f6c9\">Jennie badged them into the main part of the building, a different one than Arsyen had visited for his job interview. An enormous skylight stretched the building\u2019s length; Arsyen could even see clouds moving across the blue sky above. Suspended from the ceiling by wires and blocking the sun\u2019s glare, an old NASA rocket and a fiberglass <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">T. rex</em> charged at each other from opposite ends of the building.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e13a\" name=\"e13a\">To Arsyen\u2019s left, running along the outside wall of one cubicle, a ticker tape documented connections made through the company\u2019s latest product, Moodify, a social network designed to connect people based on their moods, heart rates, and favorite video games. Although he didn\u2019t know much about technology, Arsyen had recently bought a Moodify bracelet. It pained him that his video game and gadget expenditures had to come out of his throne reclamation fund, but it was very important that the future leader of Pyrrhia be up to date on the latest technology and first-person-shooter attack and defense techniques.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7fcb\" name=\"7fcb\">Arsyen\u2019s Moodify bracelet glowed red\u200a\u2014\u200athe same color, he was certain, as Jennie\u2019s. He waited to see their names cross the ticker tape in a flashing red arrow, suggesting a love connection, but the Moodify technology seemed to be broken. He turned to speak, but Jennie was already on the other side of the hall, standing before an enormous aquarium that stretched the length of the wall. Her bracelet pulsed with blue light. Arsyen shook his head and double-checked to see if his bracelet had changed colors. Maybe he just needed to stand closer. He ran to catch up with his future queen.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"baa6\" name=\"baa6\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"b234\" name=\"b234\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"66b9\" name=\"66b9\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">J</span>ennie spotted the squid from across the floor, its peach mass hovering above a cluster of neon corals and sea plants. The squid was no longer part of the company tour\u200a\u2014\u200anowadays animals were included only if they were robotic\u200a\u2014\u200abut Jennie liked to stop by at least once a week to say hello.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1277\" name=\"1277\">\u201cHi friend,\u201d said Jennie, tapping the glass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"214e\" name=\"214e\">The squid wove its tentacles around a cluster of kelp, ripping the plant from its seabed and pressing it against the glass as if in offering.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c126\" name=\"c126\">\u201cSo sweet,\u201d Jennie giggled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"034f\" name=\"034f\">\u201cWhat this?\u201d said a man\u2019s voice behind her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"782d\" name=\"782d\">Oh\u2026him. Jennie had almost forgotten about him. Who was he\u200a\u2014\u200aArse\u2026Arsi\u2026Ass? She glanced down at her HR form. Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3b7b\" name=\"3b7b\">\u201cThis is our squid,\u201d said Jennie, stretching her receptionist\u2019s smile toothy and wide as she turned to face him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"376b\" name=\"376b\">As far as product managers went, he seemed particularly underwhelming\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019d already been walking for ten minutes and he hadn\u2019t even tried to lecture her about anything. How was it that Anahata could overlook people like Jennie in favor of dopey guys like Arsyen? Jennie had applied to ten internal jobs this quarter alone, ranging from online sales assistant to VP of infrastructure engineering, and hadn\u2019t gotten a single bite. Most of the time they told her she wasn\u2019t the right \u201cculture fit.\u201d Sometimes they claimed she wasn\u2019t qualified\u200a\u2014\u200aJennie, who had an almost-PhD in Russian literature and fifteen online entrepreneurship degrees and had watched every single TED Talk ever recorded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0c25\" name=\"0c25\">\u201cBig fish,\u201d said Arsyen, clearly demonstrating his superior intellect. \u201cOther fish here too?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3c9d\" name=\"3c9d\">\u201cNot anymore. We used to have other fish, but they just kept disappearing while the squid here kept getting bigger and bigger. So it\u2019s just him now. Some people think he ate the smaller fish, but I think he\u2019s just a misunderstood giant.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"135f\" name=\"135f\">Jennie wanted to point out to Arsyen that she had just created a metaphor. She was obviously the squid, but prettier.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a6a0\" name=\"a6a0\">But instead she just smiled. Jennie knew her poetry would be lost on someone with an engineering degree.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"05d4\" name=\"05d4\">\u201cYou can visit him whenever you want,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you make it past the first week, you can even sign up to feed him.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8472\" name=\"8472\">\u201cThe first week\u2026?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4747\" name=\"4747\">Jennie did a double take.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"869a\" name=\"869a\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you read your offer letter?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a205\" name=\"a205\">\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c3b\" name=\"0c3b\">Jennie rifled through the HR paperwork. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, thrusting a paper at Arsyen and tapping the middle of the page with a pink fingernail.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"abf9\" name=\"abf9\">\u201c\u2018Anahata reserves the right to terminate your contract at any point during your first week,\u2019\u201d Jennie quoted. \u201cAnd by \u2018any point,\u2019 they mean even during the first five minutes.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"06c9\" name=\"06c9\">Jennie saw the panic that flashed across Arsyen\u2019s face and couldn\u2019t resist pushing things a bit further.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3a13\" name=\"3a13\">\u201cI should probably fire you right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2521\" name=\"2521\">Jennie ripped Arsyen\u2019s red badge out of his hand and started to walk away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7d9c\" name=\"7d9c\">\u201cBut I\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aed0\" name=\"aed0\">Jennie stopped and sighed. The truth was she had no power to fire anyone at Anahata. It was fun to mess with Arsyen, but if she wasn\u2019t careful, he could end up firing her. The only power receptionists had was over the refrigerator in the reception area.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dcda\" name=\"dcda\">She turned to face him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"899f\" name=\"899f\">\u201cIf you had read your contract, you\u2019d know that I can\u2019t fire you,\u201d Jennie said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"072b\" name=\"072b\">\u201cPhew!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bb9c\" name=\"bb9c\">Jennie scribbled a note on Arsyen\u2019s HR form: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Employee</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">did not read contract</em>. In another profession, that would have been a ding against Arsyen, but at Anahata, managers seemed to view noncompliance among their technical staff as a sign of genius.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d9b3\" name=\"d9b3\">\u201cWhat you doing?\u201d said Arsyen, lifting onto his toes to catch a glimpse of what Jennie had written.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1e9e\" name=\"1e9e\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Jennie, waving away his concern as she pushed him out of the building and onto the lawn. \u201cThe only thing you need to do is keep your manager happy and, well, watch out for other engineers.\u201d She gestured toward a group of men sitting on a picnic table, gathered around a computer. \u201cI can\u2019t fire you, but <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">they</em> can.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5e2\" name=\"f5e2\">The largest man in the group turned in their direction, stretching his arms above his head. Jennie recognized him from the previous week, when she had seen him fire a new engineer for choosing a Diet Coke instead of a Red Bull from the micro-kitchen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9fa3\" name=\"9fa3\">The engineer\u2019s mouth roared in a wide, silent yawn, and his eyes scanned the area around him, moving across the various employees walking across the grass. His gaze fell on Arsyen and a trigger within him seemed to be pulled. He threw his pale, hairy legs over the bench and began to lope toward them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8e30\" name=\"8e30\">\u201cQuick!\u201d hissed Jennie, pushing Arsyen into the nearest building.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3569\" name=\"3569\">She didn\u2019t care about Arsyen, but she did care about her orientation success rate. To date, she was the only Anahata receptionist who had completed all of her new employee tours without having a single employee fired.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3796\" name=\"3796\">Jennie found an empty meeting room and closed the door behind them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3f24\" name=\"3f24\">\u201cThat was close!\u201d she said. \u201cSorry, I should have explained earlier. My badge is white, but your badge is red.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7492\" name=\"7492\">\u201cRed is for special employees?\u201d asked Arsyen, puffing out his chest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c20c\" name=\"c20c\">\u201cI guess you could say that,\u201d shrugged Jennie. \u201cMost of the employees with red badges are contractors. Those are the employees we like\u2026but not so much as to give them health care\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know, like cafeteria workers and security guards. The other people who get red badges are like you\u200a\u2014\u200aprovisional employees who need to pass their first week. Anyway, the point is you\u2019ll need your badge to get into buildings, but the rest of the time you should hide it in your pocket.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"779b\" name=\"779b\">Jennie poked her head out the door. The engineer was pacing the hall. She shut the door and turned to face Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7012\" name=\"7012\">\u201cNever show fear. Engineers can smell it a mile away. Half of succeeding here is just acting like you\u2019re right about stuff even when you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f112\" name=\"f112\">Jennie glanced at Arsyen\u2019s HR sheet. He was assigned to Building 7, which housed some of the company\u2019s coolest projects, like Social Car and Builder. Maybe she could butter up to him and he could get her a job there. Though, on second thought, Arsyen seemed a little creepy and could misinterpret her intentions. The last thing Jennie needed was another work drama. A few weeks earlier she had made the mistake of hooking up with Niels Smeardon, Anahata\u2019s SVP of sales. She had done everything he wanted\u200a\u2014\u200atold him that his penis and sales strategy presentation were the biggest she had ever seen; she even let him balance his computer on her back so he could send a few urgent emails right after they had sex. And all of that had gotten her nothing but a reassignment by the HR team to the main reception area, far away from the sales buildings.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a038\" name=\"a038\">Jennie continued to stew about her Niels hookup as she began to rattle off other campus facts to Arsyen. Sales were in Buildings 10 to 15, Operations from 15 to 20, anything supporting those teams from 20 to 27, and facilities and janitorial staff in Building 28. She saw Arsyen nod when she mentioned the janitors and wondered if he was one of those social activist employees, the type who made six figures but liked to spend the majority of his work hours railing about The Man and trying to make the cafeterias go full vegan.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6292\" name=\"6292\">Jennie found those employees a bit annoying\u200a\u2014\u200athey were always complaining about the juice selection in the reception area\u200a\u2014\u200abut she still preferred them to people like Niels. He had taken home more than $100 million dollars last year in executive pay but hadn\u2019t even offered to order her a car ride home.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"039c\" name=\"039c\">\u201cWhat do you do at Anahata?\u201d asked Arsyen, interrupting Jennie\u2019s thoughts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"edb3\" name=\"edb3\">Was he just trying to make conversation, or was he questioning her competence? At Anahata, one could never be sure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"14bd\" name=\"14bd\">\u201cI\u2019m a campus guide and do some reception work,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important role, because if you don\u2019t have someone like me who shows new people around, they may never understand Anahata and could get lost.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe20\" name=\"fe20\">She paused and searched Arsyen\u2019s face for a reaction. It was totally blank, as if he wasn\u2019t even listening to her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b1bc\" name=\"b1bc\">\u201cOf course, I mean \u2018getting lost\u2019 both figuratively and literally,\u201d continued Jennie, feeling anger build in her stomach. \u201cMany of your lot only understand the latter point, not the former, and so you see, that is why we humanities majors are so valuable here.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d930\" name=\"d930\">Arsyen nodded but now seemed fixated on the Moodify bracelet on his wrist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c682\" name=\"c682\">Had he even heard a word she said? He was like the rest of them\u200a\u2014\u200afull of himself, convinced of his own brilliance, sure that a lowly receptionist was completely irrelevant to the mighty things he had to do during his day. But what did he know about the world, anyway? Coding didn\u2019t teach you about culture. It didn\u2019t teach you empathy or emotional intelligence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"67f6\" name=\"67f6\">\u201cI was a Russian lit PhD before I dropped out to join Anahata, so I know a lot about what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cThere are people starving, people who don\u2019t have clean water. So after Anahata, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do\u200a\u2014\u200achange some of those things. Or maybe I\u2019ll do it here. I haven\u2019t figured it out yet. The point is, do <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you</em> have a social conscience? A big purpose, Arsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d54\" name=\"8d54\">Arsyen looked up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4b6e\" name=\"4b6e\">\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI will save my people and kill very bad dictator.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b56\" name=\"5b56\">Good lord. This tour was proving even more tedious than her last one\u200a\u2014\u200aan engineer who made whale sounds out of his nose while they hid in a broom closet. She leaned out the door.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e576\" name=\"e576\">\u201cAll clear.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd1b\" name=\"cd1b\">She popped her head back in and pointed at Arsyen\u2019s badge to remind him to hide it in his pocket.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a0f3\" name=\"a0f3\">They made it safely to the other parts of the campus, each building revealing a well-orchestrated surprise for Anahata\u2019s new employee. Building 3 had frozen yogurt machines in each cubicle. In Building 4, there was a service for engineers who wanted someone to tuck them in at night in the campus beds. Building 2 had moving walkways that would reverse direction every fifteen minutes\u200a\u2014\u200aa challenge to either time one\u2019s movements precisely or exercise by moving against the current.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0f94\" name=\"0f94\">\u201cPast that door is the volleyball court,\u201d said Jennie, pointing just beyond the reversible walkway, \u201cand to the right is the swimming pool. Our founder, Bobby Bonilo, wanted to set an example for the rest of the Valley that health and fitness should be an important part of an employee\u2019s well-being.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"27bf\" name=\"27bf\">\u201cLike Galt,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7118\" name=\"7118\">Jennie shot Arsyen a glance. What kind of idiot joined Anahata and spent their first day talking about its biggest competitor?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c9da\" name=\"c9da\">\u201cAnahata did it <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">first</em>,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWe were the first to make health a priority. The first to say you should drink lots of water and get lots of sleep.

Nor were there any henchmen to wait on Arsyen, or maidens to help feed and clothe him. And there was certainly no one to help clean up after him. To think if his people knew that Arsyen was now cleaning the toilets of America!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aeee\" name=\"aeee\">It was never supposed to be like this. If the peasants hadn\u2019t gotten so mad about the potato tax, if the neighboring country of Embria hadn\u2019t sensed weakness and attacked from the north, Arsyen would still be in Poodlekek now, having his bottom wiped by the royal wiper, occasionally exerting himself at a game of croquet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6539\" name=\"6539\">But the Embrian barbarians had surrounded his family\u2019s palace, with Arsyen narrowly missing execution as he snuck across the border and into a U.N. refugee camp. The Pyrrhian military successfully restored the country to order, but just as Arsyen was prepared to return, General Korpeko declared a coup and foisted the helpless Aimo family from power.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"237e\" name=\"237e\">Arsyen was bounced between various immigrant detention camps, eventually ending up in California, where he was released into the wilds of Silicon Valley. There, he found work as a janitor in Stanford\u2019s chemistry department. Then, from there, on to a few small startups and eventually Galt. And now Anahata, where he would finally make his mark.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f05b\" name=\"f05b\">Arsyen glanced over at his future queen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0d0f\" name=\"0d0f\">Jennie\u2019s mouth was moving again. It seemed to move a lot. Arsyen knew that women liked the opportunity to speak, but beautiful women were most beautiful when they were silent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7423\" name=\"7423\">\u201cAnd so you can see,\u201d she was saying, \u201cthat the composting techniques developed in Russia in the early twentieth century had a profound impact in how we compost now in Palo Alto.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"118d\" name=\"118d\">\u201cYes,\u201d said Arsyen, looking down to see if their Moodify bracelets had finally synced.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d960\" name=\"d960\">They still weren\u2019t working.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6557\" name=\"6557\">Jennie stopped in front of another building. It was an echo of all previous buildings they had toured: an enormous white complex with a plain, charmless exterior. \u201cYour new home,\u201d she announced.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"18c8\" name=\"18c8\">Hadn\u2019t Jennie said janitorial services were in Building 28? This one had an enormous black \u201c7\u201d painted near its entrance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"38aa\" name=\"38aa\">The metal doors banged open, and a large group of men walked out, laughing about something. Arsyen had never seen such diversity\u200a\u2014\u200aso many white, Chinese, and Indian male janitors all working in the same company.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e1f9\" name=\"e1f9\">Behind them was another man, also white, walking slowly across the lawn, chomping on an enormous carrot. It was the same guy Arsyen had met at his interview. He had already forgotten his name, but the man\u2019s shirt reminded him: R-O-N-I, spelled out in big block letters sewn clumsily across the chest. This was him, the king of the cleaning crew.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"72e8\" name=\"72e8\">Roni greeted Arsyen with a wave. Arsyen turned to say something to Jennie, but she had already disappeared.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b92\" name=\"6b92\">Roni signaled to Arsyen to follow, pointing out different landmarks as they made their way around campus: \u201cHere\u2019s where you can pick up four different kinds of cupcakes each day at three p.m.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s the secret underground passageway that leads to the volleyball court.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s where you can get a full-body massage\u200a\u2014\u200aand if you book the tropical forest room, tell them no rainmaker!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d260\" name=\"d260\">Arsyen was amazed by the amenities, but he was even more excited about his paycheck. With the extraordinary salary they were paying him\u200a\u2014\u200aten times more than the job listing had originally advertised\u200a\u2014\u200ahis reclamation of Pyrrhia drew much, much closer. This year\u2019s salary alone would purchase twenty Pyrrhian mercenary troops and several thousand horses, as well as one million sacks of flour to be distributed to the poor (eight hundred thousand if he had his portrait printed on the sacks, which could be an important revolution/coup marketing strategy).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"23f2\" name=\"23f2\">If he kept on this path, he could reclaim the throne in just a few years. He could probably even fly Natia, his Pyrrhian internet girlfriend, out to the United States so he could finally have sex with her. Though maybe it would be better to dump Natia, date Jennie, and spend the extra money on some new video games. Being a ruler meant setting clear priorities.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"13a6\" name=\"13a6\">They walked down a nondescript hall that dumped them into a maze of cubicles. Each contained a handful of desks, and occasionally a table. The white walls were only shoulder height, and Arsyen could easily see who was inside. The view was the same no matter where he turned: square after square of men staring at their computer screens. The layout reminded him of ice cube trays.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f337\" name=\"f337\">Roni stopped next to a poster that read \u201cEntering a No Galt Zone!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a7bc\" name=\"a7bc\">\u201cVoil\u00e0!,\u201d exclaimed Roni, his arm gesturing at the cubicle before him like a game show host. Its simple layout mirrored that of every other cubicle they had passed. There were three desks\u200a\u2014\u200aonly two of which were occupied\u200a\u2014\u200aand a whiteboard covered in code hieroglyphs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a83\" name=\"5a83\">There were two men in the cubicle, but neither turned, continuing instead to focus intently on their screens. Arsyen wondered why his fellow sanitation engineers were working on computers, and why there were no cleaning materials anywhere in sight. Perhaps cleaning happened differently at Anahata. Thoughts of unknown methods immediately filled his head, his exhilaration only slightly tempered by the sight of Red Bull cans stacked in a pyramid atop a side table. Roni grabbed an unopened can and tossed it to Arsyen. \u201cLife blood,\u201d he joked, grabbing one for himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4bb9\" name=\"4bb9\">Roni tapped one of the cubicle dwellers on the shoulder.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5a75\" name=\"5a75\">\u201cJonas, meet Arsyen,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4413\" name=\"4413\">The seated figure turned slowly, and Arsyen realized that the gangly, pimply boy before him couldn\u2019t be more than sixteen. His skin was a shifting kaleidoscope of sallow and dark blotches. Enormous glasses covered his face from the eyebrows to the tip of the nose. Through the frames, his eyes studied Arsyen, and then moved to Roni, and then suddenly seemed to register the purpose of the introduction. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, in a thick but familiar accent. \u201cIt is nice to make your acquaintance. Arsyen\u200a\u2014\u200a<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">bish mena kakaya</em>?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e4e2\" name=\"e4e2\">Arsyen hesitated. The words, the accent, the singsong of the phrase all sounded so familiar, and yet he had no idea what the teenager had just said to him. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1e2e\" name=\"1e2e\">\u201cOh, my most sincere apologies,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI thought from your name\u2026you see, Arsyen is a name we have in my country, Embria. And your face could pass for Embrian.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f69\" name=\"5f69\">Arsyen\u2019s left eye twitched. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Embria!</em> The country that had started the Fifth Great War, the country responsible for having raped and pillaged his native land for thousands of years. The rivalry between the two countries was legendary. The greatest insult in the Pyrrhian language was to call someone a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">klok-klok</em>\u200a\u2014\u200aa chicken from Embria.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08f9\" name=\"08f9\">Arsyen offered his hand. \u201cI am from Pyrrhia,\u201d he said, proudly trilling the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">r</em>and making the sign of the red-breasted woodpecker.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"85b6\" name=\"85b6\">But Jonas\u2019 expression didn\u2019t change, as if it was simply an input of information, meaning no more to him than if Arsyen had said he was from Los Angeles. He turned back to his computer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4171\" name=\"4171\">Roni pointed to the desk across the room, where a very blond head sat atop a very long body.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"630e\" name=\"630e\">\u201cThat\u2019s Sven. He\u2019s from Sweden and is ex-Microsoft, but he\u2019s a bit embarrassed about that, so don\u2019t bring it up with him. He lives with his mom, which is another topic to avoid. But he\u2019s got a thousand startup ideas\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s always a safe subject.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5012\" name=\"5012\">Roni pulled the headphones off the blond mop of hair, and Sven swiveled his chair. He grinned and shook Arsyen\u2019s hand. Then he readjusted his headphones and banged his knees against the desk as he turned back to face his screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e7b9\" name=\"e7b9\">Roni pointed at an empty desk between Jonas and Sven. \u201cHere\u2019s your space.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c26\" name=\"1c26\">Arsyen\u2019s eyes ran across the desk. There was nothing on it but an enormous computer. He opened a drawer. No sponges, no commercial cleaning agents, no chemicals for him to mix.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fed4\" name=\"fed4\">\u201cRoni, where my supplies?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"87ef\" name=\"87ef\">\u201cOh, there\u2019s a tech center down the hall where you can get everything\u200a\u2014\u200aa mouse, big monitor, pens\u200a\u2014\u200aif you are one of those people who still writes things by hand, that is. Anyway, take your time getting set up. I\u2019ve got an important meeting to attend, but when I come back I\u2019ll get you briefed on everything.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0a15\" name=\"0a15\">Arsyen took a seat at his desk and studied the area around him. The floor throughout the cubicle was covered in potato chip particles\u200a\u2014\u200apresumably from the open bag on Sven\u2019s desk. A piece of dried putty had begun a slow, snail-like trudge down the wall above Jonas\u2019 desk. Across the room, a series of dark symbols glared at Arsyen from the whiteboard.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4079\" name=\"4079\">This was the messiest janitor\u2019s office he had ever seen.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"96f3\" name=\"96f3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"7936\" name=\"7936\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he first order of business was to get his cleaning supplies. Roni\u2019s instructions had seemed simple enough\u200a\u2014\u200astraight down the hall, a right at the first opportunity, then the second left. But no sooner had he made the first turn then Arsyen found himself lost in a labyrinth of cubicles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d61\" name=\"9d61\">He approached a map posted on the wall, tracing his finger along the rows in search of something resembling a supply closet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d861\" name=\"d861\">Arsyen felt a tap on his shoulder.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ace3\" name=\"ace3\">\u201cAre you lost?

The kid looked skinny and weak. Arsyen was sure he could outrun him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1e1e\" name=\"1e1e\">The kid\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7224\" name=\"7224\">\u201cOkay, then. I want to know all the words in English that have X as the second letter and N as the second to last.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0a97\" name=\"0a97\">Arsyen spotted an exit sign at the far end of the hall. He decided to make a run for it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ecfe\" name=\"ecfe\">\u201cHey! Hey!\u201d screamed the kid, yelling after him. \u201cTell me how you would make an object model of a pig!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"37d1\" name=\"37d1\">Arsyen dashed down the hall, the sound of the kid\u2019s plastic Crocs squeaking closely behind him. He pushed open the door, ran to his right, past the volleyball court, over a bridge made of Legos, dodged through a group of employees fighting with light sabers, and ducked into a nearby building.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6e60\" name=\"6e60\">Arsyen glanced behind him. The kid was nowhere in sight. He caught his breath and surveyed his surroundings.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"db16\" name=\"db16\">He hadn\u2019t been in this building before. It seemed largely empty\u200a\u2014\u200anothing more than a series of plain white corridors. There wasn\u2019t even anyone walking about.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a47\" name=\"7a47\">He spotted another building map and traced his finger down the corridors. At the end of the northwest hall was an exit door that appeared to lead in the direction of Building 7\u200a\u2014\u200aArsyen\u2019s building.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3489\" name=\"3489\">He headed in that direction, keeping an eye out for predatory engineers. But there wasn\u2019t a soul in sight.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"85dd\" name=\"85dd\">Just before reaching the exit, Arsyen stopped, and his face lit up in a smile. To his right was a white door labeled in simple black lettering: SUPPLY CLOSET</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0314\" name=\"0314\">Finally!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c9b0\" name=\"c9b0\">Arsyen paused before the door. This was a big moment. The tools he chose here would determine the success of his first week at Anahata. A lobby broom was a good choice for one-handed cleaning and getting at some of the trickier corners of Arsyen\u2019s cubicle. But a midsize broom would be better for general sweeping.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"56d9\" name=\"56d9\">He knew his co-workers would judge him closely for his choices, so he took a deep breath and placed his hand on the knob.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"9d1d\" name=\"9d1d\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"20f1\" name=\"20f1\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> the other side of the door, Gregor Guntlag\u2019s gaze alternated between the doorknob, which he thought he had seen rattle, and the clock, whose minute hand was broken. It wobbled between one tick and the next, as though no longer sure of the direction in which time moved.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"19e7\" name=\"19e7\">The existence of a clock on a wall of the world\u2019s most important technology company was itself a quaint reminder of a different era, a period in which time was measured differently, the various positions of its hands signifying official, institutionalized periods of work and rest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b7ab\" name=\"b7ab\">That clock\u200a\u2014\u200athe only one on campus\u200a\u2014\u200awas a crucial addition to the Anahata board room, aka the supply closet. The company\u2019s CEO, Bobby Bonilo, had forbidden the use of any electronic devices in the room, and the clock was the only way his management team could measure the progress of their interminable meetings. According to its current movements, one minute (soon to be minus one minute) had passed since Bobby had begun his latest yoga pose. Gregor Guntlag, Anahata\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, had many projects in the works to speed up time, but to date, even he couldn\u2019t manage to accelerate Bobby\u2019s sun salutations.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"979f\" name=\"979f\">\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa,\u201d came a deep, raspy sound from the back of Bobby\u2019s throat. He was on all fours at the head of the table, his butt thrust toward the ceiling, the top of his white shirt falling to expose a pale back covered with moles. Bobby rested his knees on the table and sat back on his legs, a small gut spilling over his waistband like freshly baked bread. His eyes remained closed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6332\" name=\"6332\">\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d The sound intensified. \u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa! Haaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"120d\" name=\"120d\">The daily management meeting was itself an exercise in yogic patience and discipline, with all five members of the team doing a generally poor job of tolerating each other.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c694\" name=\"c694\">Although they were a small group, the men spread themselves out around the table, allowing spaces of two or three chairs between them. In addition to Gregor, there was Old Al, the company\u2019s only gray-haired engineer, occasionally useful for his fifty-four years of wisdom. A few seats down sat Greg Fischer, the chief financial and corporate affairs officer (CFCAO), who ran all the departments\u200a\u2014\u200alegal, finance, marketing, and PR\u200a\u2014\u200athat were seen as necessary evils in helping run a large company. Equal in irrelevance was HR Paul, the head of the human resources department, who was generally regarded as a nincompoop psychology PhD with a flatulence problem. And then there was Niels, aka The Salesman.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a515\" name=\"a515\">The master engineer and the master salesman did not like each other, but today Niels seemed to be paying Gregor no attention. Gregor grimaced as Niels bent his gel-slicked head over the small notepad that he carried around in his front pocket. He found the mere existence of Niels\u2019 notepad an insult to the advances of technology and word processing software.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f6e\" name=\"8f6e\">Gregor had disliked Anahata\u2019s new head of advertising from the instant he spotted him on campus, a plastic smile fixed on his face, fancy designer suit falling from his shoulders like a second skin. With his wingtips pointed sharply in the direction of his target, Niels had approached Gregor to suggest the engineering team fix the advertising system interface so that Anahata\u2019s advertisers could more easily place their ads online. Gregor quickly informed Niels that Anahata was about its users first and foremost, and that its users\u200a\u2014\u200aand just as important, Anahata\u2019s engineers\u200a\u2014\u200adid not care about an improved advertising system. Implicit in his explanation was the unwritten philosophical hierarchy of Anahata: Engineers at the top, then users, and then, long after that, cheerleaders, janitors, creationists, and, finally, the Anahata sales team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e90\" name=\"3e90\">But Niels was slow on the uptake. He kept pushing for the change, eventually escalating the issue to Bobby. Bobby, in turn, sent Gregor and Niels an email asking them to speak to each other and not bother him with such small problems. Six years later, the two men still had not managed to do so. They only met in Bobby\u2019s management meetings, where they sat on opposite ends of the table and took opposing stances in almost any argument.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"55f9\" name=\"55f9\">\u201cHaaaaaaaaaa\u2026Haaaaaaaaaa\u2026Haaaaaaa\u2026Ha! Ha! Ha!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d862\" name=\"d862\">Suddenly, Bobby was on his feet, arms outstretched.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"802a\" name=\"802a\">\u201cOur minds are clear,\u201d he said, opening his eyes and bowing to his management team. Bobby sat down on top of the table, crossing his legs in the lotus position. \u201cLet us begin.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f7d7\" name=\"f7d7\">Just then, the door opened and a man entered, wearing an enormous grin.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3eaa\" name=\"3eaa\">Gregor thought he recognized this short, swarthy man, but he could not place him. The intruder also seemed confused: He scanned the room, past Gregor, past Niels, and landed on Bobby. His eyes bulged, the grin vanished, and he took a step back. His hand fiddled with the doorknob.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0be3\" name=\"0be3\">\u201cWait,\u201d said Bobby, looking him over. \u201cClearly you must be smart to have found me like this. I am elusive, you know. A bit like a panther\u200a\u2014\u200aif panthers were also progressive Buddhists.\u201d Bobby pawed the air with his claws.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d16d\" name=\"d16d\">The man nodded vigorously.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"33e2\" name=\"33e2\">Gregor\u2019s tongue roamed his mouth, searching for particles of stray food. He always brushed his teeth after lunch, but today he had lost track of time while troubleshooting a server issue with the infrastructure team. The lack of order in his mouth was mildly distressing\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like this intruder, who he wished would leave. Where had he seen him before?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b533\" name=\"b533\">\u201cI suppose you have joined us because you know of our open-door meeting policy,\u201d said Bobby, referring to a core Anahata principle that Gregor and the rest of the management team all actually hated.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c96c\" name=\"c96c\">\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Bobby asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3df3\" name=\"3df3\">\u201cArsyen Aimo,\u201d the man said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3740\" name=\"3740\">\u201cJoin us, Arsyen.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c378\" name=\"c378\">\u201cBut, Bobby, \u201d said Fischer, the CFCAO, \u201cwe have confidential things to discuss.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ec3b\" name=\"ec3b\">\u201cTrust is the cornerstone of truth. If we cannot trust our employees, our house will fall upon itself.\u201d Bobby turned to Arsyen and gestured at a seat at the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e952\" name=\"e952\">Arsyen took the chair closest to the door, gripping its arms oddly, rigidly, as if he were sitting on a throne. Suddenly Gregor recalled where he had seen him. This was the product manager candidate Roni had pointed out, the one from Galt. They had decided to hire him just to bleed Galt of some of its top talent. Over the past month, Anahata had lost several of its best engineers to the startup.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"23a4\" name=\"23a4\">Gregor gave Arsyen another look. He was still panting a bit; dark hairs peeked out from a very wet collar. He did not seem like an exceptional human being. Still\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1018\" name=\"1018\">\u201cWhat\u2019s up first?\u201d asked Bobby, turning to his assistant. She was in attendance that day as part of what Bobby called \u201cradical transparency,\u201d a philosophy that, while often cited by Bobby, seemed to be in effect only every third Thursday. His assistant leaned over and showed him a list\u200a\u2014\u200aand some generous cleavage.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3590\" name=\"3590\">\u201cOkay, everyone,\u201d said Bobby, nodding at her breasts. \u201cLet\u2019s show Arsyen what innovation looks like!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5517\" name=\"5517\">Bobby\u2019s assistant opened the door, and a product manager and his engineering team shuffled toward the table in an awkward, heaving lump. They kept their heads down, shooting furtive glances at Bobby as they prepared to present their work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4347\" name=\"4347\">The product manager coughed. \u201cWhen, um, we set out to design the new interface for Rovix, we had, uh, three goals in mind.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e556\" name=\"e556\">\u201cWhy do you need a presentation to tell me your goals?\u201d Old Al barked. \u201cKeep things simple. You don\u2019t need two hundred slides to tell me what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a0ed\" name=\"a0ed\">\u201cIt\u2019s just a few slides,\u201d the product manager mumbled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6fda\" name=\"6fda\">\u201cAl\u2019s right,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t tell us your idea in thirty seconds, it\u2019s not an idea. It\u2019s a presentation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6681\" name=\"6681\">The product manager closed his computer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6a12\" name=\"6a12\">\u201cSo, uh, there were three goals. First, to simplify the user interface. Second, to make it easier for people to share content across all of our products. And third, to ensure we had the right structure in place to eventually run ads next to the content\u200a\u2014\u200aif,\u201d his eyes darted over at Gregor, \u201cwe ever decided that was something we would want to do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"32a9\" name=\"32a9\">Gregor\u2019s radar shot to attention. Had they actually just suggested putting advertising on this product? Niels\u2019 team must have lobbied for it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9382\" name=\"9382\">\u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d said Old Al, shaking his finger at the team. \u201cBobby invented the concept of cloud computing on a high school cafeteria napkin twenty years ago. Big ideas should be simple. Napkinable.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f6e3\" name=\"f6e3\">\u201cHere,\u201d said Fischer, pulling a napkin out of his takeaway carton. \u201cUse this. Show us Rovix on a napkin.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"014c\" name=\"014c\">The product manager fumbled with his backpack and pulled out a pen. He began to draw on Fischer\u2019s napkin. Soon, the napkin had various arrows and bullet points scattered across it, in addition to a small glob of mayonnaise.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3249\" name=\"3249\">Bobby glanced at the drawing and frowned. \u201cArsyen, take a look and tell us what you would do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0ef0\" name=\"0ef0\">The napkin made its way down the table to Arsyen. His nose wrinkled as his fingers daintily pinched the clean edge.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e76a\" name=\"e76a\">\u201cSpeak up!\u201d shouted Old Al as he adjusted his hearing aid.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ad5a\" name=\"ad5a\">\u201cThrow it away,\u201d said Arsyen, pushing the napkin toward the middle of the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9e38\" name=\"9e38\">Bobby\u2019s eyes lit up, and he turned to the Rovix team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cd9f\" name=\"cd9f\">\u201cYou heard Arsyen. There\u2019s clearly something wrong with your product\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll leave you all to figure out what that is. But remember: Big ideas have simple solutions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a772\" name=\"a772\">\u201cAlso remember: Solutionize. Iterate. Solutionize. Iterate.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6ac0\" name=\"6ac0\">\u201cAnd really remember: Sometimes failure is success, and other times success is failure.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e88e\" name=\"e88e\">\u201cThank you,\u201d said the product manager, inclining slightly in a half-bow. He glanced at Old Al and then Gregor, likely hoping for additional feedback or some indication of whether the meeting had gone well. But Gregor wasn\u2019t in the mood to give feedback, and Old Al had fallen asleep.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c28\" name=\"1c28\">The assistant shut the door behind them, and Fischer belched noisily.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8c98\" name=\"8c98\">Gregor rolled his eyes. He found the whole lot of them to be idiots, minus Bobby and occasionally Old Al. But then he caught a similar disgust on Niels\u2019 face and recoiled. He would not permit himself to share an emotion with that man.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2408\" name=\"2408\">\u201cAre we done?\u201d Gregor asked. He needed to talk to Bobby, and no productive dialog could take place as long as The Salesman was around.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"da03\" name=\"da03\">Bobby\u2019s assistant consulted the agenda. \u201cWe have a proposal from Niels,\u201d she said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fbc3\" name=\"fbc3\">Niels flashed the assistant his best grin, then launched into his pitch.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"096c\" name=\"096c\">\u201cWe have a huge, untapped opportunity before us,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the chance to make over a billion dollars in the first year alone just by\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a2c9\" name=\"a2c9\">\u201cNiels, stop right there!\u201d Bobby yelped. \u201cDon\u2019t you see who is in the room? Arsyen!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a7b2\" name=\"a7b2\">Everyone turned in his direction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"64a3\" name=\"64a3\">The weight of the group\u2019s gaze seemed to sink Arsyen even lower in his chair\u200a\u2014\u200aan observation that did not displease Gregor. This Arsyen seemed to be a rather unremarkable individual. What had Galt seen in him? Had Gregor and Roni made a mistake in hiring him?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ca85\" name=\"ca85\">\u201cIt is inevitable that the rest of us must discuss it, but I don\u2019t know if our engineer should hear this kind of talk. You <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">are</em> an engineer, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"533f\" name=\"533f\">Arsyen nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5368\" name=\"5368\">Gregor shook his head but didn\u2019t say anything. Product managers were such frauds, always trying to pretend they were real engineers instead of MBAs with a few coding classes under their belts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"10f3\" name=\"10f3\">\u201cYou see, Arsyen,\u201d continued Bobby, \u201cwe\u2019re going to talk about money. Or more specifically, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">advertising</em>.\u201d Bobby spit out the last word like a piece of rotten food.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b7fa\" name=\"b7fa\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">That\u2019ll show him</em>, thought Gregor, shooting a smug glance at Niels.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"60f2\" name=\"60f2\">But Niels only smiled in response. His confidence enraged Gregor\u200a\u2014\u200aand fed his self-doubt. What if Bobby didn\u2019t really hate advertising <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">or</em> Niels? What if his disgust was just an act?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"db97\" name=\"db97\">\u201cBobby, you make an excellent point, as always,\u201d Niels said. \u201cBut I think it would be good for engineers like Arsyen to understand how the sales team funds<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>their innovations.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b51a\" name=\"b51a\">\u201cFine with me,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for our new employee to understand who really runs this company.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b9ad\" name=\"b9ad\">Gregor looked to Bobby, but the founder said nothing. He seemed to be distracted by some dirt underneath his fingernails.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd89\" name=\"dd89\">Niels introduced his proposal\u200a\u2014\u200aa project in which Anahata would run ads on Moodify bracelets. Within minutes, Gregor was on the attack. No matter what revenue projection or partnership expansion Niels raised, Gregor countered with the Anahata commandment to never hurt the user experience in the name of revenue.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d093\" name=\"d093\">Despite his reputation, Gregor was not actually opposed to advertising. He knew the company needed to make money, and, like Bobby, he himself was a very rich man thanks to Anahata\u2019s online ads. But Gregor was willing to put additional material gain aside in the name of thwarting his nemesis.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c56\" name=\"0c56\">After an extensive back-and-forth\u200a\u2014\u200aand a lengthy digression from Old Al, who had woken from his nap to explain how advertising had worked back before the internet was invented\u200a\u2014\u200athe battle finally puttered to a halt. Gregor wasn\u2019t sure he had won\u200a\u2014\u200aBobby had refused to make a decision and then closed his eyes to meditate\u200a\u2014\u200abut the frustrated look on Niels\u2019 face was satisfaction enough.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f021\" name=\"f021\">Fischer offered a temporary d\u00e9tente by raising an issue they had discussed the previous week: a newly released Galt productivity tool that reduced people\u2019s lengthy business presentations into a four-sentence sales pitch, thereby shortening business meetings and helping society advance capitalism at three times the current rate. It was nearly identical to a project Anahata was set to launch the following month. That Galt had beaten Anahata to market was no surprise: The startup had lured away two of Anahata\u2019s best productivity engineers the previous fall. In fact, it seemed that all of Anahata\u2019s work and thinking had made it into the final Galt tool.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9b9e\" name=\"9b9e\">\u201cI always said we would lose those engineers to Galt,\u201d growled Old Al, shaking a finger at HR Paul. \u201cWe knew they were getting calls from the recruiters every week, and we did nothing to stop it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"906a\" name=\"906a\">\u201cThat\u2019s not true Al, and I don\u2019t feel like you are speaking to me in a productive manner,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe gave them strong counteroffers, and even took one of their mothers on a hot-air balloon ride. But in the end, both said Galt was scrappier and less bureaucratic.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1ddd\" name=\"1ddd\">\u201cWe should sue Galt and show them they can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d Old Al retorted. \u201cThey\u2019ve already poached several of our top engineers, and now they\u2019re beating us to the market with products. We can\u2019t just sit by and let them do this. You know, back when I was at Bell Labs, we had a policy that\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"88d6\" name=\"88d6\">\u201cMy team,\u201d said Bobby, raising his palm to silence the group. Gregor glared at Niels across the room as Bobby counted aloud to five.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3a25\" name=\"3a25\">Bobby opened his eyes. \u201cWhen a duck grows big, people forget about its webbed feet. They forget that it can swim.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ec9f\" name=\"ec9f\">Gregor tried to remember whether Bobby had used this aphorism before.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f57\" name=\"2f57\">Bobby waited another minute for someone to respond, but Gregor didn\u2019t seem to be the only one who was lost. No one said anything. Finally, Bobby sighed loudly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d840\" name=\"d840\">\u201cThe fundamental issue here is Galt,\u201d he said. \u201cOur engineers are leaving us for Galt because they think it\u2019s faster and more innovative. Just look at Arsyen.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d5e\" name=\"4d5e\">All heads swiveled toward Arsyen, and the little man sunk lower in his chair.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c599\" name=\"c599\">\u201cArsyen, look up again for us. Good. Do you all see that\u200a\u2014\u200athe fear in his eyes? Watching us, watching the Rovix team just now, he has clearly been asking himself why he is working at Anahata. Isn\u2019t that right, Arsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aeeb\" name=\"aeeb\">Arsyen nodded vigorously.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1fe7\" name=\"1fe7\">Gregor still wasn\u2019t convinced the guy was that remarkable, but at least Arsyen was smart enough to know to agree with Bobby. Bobby was always right in the long run.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dcb3\" name=\"dcb3\">\u201cWe could add more of those organic juicers to each building?\u201d offered HR Paul. \u201cOr a pet hedgehog? Once you bond with them, you\u2019ll find it much harder to leave the company.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6785\" name=\"6785\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t about giving them more amenities,\u201d groaned Niels, rolling his eyes. \u201cOur engineers are spoiled enough as it is. You\u2019ll notice that none of the sales team has defected to Galt\u200a\u2014\u200adespite their recruiters trying to ambush my guys in the parking lots. It\u2019s because we run a tight ship in sales. We\u2019re not out there handing out free jet packs every day like engineering does. The only freebie I hand out is my book of master negotiator tips.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a015\" name=\"a015\">Niels waved a shiny copy of the red manual he issued to all sales employees.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f6b0\" name=\"f6b0\">\u201cThe reason you haven\u2019t lost many people to Galt is that sales will be the last to go,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cThe innovative minds go first. If ten percent of our sales workforce had gone to Galt\u200a\u2014\u200ainstead of our engineering staff\u200a\u2014\u200awe wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation right now.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ccc8\" name=\"ccc8\">Niels looked to HR Paul for support, but his colleague nodded in agreement with Gregor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"773f\" name=\"773f\">Niels turned to Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f473\" name=\"f473\">\u201cWe need to create more of a war mentality here. Wars are very productive for unity. Every Anahata employee should want nothing more than to kill Galt and rip their little startup hearts out. People need enemies. Enemies drive us forward.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ce95\" name=\"ce95\">Niels scanned the room, stopping on Gregor. His eyes narrowed to lizard slits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8722\" name=\"8722\">\u201cWrong,\u201d said Gregor, not breaking Niels\u2019 gaze. \u201cBobby\u2019s point is that if we want to remain the world\u2019s most innovative company, we have to keep our engineers. And to do that, we have to be fast. We have to let the engineers work on exciting projects, and in an environment where they and their projects are isolated from the temptations of Galt.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9245\" name=\"9245\">\u201cVery realistic,\u201d Niels said. \u201cLet\u2019s just put them on an island then.

He was sure Bobby chose the bathroom\u200a\u2014\u200awith its occasional disagreeable smells and sounds and the eventual, inevitable intrusion by an outsider\u200a\u2014\u200ato keep the length of any meeting to a minimum. This allowed him more time in his day to think of greater things. It was the mark of an exceptional leader.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e8dd\" name=\"e8dd\">Roni often recalled his first and only bathroom meeting with Bobby. Eight other employees had been present, each jockeying for position. They all wanted to stand next to him, near the hand dryer, but Roni beat them to it. Although the meeting lasted just four minutes and Bobby uttered only one sentence, they were a very long four minutes, and it was one very important sentence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b28\" name=\"6b28\">Ever since that day, Roni favored that same Building 3, southwest corner bathroom. Its gentle pale-blue walls and piped-in ocean sounds were the perfect setting for his daily hour-long meditation sessions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d33\" name=\"4d33\">With the stall door closed and his patchouli candle lit, Roni would lean back on the heated Japanese toilet seat, press the soles of his Crocs against the wall, close his eyes, and insert his finger into his nose. The dry Northern California air lent itself to large, easily removable finds, particularly during the days when the region was hit by the Diablo winds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"df6c\" name=\"df6c\">But today no amount of nostril exploration could ease the mild anxiety building within him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a9a\" name=\"4a9a\">When Roni first started at Anahata, he was one of its superstars, leading a project to do real-time monitoring of all of the world\u2019s nuclear hazards. People on campus called him \u201cRadioactive Roni,\u201d and someone even organized a Chernobyl-themed party in his honor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b50\" name=\"6b50\">He was now into his seventh year at Anahata. Roni was making a ton of money; all his needs were met. But he no longer felt a part of the in-crowd, privy to the hottest projects or latest internal gossip. He increasingly felt like the heart of the company was beating elsewhere. It was only a vague sense, but one akin to that of the young dragon slayer approaching the bridge, one careful step after another, the fog slowly clearing before him to reveal\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d09\" name=\"2d09\">Was it because he had recently become a Republican?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9a86\" name=\"9a86\">In any case, Roni was sure something was afoot. Gregor had recently installed biometric screening at the entrance to Building 1, and conversations between Building 1 employees abruptly stopped whenever Roni joined them at the company cafeteria.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6588\" name=\"6588\">The funny thing was that if you asked most Anahatis, Roni had a dream job. He was the technical lead of Social Car, one of the hottest, most anticipated projects at the company. But Roni had been at Anahata long enough to know a quirky project from a crucial one. And Social Car just felt a bit too much like the former. Roni wondered if it was just a distraction\u200a\u2014\u200aa deft sleight of hand by Bobby to divert attention from the true gamble of something much, much bigger taking form in Building 1.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d73\" name=\"8d73\">He had made a few passes to uncover the truth. One of Roni\u2019s friends worked in Building 1. He had proved impenetrable to inquiry, claiming he was just \u201ctinkering with the ads algorithm.\u201d Gregor had likewise stonewalled him, mentioning something about Building 1\u2019s commitment to \u201cbreakthrough enterprise software products.\u201d Roni was enough of a Valley veteran to know that when an engineer feigned enthusiasm for business software, he was either lying about the software or lying about being an engineer. And that couldn\u2019t have been more true than with Gregor Guntlag, who was well known for his dislike of business, sales, and anything connected to advancing the dirty affairs of capitalism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e867\" name=\"e867\">So Roni had thrown himself into other projects alongside his work on Social Car. Most notably, he had become the organizer of the company\u2019s quarterly hackathons, designed to bring engineers together from across the company to detect bugs and fix core software. But while he enjoyed mentoring the younger engineers, Roni was beginning to feel like an aging school dance chaperon who furnished the pizza and Red Bull and hung out awkwardly at the back of the hall. What he was doing didn\u2019t feel tangible or significant.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"31d1\" name=\"31d1\">Roni sighed and pumped his Crocs against the door in a pitter patter of plastic. He sighed again, and then again and again, beginning to enjoy the sound of his breath echoing through the bathroom. He imagined an audience beyond the stall door, sitting on the blue tiles, crowding in to listen to his wise words about an important engineering topic.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"465b\" name=\"465b\">\u201cLet me tell you the truth about cloud computing,\u201d Roni said aloud in mock tenor. \u201cThere is no cloud. It is a myth. Your data is actually in my nose. Right above the\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1a10\" name=\"1a10\">Roni stopped as he heard two voices outside the bathroom. The door opened, and Roni heard a shuffling of feet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8e50\" name=\"8e50\">\u201cHello? Is anyone here?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was vaguely familiar.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e0f7\" name=\"e0f7\">\u201cAll clear,\u201d said another voice, the accent thick, like a knife trying to find its way out of taffy. Roni recognized its owner immediately: Gregor Guntlag.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b71b\" name=\"b71b\">\u201cSo, like I was saying in the meeting,\u201d the first man said. \u201cLife extension.

No, the kind of army Gandhi would have had.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"66ae\" name=\"66ae\">\u201cBobby, I\u2019m not sure I understand.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"56ad\" name=\"56ad\">Roni\u2019s eyes popped.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed48\" name=\"ed48\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">It was Bobby\u200a\u2014\u200aof course! </em>Bobby was the only one in the company who could give Gregor orders; the only one who quoted Ghandhi and whose license plate read \u201cMAHATMA.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6659\" name=\"6659\">Roni heard footsteps cross the bathroom, like someone was pacing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3cbc\" name=\"3cbc\">\u201cYes, yes, our peaceful army <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">will</em> be armed,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cBut its arms will be technology, and therefore not arms, but also arms.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"971d\" name=\"971d\">\u201cI don\u2019t follow,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"994c\" name=\"994c\">Bobby sighed loudly, as if it was his eternal burden to explain himself. \u201cWhen we are ready to push the button on Project Y, we will need a group of engineers who will already be converts and will spread the word. And then, of course, we also need engineers like Jonas who will infiltrate the enemy\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2529\" name=\"2529\">Roni\u2019s Crocs nearly dropped from their perch at the sound of his employee\u2019s name.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f8c8\" name=\"f8c8\">Gregor replied, but one of them was now using the urinal and Roni couldn\u2019t make out the words. He leaned forward in his seat, careful to keep his feet suspended against the door. There were more unintelligible words. A urinal was flushed. Something knocked against something else. An object fell to the ground. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The drama! What next?</em> He heard the faucets running, footsteps exiting, and the door closing. Roni was alone again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5044\" name=\"5044\">Roni\u2019s mind raced across and above and behind itself, the idea of a mysterious Project Y bolting about in his head, ricocheting off his skull, toward his ear, past Jonas\u2019 name. But no matter how he fit the bits together, he couldn\u2019t make sense of it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4921\" name=\"4921\">He started over. There was something called Project Y\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe that was the secret thing happening in Building 1. Project Y needed to build an army. And they needed people like Jonas to infiltrate \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Why didn\u2019t they want Roni? Roni had a black belt in karate. It was from when he was twelve, but still.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0193\" name=\"0193\">They couldn\u2019t know that he was on to them. Roni stood on the toilet seat and used his Swiss army knife to quickly loosen the bolts on the ventilator above his stall. Stepping onto the toilet tank, he lifted himself into the air shaft and onto his belly. He began to shimmy his way forward in the darkness. Roni had done this once before\u200a\u2014\u200amany years earlier, when he misinterpreted his manager\u2019s instructions to build a product in \u201cstealth mode.\u201d He knew this shaft would eventually take him to the building\u2019s northern corner, where he could safely drop down through another bathroom.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"79a8\" name=\"79a8\">The metal shaft felt cool against his stomach, and Roni moved through it with greater ease than he had remembered. All the apocalypse survival training he had been doing during the weekends was paying off.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9781\" name=\"9781\">But Roni was on edge. He could feel his fingers tingling, hear his heart pumping in the stifling air around him. Project Y was so close! And yet he had nothing but a trail of vague clues. He was following a thread through the dark labyrinth, the derisive laugh of his elusive dragon echoing through the air shafts.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"7875\" name=\"7875\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"a402\" name=\"a402\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"6e0e\" name=\"6e0e\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>rsyen burst into the cubicle, eager to tell Sven and Jonas all about his encounter with the famous Bobby Bonilo. But his co-workers faced their screens in silence. The only acknowledgment of his presence was an open can atop the Red Bull pyramid, which rattled left and right, then plummeted toward the carpet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6ca1\" name=\"6ca1\">\u201cHello, hello!\u201d boomed a voice from the corridor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"02a3\" name=\"02a3\">Roni entered the cubicle and made a beeline for the whiteboard. He grabbed an eraser and began wiping away the graffiti. Arsyen breathed a sigh of relief; finally, they were going to clean.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c31f\" name=\"c31f\">Instead, Roni motioned for Arsyen to approach.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fbe2\" name=\"fbe2\">\u201cI want to tell you about our super-duper top-secret project.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"94bc\" name=\"94bc\">A few years earlier, Anahata unveiled a driverless car that drove itself while the passenger sat, hands free, in the front or back seat. The project gained tons of attention in the press, and even Arsyen had heard of it. But he didn\u2019t understand the excitement. His father had invented an equally effective driverless car decades ago in Pyrrhia\u200a\u2014\u200aroyal chariots, entirely voice activated, that traveled on the backs of a pack of corgis imported from England.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4acc\" name=\"4acc\">Roni said their team had been assigned the next stage of the driverless car project. It was called \u201cSocial Car,\u201d internal code name: \u201cPad Thai.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ccba\" name=\"ccba\">While the passenger relaxed in the car, enjoying a stress-free commute, a console would announce who was sitting in the nearby vehicles. Profile photos of the other passengers would pop up, along with additional information like profession and gender. Passengers could also easily chat and message each other directly through the console.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"92c7\" name=\"92c7\">In short, Anahata was making the car journey a social experience.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ef6a\" name=\"ef6a\">\u201cOr as Bobby has put it,\u201d Roni said, \u201cwe\u2019re improving humankind by eliminating loneliness.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7ca0\" name=\"7ca0\">Arsyen wanted to ask why someone wouldn\u2019t prefer to just wait to talk to other people at their destination, but he decided that was one of those stupid questions Jennie had warned him not to ask. After all, why would the team build something that wasn\u2019t needed?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c01d\" name=\"c01d\">What worried him more was just how a sanitation engineer fit into the project. From the way Roni described it, Arsyen didn\u2019t see any janitorial work needed for Social Car\u200a\u2014\u200aunless, that is, he was supposed to clean the cars before they launched.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2581\" name=\"2581\">\u201cRoni, what do I clean here?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"97f6\" name=\"97f6\">\u201cWell, the real dirty work is for them,\u201d said Roni, nodding in the direction of Sven and Jonas. \u201cAs you know, being a P.M. is more about leading than doing. Your role is mainly to keep things organized, keep everyone focused, and lead the final polishing of the product. You know, the same stuff you did at Galt. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take the lead for now, until you have the hang of things.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b3d\" name=\"5b3d\">Sven and Jonas scooted their chairs toward the whiteboard. Arsyen noted the computers on their laps and followed their lead, but the machine balancing on his thighs felt less like a work accessory than the physical weight of his doubt. Roni had said he would be polishing Social Car, but Arsyen had yet to spot a single microfiber cloth or tub of wax. And what was this P.M. title Roni kept referring to\u200a\u2014\u200apoop manager? Arsyen would draw the line at poop; there were some things a prince should never, ever do.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3f2b\" name=\"3f2b\">Roni cleared his throat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"620a\" name=\"620a\">\u201cOkay, guys, to recap: Car A detects someone in Car B.

I am very capable of processing many things simultaneously.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6c7d\" name=\"6c7d\">\u201cWell,\u201d Roni was saying, \u201cwe just make sure that when your car speeds up, it never goes beyond ten miles per hour above the speed limit. That way, you shouldn\u2019t get a ticket.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4b58\" name=\"4b58\">\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that</em>,\u201d said Sven, shaking his head. \u201cWhat I mean is the real problem is how to decide whether the Car B passenger is actually attractive enough for Car A to risk the speeding ticket.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"23f8\" name=\"23f8\">\u201cAh, got it, got it,\u201d said Roni, turning to the whiteboard and writing \u201cAttraction Index.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6278\" name=\"6278\">\u201cWe\u2019ll need to work that into the algorithm, but that shouldn\u2019t be hard. We take your profile information, and from your height, weight, and so on, we assign you a wellness score. And then we combine that score with an attractiveness score that will use your photo, measured against the Symmetry Enhancement project.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d436\" name=\"d436\">Roni turned to face the group, and Arsyen noticed an inkspot the size of a baby\u2019s fist quickly spreading across his shirt pocket. Roni\u2019s white shirt was going to be ruined. Arsyen signaled with his hand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b4a9\" name=\"b4a9\">\u201cOh, sorry, Arsyen, I should have explained. Symmetry Enhancement is a project we have to make all images on the web look better. That way, the world just looks nicer to people. We mainly use it for low-resolution images\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"739b\" name=\"739b\">\u201cAnd porn,\u201d said Sven, turning to Arsyen. \u201cDid you know that most women\u2019s breasts aren\u2019t symmetrical? Our tool fixes that.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c92\" name=\"1c92\">Roni\u2019s face flushed, but he pressed on. \u201cBut the cool thing is you can also use Symmetry Enhancement on people\u2019s faces. We can calculate how symmetrical your face is, then make adjustments to give it better symmetry. For Social Car, we wouldn\u2019t redo your entire face, but we could just do the first part of calculating symmetry, since it\u2019s a proxy for attractiveness. That would feed into the algorithm and determine whether the person in the other car is worth the risk associated with speeding. So, if the person is significantly uglier than you, then your car slows down and tries to match up with a new car. But if the person is on par or better looking, then it\u2019s all systems go.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1bc3\" name=\"1bc3\">\u201cWe could eventually monetize the symmetry feature,\u201d said Jonas, without looking up from his computer. \u201cFor example, we could make you more attractive to other passengers if you paid to have your image adjusted.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"89d1\" name=\"89d1\">Roni stiffened. \u201cJonas, let\u2019s not talk about money. Our goal is to build a great product for our users.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0d28\" name=\"0d28\">Arsyen was catching bits and pieces of his colleagues\u2019 words, but nothing made much sense. Meanwhile, Roni\u2019s stain was pushing into new territory, now working its way toward his armpit. But he seemed totally unaware, or if he was aware, he simply didn\u2019t care, his hands jumping about as he got increasingly excited about the conversation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a0c5\" name=\"a0c5\">\u201cWe combine all these factors\u200a\u2014\u200ayour attractiveness, your healthiness, and so forth\u200a\u2014\u200aand we create a matching algorithm that puts your car in touch with the people you want to meet\u200a\u2014\u200athe people you don\u2019t mind getting a speeding ticket for.\u201d Roni paused. \u201cI guess that means ugly and unhealthy people won\u2019t get to talk to anyone, but maybe that\u2019s a good thing for society in the long run?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"77ae\" name=\"77ae\">Roni turned and made a few new marks on the whiteboard, his various lines and symbols now abutting his crude car drawings like primitive weapons.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8469\" name=\"8469\">Arsyen placed his fingers on his temples and moved them in slow circles, closing his eyes and then reopening them. The black hole on Roni\u2019s shirt gaped at Arsyen like the mouth of a hungry Pyrrhian orphan. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Save me, Arsyen!</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"63d4\" name=\"63d4\">\u201cMake them all disappear,\u201d he whispered in Pyrrhian. \u201cMake them disappear.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0204\" name=\"0204\">It was a chant that had always proven effective in Pyrrhia. Servants and peasants alike vanished whenever Arsyen issued the command.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6068\" name=\"6068\">He opened his eyes. The problem was still there; dashes and numbers on the board seemed to be converging. And Roni was still talking nonsense.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7f66\" name=\"7f66\">\u201cLuckily we have our new product manager here\u2026Arsyen? Arsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d44d\" name=\"d44d\">Roni was pointing a whiteboard marker in Arsyen\u2019s direction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d9b9\" name=\"d9b9\">\u201cArsyen, why don\u2019t you give us a P.M.\u2019s opinion on all this?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2bd3\" name=\"2bd3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Product manager.</em> So that\u2019s what a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">P.M. </em>was.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"abad\" name=\"abad\">Arsyen had heard the title before.

They were both incredibly pale, like their faces had never seen the sun. Because, of course\u200a\u2014\u200athey were engineers. And he was their product manager. The person who managed the product.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0701\" name=\"0701\">They were going to figure it out and fire him. And if he was fired, he would lose everything\u200a\u2014\u200athe chance to feed all of those hungry Pyrrhian orphans, the chance to liberate his country from tyranny, the chance to speak to his girlfriend without the aid of an internet chat application.

Besides, how hard could it be to be a product manager? For decades, Arsyen had watched his father manage a country; he could certainly manage a bunch of talking cars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9cdd\" name=\"9cdd\">Arsyen sat up tall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"12be\" name=\"12be\">\u201cBe clear on problem,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4cd2\" name=\"4cd2\">\u201cRight, right, I should be more specific,\u201d Roni nodded. He pointed at his drawing of Car A.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"91ef\" name=\"91ef\">\u201cAt this point, my car has detected a cute woman around me.

Sound good?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ef9\" name=\"9ef9\">Arsyen nodded calmly, but inside he was anything but.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f1af\" name=\"f1af\">\u201cExcuse me, bathroom!\u201d he shouted, and leaped up from his seat, dashing into the men\u2019s room across the hall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8437\" name=\"8437\">He locked himself in one of the stalls and pulled out his phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e72f\" name=\"e72f\">Arsyen looked up \u201cproduct manager\u201d on the internet and, after a few minutes of reading, felt his confidence return.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd3f\" name=\"fd3f\">There was really no reason to worry. Product managers were apparently in charge of the big picture, deciding why a product was needed, what it would be, and how the company could bring it to life. As one blog post put it:</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e28c\" name=\"e28c\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">As a product manager, you are tasked with leading a team and bringing an idea to life.

But then he reconsidered: Other than the receptionists, he had yet to meet any women at Anahata. He probably didn\u2019t need to worry about being treated like one of them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5621\" name=\"5621\">Arsyen skimmed a few more blogs, trying to memorize the P.M.\u2019s language\u200a\u2014\u200awords like \u201caction items,\u201d \u201cB2B solutions,\u201d and \u201cuse cases,\u201d and then something mystic called a \u201croadmap,\u201d which as far as Arsyen could tell had little to do with either roads or maps. There was an even greater obsession with \u201calignment,\u201d a concept Arsyen struggled with as his translation app told him that the equivalent word in Pyrrhian was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">pokaya</em>, meaning to place the chicken coop parallel to one\u2019s home.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd97\" name=\"fd97\">Suddenly there was a banging on the stall door.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"449c\" name=\"449c\">\u201cArsyen?

Only senior engineers get to work in the bathroom. Roni has some sort of roadmap question for you, so come on back.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aaf0\" name=\"aaf0\">Arsyen washed his hands and returned to the cubicle, armed with his new vocabulary.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"72f8\" name=\"72f8\">When Roni asked Arsyen about prioritization, Arsyen asked, \u201cIs this on the roadmap?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d99\" name=\"9d99\">When Sven suggested adding images of attractive women to the car dashboard, Arsyen rubbed his chin.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6c6a\" name=\"6c6a\">\u201cDoes this align with our strategy?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b10\" name=\"6b10\">When all three looked to him for an opinion in how best to implement Symmetry Enhancement, Arsyen stood and put his hands on his hips.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cf2f\" name=\"cf2f\">\u201cDoes this align with the strategy on our roadmap?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"865f\" name=\"865f\">No one seemed to notice anything was amiss.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>If anything, it seemed like product managers just asked questions that other people had to answer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2106\" name=\"2106\">\u201cGood brainstorm, everyone. Let\u2019s break for lunch,\u201d Roni said. \u201cOh, and Arsyen, this is still very confidential, so let\u2019s get this whiteboard cleaned off.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"727c\" name=\"727c\">Arsyen jumped up and began to wipe the whiteboard clean as Sven and Jonas scooted their chairs back to their desks. Arsyen was pleased that product managers seemed to have some janitorial tasks in their role.

In some parts of the world, people were already learning to text, and their thumbs were growing ganglia. People\u2019s brains had begun to function differently! You clearly came of age in a different world\u200a\u2014\u200aone that doesn\u2019t know latency or patience.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f5ad\" name=\"f5ad\">\u201cI am disappointed by this conversation and am done speaking for now,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cPlease carry on by yourselves.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fa52\" name=\"fa52\">He stabbed his fork into his pile of noodles, then began twirling them with great concentration.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"04b5\" name=\"04b5\">Arsyen felt as though he himself were in a video game, his life meter, a flashing red heart, beeping at low levels as he desperately searched for a wizard or magic plant to replenish his strength.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f0b5\" name=\"f0b5\">He silently cursed his mother. As a child, Arsyen repeatedly asked her for a video game console, but she refused, claiming the nobility should focus on croquet, not cartoons dancing across a screen. She was lucky the king hadn\u2019t allowed Arsyen to send her to the dungeon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f169\" name=\"f169\">Arsyen breathed deeply and closed his eyes, willing his heartbeat to slow. If he could just keep his P.M. job long enough to become a permanent employee, he could eventually have his army behead Sven and Jonas.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf1c\" name=\"bf1c\">Arsyen lingered over the image of a guillotine snapping Jonas\u2019 neck until he felt his pulse steady. He opened his eyes. His co-workers were staring at him, expecting something. Arsyen needed to redirect the conversation\u200a\u2014\u200amake them do the talking rather than him. He turned toward Sven, who was clearly an easier target than Jonas.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ae04\" name=\"ae04\">\u201cRoni says you have startup project?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8582\" name=\"8582\">Sven brightened and reached for a fry on Arsyen\u2019s plate. \u201cTwo, actually. The first is called Fingerbell. It\u2019s like a dumbbell, but on your mobile phone. You try to move an animated weight up the screen by using one finger. With each level, the resistance increases and it gets harder to move the weight.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"53e1\" name=\"53e1\">\u201cBut why\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5137\" name=\"5137\">\u201cBecause there\u2019s a real obesity problem in this country these days. Fingerbell is about revolutionizing exercise\u200a\u2014\u200astarting with your fingers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4293\" name=\"4293\">\u201cHow it make money?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe6f\" name=\"fe6f\">Sven threw up his hands. \u201cWhat world do you live in, Arsyen? Jonas, are you listening to this?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"939c\" name=\"939c\">Jonas ignored them. He now seemed preoccupied with separating his noodles into individual pods on his plate.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4a1e\" name=\"4a1e\">\u201cHere\u2019s how it works,\u201d said Sven, leaning in. \u201cAll you have to do is come up with an idea for a startup, build it, and get users. The important thing is that your users are growing\u200a\u2014\u200aeven better if you can tell everyone your growth is exponential.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4502\" name=\"4502\">\u201cIt is rare that anything is truly exponential,\u201d said Jonas, suddenly looking up. \u201cMost growth is linear, but then most people are stupid.\u201d He lowered his head again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"90f3\" name=\"90f3\">\u201cNext,\u201d said Sven, \u201ca venture capitalist sees all this growth and they start doling out cash like it\u2019s candy. You get rich before you\u2019ve even proven your product can make money. Then a big company like Anahata comes along and buys your startup. Sometimes it\u2019s just to acquire your employees\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can make millions of dollars if you just tell people you employ experts in A.I. and machine learning. Computer security, biohacking, and micro-algae are also good areas. Worse comes to worst, you just tell people you\u2019re making robots\u200a\u2014\u200athere isn\u2019t a single CEO in the Valley who doesn\u2019t get a hard-on over robots.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6108\" name=\"6108\">\u201cNow, if you\u2019re really lucky, the company isn\u2019t after your employees but your actual product. They want to buy it so they can kill it and keep you from competing with them. That\u2019s where you really get into the big money. And, yeah, it kind of sucks that all your hard work and years of no sleep and sex will be destroyed, but hey, you\u2019re rich now, and you can go and invest money in things you really care about, like food security cameras or currency for sea animals or\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5128\" name=\"5128\">\u201cBikek,\u201d said Jonas, looking up. \u201cBikek is the capital of Embria. It has a temperate climate, and in its surrounding mountains one can grow delicious apples in the winter. Embria boasts a modern railway system, as well as three national highways and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5e69\" name=\"5e69\">\u201cNo one wants to hear about the transportation system in your obscure country,\u201d said Sven, rolling his eyes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1e8b\" name=\"1e8b\">Jonas scowled, but Arsyen saw an opportunity to score a point with his co-worker.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"96d6\" name=\"96d6\">\u201cYour English good, Jonas,\u201d said Arsyen, trying out his Magnanimous Leader smile.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e78e\" name=\"e78e\">Jonas nodded, his eyes lifting slightly from his tray.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f8a4\" name=\"f8a4\">\u201cHis English gets better each day,\u201d Sven said. \u201cIt\u2019s like training a machine learning model. Correct him once and he doesn\u2019t repeat the mistake.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4152\" name=\"4152\">\u201cThat is the goal,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c345\" name=\"c345\">\u201cYou come to America for school?\u201d Arsyen asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"136d\" name=\"136d\">Jonas shook his head, his eyes still fixed on his tray.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ed40\" name=\"ed40\">\u201cThere is a video about it online,\u201d interjected Sven. \u201cBasically, Jonas was like a mad-scientist teenager genius working out of his parents\u2019 apartment. He built a computer by looking at the stars and calculating from the astrological patterns how he could construct a mainframe.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5d5f\" name=\"5d5f\">\u201cSven\u2026,\u201d began Jonas, lifting his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e1e\" name=\"7e1e\">\u201cAnd then there was a documentary filmmaker from the BBC who happened to be in town filming the plight of some rare yak in Bikek. He was staying at the hotel across the street on the day Jonas hooked his computer up and started a fire that nearly burned down his apartment building. Overnight, Jonas became the most famous boy in Embria, and Anahata, which has its Progressa program\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a59d\" name=\"a59d\">\u201cProgressa?\u201d asked Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bc5d\" name=\"bc5d\">\u201cProgressa brings technology to poor people like Jonas,\u201d said Sven. \u201cThey are begging for food and water, and Progressa shows up with a computer and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2cf5\" name=\"2cf5\">\u201cThat is incorrect,\u201d Jonas said. He turned toward Arsyen. \u201cProgressa is the philanthropic branch of Anahata, designed to tackle the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian problems.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8269\" name=\"8269\">\u201cAnd so young Jonas got on a boat\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d began Sven.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f442\" name=\"f442\">\u201cAn airplane, actually.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"eedf\" name=\"eedf\">\u201cAn airplane, and came to the United States of America. Where loving Anahata taught him to program.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e3a8\" name=\"e3a8\">\u201cWe will not discuss my situation further,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cArsyen, I suggest you ask about Sven\u2019s other startup idea if your hope is to have a conversation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"68cb\" name=\"68cb\">\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Sven said. \u201cThis one\u2019s almost as good as Fingerbell. It\u2019s gonna make me rich.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2ce5\" name=\"2ce5\">He pulled out his mobile phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"56be\" name=\"56be\">\u201cI wanted to solve a problem that all of us have: getting rid of things we don\u2019t want to do.

The word \u201cDogtown\u201d emerged, written in light blue across a black background. Underneath, a cartoon dog with a bone in its mouth looked out lovingly from the screen, its tail wagging back and forth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6846\" name=\"6846\">\u201cWe all have problems we don\u2019t want to deal with ourselves\u200a\u2014\u200alike laundry. So what I\u2019ve done is create an app that helps you outsource <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">everything</em>. You list your problem and then send it out into the Dogtown community. Whatever dog\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s what I call our members\u200a\u2014\u200awants to do the task, he responds to \u2018fetch\u2019 it for you, and you work out the details. Then you pay him in dog food.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7f29\" name=\"7f29\">\u201cDog food?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fe91\" name=\"fe91\">\u201cWell, money. On the app, money is called \u2018dog food.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22e4\" name=\"22e4\">Arsyen liked the idea of outsourcing his battle to reclaim Pyrrhia. Someone else could just go off and do it for him, leaving Arsyen to play video games and hang out in California until Pyrrhia was ready for him. The laundry scenario, however, seemed complicated.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a6d3\" name=\"a6d3\">\u201cSo, someone come to my apartment, wash my clothes, wait while clothes dry\u2026seem easier for me to do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3e84\" name=\"3e84\">\u201cYou just need to embrace the concept of outsourcing your life,\u201d Sven said. \u201cThere may be a few people in your house, but once you accept that they are there to perform a function that ultimately benefits you, they are just there\u200a\u2014\u200alike moving furniture. I mean, I just used Dogtown a few hours ago, right Jonas?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f7ec\" name=\"f7ec\">Sven waved a fry below Jonas\u2019 nose, and the teenager looked up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1988\" name=\"1988\">\u201cThis morning, Jonas was slurping his Red Bull so loudly I could hear it through my headphones. So I sent out a call on Dogtown to ask someone to take care of it for me. A guy in San Francisco saw my request, I gave him Jonas\u2019 email address, and the guy emailed him telling him to shut up. Worked like a charm.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4bed\" name=\"4bed\">\u201cBut he sit next to you. You can just tell him or send him email,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ccdf\" name=\"ccdf\">\u201cI consider myself a pacifist. I don\u2019t like conflict.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8622\" name=\"8622\">Arsyen nodded but didn\u2019t really understand. Conflict in the janitor community was always solved through direct conversation. And sometimes mop fights. But never through an app. What kind of person would think it was better to argue over the internet rather than speak directly?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3de1\" name=\"3de1\">\u201cBy receiving an email, I was able to process the information quickly and stop slurping,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cIf Sven had stopped my work to speak with me, I would have found it quite disrupted.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4fbc\" name=\"4fbc\">\u201cDisrup<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tive</em>,\u201d Sven corrected.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"661a\" name=\"661a\">\u201cDisrup<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tive</em>,\u201d Jonas repeated. \u201cTechnology is disrup<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">tive</em>, but I, Jonas, do not like to be disrup<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ted</em>.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c86f\" name=\"c86f\">\u201cVery good,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNow if we can just tell that brainiac processing center of yours to incorporate some contractions into your English, it will be flawless.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3069\" name=\"3069\">\u201cWe have discussed this previously,\u201d Jonas sighed. \u201cContractions are not elegant. Moreover, many times they are grammatically incorrect. I will not have my speech sullied by\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d Jonas\u2019 eyes caught sight of something in the distance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"db2b\" name=\"db2b\">\u201cHe is here,\u201d Jonas whispered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"06c5\" name=\"06c5\">Sven turned and gasped. \u201cWhat do you think he will eat?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"444c\" name=\"444c\">\u201cWho?\u201d Arsyen asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2e3e\" name=\"2e3e\">\u201cBobby Bonilo,\u201d they answered in unison.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f83\" name=\"1f83\">Arsyen scanned the entrance and quickly pinpointed the object of their attention, not because the figure was remarkable or distinguished in any way, but rather because the effect of the man\u2019s presence was universal. The cafeteria fell silent. Those waiting at the stands of Fried Fred\u2019s pushed themselves against the buffet rails to allow ample room for the man to pass. Mouths froze in mid-sentence. Hamburgers were forgotten on their plates.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9df1\" name=\"9df1\">It was the second time that day Arsyen found himself in the presence of Anahata\u2019s elusive founder.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5164\" name=\"5164\">Bobby stopped at the Mexican food stand and surveyed its offerings. He dipped a finger into the guacamole bowl, and the chefs held their breath, waiting for his verdict. Showing no reaction, he then continued on to the sushi bar, then the Asian fusion stand, at one point looking as though he was set to take a dumpling. Then he abruptly turned on his heel and walked three steps to the salad bar. Arsyen could hear Jonas\u2019 legs shaking under the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"627d\" name=\"627d\">Bobby circled the salad bar once clockwise, then stopped and changed direction. Finally, he picked up a bagel, nodded as though in communication with the tub of cream cheese in the buffet, and glided out of Fried Fred\u2019s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"432c\" name=\"432c\">As soon as the door closed behind him, the cafeteria exploded in sound.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bf97\" name=\"bf97\">\u201cWow, do you know who that was?\u201d Sven asked Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"15bd\" name=\"15bd\">Arsyen nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f16f\" name=\"f16f\">Frankly, he didn\u2019t get the fuss. Sure, Bobby Bonilo\u2019s story was impressive\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had started Anahata from his college dorm, convinced a rich guy to invest in his idea, and, a few years later, became a trillionaire. But Bobby\u2019s physical appearance was utterly ordinary, with a pale, slightly puffy face falling into a neck that connected to the gently disintegrating body of a man approaching middle age. He looked nothing like the pictures Arsyen had seen in magazines. There, Bobby\u2019s chiseled face seemed straight out of a cologne ad. He was always dressed in white T-shirts that showed off massive biceps, and in more than one article, a small glow circling the top of his brown, curly hair gave the impression of a celestial aura.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f842\" name=\"f842\">\u201cEveryone so quiet. Do people not talk to him?\u201d Arsyen asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bb4e\" name=\"bb4e\">\u201cWell, you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">can</em> talk to him. But he speaks in puzzles,\u201d Sven said. \u201cNot everyone is capable of understanding him. So, if you\u2019re going to talk to him, you just better make sure that what you have to say is really, really smart. Like the smartest thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3358\" name=\"3358\">\u201cBobby <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is </em>Anahata,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cHe created it, built it, runs it. He is a genius. And seeing him here is a momentous occasion. Most of the time he is in Building 1. That is the locked building. It is said, \u2018No one goes in, and no one comes out.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"04fb\" name=\"04fb\">\u201cThough of course they do,\u201d Sven jumped in. \u201cBut it\u2019s really only the senior engineers that are allowed in there. I heard Bobby decided to get rid of all the chairs and desks in Building 1. He said they stopped people from thinking. So everyone works standing up, roaming about and having their thoughts collide in the hallways. It\u2019s supposed to encourage innovation and collaboration. And phones\u200a\u2014\u200athere are desk phones\u200a\u2014\u200athough of course they are placed on the floor since there are supposedly no desks. Bobby apparently had them installed to encourage people to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">speak</em> to each other.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"81e7\" name=\"81e7\">\u201cI heard that all responses to questions in Building 1 have to start with \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d Jonas added. \u201cYou are not permitted to say no unless you have said yes first, because Bobby believes that if you start from believing things are not possible, nothing will ever be achieved.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"46f9\" name=\"46f9\">\u201cIt\u2019s one of the ten Anahata commandments,\u201d Sven said. \u201cThey\u2019re like the company\u2019s guiding principles. One of them is to always start with the word \u2018yes.\u2019 And the rest, well, there is one about speed, and another about innovation\u2026and putting our users first\u2026oh, and changing the world. We must improve humankind!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1827\" name=\"1827\">\u201cHumankind?\u201d Arsyen didn\u2019t recognize the word. Did Anahata want to make humans be kinder to each other? That sounded like something a silly communist would dream up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1303\" name=\"1303\">\u201cBobby believes that with every product, we should be able to ask ourselves what serious world problem we are solving.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d7a6\" name=\"d7a6\">Arsyen immediately thought of Moodify and the scores of Anahata products that largely just seemed to exist to waste time and have fun.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ad2e\" name=\"ad2e\">\u201cReally? <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Every</em> product must solve world problem?\u201d he asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a93a\" name=\"a93a\">Jonas shrugged. \u201cThat is for the marketing and PR team to figure out. We build the product, and then they communicate to the public how it improves humankind.

For the past three days, Arsyen had been talking about sponges, complaining about the brand they stocked in the micro-kitchen. \u201cAnahata should disrupt sponges,\u201d he was saying. \u201cAlign sponges with roadmap.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa77\" name=\"aa77\">It was typical product manager speak\u200a\u2014\u200abig vision statements with little understanding of the technical difficulties. Did Arsyen know just how complex modern sponges had become over the past twenty years?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"15a0\" name=\"15a0\">Whenever Arsyen spoke, Roni just nodded in response. As a technical lead, it was his job to let product managers like Arsyen think he cared about their opinions. Still, Arsyen\u2019s opinions often seemed particularly random and difficult to endorse.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"63a6\" name=\"63a6\">\u201cI make manifesto,\u201d Arsyen announced to the team that morning. \u201cAs good P.M., I know manifesto key to successful product.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8368\" name=\"8368\">He began to read aloud.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8778\" name=\"8778\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Social Car is Anahata technology to eliminate loneliness.

Thanks to Social Car, you make conversation with them and begin lifelong friendship. Because relationship is in cloud, you do not have to worry about catching sex disease or awkward moment where you realize other person is missing arm. The person is real and not real, like your journey, like life.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55e8\" name=\"55e8\">Roni\u2019s brain started to spin. This Arsyen was such a mystery. He spent half his time in the bathroom, and when he did materialize, you couldn\u2019t be sure whether you were about to hear the stupidest or most brilliant idea of all time. One moment he was suggesting they attach mops to the wheels of Social Car in order to clean the road while driving, and the next moment he was busting out an amazing product manifesto. It reminded Roni of his first day on the job at Anahata, when Bobby smoked pot with him and the other NASA recruits, dropping some crazy science on them all about unicorns and space elevators. Both sounded totally stupid until you realized Bobby was a genius.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"571a\" name=\"571a\">Perhaps Arsyen was also a genius.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8e5b\" name=\"8e5b\">If he was, that helped Roni, too: Managing a genius was always a good career move.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fc89\" name=\"fc89\">\u201cThat\u2019s pretty deep,\u201d Roni said to Arsyen. \u201cLife is like an empty journey unless you have Social Car.

I see problem many times in B2B solutions. I give you example from Pyrrhia social media roadmap. Sometimes when we in countryside, I have boys wash my car. But they lazy. They throw soap on car and then put water on car. But the car not shiny. It because they didn\u2019t start at beginning\u200a\u2014\u200awith water, in the cloud. I tell them, \u2018Wash car first or I feed you to dogs,\u2019 and finally they do it right. It\u2019s like\u2026software as a service for internet of things.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4838\" name=\"4838\">Roni frowned. Arsyen\u2019s brain was moving too fast for him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3c44\" name=\"3c44\">Arsyen turned to the whiteboard and drew a rough sketch of two cars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"92db\" name=\"92db\">\u201cYou all talk about what happen with Social Car when you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">on</em> the road,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cBut what about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">before</em> you get in car? Start at beginning of problem\u200a\u2014\u200anot in middle like little Pyrrhian boys. Social Car can tell me who around me now. But what if I can tell Social Car who I want to meet when I first get in car?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0649\" name=\"0649\">\u201cYou mean, program it to take you to an address or someone\u2019s house?\u201d Sven asked. \u201cWelcome to the modern world, Arsyen. Cars already have that. It\u2019s called a GPS.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2b88\" name=\"2b88\">\u201cNo, this not about taking you to friend\u2019s house. It for people and places you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">don\u2019t </em>know. So you have your app and want to meet other engineers. Well, Social Car take you to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Trek</em> convention. Or say you want to pitch businessman on your startup. Social Car take you to hotel bar or fancy-person strip club. Then, once cars close together, you can begin conversation with your target.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ed80\" name=\"ed80\">\u201cI see, I see, so it\u2019s a more targeted way to meet new people. Kinda like a business networking tool?\u201d Roni asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6f2b\" name=\"6f2b\">\u201cYes,\u201d Arsyen nodded. \u201cBusiness networking tool\u2026in the cloud. Social. B2B. Alignment.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1cae\" name=\"1cae\">\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d said Jonas, looking up from his computer. \u201cYou are not describing a business networking tool. This is what one would call a hookup app.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aee9\" name=\"aee9\">Roni studied the drawing on the whiteboard. It looked like two rectangular men in suits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"15cc\" name=\"15cc\">\u201cHe\u2019s right. It\u2019s totally about meeting hot girls!\u201d Sven jumped out of his chair and hopped to the whiteboard, grabbing a pen and adding a pair of breasts to the roof of one of Arsyen\u2019s cars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"23e4\" name=\"23e4\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ohhh</em>,\u201d said Roni, as the idea came to life before him, his businessmen transforming into busty coeds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"203a\" name=\"203a\">\u201cA user inputs into Social Car what he wants in terms of age, gender, and sexuality,\u201d Sven explained. \u201cSocial Car does the rest. All it has to do is scan the profiles from all the other Social Car\u2013enabled vehicles. And we give them pickup lines to help kick-start the conversation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ed9d\" name=\"ed9d\">\u201cGreat idea,\u201d grinned Roni, slapping Arsyen on the back.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4161\" name=\"4161\">\u201cAlso, I think about woman problem again,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cYou know, about woman who not want to be found. I think I have answer: We give her choice to turn off Social Car.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3052\" name=\"3052\">\u201cYou mean, let women <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">choose</em> whether to let people find her?\u201d Roni asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"99fd\" name=\"99fd\">Arsyen nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7399\" name=\"7399\">\u201cAre you crazy!?\u201d Sven cried.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d234\" name=\"d234\">Roni shook his head. How could this be the same employee who had authored that manifesto?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b06\" name=\"5b06\">He reached into his backpack and grabbed Arsyen\u2019s HR form (damn HR, always wanting him to use paper!). No genius would ever propose listening to users\u2019 opinions. As Roni made a little tick on the form, he saw a cloud of worry pass over Arsyen\u2019s face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"20cc\" name=\"20cc\">\u201cIf girls get to choose whether to use the feature, then we\u2019re only going to have a bunch of dudes on Social Car,\u201d Sven explained.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5263\" name=\"5263\">Roni nodded. \u201cPeople get confused by choice\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s our job to tell them what they want. Besides, you\u2019ve got three guys in here saying they love it. What other proof do you need?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e7f7\" name=\"e7f7\">But it was clear Arsyen was no longer listening. He was staring at the HR form in Roni\u2019s hand, as if worried he had done something wrong. For that alone, Roni made another tick. The fact that Arsyen could even believe he had done something wrong once again indicated his inferiority. Geniuses weren\u2019t ever wrong, even when they were.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"10fa\" name=\"10fa\">Which was also why Roni needed to be right about having hired Arsyen.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"4c02\" name=\"4c02\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"4e8f\" name=\"4e8f\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"232d\" name=\"232d\">Jonas cornered Arsyen later that morning.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"458c\" name=\"458c\">\u201cWhat do you want me to do about those pickup lines?\u201d asked Jonas, standing between Arsyen\u2019s desk and the cubicle entrance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c6f6\" name=\"c6f6\">\u201cPickup lines?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd9f\" name=\"bd9f\">Arsyen stood.

This is a totally different idea from the hookup feature we discussed two days ago.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6e72\" name=\"6e72\">\u201cCar color and clean very important to user,\u201d said Arsyen, shaking his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a349\" name=\"a349\">It was even more important to Arsyen. He had spent the entire night thinking up ways to postpone the team from settling on a clear direction. If he gave the engineers something new to consider, Arsyen wouldn\u2019t have to flesh anything out until after his trial period was over. And once he was a permanent employee, he\u2019d have plenty of time to learn how to be a real product manager.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"48c2\" name=\"48c2\">\u201cI want purple and green cars,\u201d said Arsyen, invoking the Anahata colors. \u201cNow, sorry, but HR team needs paperwork from me. Back later.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfad\" name=\"dfad\">Arsyen made his way to the video game console down the hall, holding his sponge in front of him like an offering. He had discovered that Anahata\u2019s engineers let him roam wherever he wanted if he was carrying cleaning supplies, clearly uninterested in firing someone whose work they didn\u2019t wish to perform themselves.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"573b\" name=\"573b\">He returned late in the afternoon and was relieved to see Jonas transfixed by his screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22a0\" name=\"22a0\">Sven waved but didn\u2019t look up; he was studying a bunch of cartoon dogs that were lined up vertically on his phone. Each \u201cdog\u201d had the face of a real human being.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e7bb\" name=\"e7bb\">\u201cHow Dogtown going?\u201d he asked, hoping to score points with the nicer of his two co-workers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"63f6\" name=\"63f6\">Sven sighed and explained that he had run into a snag. A local journalist had posted something in praise of Dogtown, and as a result, a few thousand people between San Francisco and the South Bay had downloaded it to their phones. While that should have been reason to celebrate, it instead led to a supply-demand imbalance: There seemed to be far more people who wanted to perform disagreeable tasks than there were people who needed disagreeable tasks to be performed for them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2abc\" name=\"2abc\">\u201cThere are too many guilty liberals on Dogtown,\u201d Sven moaned. \u201cI\u2019ve essentially got everyone bidding on the same tasks.\u201d He showed Arsyen the long list of white faces volunteering to perform menial tasks for people of color. \u201cI tried to get someone to pick up a tub of ice cream for my fake Asian female profile last night, and the bidding war was so intense that I ended up getting it delivered for free. It\u2019s even more exaggerated if I use my Latino or African-American profiles. Every white person in San Francisco seems desperate to run errands for free just to prove they\u2019re really progressive. They even want me to design badges they can put on their profile pictures to prove to everyone else they\u2019re not racist.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b56e\" name=\"b56e\">\u201cBut that a good problem, right? You rework power balance. Fight the Men!\u201d Arsyen cheered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6721\" name=\"6721\">\u201cI prefer to leave saving the world to Anahata. I just want to create a bidding system for errands. I\u2019ll pay you to go pick up my dry cleaning. I don\u2019t want to know who you are, what you do, or what you look like. Just pick up my damn dry cleaning.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"373d\" name=\"373d\">Just then, Sven\u2019s phone rang. His eyes rolled as he picked it up, mouthing \u201cmom\u201d to Arsyen. He muttered a desultory greeting in Swedish as he left the cubicle.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"59fc\" name=\"59fc\">Arsyen heard something move behind him and turned to find Jonas standing there, arms crossed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7612\" name=\"7612\">\u201cDespite your lack of guidance, I went ahead and programmed part of the hookup feature,\u201d said Jonas, pointing to his screen. He had chosen a handful of key attributes to generate the pickup lines\u200a\u2014\u200acar type, model, color, passenger gender and age. He showed Arsyen a list of computer-generated interactions between Car A and Car B.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"31e0\" name=\"31e0\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I think women in Cadillacs are interesting and compassionate.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5be8\" name=\"5be8\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I did not know women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four liked Cadillacs.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8835\" name=\"8835\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Where did you buy your 2015 blue Cadillac ATS?

Is that correct?\u2019</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c06\" name=\"2c06\">Arsyen nodded. He noticed that the enormous, pulsing boil from the previous day had heaved its way farther across Jonas\u2019 nose.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0ad9\" name=\"0ad9\">\u201cI spent last summer memorizing all the computer science professors and students in America\u2019s top ten PhD programs.

Machine learning explosion.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d250\" name=\"d250\">\u201cArsyen, I know you are lying. In fact, I have proof that you are lying.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e02b\" name=\"e02b\">Arsyen lowered his head. The game was up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ff3e\" name=\"ff3e\">\u201cI will expose you,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cYou will not make it past this week.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"36be\" name=\"36be\">Arsyen remembered then what his father had said right before surrendering to the Embrian king: It is ignoble to fight an obvious defeat. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Bish lena, bish lena.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8662\" name=\"8662\">He knelt to grab his backpack, and a piece of paper on the ground caught his eye. It was a blueprint for something unrecognizable, almost like a sea creature, with intricate blue lines intersecting at right angles, forming tentacles radiating from a central oval body.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a29\" name=\"4a29\">Arsyen crawled out from under the desk and studied the thin blue paper again in the light. He decided it wasn\u2019t an animal but an arm, with fingers extending to the edge of the page. The fingertips were purple and green, just like the Anahata logo.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f67a\" name=\"f67a\">\u201cWhere did you find that?\u201d snapped Jonas, drawing closer. He reached for the paper, but Arsyen swept his hand behind his back. He was keeping this for himself\u200a\u2014\u200ait was all he had to show for his one week at the greatest company in America.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0316\" name=\"0316\">Jonas\u2019 face hardened.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"35c5\" name=\"35c5\">\u201cSo this is how you want to play it?\u201d His pimple pulsed with anger.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1739\" name=\"1739\">Arsyen shook his head. One day he would have Jonas decapitated, but for now, there was no point in further conversation. He moved to the side, but Jonas blocked his path.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"20ff\" name=\"20ff\">\u201cYou know I know.

None came close to his extraordinary Anahata salary. It would take him decades to save enough money to raise an army and storm the imperial palace. By then, his nemesis, General Korpeko, would be waiting for him in some fancy laser-shooting wheelchair, and Arsyen would be done for before he could even dismount from the only old, decrepit donkey he was able to afford.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3684\" name=\"3684\">A little red icon blinked at the bottom of his computer screen, desperate for his attention.

From crew cut to coccyx, his spine descended in a long, straight line that leaned forward, diagonal to the floor, as though in constant battle with gravity.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3588\" name=\"3588\">At the moment, however, Gregor\u2019s problem was less physics than numbers. Ugly, unsettling numbers. While few people on the Anahata campus knew of its existence, Gregor\u2019s top-secret Project Y was the only endeavor that now mattered at the company. Everything else was an afterthought; a blip in the company\u2019s glorious ten-year history. Were the project to fail, it would mean the end of Anahata. A victory, on the other hand, would ensure the success of Anahata, the web, and all things good for decades to come. It would be Gregor\u2019s finest achievement, the greatest project to which he had ever put his name. He could not allow it to fail.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3760\" name=\"3760\">Yet by the numbers, it <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">was</em> failing, and not for any of the predictable reasons that often plagued brilliant Anahata ideas\u200a\u2014\u200aan inability to find willing commercial partners, or criticism that Anahata was violating some silly law. Such problems, governed as they were by ignorance and reactionaries, were far outside Gregor\u2019s control. In fact, his current inability to limit these kinds of interference was one of the main reasons Gregor found Project Y so exhilarating. If it succeeded, he would be able to protect his engineers from the ignorant masses, letting them build and create their dreams unencumbered. There would be no more defections to Galt, no more debates in the media about Anahata\u2019s relevance. Project Y would definitively establish Anahata as the most innovative company in the world, ever.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d7dc\" name=\"d7dc\">Gregor often found himself wondering what would have become of him had Anahata or Project Y existed in his early days as an engineer, when he first landed on the shores of Baltimore, fresh from the University of Liechtenstein, his head filled with ideas for space elevators and floating castles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd72\" name=\"fd72\">His first major undertaking tackled the many lies and inaccuracies on the internet by using software that automatically corrected inaccurate opinions, comments, and blog posts. But the service never found any mainstream appeal\u200a\u2014\u200aas one venture capitalist told him, \u201cThe internet wasn\u2019t built for facts.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6d03\" name=\"6d03\">Next, he embarked on a project to replace the planet\u2019s slavery cages (or zoos, as they were also known) with robotic animal sanctuaries. After four years of working out of his one-room apartment in San Diego, surviving on little more than instant noodles and bananas, Gregor was forced to admit defeat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"822a\" name=\"822a\">But it was there in San Diego, standing next to a dumpster, ready to trash his metal monkey parts, that he met Bobby Bonilo. The future Anahata founder tossed him a quarter, thinking Gregor was homeless. But then Bobby saw the wires sprouting from the monkey\u2019s tail in Gregor\u2019s hand, took in the faded computing slogan on his T-shirt, and in a split second seemed to understand all of Gregor\u2019s dreams\u200a\u2014\u200aand their crushing defeat at the cruel hand of pragmatism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a9bb\" name=\"a9bb\">Bobby had been the first to recognize Gregor\u2019s genius. \u201cHumans cling to the past. They will work tirelessly to destroy the most important advances of society,\u201d he had said. \u201cAs a visionary, you must know that your ideas are ahead of their time. They must only come to light when the world is ready for them\u200a\u2014\u200aor when you have too much power to be stopped.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bda8\" name=\"bda8\">Project Y was just that\u200a\u2014\u200abeyond its time, beyond any earthly concept of innovation. By that measure alone it would have failed in a normal environment. But Anahata now had what Gregor then lacked: boundless capital, a deep pool of engineering talent, and the power of a large country. Moreover, there was no public opinion standing in the way of Y. Its secrecy had been closely guarded, and Gregor was determined to keep its existence quiet until it was too late to be stopped.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f0d\" name=\"8f0d\">Instead, the hurdle Gregor now found before him was a far more potent nemesis: the devil himself, Niels Smeardon, breathing fire and online advertising in the path of Gregor\u2019s engineering team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c02\" name=\"0c02\">Niels was the reason two Project Y product managers had come to Gregor\u2019s office that afternoon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0382\" name=\"0382\">\u201cFor the past week, we\u2019ve literally been twiddling our thumbs,\u201d one said. \u201cEvery step we take is blocked by sales.

Conferences\u2026with Powerpoint,\u201d spat the other product manager.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"eea1\" name=\"eea1\">\u201cAlso, we need to be able to turn off advertising in one part of the world to free up some servers for Y testing. It would just be a low-volume region that we\u2019d turn off, like Eastern Africa, but sales refuses. I was told it was escalated to Niels and he stopped the whole thing, saying the entire world deserves to benefit from Anahata advertising and that under no condition should Eastern Africa not receive our glorious ads for even a single day.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5047\" name=\"5047\">Gregor snorted. He looked out onto the field below his office, where a group of sales employees were playing rugby. These were the men who sold Anahata\u2019s internet ads\u200a\u2014\u200apithy phrases and punchy slogans advertising cruise ships and cancer treatments. They believed in dress shirts and strip clubs and golf and triathlons. He was sure he could see Niels among them, dressed in one of his shiny custom jerseys, kicking up mud clods simply to remind the earth of his dominance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"db88\" name=\"db88\">\u201cI will fix the Niels problem,\u201d said Gregor, steadying his voice and watching Niels\u2019 spiky blond hair attack the sky as he ran down the field. The two product managers would never have guessed that Gregor\u2019s body was raging inside, his blood cells taking up arms, their spears pricking the subcutaneous layer of his skin, ready to fight.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8b17\" name=\"8b17\">\u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked, turning to the two men.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b02e\" name=\"b02e\">\u201cThings are still very quiet in the rest of the engineering community. The distractions have worked really well.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"75a1\" name=\"75a1\">Gregor nodded. When planning Project Y, he and Bobby had devised a list of \u201cdistractions\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aprojects like Social Car and Genie\u200a\u2014\u200athat if leaked would capture internal, public, and media attention and let the Y engineers continue to work in secrecy on the company\u2019s big bet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"00a3\" name=\"00a3\">\u201cGo back to work, and don\u2019t worry about this anymore.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c4b2\" name=\"c4b2\">The duo left smiling.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"efed\" name=\"efed\">Gregor remained by the window, watching the field. To any other observer, Niels might have seemed the ultimate captain, rallying his team to the win, throwing slaps and high-fives. But it was all an act. Niels was a man willing to knock down anyone who got in his way. Gregor had kept Project Y a secret from him for this very reason. Niels would destroy it for the very fact that it was Gregor\u2019s baby. And if Niels succeeded in sabotaging Y, it would be the end of everything.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f45\" name=\"2f45\">The problem was that Gregor had no power over Niels. They were equals, if not in brain power, then at least according to Anahata\u2019s organizational chart. Only Bobby could tell Niels what to do. And while Gregor and Bobby dreamed up the idea for Project Y together, the founder had since taken a step back, tasking Gregor with making it a reality. This would have been fine were it not for the fact that Bobby seemed to have a weird affection for Niels, never suggesting that he really liked the guy, but also taking care to protect him from Gregor. He had even heard that Bobby and Niels occasionally did yoga together.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bcf8\" name=\"bcf8\">Gregor paced his office, Niels\u2019 gravelly voice and sales aphorisms trailing behind him: \u201cWith courage comes determination.\u201d \u201cLeadership is knowing when to lead.\u201d \u201cThose who win are those who win.\u201d He caught sight again of Niels on the field, this time tripping an oncoming opponent, the stunned player falling to the ground. Niels was halfway down the field before the man could even lift his face from the dirt.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"38b5\" name=\"38b5\">Gregor needed Bobby\u2019s help to get past Niels for good. It wasn\u2019t simply a matter of getting a server or access to the field. Gregor needed Niels out of the picture, completely won over to the idea of Y, or contained so that he couldn\u2019t thwart it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"95c0\" name=\"95c0\">He opened his messenger service. Bobby had said he would be busy much of the day at a colonics retreat but in fact seemed to be online.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\" id=\"0380\" name=\"0380\">Gregor: <em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">We need to talk about Y.

He stared out the window for a long time without moving, the sky above him clouding with dark thoughts.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"eb30\" name=\"eb30\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"5701\" name=\"5701\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he four leaders of Gregor\u2019s \u201cdistractions\u201d projects were all longtime Anahatis. Any one of them could be trusted to help recruit the army of engineers Bobby had requested.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f6f6\" name=\"f6f6\">Which is how Gregor ended up in one of the company parking lots, the key to a driverless car in his hand. Nose upturned, he held the car key several inches away from his body. He believed keys were an outdated method of accessing one\u2019s property, which was why he had an engineering team working on a simple identification solution that would require just a small incision in an individual\u2019s pinky.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3fcc\" name=\"3fcc\">Gregor unlocked the door and settled into the front seat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3767\" name=\"3767\">An unfamiliar <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">beep boop beep</em> came from the dashboard, and five red lights flashed in the center console as the Social Car software booted up.

Gregor didn\u2019t recognize them but assumed they were the pictures of Social Car team members.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bc17\" name=\"bc17\">\u201cNumber 1,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3ca0\" name=\"3ca0\">\u201cSven Svensson is a quarter-mile away,\u201d the voice said. \u201cShall I read you his profile?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"df10\" name=\"df10\">Gregor had no interest in getting to know his employees.

Now a third, more familiar face stared back at him. He recognized Roni Herman, the team lead. Roni was a bit past his prime, already in his early thirties, but still a well-liked figure on campus. In reviewing the distraction projects and their leaders that morning, Gregor had thought Roni could be an interesting candidate to join the Project Y team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a9c7\" name=\"a9c7\">\u201cTake me to Roni Herman.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"73be\" name=\"73be\">The software beeped its assent, and a few minutes later, Gregor\u2019s car pulled alongside Roni\u2019s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bbef\" name=\"bbef\">\u201cSpeak to Roni,\u201d Gregor said. The dashboard beeped and a moment later confirmed that Roni had accepted the communication.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"32ae\" name=\"32ae\">\u201cHello, Gregor, hello!\u201d Roni\u2019s eager, nasal voice filled Gregor\u2019s car. \u201cHow do you like Pad Thai?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1457\" name=\"1457\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Gregor never ate Thai food. He didn\u2019t like the feeling of spice running through his body, raising his body temperature.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fa9f\" name=\"fa9f\">\u201cYou know, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Pad</em>\u2026<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Thai</em>,\u201d Roni repeated. Gregor glanced over at Roni\u2019s car, which was keeping perfect pace with his own. Roni climbed into the back of his car, searching for something. A moment later, he put a piece of paper against the window. On it was written in big black letters: \u201cPAD THAI=SOCIAL CAR CODE NAME.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0dd2\" name=\"0dd2\">\u201cWhat would happen if I were to pull you off Social Car?\u201d Gregor asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c9a0\" name=\"c9a0\">Roni didn\u2019t answer immediately. Although Gregor refused to make eye contact, he imagined Roni was panicking, afraid he was about to be kicked off his project. Although Gregor volunteered at a community garden, gave millions each year to humanitarian crisis organizations, and voted only for socialists, he did like to cause a bit of microsuffering now and then. He felt it kept the engineers on their toes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5a58\" name=\"5a58\">\u201cOh, well, you know, I don\u2019t know how things would go if I came off it,\u201d said Roni, the panic painted across his face in bold pinkish strokes. \u201cI\u2019ve really led the team from the start and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4ff1\" name=\"4ff1\">Gregor frowned. In a company where sales strutted with their chins to the clouds, Gregor preferred the men who slouched. Roni could at least display a bit of faux humility.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a228\" name=\"a228\">\u201cSlow down,\u201d Gregor told his car. He\u2019d ditch Roni and go talk to the Genie team lead instead.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2338\" name=\"2338\">But Roni\u2019s car slowed to keep pace with Gregor\u2019s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d80c\" name=\"d80c\">\u201cPretty great, right?\u201d Roni said. \u201cThat\u2019s the speed-detection system we built this week. You can try to slow down, but my car will slow with yours so we can keep chatting. We\u2019ve still got some bugs to work out, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll launch before the end of the quarter.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6495\" name=\"6495\">What?!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5fbe\" name=\"5fbe\">The end of the quarter was far too soon for a Social Car launch. Gregor needed all of his distractions running up until Project Y was ready. He couldn\u2019t kill this project\u200a\u2014\u200ait was too well known and popular on campus\u200a\u2014\u200abut he certainly couldn\u2019t let it launch anytime soon. He needed to slow it down\u200a\u2014\u200alike by removing Roni from Social Car and making him his Y evangelist. Gregor inhaled deeply.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8054\" name=\"8054\">\u201cHave you heard of Project Y?\u201d he asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"84c3\" name=\"84c3\">Roni gasped. \u201cI\u2019ve heard\u2026things, you know, but not all the details.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1439\" name=\"1439\">\u201cIt\u2019s our best shot at building the world\u2019s greatest company. And the most important thing right now is for us to have strong leaders. People who can motivate others. People who can help articulate a vision.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8df2\" name=\"8df2\">Out of the corner of his eye, Gregor saw Roni bouncing in his seat. \u201cAt many times during my career I\u2019ve shown leadership and created visions and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9c5c\" name=\"9c5c\">\u201cYour vision isn\u2019t required,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll need to do is spread the word, win people over, recruit new team members\u200a\u2014\u200aand eventually spread the project to all of Anahata\u2019s engineers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"aa7d\" name=\"aa7d\">\u201cI organize the quarterly hackathon,\u201d Roni said. \u201cWe now have 2,000 Anahata engineers around the world who code the entire weekend over a livestream feed in exchange for beer.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4bee\" name=\"4bee\">\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big job. It\u2019s historic. I need you to move over to Building 1 ASAP.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ef96\" name=\"ef96\">\u201cBuilding 1? Oh, yes! I won\u2019t let you down!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6660\" name=\"6660\">Gregor gave a small nod from his car.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b816\" name=\"b816\">\u201cOh, oh, one thing,\u201d Roni said. \u201cWhat do you want me to do about Pad Thai? Will you find a new leader for it?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6d6b\" name=\"6d6b\">\u201cI\u2019ll find someone new. Don\u2019t tell anyone where you are going or what you are working on.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5a1f\" name=\"5a1f\">\u201cI\u2019ll get going right away!\u201d Roni waved as his car turned and sped back toward campus. Soon he disappeared from Gregor\u2019s dashboard altogether.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f833\" name=\"f833\">\u201cTake me to Innovation Drive,\u201d Gregor told his car.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0488\" name=\"0488\">As the car reversed course, Gregor contemplated how best to hinder Social Car. Putting a new technical lead on the project would undoubtedly slow it down. But he needed to throw a real wrench in the works, not simply lose a few weeks\u2019 time as someone new got up to speed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b096\" name=\"b096\">Gregor continued to wrestle with the problem as his car made its way down El Camino Real, a street that stretched the length of Silicon Valley in an endless loop of Mexican restaurants (Casa Fiesta, Casa Grande, Casa Lupe), energy-efficient cars, and boxy computer stores. Gregor found the relentless monotony and disinterested aesthetics pleasing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cdbe\" name=\"cdbe\">The car passed under a billboard for Mr. Fixit, a local computer-repair service. Gregor glanced up at the tongue-in-cheek, 1950s-style image of a desperate housewife ripping her hair out as a confident Mr. Fixit repaired her computer and saved the day.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a5d2\" name=\"a5d2\">Gregor rolled down the window and craned his neck to see the ad. He ordered his car to do a U-turn. The car drove past the sign again, and then once more.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ff3a\" name=\"ff3a\">By the time he passed the sign for the third time, Gregor had the answer to his problem.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b404\" name=\"b404\">\u201cTake me back to Anahata,\u201d he said, \u201cand drop me off at the lobby.\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"0430\" name=\"0430\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"8ece\" name=\"8ece\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*pSf2fmhfsa12lwxOiUAhwA.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*pSf2fmhfsa12lwxOiUAhwA.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*pSf2fmhfsa12lwxOiUAhwA.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pSf2fmhfsa12lwxOiUAhwA.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pSf2fmhfsa12lwxOiUAhwA.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"6966\" name=\"6966\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he next morning, Gregor found himself in a place he rarely visited: the campus security control room, in Building 28. Row after row of TV screens circled the room; below them, men in matching purple polo shirts manned a dashboard of flashing red lights.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f245\" name=\"f245\">It appeared high-tech, but the reality was more panopticon of the banal. On one screen, a sales employee pulled his Porsche into the Anahata parking lot, straightening his tie in the reflection of the car window. Above him, two women did yoga on the lawn. On another screen, an aerial shot captured cubicle after cubicle of workers staring at their computers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"722e\" name=\"722e\">The cameras recorded this routine and hundreds like it each day. It was a wonder that they could even keep their lenses open on alert given how mind-numbingly boring Anahata\u2019s security scene was, particularly during the night shift. In the wee hours of morning, nothing went into Anahata and nothing came out\u200a\u2014\u200aminus the occasional nocturnal engineer. Otherwise the place was locked down with the tightest security in the Valley. There hadn\u2019t been an attempted theft in more than five years.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a91f\" name=\"a91f\">But that morning, there had been a break-in at Building 1\u200a\u2014\u200athe highest-security spot on Anahata\u2019s campus\u200a\u2014\u200aprompting Gregor to dash out of the management meeting and make a beeline for the security office.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"69d8\" name=\"69d8\">Footage from three a.m. showed a man dressed entirely in black sneaking across the Building 1 parking lot, hovering on tiptoe like a thuggish ballerina. He jumped behind a tree, rolled through the grass, and ended up at the building\u2019s side entrance, where he pulled out an Anahata badge that had likely been swiped from a negligent engineer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f4b\" name=\"9f4b\">The man again raised the stolen badge to the access control reader, and for a second, the camera caught a shot of his face. He was Caucasian but looked more like a zebra, with black zigzags painted across his face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8fd4\" name=\"8fd4\">Inside, he went past the molecular lab, the welding shop, the hard-hat zone, and the physical and intangible infrastructure teams, and then stopped in front of another office.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"69d6\" name=\"69d6\">The man darted his flashlight around the room, splashing the walls with light. It was difficult to make out what he was doing, but from the shadows it seemed he had stopped in front of a desk and was pulling something out of his bag. The flashlight swung again. Suddenly, the scene was illuminated: The man was plugging a computer into a wall outlet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8c3e\" name=\"8c3e\">\u201cGalt!\u201d Gregor gasped. This was nothing less than corporate espionage. The thief was going to plant something\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe surveillance equipment or tampered data\u200a\u2014\u200athen use it to gain access to all of Anahata\u2019s network.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7454\" name=\"7454\">Then the thief sat down and put his feet up on the desk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e6c7\" name=\"e6c7\">\u201cWait\u2026what is he doing?\u201d asked Gregor, crouching to put himself at eye level with the screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"07bc\" name=\"07bc\">\u201cSir, after watching this many times, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that he is picking his nose,\u201d said one of the guards, freezing the tape for a moment to show the faint outline of a finger moving toward the man\u2019s face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ccf2\" name=\"ccf2\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Gregor drew even closer, his face now just inches from the screen. He signaled to the guard to continue the footage.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ff1\" name=\"3ff1\">The thief jumped up from the chair and turned off his flashlight. Within thirty seconds, he had crept out the back exit, barrel-rolled across the parking lot, unlocked a car, and driven off. One of the guards rewound the footage and froze it on the last full shot of the man\u2019s face, little more than a black-and-white blur.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b01d\" name=\"b01d\">Although the security team had already watched the tape thirty times that morning, their collective adrenaline rose as they watched Gregor\u2019s face for a reaction. They hadn\u2019t seen this much excitement since an engineer\u2019s pet boa had gotten loose on campus the previous month.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9624\" name=\"9624\">\u201cWhose badge did he use to break in?\u201d Gregor said finally.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93f5\" name=\"93f5\">The security head double-checked a pad of paper on the desk. \u201cSomeone named Roni Herman, who works in Building 7. As of yesterday, Roni Herman\u2019s badge was cleared for access to Building 1. The perpetrator was probably tracking Roni the whole time, somehow got hold of his badge, and then got access to both buildings. This was probably the result of months of tracking and shadowing his movements. Should we call the police?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8062\" name=\"8062\">Gregor stared at the face frozen on the screen, a black zigzag casting a lightning bolt from the man\u2019s forehead to his neck. \u201cIdiot,\u201d he muttered, staring at Roni\u2019s face on the screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7061\" name=\"7061\">Gregor stood.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0a12\" name=\"0a12\">\u201cIdiots,\u201d he said loudly, looking at the security team. \u201cThere is no need to call anyone.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3328\" name=\"3328\">He turned on his heel and clomped out the door.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cda3\" name=\"cda3\">The security team looked at each other and shrugged.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4bb0\" name=\"4bb0\">\u201cMan, I will never understand engineers,\u201d said one, shaking his head before switching his attention to the cameras trained on the well-endowed girls in the customer support department.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"897c\" name=\"897c\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"5bf1\" name=\"5bf1\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">N</span>iels began each day with a run. The Northern California air was just crisp enough to feel clean and pure, and the occasional headwind produced a surmountable challenge\u200a\u2014\u200athe kind of easy and achievable goal-setting that Niels liked for warming up to his workday. He followed his workout with a long shower, the rainforest setting gently splattering purified water on his head while a speaker piped in a soothing recording of a woman\u2019s voice appraising each inch of his body.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"908f\" name=\"908f\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Your muscles are so big.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45ca\" name=\"45ca\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Your abs are very flat.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0a14\" name=\"0a14\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Your Adam\u2019s apple is prominent but tasteful.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9895\" name=\"9895\">But that morning, Niels could focus only on Gregor Guntlag. The overly German German had hated him since day one and seemed intent on turning Bobby against him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"26a9\" name=\"26a9\">Bobby and Gregor were both nutjobs as far as Niels was concerned, but he was used to working with crazies. Fifteen years of working in the Valley and he had never worked for a CEO or founder who wasn\u2019t a sociopath or narcissist. They thought the world\u2019s problems existed in part to keep them intellectually stimulated, and that all those problems\u200a\u2014\u200amalaria, corruption, congressional deadlock, death, you name it\u200a\u2014\u200acould be solved by technologists. Their lack of focus was confused for genius. One moment they would be asking the entire company to dramatically change course, and the next moment they\u2019d be giving equal attention to the color of the lampshades in the lobby. And despite their staunch atheism, they all believed their success was somehow mythically predestined.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"47fd\" name=\"47fd\">It was an absurd worldview, but one that Niels admired for its selfishness. Managing and manipulating these egomaniacs was an art he felt he had perfected.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bef7\" name=\"bef7\">With persistence and patience, Niels had worked on Bobby for six years, helping him understand that Anahata needed money to be successful and that Niels was the best lever he had to produce it in large quantities. As a result, Bobby generally left him alone. Gregor, on the other hand, had been less susceptible to Niels\u2019 charm. He did everything he could to sabotage Niels, always playing the contrarian in any management meeting and sending out his engineering lackeys to turn off a sales production task here and there. It was nothing sufficiently significant to warrant an outcry to Bobby, but just enough to annoy Niels and make clear that Gregor and his foot soldiers were behind the job.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a1da\" name=\"a1da\">So Niels was surprised by the peace offering that had appeared the previous night in the form of a blue chat bubble on his phone\u200a\u2014\u200aa chat message asking Gregor to come over to \u201cwork things out and bury the hatchet.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"683b\" name=\"683b\">It was a shocking olive branch from Anahata\u2019s head engineer, and in retrospect, Niels realized he should have taken a screenshot of their exchange. Unfortunately, since Anahata chats were not stored (the result of Gregor and Bobby\u2019s joint paranoia about government surveillance), this historic exchange of civilities would have no record.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fdb4\" name=\"fdb4\">After an evening spent trying to discern Gregor\u2019s motives, Niels had finally replied that, yes, of course he\u2019d be happy to talk. But the whole thing smelled fishy. Perhaps Gregor wanted something that belonged to sales. If that was the case, it meant that Niels had already achieved Master Negotiator Rule #1: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Always</em> have the upper hand. (Viewing even the most casual encounters as an opportunity for personal gain was key to Niel\u2019s life philosophy. An ex-girlfriend had once accused him of dealing with their relationship like a business negotiation. Niels said he didn\u2019t understand how she could possibly think that anything in life was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> a negotiation. He came away triumphant, although the woman did break up with him shortly thereafter.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"69b1\" name=\"69b1\">Niels was confident he could work the meeting to his advantage. In fact, this could be the opening he needed to get Gregor to agree to put ads on Moodify bracelets.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"384b\" name=\"384b\">In any other company, the management team would have salivated over the Moodify bracelets, with one billion dollars in projected profit in the first year alone. But not Gregor Guntlag, whose perennial argument against anything Niels wanted was that it wouldn\u2019t be good for Anahata users. Niels believed that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not </em>giving people advertisements was bad. If they didn\u2019t know something existed, how could they know they needed it? Only advertising could tell people what they needed to need.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"48d5\" name=\"48d5\">Typically, Bobby hadn\u2019t even listened to the discussion. He caught just the tail end of Gregor\u2019s rebuttal and seemed to defer the decision indefinitely with a wave of his hands. If you asked Niels, Bobby gave his head engineer far too much rope. Gregor was holding the company back from billions of additional revenue. And what did he do to make up for it? As far as Niels could tell, Gregor was simply there to execute Bobby\u2019s big ideas. All of Gregor\u2019s own projects had been massive failures. He was good at implementation but had no vision of his own.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1cbf\" name=\"1cbf\">Niels stepped out of the shower and surveyed himself in the bathroom mirror. He was forty-two but didn\u2019t show a single gray hair or wrinkle. By almost any measure, he was the picture of excellence in aging. He gave a quick, indulgent flex of his muscle and a flash of bleached teeth. He remembered that the Anahata employee he banged a few weeks back had commented on his nice smile. He racked his brain for a split second, trying to remember her name. She was that sexy hippie receptionist who kept asking him for career advice as he tried to take her clothes off. Janine. Jane. Jennie. It didn\u2019t matter. It was probably a bit stupid to hit on someone who worked at Anahata, but he wasn\u2019t going to worry about it. He always could have her fired if things got uncomfortable. So far, he hadn\u2019t even run into her on campus.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c2d\" name=\"2c2d\">Niels threw on his favorite Prada slacks\u200a\u2014\u200athe ones he wore to close a deal\u200a\u2014\u200aand finished getting dressed for work. He took a final look in the mirror and flashed his teeth. Never underestimate the power of a killer grin.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"09d7\" name=\"09d7\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"846c\" name=\"846c\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">M</span>aster Negotiator Rule #36: Arriving a few minutes late to a meeting communicates dominance. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">You</em> will wait for <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">me</em>.

He checked the house number again: 414 Tuscany Drive. This was it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d736\" name=\"d736\">Before him was an immense silver gate\u200a\u2014\u200athe kind of gate that only the truly rich, and truly paranoid, possessed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5762\" name=\"5762\">Niels pushed a button on the intercom. Someone picked up, but instead of a \u201chello\u201d there was simply a buzzing sound, followed by the slow opening of the gate, revealing a long driveway abutted by row after row of towering pines.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3f92\" name=\"3f92\">On some level, it made sense to Niels that Gregor would live in the wealthiest neighborhood in Atherton, itself the wealthiest city in the Valley. He was, after all, one of the earliest employees at Anahata and had made billions of dollars when the company went public. But Gregor was also the man who wore faded decades-old shirts every day, ate the same bland lentils at every lunch, and drove a beat-up Jeep to work. Niels had assumed he\u2019d eschew a fancy house and live in austerity in a small condo in crime-ridden East Palo Alto, or perhaps an inconspicuous cottage in the slightly smelly, middle-class part of Mountain View. Anything but the estate that was emerging before Niels\u2019 eyes\u200a\u2014\u200aa sprawling mansion the style of which Niels could only describe as nouveau-chateau, and whose inhabitants Niels would ordinarily assume to be a transplanted Texas blonde and her bejeweled poodle.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0dbb\" name=\"0dbb\">The house was ostentation at its American best, its climbing spires and ornate Mediterranean palacio flourishes the odd manifestation of new money\u2019s dream of old Europe. At the end of the driveway was a large marble fountain\u200a\u2014\u200asix white swans spouting water onto a central lily pad. Rising up behind the fountain was a large marble staircase that led to the front door. Two long, peach-colored wings branched out from the entrance, each ending in a tall, Rapunzel-like tower.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"49e7\" name=\"49e7\">Gregor was waiting for him at the top of the marble steps, dressed in his typical uniform of white T-shirt, khaki pants, and combat boots. In his hand he held two beers, one of which was immediately thrust at Niels, as if Gregor was following a textbook instruction on how to relate to American men. The beer was warm, likely pulled from the pantry just minutes before. Even if this was all just a plot to get something out of him, at least the guy was making an effort. And in any case, it was kind of fun to witness Gregor\u2019s visible discomfort in his role as host.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aaf9\" name=\"aaf9\">If the garish exterior of Gregor\u2019s palace had thrown Niels\u2019 preconceptions, the interior only reaffirmed them. Once inside, Niels could see nothing in the house beyond white walls and a single overhead light in each room. The few windows in existence were so high up from the floor that they reminded Niels of a cathedral\u2026or a prison. There was no artwork, no photographs, no sign of a woman, pet, plant, or any possible sign of life.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bdf6\" name=\"bdf6\">\u201cYou\u2019re not one for decorating, are you?\u201d said Niels, turning to Gregor with a smile designed to communicate friendliness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d4e4\" name=\"d4e4\">\u201cI like simplicity,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cI don\u2019t really like\u2026<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">things</em>.\u201d The word lingered in the air between them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"efcd\" name=\"efcd\">\u201cExcept for an enormous house,\u201d Niels smirked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8a64\" name=\"8a64\">\u201cI only bought a large house so as to have a strong fortress in the event of an anthropogenic risk,\u201d Gregor replied.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7191\" name=\"7191\">\u201cAn anthropo-what?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bd4f\" name=\"bd4f\">\u201cHostile artificial intelligence, nuclear holocaust, fossil energy exhaustion, the collapse of everything.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6e85\" name=\"6e85\">\u201cHa ha\u2026oh\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"445d\" name=\"445d\">Niels stifled his laugh; Gregor wasn\u2019t kidding. The engineer\u2019s face was as smooth as his walls, giving up nothing. He seemed to be staring at an imaginary spot just past Niels\u2019 shoulder, avoiding eye contact.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"84bd\" name=\"84bd\">\u201cYou like wine,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e8e3\" name=\"e8e3\">\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d1c3\" name=\"d1c3\">\u201cFischer said you took him on a wine tasting in Napa a few years ago.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"29ba\" name=\"29ba\">\u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked wine,\u201d Niels said. \u201cI would\u2019ve invited you along.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7380\" name=\"7380\">\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cAnd if you had, I would have said no. We aren\u2019t friends.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e045\" name=\"e045\">Niels coughed. Being a salesman, he wasn\u2019t used to such direct displays of honesty.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1a42\" name=\"1a42\">Gregor\u2019s eyes briefly flicked away from the wall, settling on Niels\u2019 shoulders. \u201cDo you want to see my wine cellar?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2756\" name=\"2756\">Gregor led him down a white hall and through a massive, empty kitchen, at the far end of which was a wide, floor-to-ceiling steel door. Gregor pushed a button, and the door slowly slid into the wall, revealing a flight of stairs leading into darkness. In the seconds before their descent, Niels recalled an article he once read in a tech magazine, in which a successful Valley engineer kept a dungeon underneath his home, holding secret orgies while his nuclear family, clothed in matching pastel cottons, lived happily and unknowingly in the rooms upstairs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"feea\" name=\"feea\">But when Gregor turned on the lights, the illuminated space below revealed nothing more than a simple wine cellar, with row after row of bottle racks, and in the center, two chairs and a wooden table. Atop the table was a decanter filled with wine, and next to it, an empty bottle.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93dd\" name=\"93dd\">Instead of a toast, Gregor spent thirty minutes detailing each wine purchase in length: how much it had cost, what was said about the vintage, and when he was planning to open a particular bottle. He had built an elaborate wine management system that scanned the bottle\u2019s label, then input each detail\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding age, composition, and position in the wine cellar\u200a\u2014\u200ainto an algorithm that determined the ideal \u201cdrink date.\u201d When the date approached, Gregor was sent a notification at two-week, one-week, day-of, and then hourly intervals, alerting him of the impending deadline.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"560d\" name=\"560d\">\u201cOne time I received a notification while on a course of antibiotics,\u201d said Gregor, leaning in just slightly and lowering his voice. \u201cI had this bottle I needed to drink and was worried it was going to go bad. I had to save it until I was well again. It was very upsetting.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bdce\" name=\"bdce\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drink the bottle right that very same day. It\u2019s not like milk.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1bb5\" name=\"1bb5\">\u201cBut then I would get no benefit from such a complex system,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c5b\" name=\"1c5b\">He grabbed the bottle of wine from the wooden table and passed it to Niels, who let out a low whistle of appreciation. It was a Chateau Margaux\u200a\u2014\u200athe holy grail of red wine. Niels couldn\u2019t help but grin. He was going to crush his enemy at the negotiating table while trying one of the world\u2019s most highly regarded wines.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6e6f\" name=\"6e6f\">Niels believed that learning to appreciate wine was an apprenticeship akin to golf\u200a\u2014\u200aat first difficult to acquire, but then indispensable for business and generally agreeable as a pastime. And he had, in fact, come to love the taste of it. Chateau Margaux was a real bragging right, and he had never held its deep ruby on his tongue.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"85a5\" name=\"85a5\">Niels sat down on an uncomfortable wooden chair. One of the spindles was split in the middle, and the raw edge pushed into his spine. He suspected Gregor had never been inside a home furnishings store in his life, that he didn\u2019t see the inconsistency in offering up one of the world\u2019s most expensive wines in such a dank and uncomfortable setting. For all his engineering brilliance, Gregor would never even have made it past the sales team\u2019s entry-level \u201cHospitality &amp; Negotiation\u201d training course.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"336e\" name=\"336e\">Gregor poured the wine from the decanter and handed a glass to Niels. The men studied the wine and took in the aroma, each eying the other over his glass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6fe3\" name=\"6fe3\">But the deep tones of the Chateau Margaux transformed them. Niels loosened his tie, Gregor slouched just slightly in his chair. It was an exceptional wine. And after they took their first sip, Niels had the sudden realization that this was the first nondisagreeable experience the two had shared since Niels joined Anahata six years earlier. Gregor even tried to offer a slight smile, pushing it onto his face as though it were a heavy wooden beam. But at least he was trying.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"abf2\" name=\"abf2\">Niels did not say a word\u200a\u2014\u200aMaster Negotiator Rule #33: Approach silence like a battlefield. He who speaks first shows his hand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ffe5\" name=\"ffe5\">Niels sipped his wine slowly but decisively. He imagined his Adam\u2019s apple bulging then receding, like a heaving warrior ready to break through enemy lines. A warrior with rippling abs and a weathered loincloth that barely covered his forceful manhood. He could crush this wine glass with just a slight clenching of his fingers. It would shatter at his feet, taking with it all of Gregor\u2019s dreams and \u2014</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"56b6\" name=\"56b6\">\u201cDo you read any philosophy?\u201d Gregor asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9546\" name=\"9546\">\u201cNot really,\u201d Niels said. \u201cI mean, college, but that was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"faad\" name=\"faad\">\u201cI thought so,\u201d said Gregor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"efc0\" name=\"efc0\">Niels wanted to tell Gregor that he had graduated summa cum laude in economics from Yale, that he had been a Rhodes scholar, that he had won a Cambridge debate on the virtues of Adam Smith\u200a\u2014\u200abut he held back. It was best to let the conversation advance smoothly toward the negotiation point.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e542\" name=\"e542\">\u201cFor centuries,\u201d Gregor began, \u201cpeople have tried to create the perfect society.

To transpose the ideal on our reality.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9683\" name=\"9683\">Niels imagined Gregor sitting on his white couch, within his white walls, reading Greek philosophers after a hard day\u2019s work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c484\" name=\"c484\">\u201cMany people have tried to create a community of like-minded individuals, with the aim of a peaceful and collaborative rule\u200a\u2014\u200aa utopia, if you will.

He coughed, then continued.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"96db\" name=\"96db\">\u201cWe know how to do it.

In a sharp whisper, his eyes blazing, \u201cNiels, we\u2019re going to the moon!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d091\" name=\"d091\">It took Niels a few seconds to realize what he had just heard. He moved to speak, but Gregor\u2019s hand stopped him, his words spilling over his palm and rushing at Niels.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fc18\" name=\"fc18\">\u201cWe\u2019ve figured out how to build the perfect society\u200a\u2014\u200aand from all angles, from actual technical infrastructure to the societal structure. We\u2019ve figured it all out!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e94\" name=\"7e94\">The Master Negotiator faltered and a laugh escaped from him, rudely punctuating Gregor\u2019s plan. Niels couldn\u2019t help himself\u200a\u2014\u200awith just one simple, absurd phrase, six years of intimidation had evaporated. Gregor wasn\u2019t anyone to be afraid of. He was simply insane. And that was surely to Niels\u2019 advantage, though he knew one had to proceed carefully with crazy people. They could be unpredictable.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7624\" name=\"7624\">\u201cSlow down,\u201d Niels said. \u201cAre you joking with me?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f0ec\" name=\"f0ec\">\u201cWe have been working on the project for a year,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cFifty engineers working in secret in Building 1.

How are you dealing with gravity? Wait, never mind, don\u2019t answer that. What I mean is, since when did Anahata get into the business of humankind?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5963\" name=\"5963\">\u201cAnahata has always <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">only</em> ever been about humankind.

How do you know how to construct a society?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5c1c\" name=\"5c1c\">\u201cActually, a society is a lot like software.

He pushed his chair closer, and Niels couldn\u2019t help but lean forward. The broken wooden spindle leaned with him, pushing into his back. But he did not move to swat it away; his eyes were locked on Gregor, their faces almost touching.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"48ce\" name=\"48ce\">\u201cAlgorithms,\u201d Gregor whispered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"596b\" name=\"596b\">\u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d Niels snorted. \u201cThese are humans we\u2019re talking about, not robots. You can\u2019t predict and control human behavior with algorithms.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fe25\" name=\"fe25\">\u201cThat is an emotional reaction to what is a very logical project. And, yes, an algorithm could have predicted that you would respond that way. Even irrational behavior is rational when seen as a larger grouping of patterns. And as you can imagine, this project is built on patterns of success. Project Y, we call it. It will save Anahata\u200a\u2014\u200aand, as a result, humankind.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c637\" name=\"c637\">Niels shook his head. He had come to ask Gregor to slap some silly ads on a dumb bracelet; Gregor was telling him they were going to build a moon colony. If Gregor wasn\u2019t crazy, then Niels was stupid for asking for so little in return.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e565\" name=\"e565\">\u201cLet me get this straight. We\u2019re wasting tons of company money for a totally altruistic endeavor? There\u2019s not a single business purpose in all of this?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c0a0\" name=\"c0a0\">\u201cObviously there\u2019s a business purpose,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cThat\u2019s where it all started.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3136\" name=\"3136\">Niels smirked\u200a\u2014\u200anow they were speaking his language. The company always talked about saving the world, and sometimes really did believe in it, but Bobby always made sure there was a monetization element involved\u200a\u2014\u200aand that Niels was in charge of ensuring the project\u2019s economic success.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f717\" name=\"f717\">\u201cTell me more,\u201d said Niels, leaning back in his uncomfortable chair.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f791\" name=\"f791\">\u201cProject Y is fundamentally about protecting our employees and our company from outside threats,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2872\" name=\"2872\">\u201cSo this is about beating Galt.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8b35\" name=\"8b35\">\u201cAnd any future Galt. We have the world\u2019s best engineers, and if we lose them, we lose everything. But if we build them a utopia, they will never have any reason to leave.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"61dd\" name=\"61dd\">\u201cDon\u2019t you think the company\u2019s already done a pretty good job of building a worker\u2019s paradise?\u201d Niels said. \u201cIf anything, we\u2019ve made all these engineers into self-entitled, smoothie-guzzling cult members who will never have any reason to leave. Where else could they have job titles like \u2018Evangelist,\u2019 \u2018Security Warrior,\u2019 \u2018Protector of All Things Internet,\u2019 and \u2018Debuggenator\u2019?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4fc7\" name=\"4fc7\">Gregor shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough anymore. Free food, massages, and light-saber aerobics were revolutionary when we first started the company. But nowadays, every startup has them. The smaller companies can offer faster career mobility, wider remit, and most important, by dint of being small and under the radar, they can innovate wildly through illegality. Just think\u200a\u2014\u200awhen was the last time we were able to get away with selling a user\u2019s private data or violate someone\u2019s copyright? Those golden days are gone. We simply can\u2019t compete. And Galt knows it. Everyone knows it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3682\" name=\"3682\">Niels couldn\u2019t disagree. Galt was a real threat, particularly in the Valley, where the average shelf life of even the most successful tech companies was just a decade or two. Anahata was already ten years old. Practically ancient.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c4cf\" name=\"c4cf\">\u201cSo, if you build a colony on the moon\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c058\" name=\"c058\">\u201cThe better way to state it is, if we build an isolated utopia\u200a\u2014\u200awhich just happens to be on the moon\u200a\u2014\u200athen we will secure the future of this company. No more Galt headhunters. No more Galt stealing our great ideas.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b659\" name=\"b659\">\u201cAnd you\u2019ll just lock the employees up there on the moon? Give them a one-way ticket?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4ecb\" name=\"4ecb\">\u201cImagine\u200a\u2014\u200aa planet full of geniuses!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22e8\" name=\"22e8\">Niels shook his head. \u201cSurely there are easier ways to do this. What about raising employees\u2019 salaries or giving them longer vacations? Going to the moon seems extreme. I see no value add to the company.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e85\" name=\"7e85\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Value add</em>?\u201d Gregor sneered. \u201cYour statement is not made true by its redundancy. There is indeed value. It\u2019s only by tackling what seems impossible that you can ensure no one else will do it. Galt can compete with bigger salaries and fancy perks, but they won\u2019t be able to compete with a moon colony. Plus, we\u2019re building a utopia that no engineer will ever want to leave. We\u2019ll be unstoppable! All other utopian societies have failed\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s a big problem that no one\u2019s solved. It\u2019s a huge opportunity for us.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"837b\" name=\"837b\">\u201cOr the sign that we will fail like all the others,\u201d Niels sighed. A moon colony was crazy even by Anahata standards.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0b0d\" name=\"0b0d\">\u201cOur utopia will be different. We\u2019ve spent several months analyzing the best combinations of political thought, philosophy, and technological advances necessary to achieve a better society. We\u2019ve also looked at societal failures through the centuries\u200a\u2014\u200aRome, Byzantium, and so forth. What was consistent throughout was a lack of individual purpose. As a society progresses, it becomes more specialized, and while its citizens become ever more dependent on each other, they have no relationship with the tasks they perform. They are cogs in a wheel they never wanted to build.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d63b\" name=\"d63b\">Niels remembered late-night pot-filled conversations in college that sounded a lot like this. He fiddled again with the wooden spindle digging into his back. When the first ad appeared on Moodify, he\u2019d send Gregor a new chair as a snide gift. Nothing was more insulting to a rich man than to send him a better version of what he already owned.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"23dc\" name=\"23dc\">\u201cWe will take the best sampling of society and give people roles that fit their skills,\u201d Gregor continued. \u201cThe man born to be a mechanical engineer will be a mechanical engineer. He who cooks well will be a cook. There will be no <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">anomie</em>\u200a\u2014\u200aI guess you don\u2019t know the philosopher \u00c9mile Durkheim? But in any case, every man will have his place. Every man will work together, for himself and for the greater good of the group.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1be1\" name=\"1be1\">Niels put one hand behind his back and began to twist at the base of the wooden spindle, trying to wrench it free from the chair. It wouldn\u2019t budge no matter how hard he tried. He could feel the sweat forming amateurish circles under his expensive shirt.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2656\" name=\"2656\">\u201cThis goddamn chair\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201c</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3b74\" name=\"3b74\">He looked up and saw Gregor studying him, expressionless.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5955\" name=\"5955\">\u201cI mean,\u201d Niels said, \u201chow are you going to transport all of mankind to the moon?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b36d\" name=\"b36d\">\u201cOh no,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cThat would just be bringing along the bad seeds and all their earthly problems. There is a full selection process. The bulk of the group will be engineers, of course, as they perform very well across every factor we\u2019ve determined necessary for success. You see, we have calculated a target percentage for every category of person and skill type that we need in order to have a high societal success rate.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8514\" name=\"8514\">\u201cArgh!\u201d growled Niels, the spindle behaving even more egregiously than before, pushing on his spine, scratching at his well-buffed skin. Such a crappy chair had no place in his existence. He worked way too hard and earned too much money to have to sit in chairs like this.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4678\" name=\"4678\">He scooted to the edge of his chair, but the spindle followed him, digging into him, pushing him forward and downward as though he were Gregor\u2019s supplicant. Unacceptable!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d48a\" name=\"d48a\">Niels leaped to his feet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3fb0\" name=\"3fb0\">\u201cSit. Please,\u201d said Gregor, leaning across and pulling the the spindle out of Niels\u2019 chair in one single, swift movement.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ac13\" name=\"ac13\">\u201cAs you may have guessed,\u201d said Gregor, laying the spindle next to the bottle of wine, \u201csales employees won\u2019t be as likely to be admitted to the moon colony given the high bar, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a shot. If you help us, I can even imagine we\u2019d raise the percentage of acceptance for the sales employees. Provided, of course, that they pass the necessary tests.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"98e9\" name=\"98e9\">Niels snatched the spindle from the table and pointed it at Gregor. He thought the move looked intimidating, menacing even. But then he glanced down and realized he looked more like an orchestra conductor. He threw the spindle to the ground.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7521\" name=\"7521\">\u201cYou always get so upset when I speak in a factual manner about the sales team\u2019s IQ,\u201d Gregor continued. \u201cBut you should listen objectively to this plan, because there\u2019s a part that you\u2019re going to love.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"178e\" name=\"178e\">Gregor paused, then drew out his words. \u201cI\u2026will\u2026let\u2026you\u2026monetize.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"52e6\" name=\"52e6\">Niels eyebrows shot upward in genuine surprise.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7b53\" name=\"7b53\">\u201cMonetize the moon? You\u2019ll let me do that?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"80ad\" name=\"80ad\">\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b520\" name=\"b520\">\u201cBut\u2026you never let me monetize,\u201d said Niels, sitting down. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d92d\" name=\"d92d\">\u201cI\u2019ll let you export the moon minerals,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cYou and your team will go down there and pull them out and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"445f\" name=\"445f\">\u201cMinerals!\u201d roared Niels, rocketing out of his chair. \u201cMy team sells internet advertising, Gregor, not minerals! Internet advertising!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3843\" name=\"3843\">\u201cWell, before they can sell the minerals, they need to get them out of the ground, so the selling part is sort of a moot point at this stage.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0656\" name=\"0656\">\u201cYou want my sales team to become miners?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f786\" name=\"f786\">Gregor looked puzzled. \u201cOh, I hadn\u2019t really thought they would be the miners. But now that you suggest it, it\u2019s not a bad idea. The skill sets do overlap, I suppose. The \u2018core competencies,\u2019 as you call them, are the same\u200a\u2014\u200adirt digging, rubbing elbows with worms, hunting for gold\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"424e\" name=\"424e\">\u201cGregor!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8a89\" name=\"8a89\">\u201cOne thing,\u201d said Gregor, holding up his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get too excited. We can\u2019t export minerals right away. It really doesn\u2019t become economical until we build the space elevator, and that\u2019s not on the roadmap until late next year.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6134\" name=\"6134\">\u201cSpace elevator?!? You are going to sink this company!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f23\" name=\"1f23\">Niels knew it was time. He jumped onto his chair and stomped his feet. He waved his arms in the air again, willing his face redder and redder, sputtering a few expletives to express his outrage at Gregor\u2019s ridiculous plan. While not all business meetings required such theatrics, almost one hundred percent of Niels\u2019 negotiations involved either throwing a pen or stomping away from the table. He found it was often the best way to force a rapprochement from his opponent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"54c2\" name=\"54c2\">\u201cSit down,\u201d said Gregor, pouring them both more wine. \u201cYou have nothing to be concerned about. Project Y is highly economical. By retaining our best engineers and protecting our most secret projects, we save hundreds of millions of dollars each year. And that\u2019s before even calculating the potential upside from building the world\u2019s first functioning utopia. Ultimately, we think this could generate tens of billions of dollars of new revenue.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5a9\" name=\"c5a9\">Niels slowly lowered his arms, but he wasn\u2019t sure what to do with them. Feigned outrage was a tried-and-true technique\u200a\u2014\u200awhy hadn\u2019t it worked this time? Just the previous week, Niels had used the same approach on the CEO of the world\u2019s largest advertising firm, and in a matter of minutes the guy agreed to make his own car a surface for real-time Anahata ads.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ebc6\" name=\"ebc6\">He decided to continue standing on the chair. Niels threw his hands on his hips and puffed out his chest, then clenched his fists to make his biceps pop.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fb71\" name=\"fb71\">\u201cSo you\u2019re going to put a whole bunch of male engineers alone on a planet, huh?

But at least their motivation was pure\u200a\u2014\u200ato escape the jungle on behalf of Anahata. This is why they are the ultimate citizens of our new society. They will always work for its greater benefit and not be led astray by the petty distractions that affect so many other people. Distractions like\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"402a\" name=\"402a\">Gregor\u2019s eyes flashed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"934c\" name=\"934c\">\u201cDistractions like pots of gold.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c0ce\" name=\"c0ce\">It was clearly a dig. But last year\u2019s sales incentive\u200a\u2014\u200ain which Niels had promised a pot of authentic gold doubloons to any sales team member who doubled their returns in a quarter\u200a\u2014\u200ahad proved to be a brilliant motivational technique. Anahata had tripled its profits that year thanks to a bit of luck o\u2019 the Irish. Niels wasn\u2019t crazy; he was shrewd. And that, he believed, was the difference between him and the man seated below him. There was no reasoning with insanity.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a528\" name=\"a528\">\u201cWhat do you want from me,\u201d Niels asked, throwing his hands up. He was no longer certain of his next move. Should he come down from the chair? Or maybe it was best to speak to Bobby directly, though that also carried risks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5dc4\" name=\"5dc4\">\u201cStop blocking my teams from testing on Shanley Field,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cFree up the servers in Eastern Africa.

He was used to arguing over dollars in well-lit restaurants, not debating with a psychopath in his wine dungeon. It was time to play the Bobby card.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0279\" name=\"0279\">\u201cI think we need to talk about this\u200a\u2014\u200aseriously talk about this at a very, very long management meeting.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a9d7\" name=\"a9d7\">Gregor\u2019s face tightened. \u201cThere is nothing to talk about.

We\u2019re not done!\u201d Gregor yelped.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6025\" name=\"6025\">Niels suppressed a grin. Clearly, all was not lost. He counted to five in his head, and slowly, slowly turned toward his prey.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d0ff\" name=\"d0ff\">\u201cMaybe there is a way\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5a76\" name=\"5a76\">\u201cI\u2019m sure we can find a compromise,\u201d said Gregor, the slight tremble in his voice confirming Niels\u2019 hunch.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f4e\" name=\"2f4e\">Gregor was afraid Niels would turn Bobby against him. It never ceased to amaze him the things grown men feared. Niels feared no one.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"703f\" name=\"703f\">\u201cI want ads on Moodify,\u201d Niels said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"47ea\" name=\"47ea\">Gregor\u2019s face scrunched into a sour ball, then unfolded into a scowl before disappearing underneath his skin. A second later, it was as if his face had never hosted any expression at all.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"672f\" name=\"672f\">\u201cListen,\u201d said Niels, \u201cyou let me put ads on Moodify and I\u2019ll support you one hundred percent in the moon colony project. Shanley Field, servers in Africa\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019ll even give you a few sales guys who can wash your engineers\u2019 laundry on the moon.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"da3d\" name=\"da3d\">Niels held out his hand, but Gregor made no move toward him. For a minute, the two men stared at each other without moving.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"aa8f\" name=\"aa8f\">\u201cPutting ads on Moodify bracelets is bad for our users,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4b86\" name=\"4b86\">Niels shrugged. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just discuss this with Bobby tomorrow and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"77b3\" name=\"77b3\">\u201cWait,\u201d said Gregor, jumping out of his seat and moving quickly toward Niels. \u201cThere is something I have to show you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a629\" name=\"a629\">Gregor took a few slow steps backwards toward the stairs, as if his gaze could freeze Niels in place. He then turned and bounded up the steps, letting the door slide gently behind him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fef1\" name=\"fef1\">Down below, Niels crossed his arms and yawned loudly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"baa0\" name=\"baa0\">But once Gregor was gone, Niels began to rub his temples. Why hadn\u2019t he just gone into banking instead? Greedy capitalists were so much easier to negotiate with than engineers.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"a222\" name=\"a222\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"6bc9\" name=\"6bc9\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"9669\" name=\"9669\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">F</span>ive miles away, Arsyen Aimo was also thinking about money\u200a\u2014\u200anamely, that thanks to his huge new salary, he was once again on the winning side of capitalism and ready to upgrade his entire life.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"77da\" name=\"77da\">Part of that upgrade definitely involved getting a new girlfriend\u200a\u2014\u200apreferably an American one with excellent teeth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a992\" name=\"a992\">Of course, he already had a girlfriend, Natia, though that had happened somewhat by accident.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2128\" name=\"2128\">A year earlier, he had signed up to an online dating site as \u201cRick,\u201d a blond surfer from Santa Cruz. Rick resembled an underwear model, with a chiseled body, defined jawline, and a strong nose echoing Arsyen\u2019s own good looks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f815\" name=\"f815\">The first woman he met was Natia\u200a\u2014\u200aherself masking as a Romanian grad student at Berkeley. Between her confusion of Los Angeles as a Northern Californian city and Arsyen\u2019s own English mistakes, they quickly called each other\u2019s bluff and soon were speaking to each other in Pyrrhian.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4cc7\" name=\"4cc7\">They struck up a fast virtual friendship\u200a\u2014\u200anot more than that initially, as they were both too practical to imagine dating someone thousands of miles away. Arsyen took pains to conceal his true identity. From his experience, once a Pyrrhian woman knew she was in the presence of an Aimo, all hopes of reasonable conversation dissolved in a puddle of sighs. Instead, he told her about living in America, about drive-through pharmacies and the endless array of flavored sparkling water, and the importance of sanitation engineers like Arsyen, who fixed the various clogs, stains, and crumbs that could slow the infrastructure of a fast-moving startup.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05b6\" name=\"05b6\">She in turn wrote to him about her life in Poodlekek, Pyrrhia\u2019s capital. Natia worked as a switchboard operator for the national telecommunications firm, a graying dinosaur that was slowly moving Pyrrhia into the 1980s. She belonged to a political philosophy group, which met weekly to discuss why Marxism failed and whether man could subvert machine in a post-capitalist society. Arsyen found her little intellectual forays rather cute. There would be no need for political philosophy once royal reign was restored, but why discourage Natia from stretching her feminine brain in the meantime?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c12\" name=\"2c12\">She was particularly passionate in her dislike of General (now President) Korpeko\u200a\u2014\u200athe source of the Aimo family\u2019s undoing. He was a \u201cdespot,\u201d she wrote, \u201chell-bent on pushing sports and false achievements instead of encouraging the true prosperity of the nation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c4a7\" name=\"c4a7\">Among her many gripes was Korpeko\u2019s obsession with the little-known sport of curling. He believed it was Pyrrhia\u2019s ticket to international fame\u200a\u2014\u200asufficiently obscure as to ensure little competition from wealthier countries. Korpeko had replaced all the bike lanes and gutters along main roads with curling courts, and no vacations or trips outside the country were allowed during the first week of February, now known as Pyrrhian Curling Week. Arsyen\u2019s stomach tightened each time he imagined Korpeko\u2019s curling lanes snaking across Pyrrhia\u2019s unmarred hills.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a98a\" name=\"a98a\">\u201cIt sounds nothing like the rich cultural life that once flourished under the royal family,\u201d Arsyen wrote to Natia, thinking of the literary salons and long afternoon croquet matches his family hosted at their summer palace for the Pyrrhian elite. The king had generously ensured that vivid accounts of the affairs were published in all of the country\u2019s newspapers so literate citizens could vicariously enjoy the experience.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8007\" name=\"8007\">\u201cDo you remember the photos of them playing croquet atop their verdant courts?\u201d Arsyen asked. \u201cIt was far more dignified.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5f4f\" name=\"5f4f\">\u201cYes, I suppose if you consider hitting a ball a more civilized activity than rolling a puck,\u201d Natia replied.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1875\" name=\"1875\">Natia\u2019s lack of appreciation for croquet was one of the many shortcomings Arsyen had been forced to tolerate as a lowly janitor. Another was the mole on her cheek\u200a\u2014\u200ait was just a little too big for his liking; he often found himself covering it up with his thumb whenever they did video chat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a3af\" name=\"a3af\">Luckily, product managers didn\u2019t have to put up with such defects. When product managers discovered problems, they fixed them. And that\u2019s exactly what Arsyen planned to do.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7f57\" name=\"7f57\">With a fat new paycheck now coming his way, Arsyen was better equipped to find himself a beautiful American girl\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone like that hippie receptionist, Jennie. Then, when the time was right, he would return to Pyrrhia bronzed and wealthy, with his beautiful queen and her good orthodontics on display. Natia and the other women of Pyrrhia would weep at what they had lost, only able to take comfort in the possibility of becoming one of Arsyen\u2019s bathing maidens.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"32ac\" name=\"32ac\">So it was decided: Natia was out. The only question was whether to write her a breakup email now or first play his video game.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0b3b\" name=\"0b3b\">Arsyen opted for the video game. And there he was, a half-hour later, stuck on his couch, glued to his screen, when the phone rang.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"33ef\" name=\"33ef\">It was the chief strategist with the Throne Reclamation Committee (the TRC).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4f7e\" name=\"4f7e\">\u201cHave you heard the news? A train went off Golden Bridge and fell into the lake.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2a56\" name=\"2a56\">\u201cMmmhmm,\u201d said Arsyen, drawing his sword and piercing the heart of a castle guard. \u201cIt was probably a drunk conductor. Our trains are flawless.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71cd\" name=\"71cd\">The national rail service had been one of the great Aimo accomplishments\u200a\u2014\u200achristened by his father as \u201clocomotives of progress and prosperity.\u201d The king even had a toy train replica built to travel over their palace moat and directly into Arsyen\u2019s bedroom. He wondered if that train was still there\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly the first-class carriage, outfitted with miniature foodstuffs. As a teenager, Arsyen often threw the train\u2019s gold-plated bison fries at his manservant Sklartar when the old man wasn\u2019t moving fast enough.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5d59\" name=\"5d59\">\u201cThey say you could hear the screams of the children as the train flew through the air,\u201d the strategist said, \u201cthat the flames moved across the sky like a rocket.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5953\" name=\"5953\">\u201cHuh,\u201d said Arsyen, his thumb pumping up and down on the console button as he sliced through the head of one of the king\u2019s henchmen. Tragedies often befell poor nations. There wasn\u2019t much point in getting worked up over a handful of dead bodies.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"271d\" name=\"271d\">The felled henchman rose, holding his head in his hands. He was coming back for more. As Arsyen pumped the console with his thumbs, the phone fell from his ear. No matter, if the news was that important, he was sure to hear from the TRC again. Nothing was going to interrupt his game. He had made it through his grueling first week at Anahata and deserved some downtime.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f2f1\" name=\"f2f1\">Arsyen glanced at his email on his way to the bathroom a few minutes later and saw that Natia had written. She too was obsessed with the train accident. She claimed the government had stopped any media from reporting the event, fearful that the news could put a damper on its bid to host the International Curling Championships the following year. Government workers had already begun repairing the bridge, and no effort was being made to dredge up the train. Meanwhile, the police were arresting anyone they believed was spreading rumors. All internet services were blocked in the capital, and Natia had been forced to travel outside the province to get to any caf\u00e9 with open access. \u201cIf they find out I am here, they will arrest me, or worse!\u201d She wrote. \u201cHelp us get the word out about what happened. Hundreds are dead!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"43e4\" name=\"43e4\">Arsyen had assumed the TRC had been talking about ten people. Hundreds of people elevated the train wreck to a national disaster\u200a\u2014\u200athe kind of thing worthy of a future king\u2019s attention.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"54d9\" name=\"54d9\">\u201cWhat would a king do\u2026?\u201d Arsyen wondered aloud, imagining himself laying his healing hands upon thousands of maimed Pyrrhians, their bodies draped in rags\u200a\u2014\u200arags he would eventually replace with velvet robes!\u200a\u2014\u200aas they lay prostrate before him. They shielded their eyes from his divine light, and chanted his name to the ground below them. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">King Arsyen. King Arsyen.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93f6\" name=\"93f6\">He shook himself back to reality. His dream was still far off. Whatever happened in Pyrrhia now would certainly be repeated in a year\u2019s time, with a new set of mothers rolled out to despair over the loss of their children at the hands of Korpeko\u2019s corrupt and negligent government. He needed to be patient and let these minor catastrophes accumulate. At the point of ten train wrecks, the time might finally be right for a royal coup.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8ccd\" name=\"8ccd\">But in the meantime, Arsyen could at least give a nudge toward revolution and have some quick fun with Korpeko. If working in technology had taught him anything, it\u2019s that the internet loves a troll.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93b3\" name=\"93b3\">While working at Galt, Arsyen had learned about GaltPages\u200a\u2014\u200aa popular tool that aggregated everything people had to say on all the different Galt apps. He even half-started his own GaltPage a few months earlier to promote his Aimo Air Freshener\u200a\u2014\u200aa custom pink mixture he invented out of cleaning supplies so he could cover up the persistent stench of body odor that permeated the Galt meeting rooms. Its cotton candy scent would one day make Arsyen millions\u200a\u2014\u200aprovided he could figure out how to keep it from combusting.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8bbb\" name=\"8bbb\">He hadn\u2019t gotten very far with his page back then, but Galt seemed to have made its product easier to use since he last tried. He could easily repurpose his early work to suit Natia\u2019s social justice needs\u200a\u2014\u200athe fluffy pink plume of cotton candy in the page\u2019s background no longer suggesting a sweet scent but rather an artsy take on a nuclear holocaust. And, Arsyen told himself, there was a potential bonus to be had in all of this: If enough people were interested in what he posted about Poodlekek, he could collect their contact info and sell them his air freshener once all the furor died down.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d4b\" name=\"9d4b\">Arsyen had worked in the Valley long enough to know that the key to social media was virality, not sincerity. So he renamed the page \u201cJustice for Poodlekek\u201d and posted Natia\u2019s text about the accident, calling for action. He then posted the link to Justice for Poodlekek in the comment section of every Pyrrhian blog and newspaper article he could find and wrote a review of Korpeko\u2019s government on the restaurant review site Help! Then he added pictures of Golden Bridge to his Photomatic account, using the retro and futuristic filters, as well as a bleaker one with a sprinkling of decapitated bodies.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5e39\" name=\"5e39\">Arsyen leaned back in his chair and put his hands behind his head. It was an awfully nice thing he had just done for Natia, and it would hopefully assuage her disappointment when he broke up with her in favor of dating Jennie.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d72f\" name=\"d72f\">He returned to his video game and quickly forgot about the page. But a while later, passing by his computer on the way to the kitchen, he saw that the previously blank comment section of Justice for Poodlekek now hosted a long list of responses. The view count was already in the thousands and climbing with each minute. Arsyen did a double take: People seemed to really be upset by this train thing. And not just the train, but about Korpeko and his government as well.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"d385\" name=\"d385\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">The street light has been out for two weeks.</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"2515\" name=\"2515\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Why is there no bison milk on Mondays?</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"0682\" name=\"0682\">Arsyen squealed with delight. His people seemed so unhappy! He hit the refresh button again and again, each new complaint augmenting his euphoria.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"b28d\" name=\"b28d\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Korpeko will drag our country into further poverty!</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"60ff\" name=\"60ff\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">I hate curling!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"44b5\" name=\"44b5\">Arsyen couldn\u2019t resist posting a comment under a fake name.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"1ebd\" name=\"1ebd\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">This never would have happened when the Aimos were in power!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"08aa\" name=\"08aa\">Someone replied immediately.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"9210\" name=\"9210\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">That\u2019s true. King Aimo would\u2019ve made us play croquet until our fingers fell off.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"9435\" name=\"9435\">Arsyen laughed. That had indeed happened to a few unlucky peasants who had trespassed on the royal croquet court.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e48\" name=\"4e48\">As the minutes passed, complaints about bison milk were replaced by complaints about potholes, potholes by accusations of corruption, corruption by torture.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9efc\" name=\"9efc\">Arsyen did a small jig before his computer, then paused\u200a\u2014\u200afirst to check out his flexed biceps reflected on his computer screen, and then to update his page with a new message.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"4834\" name=\"4834\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">My people, we must take action!!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"b52a\" name=\"b52a\">Of course, Arsyen knew President Korpeko would put it all down. That\u2019s how it happened in Pyrrhia and the rest of the poor world. People protested and waved hand-painted signs, and then, if they weren\u2019t disappeared by the government, they trudged back to work on Monday.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5ca2\" name=\"5ca2\">But Arsyen\u2019s well-meaning but rather stupid Pyrrhian subjects couldn\u2019t see that far ahead. Instead, the misery of Pyrrhia wrote itself across the Justice for Poodlekek page. The decay of the streets, the decay of the nation, the decay of everything, really, but the country\u2019s gleaming curling lanes. The page\u2019s followers swelled into the thousands within minutes. Soon they were asking about the creator of Justice for Poodlekek, calling on him to lead them forward.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"67a6\" name=\"67a6\">It was terrible timing. He still had six levels to go in his video game.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0bde\" name=\"0bde\">\u201cMen of action take action,\u201d Arsyen said to himself, repeating a poster he had seen outside one of Anahata\u2019s sales buildings.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ac7c\" name=\"ac7c\">He composed a short note to Natia:</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"c60b\" name=\"c60b\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">My dear Natia, I have made a GaltPage to help you spread the word.

What if Natia showed up one day in California without that unfortunate mole and wanted to sleep with him?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6129\" name=\"6129\">He began to type again.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"fc7a\" name=\"fc7a\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Let me know if you ever come to California.

He would meet Gregor\u2019s final, desperate plea for cooperation with the same dismissal with which Gregor had treated Niels\u2019 chair-jumping antics.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"27c7\" name=\"27c7\">Niels pictured Gregor lugging the mysterious proof of his superior world order down the stairs, his combat boots thudding against the wooden steps, then stomping to the table. What did he want to show Niels? A philosophy book? A line of code? A diorama? Regardless, Niels\u2019 expression would remain placid, unmoved, mouth silent in Guntlagian style until Gregor\u2019s desperation grew to the point where Niels would only need to repeat three words: \u201cAds on Moodify.\u201d Maybe he would even agree to let Niels put ads on employee T-shirts and the meeting-room chairs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6e1c\" name=\"6e1c\">When had Gregor left exactly? Half an hour earlier? An hour? It was starting to seem like an awfully long time to leave someone waiting in a basement.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7717\" name=\"7717\">It was obvious what Gregor was trying to do. He had locked Niels in the cellar in order to assert his dominance and put Niels on edge. But these kinds of mind tricks and one-upmanship were old hat for a Master Negotiator. After all, Niels was the man who had challenged a quadriplegic music executive to a game of rugby; the man who hid <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">E. coli </em>in an opponent\u2019s entree so he could pitch him on a business proposition as the other lay prostrate before the toilet for six hours. This wine cellar act was amateurish.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"269c\" name=\"269c\">That said, why would a grown man lock a work colleague in his basement? Was that something Germans found funny? Or maybe Gregor was in fact Austrian. The Austrians were famous for their appreciation of basements. For a split second, Niels\u2019 body tensed as he imagined Gregor descending the stairs in a pair of leather pants.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f585\" name=\"f585\">Niels closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and opened them again. He couldn\u2019t help but respect his opponent for planting these seeds of doubt. Five minutes passed, then ten. Niels felt splinters from the chair making inroads into the back of his arms. Shapes emerged from the shadows, then receded. Another twenty minutes passed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"15c7\" name=\"15c7\">Niels knew he shouldn\u2019t panic, but the shadows, the quiet, the unpredictability of his opponent all began to cloud his confidence. The longer he sat and paced and sat and paced, the more Niels became convinced that the taciturn Teuton was planning to leave him there all night, returning only once confident that he had broken the Master Negotiator.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cbb7\" name=\"cbb7\">Niels needed to plot his escape. From his shirt pocket, he pulled out the pen and pad of paper that he always carried with him. In a world of internet intangibles, Niels found reassurance in last-century items.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e2cd\" name=\"e2cd\">His high-level plan of attack was fairly easy to map. First, Niels needed to get himself out of the basement, and second, he needed to stop Gregor\u2019s moon colony plan. (Third, he needed to destroy Gregor, though that was a longer-term goal that would require a separate strategy and PowerPoint deck.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8b02\" name=\"8b02\">The question, of course, was how to go about these things. Niels considered the obvious\u200a\u2014\u200ahe could call another member of the management team. But as soon as Fischer, HR Paul, or Old Al showed up, Gregor would have some story ready and they would all have a good chuckle over Niels\u2019 paranoia. Word would get out around Anahata, and even his own team would eventually find out about his panicked call for help. Exhilarated by the scent of weakness, the salesmen would circle him like the killer sharks he had trained them to be. It would be the end of him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9a1a\" name=\"9a1a\">Instead, Niels sketched a mountain. At the base, he wrote, \u201cMe.\u201d At the summit, he wrote \u201cFREEDOM.\u201d Then he paused, realizing that he had failed to capture the full complexity of the situation. So he drew a second mountain next to the first. Now he had a mountain range. At the base of that second mountain, Niels wrote, \u201cGregor announces Moon Colony Plan.\u201d At the top, he wrote, \u201cI DESTROY the Moon Colony Plan!!!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b94f\" name=\"b94f\">After a few minutes, and a few trees and shrubs added to his drawing for good measure, Niels had the entire route mapped, from base camp to summit. He was ready to go. He leaped out of his chair and did fifty jumping jacks, followed by one hundred situps, enjoying the rush of blood through his body. Niels would save Anahata from the worst decision it could ever make, and possibly even get Gregor fired in the process.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6aed\" name=\"6aed\">The first step was simple. He would ring Bobby and suggest that he pick Niels up at Gregor\u2019s house for a midnight yoga class. Bobby was a sucker for yoga invites and had stated on numerous occasions that he wished the management team would chant together. Niels, for his part, thought yoga was the lazy man\u2019s excuse for exercise, but like golf and wine, he saw value in its acquisition. Yoga had not only helped him meet several lonely housewives, but had also distinguished him as the only member of Bobby\u2019s team who could execute <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Chaturanga Dandasana</em>\u200a\u2014\u200aproviding a reasonable excuse for him to seed business ideas over sun salutations.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"888c\" name=\"888c\">Niels pulled out his phone, selected Bobby\u2019s number, and was soon hit by his mountain\u2019s first boulder. There was no reception in Gregor\u2019s basement.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dca\" name=\"3dca\">He was not used to being knocked down so early in the game, but like a true sales champion, Niels rose quickly. \u201cOnly losers lose,\u201d he whispered to himself, quoting one of the motivational posters in his office. He did five pushups with one hand, then jumped to his feet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b39b\" name=\"b39b\">Niels tapped his phone\u2019s email application and began to type:</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"7d3f\" name=\"7d3f\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Bobby, have just heard of a killer nighttime yoga studio in Mill Valley. Fantastic kombucha bar. I can get us in. Can you meet tonight? I\u2019m at Gregor\u2019s \u2014 stuck in his basement actually, funny story. Come grab me and we can head straight to the studio.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"b643\" name=\"b643\">He paused. Would Bobby sense desperation? He needed to make his message appear as normal and Niels-like as possible.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"7c51\" name=\"7c51\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Also, Gregor told me all about Project Y. Fascinating idea. I have some ideas about how we can monetize.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"a9a3\" name=\"a9a3\">Niels smiled. He could feel his bed and a good night\u2019s sleep within reach.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"51d7\" name=\"51d7\">He pushed \u201csend\u201d and immediately began composing a second email, this time to HR Paul. Gregor\u2019s insanity needed to be recorded somewhere\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if in the short-term Niels had no intention of compromising Anahata\u2019s public reputation and Niels\u2019 own financial stake in the company\u200a\u2014\u200aby outing its head engineer as a psychopath.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc35\" name=\"fc35\">Niels decided to attach a photo of himself in the basement. He raised his phone camera to get an angle that captured both the rows of wine bottles and the staircase leading up to a locked door. Then he hit \u201csend\u201d and took a swig of the Chateau Margaux\u200a\u2014\u200ait would make for great bragging rights at next month\u2019s HBS Successful Man Golf Tournament.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f167\" name=\"f167\">Niels opened the email application again, and his face fell. His email to Bobby hadn\u2019t gone through. In its place was a time-out message\u200a\u2014\u200athe data connection just wasn\u2019t strong enough. Niels tried to send again, and then again and again, from different parts of the basement. But each time he was met with the same result.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"be02\" name=\"be02\">The Master Negotiator was hit with a strong dose of reality\u200a\u2014\u200athere was no phone connection, only a very weak data connection, and he was trapped in an Austrian psychopath\u2019s basement.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"77d8\" name=\"77d8\">Niels scanned the room. Aside from the bottles of wine, it was absolutely empty. The staircase led to the locked door on the first floor, but otherwise there were no windows and no way out. He couldn\u2019t go to work. He couldn\u2019t make money.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e583\" name=\"e583\">He couldn\u2019t make money!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7993\" name=\"7993\">\u201cNo!!!\u201d he screamed, kicking over one of the chairs. He bounded up the stairs and began pounding on the door. \u201cLet me out! You can\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c84\" name=\"7c84\">Niels pounded for several minutes, but there was no answer from the other side.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"696a\" name=\"696a\">Niels crumbled on the top step and was at first shocked, then horrified, then just miserable to discover that the wet feeling on his face were tears, actual man tears. His body shook, and he began to feel cold. He wanted his mother, or the ex-girlfriend he had cheated on, or even just that hippie receptionist he had slept with.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf9a\" name=\"cf9a\">Or even God. Niels clasped his hands in prayer, unsure whether the gesture was necessary for the Almighty to hear him. Did God have to listen to him? Didn\u2019t God love rich people?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b333\" name=\"b333\">Just in case, Niels apologized extra hard for ignoring Him the previous four decades and promised that he would be good from now on. He wouldn\u2019t sleep with receptionists, he\u2019d mentor inner-city entrepreneurs, and he\u2019d teach the homeless how to code. He\u2019d get rid of moon colonies and pop-up internet ads, and he\u2019d fix piracy on the web once and for all. Above all, he\u2019d be a good citizen and son and follower of whatever religion God turned out to belong to.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"74f9\" name=\"74f9\">He looked down at the useless mobile phone in his hand. Tears had formed pathetic puddles across its surface, distorting his Flitter application, which now seemed to sprout wings from the \u201cf\u201d of its logo. Niels stared at it for a few seconds, watching the \u201cf\u201d heave under his tears, like a bird dreaming of flight.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cb37\" name=\"cb37\">And then it hit him. Flitter\u200a\u2014\u200aGalt\u2019s popular thought-sharing tool\u200a\u2014\u200awas famous for working in the lowest-bandwidth parts of the world. They were always bragging in the press about how someone had used their tool to escape an oppressive regime. It drove Bobby crazy\u200a\u2014\u200ahe thought Anahata should have a monopoly on freedom and hope.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d0ee\" name=\"d0ee\">Niels didn\u2019t care about any of that. In fact, he had zero interest in Galt or Flitter or in reading anyone\u2019s thoughts other than his own. But a year earlier, he had tried to convince Galt to run Anahata\u2019s ads on their apps and opened a Flitter account, Niels_1973, to show them he <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really</em> cared about their product. But eventually the deal fell through, and other than a few half-hearted fleets about some Anahata sports matches, Niels\u2019 account lay dormant for months. He had practically forgotten he even had it installed on his phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8edf\" name=\"8edf\">The likelihood Flitter would work in the cellar was low, but Niels had nothing to lose. He fired up Niels_1973 and, hands shaking, expressed his panic in fewer than one hundred thirty-five characters (the limit set on any Flitter message):</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"583a\" name=\"583a\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Help me! Trapped in basement at 13 Willow St, Atherton.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"b176\" name=\"b176\">Niels hit \u201csend,\u201d and in a split second, the post was successfully transmitted. Niels jumped up from the step, pumping his fist in the air. \u201cYes!\u201d he cheered. He sat back and waited.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eed4\" name=\"eed4\">And waited.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0b73\" name=\"0b73\">And waited.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f363\" name=\"f363\">Twenty minutes passed, and there was no response\u200a\u2014\u200ano \u201cwe\u2019re coming,\u201d or \u201chold tight, buddy!\u201d For a moment, Niels wondered whether his message had indeed been delivered\u200a\u2014\u200aor fleeted, as the Flitterati would say. But he could see there were millions of other live fleets coming in from the rest of the world\u200a\u2014\u200afleets about politicians, fleets about celebrities, fleets from companies hawking their products, and fleets from celebrities hawking those same products. Clearly someone was getting through to someone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45ac\" name=\"45ac\">The problem, Niels quickly realized, was that no one was listening to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">him</em>. He had only two people following his fleets: agefshgr_74 and tina_xxx. Niels didn\u2019t even know who they were or how they had found him in the first place.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fc87\" name=\"fc87\">\u201cFailure is not an option,\u201d Niels whispered to himself, repeating the Smeardon family motto. He took a gulp of Chateau Margaux and reminded himself that the important thing was that Flitter worked. The next step was simply to make it work better for him. He needed something more eye-catching\u200a\u2014\u200asomething that would get people so excited that they would want to refleet his message to all of their friends and followers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93f1\" name=\"93f1\">He quickly settled on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tech Geek</em>, the Valley\u2019s hottest tech gossip site. Including the @techgeek Flitter handle was his best bet to be seen by someone following their account.

Of all the Galt apps, Flitter definitely had the most crazies. There was something about giving people just one hundred thirty-five characters to express themselves that made them even more desperate\u200a\u2014\u200afueled by the hope that a bite-sized thought would be small enough to penetrate the world\u2019s scattered attention.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ac4\" name=\"1ac4\">It wasn\u2019t just weirdos like Niels who drove him crazy. It was the number of people who didn\u2019t properly understand Flittiquette. They exhibited a poor use of hashtags, a tendency to refleet every compliment or inane statement made by a follower, and an inability to craft something eye-popping in one hundred thirty-five characters.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"124a\" name=\"124a\">Social media was a twenty-first-century art, and a true <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">amateur</em> (\u201cin the French sense,\u201d he explained to anyone who would listen, \u201cmeaning a lover of social media\u201d) had to spend time honing his craft. He often reflected that his title should have been Master Craftsman of Social Media. Or simply God.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"742e\" name=\"742e\">Because as far as he could tell, there was no job with more prestige. Sure, he told his friends, he could take a high-paying social media job at a big corporation, but that wasn\u2019t his style. He didn\u2019t want to be the guy fleeting \u201cNot feeling fresh? Try the new <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">#</em>Summer_douche in fresh lavender.\u201d He had done his college senior thesis on Che Guevara\u2019s influence on scatological pop art. He could hardly sell out to the agro-chemico-industrial complex to be their social media plaything. He was part of an #online #revolution #disrupting #everything.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d0c\" name=\"2d0c\">That\u2019s why he was at <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tech Geek</em>, by all accounts the heart of the universe\u200a\u2014\u200aor, at least, his universe, and the universe of anyone who mattered to him. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tech Geek</em> was where all things tech and Valley were beating, throbbing, iterating, de-duping, compiling, normalizing, and randomizing. As far as he saw it, if you did social media for the Valley, you were, in many ways, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the</em> Valley. In fact, he liked to think of himself as a modern-day William Randolph Hearst. The decisions he made\u200a\u2014\u200awhether to refleet someone\u2019s comment, post a piece of news or gossip about another company, or (shock!) ignore it altogether\u200a\u2014\u200athese were the things that made and broke powerful men and their companies.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e3b\" name=\"3e3b\">So it annoyed him when fools like Niels_1973 would fleet things that were clearly false, just in the hope of grabbing his attention. It was irresponsible and a waste of his time. Niels_1973 was probably the same guy who had tried to send a \u201ctip\u201d to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tech Geek</em> a few months earlier that Anahata had discovered Atlantis and was refurbishing it so that Bobby Bonilo could have an underwater pleasure kingdom. Or the guy who had fleeted that Anahata was suggesting its lowest-performing employees take performance-enhancing drugs. Granted, the latter proved to be true, but the source had missed a crucial detail. Anahata was randomizing who would get the drugs so they could analyze the effectiveness of the trial\u200a\u2014\u200aa piece of research that would be helpful for the entire scientific community. #Detailsmatter</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"ae6c\" name=\"ae6c\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Niels_1973: @techgeek Love your hard-hitting tech analysis.

He spent several minutes contemplating the various punishments he could mete out, finally deciding to block Niels_1973 from his list altogether. It was an extreme punishment, but he couldn\u2019t condone such outrageous, attention-seeking behavior.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d95c\" name=\"d95c\">Then, feeling like he had done yet another great service for the world, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tech Geek</em>\u2019s social media manager called it a night and made his way to bed.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"8f2f\" name=\"8f2f\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"d6ce\" name=\"d6ce\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">It</span> took total isolation from the outside world for Niels to discover what millions of Galt fans around the world already knew: There was no longer any point in real conversation when you could just communicate in short phrases and poop emojis.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad91\" name=\"ad91\">As night gave way to morning, Niels found himself deeply focused on a handful of celebrities and their preferred hair products and was closely following the reports of a burgeoning relationship between two contestants on a popular reality TV show. His concern for smooth hair and the couple\u2019s happiness grew stronger as he finished off the bottle of Chateau Margaux, then opened a 1787 bottle of Chateau Lafite.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22fc\" name=\"22fc\">Niels\u2019 innumerable fleets about captivity, despair, and Anahata had gone unanswered despite variations in text, creative spelling, and attempts at haiku. Despite hours of nonstop fleeting, there were still no refleets by his two followers, and still no acknowledgment from <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tech Geek</em>. Nor had he gained any new followers who could potentially spread the word on his behalf.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"277a\" name=\"277a\">Ever the mountaineer, Niels devised a new plan, with a new mountain range that showcased the complexity (but also the conquerability!) of his current situation. This was one of his favorite mountain-range models to use at work. It had switchbacks and a very large boulder. The point, he often told his team, was to not get distracted by the boulder and to stay focused on the switchbacks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c740\" name=\"c740\">Flitter users were switchbacks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c57e\" name=\"c57e\">No, they were boulders.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bc5a\" name=\"bc5a\">Well, whatever they were, they weren\u2019t the point. The point was, he had been foolish to think that people on Flitter would care about <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">him</em>, Niels Smeardon. What they cared about was the content he himself had been sucked into\u200a\u2014\u200athe celebrities, the gossip, the lifestyle guru tips. The trick was to make these idiots care about him through his connection to the people they worshipped. They were like lichen growing on top of the boulder. Or maybe the sign at the bottom of the mountain marking the trail. Or\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4166\" name=\"4166\">\u201cI don\u2019t need mountains,\u201d Niels growled. \u201cMountains need ME.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"267d\" name=\"267d\">He crumpled the paper and tossed it to the ground, then immediately started fleeting again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0b39\" name=\"0b39\">His first pass was a flop, despite referencing the biggest pop star on the planet\u200a\u2014\u200athe sexy blonde singer named La Lala who was known for hitting high notes while writhing on the floor with pythons.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"5dfa\" name=\"5dfa\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">#OMG</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">LaLala making new video with </em>#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Liberace! A duet with a legend!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"2c00\" name=\"2c00\">The only reaction came from Tina_xxx, who removed herself from his list of two followers. No one else responded to his fleet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b5ff\" name=\"b5ff\">Niels sipped some wine and took a few minutes to study the most popular tweets about La Lala. Then he tried again.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"c0a1\" name=\"c0a1\">#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">LaLala sings at </em>#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Nashville high school, discourages </em>#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">bullies.

Such an </em>#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">inspiration!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"f5d8\" name=\"f5d8\">Niels doubted La Lala had ever been to Nashville. But no matter, within minutes, he had been refleeted. There was even a string of responses, most of them from Lala fans in Nashville asking where she had sung. Niels responded:</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"2da9\" name=\"2da9\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">My friend said </em>#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">EmersonHigh. She wore band aids instead of clothes!!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"17eb\" name=\"17eb\">Within a few seconds, he had two new people following his account. He stretched his fingers and typed his next set of messages.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"00b6\" name=\"00b6\">#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">LaLala wears no makeup to remind us that talent is more important than beauty.</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"067d\" name=\"067d\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">#LaLala pythons remind us that in every snake is a beating heart.</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"2f09\" name=\"2f09\">#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">LaLala spotted at </em>#<em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">LAX, straddling a plane. Anyone have pictures?</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"60bd\" name=\"60bd\">The popularity of Niels_1973 began to climb. The more inane his posts, the more misspellings and melodrama (driven more by inebriation than calculation), the more followers he gained. Niels felt his blood begin to pump again. He gave one of his <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">help me!</em> posts a go, just to see if someone would respond. But despite having amassed four thousand followers in thirty minutes, all hanging on every word he had to say about La Lala, there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone interested in helping the man behind the fleets.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6861\" name=\"6861\">Niels scratched his head, then returned to his notepad. He drew a SWOT analysis listing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of his pop star. When he hit the \u201cweaknesses\u201d box, he realized his error: La Lala skewed toward a much younger audience. Was it really plausible that a pimply fourteen-year-old fan would come to his rescue?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c805\" name=\"c805\">Niels groaned. His demographic targeting had been all wrong. La Lala fans were too young. He needed serious people. People who had driver\u2019s licenses. People who thought a bit more about the consequences of social media. People like\u2026thirty-year-olds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"65c4\" name=\"65c4\">Niels flipped back to the Flitter homepage to study the most popular age-appropriate topics. What were people fleeting about on a random Monday morning? Scrolling through the list, Niels saw that most of the topics were things he knew nothing about. In addition to the perennial pop music favorites, the list included things like #bitchslap, #whatimknitting, and #blessedmoments. Niels kept scanning, moving farther and farther down the list. And then he saw it: #Poodlekek.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8275\" name=\"8275\">\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"74b3\" name=\"74b3\">Niels knew all about Poodlekek. It was his friend\u2019s heavy metal band in college. He was surprised they were still together after two decades, let alone had become so popular. He remembered going to their shows at the campus coffee house, cigarette lighter waving in the air as he and his then-girlfriend sang to guitar-heavy ballads about twisted love, rocky family relationships, and starving children in Ethiopia. Their fans would likely be Niels\u2019 age, the kind of people who would take seriously his cries for help. And Niels had plenty of interesting things he could fleet about them to get people\u2019s attention\u200a\u2014\u200alike the lead singer\u2019s bad case of the Herp. Women would totally refleet that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f444\" name=\"f444\">But first things first. He needed to build a new fan base.

He had made several passes at courtship since arriving in the United States, but most women were too intimidated by his overwhelming virility.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a0f9\" name=\"a0f9\">But Jennie, the Anahata receptionist, struck Arsyen as the confident type. She shook his hand without averting her gaze and even scolded him during their campus tour when he complimented Galt. He liked a sassy lady with good teeth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ef0f\" name=\"ef0f\">He had the day all planned out. After lunchtime, he\u2019d surprise Jennie in the reception area and give her his Aimo Air Freshener.

It would be the perfect first date.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc05\" name=\"fc05\">The only potential hiccup was keeping his words straight. He wondered whether Sven would practice his English with him that morning.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd67\" name=\"bd67\">But Arsyen had no such chance. Sven greeted him as he entered their cubicle, waving a hand bloodied by jelly doughnut.

He did not have an answer prepared for this.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3a0e\" name=\"3a0e\">But Jennie seemed to have no difficulty continuing the conversation by herself, telling Arsyen something about her feminist book club. Little of what she said registered with him. He was watching her lips move, fascinated by the way they came together and then parted as she spoke just to him. They were so different from Natia\u2019s lips, which moved together in fits and jerks, all depending on the bandwidth of her internet connection.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"900b\" name=\"900b\">Sven cleared his throat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1e2b\" name=\"1e2b\">\u201cJane here was just about to tell us what she\u2019s doing here.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"141d\" name=\"141d\">\u201cIt\u2019s Jennie,\u201d she said, turning to Sven. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here because I\u2019m the new nontechnical technical lead.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2907\" name=\"2907\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0f9f\" name=\"0f9f\">\u201cI\u2019m your new manager,\u201d Jennie said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9476\" name=\"9476\">It was as if Vesuvius had exploded across the well-manicured lawns of Palo Alto.

I know how to lead people.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c09a\" name=\"c09a\">Sven shook his head and slumped back to his chair. Jonas pouted. Jennie\u2019s face relaxed, as if their disappointment was the first step toward acceptance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d07f\" name=\"d07f\">\u201cNow, who\u2019s going to tell me about Social Car?\u201d she asked. \u201cAll Gregor said was that it was using the driverless cars to help you meet people. Sounds like something someone without friends would come up with.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0221\" name=\"0221\">\u201cSounds like something someone who can\u2019t see the future would say,\u201d sneered Sven, grabbing another doughnut and slowly ripping it down the middle, letting the red jelly drip directly on to the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b3cd\" name=\"b3cd\">\u201cGreat, it seems like you\u2019re the perfect person to explain the project to me,\u201d Jennie said. She grabbed a spare chair from a neighboring cubicle and seated herself next to Sven. Arsyen noted their arms were almost touching.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c55\" name=\"0c55\">For the next hour, Sven walked Jennie through Social Car\u200a\u2014\u200afrom its initial history as a simple driverless car to its current state as a meeting platform. At first, Jennie scribbled madly across her notebook as he spoke, taking note of every word, code name, and milestone along the way. But as Sven progressed, her notes became fewer, punctuated by question marks, dashes, circles, and asterisks\u200a\u2014\u200aan entire discourse happening on her page, separate to the story Sven was narrating.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2b58\" name=\"2b58\">\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Jennie finally said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"880f\" name=\"880f\">Sven snorted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6984\" name=\"6984\">\u201cWhy would people want to use this?\u201d she asked. \u201cI drive to get places. When I want to meet people, I go someplace where I can meet them.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"005e\" name=\"005e\">\u201cBut Social Car helps you meet people before you get to that place, or it can tell you where to go to meet those people. It is significantly more efficient,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a4d\" name=\"7a4d\">Arsyen kept quiet. He had never really understood the purpose of Social Car. That said, he didn\u2019t want Jennie to have a negative impression of it\u200a\u2014\u200ashe wouldn\u2019t want to date the product manager of a stupid product.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c750\" name=\"c750\">\u201cWhy not just design a car that makes me a smoothie?\u201d Jennie asked. \u201cOr a car that washes my hair and does my nails? Those are more useful than what you\u2019ve come up with.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"67ed\" name=\"67ed\">Arsyen saw Jonas and Sven exchange glances, as if to consider the validity of her idea.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"21ec\" name=\"21ec\">\u201cBecause not everyone wants a carrot juice or a perm,\u201d said Sven finally. \u201cOn the other hand, everyone wants to meet someone. The use case is bigger.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0f31\" name=\"0f31\">\u201cThere <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">isn\u2019t </em>a use case. You\u2019re solving a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. And what about traffic jams and accidents? What are you going to do when everyone\u2019s trying to meet everyone else, and all of a sudden everyone\u2019s headed in the same direction, turning about and crashing into each other?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"476a\" name=\"476a\">Sven looked at Jonas.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1028\" name=\"1028\">\u201cWomen are <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> going to use this,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cEven if there are one or two who do, they\u2019re going to be inundated with messages from men. They\u2019ll be overwhelmed, and they\u2019ll just turn the feature off.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a487\" name=\"a487\">\u201cOh, we already thought of that,\u201d Sven said. \u201cWe\u2019ve opted everyone in to the service as a default and made it difficult to find the privacy settings. So we project that only two percent of users will actually manage to opt out of the service, and only a fraction of those will be women since they rarely know how to find and change their settings. So women will have to use it, and we\u2019ll have gender equilibrium. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05ee\" name=\"05ee\">Jennie shook her head. \u201cThis is creepy. Someone can see my profile and decide to keep pace with my car. Do you not see a problem with this?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4936\" name=\"4936\">\u201cThat\u2019s just so that when you are ready to stop and park somewhere, the other driver will have kept up with you and can stop and park, too,\u201d said Sven slowly, even slower than when he explained things to Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f958\" name=\"f958\">\u201cYou mean it\u2019s going to help offline stalking,\u201d Jennie said, crossing her arms.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08b8\" name=\"08b8\">Jonas turned to Sven. \u201cShe does have a good point.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6256\" name=\"6256\">\u201cI was just thinking the same thing,\u201d said Sven, approaching the whiteboard.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e9cf\" name=\"e9cf\">Jennie\u2019s face brightened, and Arsyen brightened with her. Maybe he could suggest they take a drive in Social Car together?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"464b\" name=\"464b\">\u201cI think we can fix your problem,\u201d said Sven, grabbing a pen and starting to scribble on the board. He turned toward Jonas.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f297\" name=\"f297\">\u201cWhat if we got a queuing theory expert to help?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5cda\" name=\"5cda\">\u201cI bet the original driverless car team had one,\u201d Jonas nodded. \u201cThey must have looked at the traffic jam issue when they were first scoping out the project and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9001\" name=\"9001\">\u201cTraffic jams?!?\u201d Jennie screeched. \u201cOf all the things I said, that\u2019s what strikes you as the biggest problem? You completely missed my point! There is no way that I\u2019m allowing your Stalker Car to happen.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"008a\" name=\"008a\">The room went silent. Now was his time to strike. Arsyen rose from his chair and opened his palm to reveal the pink, heart-shaped bottle of Aimo Air Freshener.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"729d\" name=\"729d\">\u201cFor you, Jennie, so I can always find you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7ea3\" name=\"7ea3\">Jennie shook her head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9022\" name=\"9022\">\u201cWe\u2019re killing this project,\u201d she said. \u201cAs your lead, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I </em>am killing this project.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4cd6\" name=\"4cd6\">Jennie stomped out of the cubicle, brushing past Arsyen and knocking the bottle out of his hand. Arsyen gasped as his sweetly scented vision of eternal love shattered into a thousand shards of pink glass. The liquid sizzled like acid on the ground, devouring an orphaned Cheerio near Sven\u2019s desk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5af\" name=\"f5af\">Sven hit the desk with his fist. \u201cDammit! Do you all get what just happened?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"95bc\" name=\"95bc\">He pushed his chair out of the way and stomped out of the cubicle, a shard of Arsyen\u2019s pink glass heart lodging itself in the bottom of his flip-flop.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"6a76\" name=\"6a76\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"5961\" name=\"5961\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">F</span>or Anahata\u2019s great technical minds, boredom was far worse than anger. It hovered above their cubicle like a dirty cloud, obscuring all possibilities beyond what was proximate. After Jennie stomped out, Jonas pouted while trolling message boards; Sven focused on improving his speed at the Rubik\u2019s cube. With each second gained, he let out a new sigh, as if these small victories were simply a reminder of a greater defeat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a547\" name=\"a547\">Things were much worse for Arsyen. Sven had told him it was just a matter of time before they were all reassigned to other teams. That new team would quickly figure out Arsyen was a fake, and even if they let him stay at Anahata, he\u2019d surely be demoted to a lower-paying janitorial role. His contributions to the Throne Reclamation Committee would drop, there would be no Pyrrhian liberation for decades, and Arsyen wouldn\u2019t enjoy the palm fronds and promiscuous handmaidens he deserved until he was old and wrinkled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ccef\" name=\"ccef\">No kingdom. No girlfriend. He\u2019d be back to cleaning toilets.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"164d\" name=\"164d\">All of this was Jennie\u2019s fault. As his father had always said, women are harmless until, suddenly, they\u2019re not.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3f8f\" name=\"3f8f\">Arsyen gazed at Natia\u2019s photo on his computer, apologizing to the bearer of its image for having lost his way. He caressed her pixelated cheek and yelped\u200a\u2014\u200ahis internet girlfriend had just shocked him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a94a\" name=\"a94a\">With nothing else to do with his time, Arsyen decided to check in on his GaltPage. He saw that his previous night\u2019s post encouraging people to take action had prompted a response from more than twelve thousand people.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"977f\" name=\"977f\">For a moment, Arsyen remembered the sweet taste of obedience.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5aa\" name=\"c5aa\">He scanned the news. Images of Poodlekek captured jagged windows of abandoned storefronts and old women crying, shaking their fists. Youths in bandannas and sweatshirts huddled in front of international TV cameras, shouting slogans as the newscaster voiceover explained there had been a ten-thousand-person march in which protesters had clashed with police. Ninety people were reported dead\u200a\u2014\u200aa number that didn\u2019t include the hundreds who had died in the train wreck.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"23a3\" name=\"23a3\">His mobile phone rang, and Arsyen ducked out of the cubicle to take the call.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9b96\" name=\"9b96\">\u201cThe TRC is ready to strike,\u201d the Throne Reclamation Committee\u2019s chief strategist announced.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4b65\" name=\"4b65\">\u201cBut we\u2019re nowhere near ready,\u201d Arsyen said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"12f6\" name=\"12f6\">\u201cThe TRC has spoken!\u201d said the strategist, and then abruptly hung up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd1b\" name=\"bd1b\">Five minutes later came another call, this time from an unfamiliar voice whose words were punctuated by a hacking cough.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9556\" name=\"9556\">\u201cKorpeko has outlawed our beloved (cough) national (cough) sport. A curling court now cuts through the Arsyen Aimo (cough) Croquet Academy!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"007e\" name=\"007e\">Arsyen rose to his feet. How dare Korpeko destroy his gleaming croquet court! Arsyen had spent hours deciding on the color scheme. He had made numerous visits to the site to ensure that the proposed spot for his statue was positioned so the sun rose from his left hand and set in the right. And now\u200a\u2014\u200adestroyed!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bb40\" name=\"bb40\">Arsyen wondered how many of his supporters were out there, working with the Throne Reclamation Committee to plot his return. \u201cThousands,\u201d the chief strategist had once said. \u201cMillions,\u201d he sometimes claimed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45ce\" name=\"45ce\">He returned to his cubicle and gazed once again at Natia\u2019s photo. She looked very serious, with her hair pulled back and not even a trace of a smile. But she was pretty, and he liked that mole on her right cheek. It made it easy to tell the difference between one side of her face and the other. Where was she? There was no sign of her\u200a\u2014\u200anot on his GaltPage, in the newspapers, or on email. Was she in trouble?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8776\" name=\"8776\">Arsyen\u2019s phone rang again. This time his ears filled with the sound of the old national anthem\u200a\u2014\u200athe song that had once played each time Arsyen\u2019s father addressed the nation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf17\" name=\"bf17\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Nationhood, brotherhood, progress upon progress\u2026</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f587\" name=\"f587\">\u201cIt is time,\u201d said a man\u2019s emphysematic voice, as the music faded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9e4a\" name=\"9e4a\">\u201cBut we don\u2019t have enough money,\u201d Arsyen protested.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d96d\" name=\"d96d\">\u201cRevolutions don\u2019t need money. Without money, people are more motivated, more bloodthirsty.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a238\" name=\"a238\">Arsyen\u2019s father had often said the same thing. He inhaled sharply.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"41aa\" name=\"41aa\">\u201cI need some time to think.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a27b\" name=\"a27b\">Arsyen scanned Flitter, the Galt app that had been appropriated by the protesters. There was no sign of Natia, but one fleet did catch his attention. In just thirty minutes it had been refleeted three thousand times, as if a rallying cry for the revolt.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"2781\" name=\"2781\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Niels_1973: Raise your lighters for #Poodlekek</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"4b25\" name=\"4b25\">Arsyen read the fleet twice, its simple, thirty-four-character plea underscoring the desperation of his country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"63ee\" name=\"63ee\">This was all moving too fast. If only everything were ready\u200a\u2014\u200athe forty cows, the special bomb, and the ten thousand horses. The latest TRC report had shown the acquisition of only ten cows and two mangy goats. How could that possibly be enough?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b452\" name=\"b452\">Arsyen left his cubicle and found an empty micro-kitchen. He rang the chief strategist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"914e\" name=\"914e\">\u201cCan we do it without the horses and the bomb? Like, in some sort of peaceful way, with just the cows?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6cf7\" name=\"6cf7\">\u201cSince when were you against violence?\u201d the chief strategist asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember the king\u2019s annual dissident hunt? You rode one of the bears!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ad5d\" name=\"ad5d\">\u201cMmm,\u201d said Arsyen, remembering those winter days of crisp air and hearty stews. \u201cBut those were peasants. They don\u2019t count. And anyway, Korpeko\u2019s no fool. If the peasants are revolting, he will put them down quickly and quietly.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d841\" name=\"d841\">\u201cThat\u2019s where you are mistaken, Your Highness. It is not the peasants who are protesting. The peasants are too busy with work to have time for revolt. It is the students, the middle class, who are up in arms. That is much trickier for the government.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"334e\" name=\"334e\">\u201cI need to think,\u201d Arsyen repeated. He hung up and frowned, then returned to his cubicle. He scanned the new Flitter messages on his computer.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"c7e9\" name=\"c7e9\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Korpeko must be stopped!</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"9d39\" name=\"9d39\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Down with tyranny!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"17b5\" name=\"17b5\">The subtext was clear. \u201cCome back, Prince Arsyen! Lead us to our destiny!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"484e\" name=\"484e\">Many of the messages linked to Arsyen\u2019s GaltPage. Surely it was not mere coincidence that he, Prince Arsyen, had become their conduit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b9f\" name=\"7b9f\">Arsyen turned again to Flitter, typing to his people in their native tongue.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"813c\" name=\"813c\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have the royal family in power? #Poodlekek</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"5f18\" name=\"5f18\">A response came quickly.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"3f80\" name=\"3f80\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Sure, if you want to die by starvation rather than in a train crash.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"d86d\" name=\"d86d\">And then another:</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"4ca6\" name=\"4ca6\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Anything\u2019s better than Korpeko.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"1dab\" name=\"1dab\">Arsyen\u2019s heart beat faster. It was just as the Throne Reclamation Committee had said. His people <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">were</em> calling for him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b3d\" name=\"2b3d\">He looked for another response. Instead, there was that same message again from Niels_1973. People kept refleeting it.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"5467\" name=\"5467\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Raise your lighters for #Poodlekek</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"28b2\" name=\"28b2\">Arsyen studied the message closely. Unlike the other <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">#Poodlekek</em> messages, this one was written in English. It was a clever move\u200a\u2014\u200aan English fleet would reach an international community. This person was a strategist, someone central to the movement\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone like Natia, trying to bring their domestic turmoil to international attention and put pressure on the Pyrrhian government. If there was any sort of core revolutionary committee, Niels_1973 was a part of it. He probably had additional ideas or information. Perhaps he even knew Natia.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"51e3\" name=\"51e3\">Arsyen clicked on the sender\u2019s handle and read some of his other fleets. From what he saw, Niels_1973 had written a lot about a famous pop singer before he had started fleeting about Poodlekek. From misspelled, teenybopper musings, Niels_1973\u2019s fleets had moved to angry, passionate words about lighters and bodies and destroyed hopes.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"41c7\" name=\"41c7\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Burn it all down! #Poodlekek</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"ec95\" name=\"ec95\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Justice for All #Poodlekek</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"18b4\" name=\"18b4\">Arsyen imagined Niels was a college student, a man who hours earlier had been listening to La Lala, carefree and young, before suddenly seeing bodies burn around him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"68b3\" name=\"68b3\">He might have the key to Natia\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"296b\" name=\"296b\">Across town in Atherton, the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">ping!</em> of a new Flitter message rang sweetly in Niels\u2019 ears.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3971\" name=\"3971\">\u201cYes!\u201d he said aloud, pumping his fist in the air and draining his second bottle of wine. It was his first response since he had begun targeting Poodlekek fans.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f454\" name=\"f454\">But whether he was drunk or simply confused, the message from PrinceArsyen didn\u2019t make much sense:</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"7dc5\" name=\"7dc5\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Is it that bad? Can I help?</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"ea86\" name=\"ea86\">Was PrinceArsyen quoting a Poodlekek song? It certainly wasn\u2019t from any Poodlekek song he could remember. Niels hated it when he was outsnobbed by other music fans.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cdc9\" name=\"cdc9\">Then again, even as a lyric, the fleet didn\u2019t really make sense. Poodlekek songs were never about charity or helping people. It was one of the reasons Niels had liked them so much\u200a\u2014\u200aheavy metal had been an early conduit for his misanthropy. He had even found the name of the band fitting\u200a\u2014\u200aall about the prissiest of dogs, a poodle, getting kicked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a02\" name=\"4a02\">Niels pictured a startled poodle flying through the air above him, landing with a crash among Gregor\u2019s shelf of Chateau Latour.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7bc0\" name=\"7bc0\">He laughed at the image, but then paused.

Poodlekek was the capital of one of those countries no one cared about; one of the places that was always poor, and always in revolt, whose leaders were always doing crazy things like naming the days of the week after their dead pets. The hundreds of #Poodlekek fleets about violence now made sense to him. There must be some sort of revolt in the region. That was just what those countries did when they had free time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2146\" name=\"2146\">\u201cArrrrrrrrrgh!\u201d Niels kicked the step of the cellar stairs. How could he screw up his Flitter strategy yet again? How many more times would he have to start over?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e1a9\" name=\"e1a9\">And then he stopped. An invisible hook passed over Niels\u2019 face, first drawing the eyebrows upward, then the corners of the mouth, freezing in a smile.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"522d\" name=\"522d\">He turned back to his phone. There was a new message.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"8ac5\" name=\"8ac5\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">@PrinceArsyen: What it like there? People ok?</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"5b35\" name=\"5b35\">Niels responded immediately:</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"04ae\" name=\"04ae\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">@Niels_1973: Shootin\u2019, lootin\u2019, and general pollutin\u2019!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"8ea8\" name=\"8ea8\">It was the chorus of his favorite Poodlekek song: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Shootin\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aboom boom\u200a\u2014\u200alootin\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aboom boom\u200a\u2014\u200agen-er-al pollutin\u2019!</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6a82\" name=\"6a82\">Niels hummed the song, feeling the wine dance along with him in his head. No one cared about old Niels, but it seemed like a whole lot of Flitterati cared about a bunch of poor people in Poodlekek. He\u2019d make the most of it.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"e78c\" name=\"e78c\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">@PrinceArsyen: Anyone hurt?</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"c6a3\" name=\"c6a3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">@Niels_1973: Can\u2019t you hear the distant cry, of the children, the women!</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"f3f8\" name=\"f3f8\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">@PrinceArsyen: Horrible!</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"3c73\" name=\"3c73\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">@Niels_1973: No food, no water, we\u2019re in for a hell of a slaughter!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"4596\" name=\"4596\">Arsyen gasped as he read Niels_1973\u2019s messages.

There was no one but him who could save Poodlekek.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45cb\" name=\"45cb\">Arsyen spun in his chair to face the whiteboard, trying to dream up cheap and quick modifications to his forty-cow, one-bomb, ten-thousand-horse plan.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5c81\" name=\"5c81\">\u201cSven,\u201d he said, tapping his co-worker on the shoulder. \u201cIf you want to do something but don\u2019t have money, is it problem?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"907e\" name=\"907e\">Sven looked up from his Rubik\u2019s cube. \u201cIf you build something people want, the monetization will figure itself out.

If Bobby Bonilo could run his company without thinking about money, then Arsyen could certainly take back his small country without it.

Niels had been stuck down there since the previous evening\u200a\u2014\u200ahow much longer could he last? A few days? Gregor still needed several weeks before Project Y would be ready.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a386\" name=\"a386\">Then there was the issue of sustenance. Gregor had to go to work and would be able to feed Niels only twice a day. That was probably sufficient\u200a\u2014\u200athough Niels\u2019 body might not easily digest the legume balls Gregor ate in lieu of breakfast and dinner. Even then, he had no slit or dumbwaiter he could use to pass food or water to the cellar. And if he opened the door to deliver it himself, Niels might pounce from the top step. Even if Gregor could overpower him (which was no guarantee), he\u2019d have that same problem each time\u200a\u2014\u200aunless he didn\u2019t feed Niels, and Niels became weak and then\u2026but no, that was too cruel. And in any case, at the moment Niels had all of his strength and wits about him\u200a\u2014\u200awhat might he do to Gregor\u2019s wine collection? Was it bad to starve him just a bit? Gregor could feel his head spinning. He had stayed up all night and hadn\u2019t gone into work that morning\u200a\u2014\u200athe first time in ten years. But it was already almost noon, and still he had no plan.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"18c6\" name=\"18c6\">As much as Gregor hated it, there was only one thing left to do. He rang Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"14a6\" name=\"14a6\">Someone picked up immediately, but there was a loud racket on Bobby\u2019s side, and Gregor couldn\u2019t hear the voice on the other line.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"87a8\" name=\"87a8\">\u201cBobby?

Bobby was confusing him with Fischer, Anahata\u2019s CFCAO known as much for his fiscal wizardry as his trysts with the company\u2019s paralegals. Gregor hadn\u2019t had a woman in his home since his grandmother died. Bobby knew that. How could he confuse him with someone like Fischer?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"49f7\" name=\"49f7\">\u201cNothing like that,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the Project Y roadblock.

He had been stuck in Gregor\u2019s basement for eighteen hours. His sales team at Anahata was well into the workday, marching forward to monetize unconquered corners of the internet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a989\" name=\"a989\">Niels kept glancing at the top of the stairs, straining his ears for the sound of a car coming down Gregor\u2019s driveway. But there was no sign of PrinceArsyen. He had sent him the Tuscany Drive address and tried messaging him several times, but it all had gone unanswered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7533\" name=\"7533\">Niels stifled a yawn. He was too angry to sleep. He kicked the broken chair, then the good chair, and finally the table, leaving the center of the cellar looking like the remnants of a bar fight. Niels scanned the room for something else to kick, but there was nothing left beyond wine bottles. Those weren\u2019t an option\u200a\u2014\u200ahe didn\u2019t want to stain his Prada shoes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"63dd\" name=\"63dd\">He sat down against the wall opposite the stairs. Once he made it out of Gregor\u2019s dungeon, he would make sure that ads were on every single Anahata product\u200a\u2014\u200ablinking, singing, dancing, screaming at consumers to try, buy, dabble, and dip into any and everything that a human being could be offered. And then he would have Gregor Guntlag fired and thrown in jail.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a456\" name=\"a456\">Just then, Niels heard a crunching of footsteps outside the door at the top of the stairs. He drew in his breath, straining to hear what was happening on the other side. He hoped it was PrinceArsyen coming to rescue him, but even if it was just Gregor, that would still be progress.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f11\" name=\"8f11\">Niels considered his options. He didn\u2019t want to do anything that would set Gregor off. Admitting defeat was fine if it would get him out of that cellar. He sat up straight in preparation for his visitor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a2d\" name=\"5a2d\">The door opened a crack, and a sliver of white light peeked through, a light so bright that Niels suddenly realized just how dark it had been. But even with the light pouring in from above, there was little Niels could see above the shadows now cast across the entrance. \u201cHello?\u201d he called out. \u201cGregor?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6067\" name=\"6067\">There was no answer, but Niels could now make out the form of two pairs of legs, shifting, conferring with each other, at the top of the stairs. The silence worried him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b630\" name=\"b630\">\u201cI think I\u2019ve been down here long enough.

He could make out the outline of two enormous frames, a pair of linebackers blocking the stairs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"02f8\" name=\"02f8\">\u201cNo sudden moves, Niels,\u201d said an unfamiliar voice. \u201cThere are more of us than there are of you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6344\" name=\"6344\">It was them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"af94\" name=\"af94\">Niels took a step back, running into the wall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4b41\" name=\"4b41\">\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you say,\u201d he said, his voice collapsing at the end of his sentence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8a37\" name=\"8a37\">He had never thought it would end like this, at the hands of the Progressa unit. These were the men who ostensibly brought Anahata technology to the poor but who lived in the shadows, nameless, faceless, conveniently turning up in various spots around the world just before popular upheavals, banking reforms, or natural disasters. They were also known to clean up any of Bobby\u2019s \u201cmesses.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e44d\" name=\"e44d\">Now Niels was one of those messes. The stupidity of his earlier nonchalance leaped upon him. His eyes darted about the basement, looking for a means of defense or a place to hide. He could grab a wine bottle, but Niels realized there were too many legs at the top of the stairs, too many Progressa men for him to take on his own.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9c48\" name=\"9c48\">The heavy shoes began their descent down the staircase, their large bodies blocking most of the light from the top. Quickly, Niels refleeted an earlier message, hoping one of his six thousand Flitter followers would finally take him seriously.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"20fa\" name=\"20fa\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">#Anahata building moon colony.

Laid before him were a stone, a strip of bark, a leaf, and a mobile phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f10\" name=\"2f10\">Although Gregor didn\u2019t understand the significance of the props, he immediately recognized the ritual. It was the same performance Bobby had enacted a decade earlier, just a few days before Anahata became a publicly traded company. Summoned at midnight to a small Palo Alto park, the Anahata board of directors had watched Bobby\u2019s cryptic movements in horror, worrying in hissed whispers that he would repeat his routine at the sound of the market\u2019s opening bell. Then, as now, Gregor absorbed it as one might a nature program. He believed that watching Bobby (and watching Bobby watch others as they watched him) was the only path toward understanding the Anahata founder and his genius.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80e6\" name=\"80e6\">Because for all of his billions, comprehension was the one thing Bobby Bonilo couldn\u2019t buy and would probably never have.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e1a1\" name=\"e1a1\">But that\u2019s why he had Gregor, whose job it was to help translate Bobby\u2019s vision to reality. If Bobby was a genius and his ideas transformed the world, then Gregor\u2019s work was vital to human progress. If Bobby was a sociopath and his dreams lacked innovation, then it meant Gregor was a fool and his own work meaningless.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b157\" name=\"b157\">Bobby was now rubbing the strip of bark against his cheek. Gregor glanced at his watch\u200a\u2014\u200amore out of curiosity than impatience\u200a\u2014\u200aand realized he had been standing on the porch for ten minutes. He zipped up his windbreaker\u200a\u2014\u200athe ocean lay just beyond the fir trees, and the air was crisp.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6a4\" name=\"b6a4\">Gregor let a few more minutes pass, as he knew he should, then threw a rock against a nearby trunk, producing a loud <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">thud</em> sufficient to break Bobby\u2019s trance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6716\" name=\"6716\">Bobby removed his blindfold, bowed to the grove\u2019s fir trees, then threw his hands into the air, waving his fingers as though playing a piano in the sky. He breathed deeply, taking in the forest air, then lowered his arms and slowly walked back toward his cabin.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9c68\" name=\"9c68\">\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about big data,\u201d he said to Gregor as he sat down on the bench.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"22ec\" name=\"22ec\">\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e379\" name=\"e379\">\u201cThat it could be bigger. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Much,</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">much</em> bigger,\u201d he said, his hands drawing an imaginary load of great weight.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c408\" name=\"c408\">Gregor looked at Bobby\u2019s hands. How could big data be bigger? How could there be a limit on the limitless?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6f80\" name=\"6f80\">\u201cAnd one other thing\u200a\u2014\u200aoptical time travel. People get too caught up in transporting the physical body. And then they worry about whether <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you</em> are <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">you</em> once your body has been reconstituted. If we just transport your eyes, you can see everything, but it\u2019s like, just your eyes. All the benefits, none of the existential dilemma.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a3fd\" name=\"a3fd\">\u201cBut if the eyes are on the body\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201c</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"052d\" name=\"052d\">\u201cNot now, Gregor. Only big thoughts here. Big thoughts.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b8bc\" name=\"b8bc\">Bobby gestured at the forest before them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7a1d\" name=\"7a1d\">\u201cYou know, I think differently when I\u2019m out here.

He would\u2019ve preferred to talk about big data and optical time travel, but there was a much more pressing matter at hand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"602b\" name=\"602b\">\u201cWhat will they do to Niels?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d59e\" name=\"d59e\">\u201cAh, Gregor. When you know as much as I do, you also know that knowledge is not always a gift. I will not burden you with knowledge. But rest assured that Progressa will not hurt him. I was clear about that. I also asked that they teach him Spanish.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9b7c\" name=\"9b7c\">\u201cSpanish?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"55ec\" name=\"55ec\">\u201cIn case we ever want to bring him back. We really need a more diverse workforce.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3fd9\" name=\"3fd9\">Bobby was always one step ahead.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3ad4\" name=\"3ad4\">\u201cNow that I\u2019ve solutionized that little problem,\u201d Bobby said, \u201ctell me where we are with Project Y.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3fe0\" name=\"3fe0\">\u201cWith Niels gone, I expect things will be back in shape on the technical side with Project Y within a day or two. The field, the servers\u200a\u2014\u200awe can now move forward without any obstacles. Though there is one other problem. A human problem.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd2c\" name=\"fd2c\">Bobby\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cIs something wrong with our child prodigies\u2026or the distractions? Is there something wrong with Genie? Social Car?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7815\" name=\"7815\">\u201cThe child prodigies are all fine. The distractions are good, too. Actually, I threw a female receptionist onto the Social Car team to slow them down a bit. They were performing ahead of schedule and could have launched this quarter, ahead of Project Y. The result was actually better than I expected\u200a\u2014\u200ashe killed the project. So that\u2019s currently serving as a distraction for the distraction. I think I will try the same technique with a few other teams.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"18bb\" name=\"18bb\">\u201cIt\u2019s a shame women keep failing at the opportunities we offer them,\u201d Bobby sighed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a214\" name=\"a214\">\u201cWell, yes, that\u2019s part of our problem, actually\u200a\u2014\u200athe women,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cAccording to our predictions, our colony dies out after the first generation because we can\u2019t get the inhabitants to breed.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4c07\" name=\"4c07\">\u201cHow can that be? We\u2019ve optimized for the best models of behavior and philosophy for the past fifteen centuries.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cda9\" name=\"cda9\">\u201cYes, but only if we can get the colony to self-perpetuate. We\u2019ve run several different models, but we can\u2019t get the women to sleep with our male engineers, who of course make up the bulk of our moon population. Hence, virtually no breeding, and our colony eventually dies out. The best we can do is keep shipping women in, but that doesn\u2019t make for a stable community.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4331\" name=\"4331\">\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cIt\u2019s biologically predestined to work.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3791\" name=\"3791\">\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Gregor, remembering working through the same questions when he had pored over the data. \u201cOur analysis suggests that the women don\u2019t find a compelling attraction mechanism present in the engineers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c5ab\" name=\"c5ab\">\u201cNo attraction mechanism,\u201d Bobby said slowly. \u201cBut surely there is nothing more attractive than an engineer?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"06c7\" name=\"06c7\">Gregor shrugged. \u201cWhen the data provided no clues, we tried asking some female employees what they thought of the engineers. We did a few focus groups, but even then, the women couldn\u2019t pinpoint any huge problem.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"62a1\" name=\"62a1\">\u201cOf course they couldn\u2019t,\u201d Bobby snorted. \u201cThe women at Anahata love engineers. Why else would they work for us?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ef2a\" name=\"ef2a\">\u201cThere were some who highlighted hygiene and clothing issues, and the word \u2018nerd\u2019 came up a lot, but mainly they just found the engineers to be less desirable than other men on campus.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"55c4\" name=\"55c4\">\u201cWhat other men?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"be4a\" name=\"be4a\">\u201cThe sales team.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bf2a\" name=\"bf2a\">\u201cHmm.\u201d Bobby stood and walked to the edge of his porch, gazing into the forest. \u201cGregor, this is serious.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2919\" name=\"2919\">\u201cYes, the breeding program is crucial to\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"215c\" name=\"215c\">\u201cIt\u2019s not just breeding. I see now that there is no path to happiness in our plan. Happiness <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is</em> the path. We have no happiness <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and </em>no path.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dff\" name=\"3dff\">Gregor tried to visualize what a path to happiness would look like but could only conjure up his driveway and its rows of towering pines.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"86c0\" name=\"86c0\">\u201cOur engineers must be happy if our society is to succeed. They are the keystone of our new world. If they are not happy, our society will fail. And the best way to make them happy\u200a\u2014\u200amore in our new world than they could ever be in this one\u200a\u2014\u200ais to give them what is impossible today.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5bf\" name=\"f5bf\">Bobby crossed the porch and nodded to himself, stopped, then nodded again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"29ec\" name=\"29ec\">\u201cWe made a crucial error. We only thought about innovation and happiness through the prism of isolation, not of inclusion.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e67a\" name=\"e67a\">\u201cInclusion?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"60a7\" name=\"60a7\">\u201cOur bodies are linked by desire.

We forgot about fucking. That\u2019s what our engineers need. Not just money. Not just hackathons. Not just innovation. They need girls.

We need Project Y to regenerate <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and</em> we need to make sure the offspring are of the highest pedigree. So the women need to be Anahata employees who have made it past our stringent hiring process. Otherwise we\u2019ll end up with a moon colony of\u2026,\u201d Bobby paused and grimaced. \u201cA moon colony of normal people.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c50b\" name=\"c50b\">\u201cWhat if\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9e5a\" name=\"9e5a\">\u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d said Bobby, rushing to Gregor\u2019s side. \u201cHow about we make the whole engineering department gay? If the men could just breed with each other, there\u2019d be no dilution of intelligence or engineering skills\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a10a\" name=\"a10a\">\u201cBut two men can\u2019t breed.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ef2b\" name=\"ef2b\">\u201cUgh, of course,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten that project still isn\u2019t complete. That would have made us a much more progressive company than Galt. Imagine a ten-thousand-man team of gay engineers\u200a\u2014\u200aon the moon!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"62f8\" name=\"62f8\">Gregor cleared his throat. \u201cI decided to address the attraction mechanism by looking at the greatest societies of history in order to find a correlation between philosophy and societal structure and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"43a0\" name=\"43a0\">\u201cAnd fucking? No, that\u2019s not the way. Philosophy is nothing more than a tree in our forest. Social structure is also a tree. But the fertilizer is the girls. If you get the girls, the engineers will come. And the engineers will be happy. And then, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">then</em> they will make little saplings. But only in that order. Our forest must be fertile.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a731\" name=\"a731\">\u201cA fertile forest,\u201d Gregor repeated slowly, trying to picture the happiness path leading into a lush forest. \u201cI think the problem is still the same. The girls don\u2019t like the engineers as much as other types of men.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c7be\" name=\"c7be\">Bobby nodded then pressed his palms together and lowered his head. A minute later, he looked up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6ccf\" name=\"6ccf\">\u201cThen we must become the change we seek.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4191\" name=\"4191\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4949\" name=\"4949\">\u201cNo\u201d Bobby sighed, \u201cI guess you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e715\" name=\"e715\">The men sat in silence for a moment.

Others, likely older, will be ready and interested in producing baby engineers. So we need to make The Engineer as a concept be sexy. It\u2019s the only way to cover both short-term pleasure and long-term mating.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c201\" name=\"c201\">Bobby began to pace.

His pants bunched awkwardly around the back of his legs, stopping just a bit below the knees.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1ade\" name=\"1ade\">\u201cWe just need to fix the perception,\u201d Bobby muttered. \u201cWe must become the change we seek, we must become the change we seek\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5395\" name=\"5395\">Gregor kept quiet on the bench, finding himself in a hopeless loop, with all potential solutions only leading back to the initial problem.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d0d3\" name=\"d0d3\">\u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d shouted Bobby, leaping down from the porch and onto a pile of leaves. He stomped up and down in a victory dance, then looked up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9461\" name=\"9461\">\u201cYou said the women kept comparing the engineers to the sales guys, right?

Listen. Do you know why supermodels sleep with me? Because I\u2019m one of the richest men in the world and I excel at both tree and crow\u2019s pose. Women want my power, my status, my flexibility\u200a\u2014\u200ait really is quite impressive. My shaman explained it once: Men want an attractive woman, but women want what we men represent. How else do you explain all the ugly men in the world married to beautiful women?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"02d2\" name=\"02d2\">\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1d8c\" name=\"1d8c\">\u201cSo all we need to do is elevate the status of our engineers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5f40\" name=\"5f40\">\u201cWe can create a higher promotion curve for the engineers so they can have better titles than the sales team?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"be0a\" name=\"be0a\">\u201cNonsense!

Lower their status.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0394\" name=\"0394\">\u201cAnd so our engineers become the change they seek.

It\u2019s about people. It\u2019s about you. That\u2019s why this week we\u2019ll be rolling out even more benefits and programs to benefit Anahatis \u2014 and humankind:</pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"b313\" name=\"b313\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">Better the World</strong> (BW) benefit, to allow employees a paid sabbatical to work full-time for charity organizations, natural disaster relief, and left-leaning political campaigns.</pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"2dc9\" name=\"2dc9\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pre-strong\">Marathon Care Time </strong>(MCT).

We look forward to developing the program in response to your feedback.</pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"1eea\" name=\"1eea\">On a final note, we would like to inform you that we will be making a small change to our organizational structure. Going forward, all of sales will report into Gregor Guntlag so that we can better align our engineering and sales goals. We think this change will help streamline processes, ensure quick decision-making, and make sure we are all moving in the right direction.

This was primarily the engineers, who believed that anything sent to the entire company would be devoid of data and facts, given it was necessary to be comprehensible to the lowest common denominator (aka sales).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"562c\" name=\"562c\">The second group responded with indifference. This was the support staff\u200a\u2014\u200apeople in departments like legal, finance, marketing, HR, and customer support\u200a\u2014\u200awho were reminded on a daily basis that their opinions and activities were not truly vital to the company\u2019s success. They knew that a shakeup at the top wouldn\u2019t change their status in the slightest. They read the email, shrugged their shoulders, and moved on with their meaningless day.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"811c\" name=\"811c\">The third group responded with outrage. This was a small number of engineers who had actually read the email and found it unacceptable that the water slide and petting zoo they had requested months earlier still had not been granted, while other employees (clearly those from sales) were being granted a marathon-training allowance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4383\" name=\"4383\">The final group was the sales team, who immediately understood the significance of Niels\u2019 departure. With just one nonchalant email from Bobby, a new world order was imposed, one in which bits and pixels trumped money and smarts trumped designer suits; a world in which golf clubs, fast cars, and weekend \u201cbusiness\u201d trips to Vegas would be replaced with gadgets, robots, and video games. They knew nothing would be the same.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fd98\" name=\"fd98\">And, in fact, the reality turned out to be worse than anything they predicted. (As any engineer would have pointed out, this was to be expected since the ability of the dimwitted sales team to predict much of anything was genetically limited.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"493b\" name=\"493b\">A few minutes following Bobby\u2019s memo, most members of the Anahata sales team received an email informing them that they had been chosen to participate in the Horizontal Moves (HM) program and that they should report to the sales auditorium in Building 13 at eleven a.m.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5766\" name=\"5766\">Their excitement at being chosen for an exclusive program dissipated once they arrived at the auditorium. The plush purple sofas that usually welcomed them for Niels\u2019 quarterly strategy meetings had been replaced with fold-up metal chairs. There was no breakfast buffet, no robot butler ready to dispense coffee. Just a man from the HR team with a clipboard who spoke only long enough to repeat Bobby\u2019s memo and then direct the group to line up according to last name at different stations throughout the auditorium. There, he said, they would be given their new special assignments.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"00a7\" name=\"00a7\">The employee who sold ads to fast-food restaurants was given a pair of purple Anahata sweatpants and told to report to the volleyball court, where he would start that morning as a personal trainer. The employee who sold ads to construction companies, henceforth known as HM #4002, was given sunscreen, a suit, and a life buoy and told to make his way to the pool. A former cubicle mate, now known as HM #3403, was made part of the concierge service, while his former boss, HM #2435, became an errand runner for engineers who hated leaving their desks. HM #12009, formerly specialized in selling ads to podiatrists, was assigned to give foot massages to a product manager named Arsyen Aimo. When the latter didn\u2019t show up to his first appointment, HM#12009 was reassigned to run the puppet and juggling shows in Building 4.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3cba\" name=\"3cba\">Before leaving the auditorium, all the sales employees were given new orange badges that clearly identified them as a different class.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"467c\" name=\"467c\">The next day, Horizontal Moves staff members who showed up for the company shuttle bus in San Francisco were curtly instructed to stand in a different line from the engineering staff; HM employees who drove to work were directed to separate parking lots located at the far end of campus. These employees were still allowed to eat in the cafeterias and take advantage of the many gyms and amenities, but they were assigned off-hours when they would be less likely to encounter engineering staff.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8fe1\" name=\"8fe1\">These weren\u2019t the only changes. The soccer field was closed for sports so it could be used as an amateur rocket launcher and robot playing field. The lap pool was taken over by a group of engineers who wanted to build a salamander farm. And the Friday afternoon drinks party in the main hall\u200a\u2014\u200awhich the sales team had long viewed as their territory\u200a\u2014\u200ano longer played hip-hop and pop music, but rather ambient sounds and repeats of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Star Trek</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0f42\" name=\"0f42\">The other Anahata employees took quickly and easily to the new hierarchy. They soon began referring to the former sales employees as Horizontal Movers, or simply by those two damning letters\u200a\u2014\u200aHM.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6287\" name=\"6287\">As for the HM staff, even they had to admit life wasn\u2019t so bad on the bottom\u200a\u2014\u200alow stress for the same pay. Many of them spent their entire days working out, and their six-packs grew new, defined lines. Such accomplishments made them wonder whether their destiny had never been to sell things\u200a\u2014\u200aand intangible things in a virtual world, at that\u200a\u2014\u200abut rather just to be in incredible physical shape.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9914\" name=\"9914\">Of course, there were moments when they suddenly remembered the thrill of their old life, of hitting their monthly sales target and beating their colleagues in the number of new client acquisitions. When those memories hit, the HM puppeteers would suddenly transform their rehearsal of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Sesame Street</em> into <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Reservoir Dogs</em>, the HM lullaby squad would change the engineer naptime music to death rock, and the HM physical trainers would find themselves assigning their engineering clients one thousand jumping jacks or a five-mile run. The engineers huffed and puffed, but it was of little consolation to the demoted employees; the stain of their new HM status stamped itself in blotchy red patches across their clients\u2019 faces.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b5da\" name=\"b5da\">But most of the time, they just admired their biceps. Life as a full-time jock was a much less stressful way to live.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"3a92\" name=\"3a92\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"20ab\" name=\"20ab\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>nahata\u2019s PR director awoke with a start. She saw the phone jumping on her nightstand, a blue light flashing across the screen. It registered then\u200a\u2014\u200aher phone was ringing. It was her boss, Greg Fischer. The ringtone gave him away: a trumpet heralding the release of racehorses from their starting gates.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bb6a\" name=\"bb6a\">She scrambled to sit upright, as though worried Fischer could see through the windows of her home. She was sure he wouldn\u2019t approve of her being asleep at 6:24 a.m. since he, like most nonengineers in the Valley, believed in rising early in order to achieve great things before everyone else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ddc\" name=\"9ddc\">Her boss both terrified and frustrated her. Although PR was one of the departments he controlled as part of his larger remit as chief financial and corporate affairs officer (CFCAO), Greg Fischer had no idea what her team did and generally spoke to her only when something had gone horribly awry.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0dad\" name=\"0dad\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m here,\u201d she said crisply into the phone, hoping she sounded alert. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a0e4\" name=\"a0e4\">\u201cA blogger found some fleets from Niels, and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Tech Geek</em> just picked it up.

She scanned the news feed on her computer. The last time Fischer had woken her up with a \u201cpress emergency,\u201d it was because a gossip rag had run a picture of Bobby\u2019s electric chimp without his permission. Fischer wanted the issue recalled and couldn\u2019t understand why she was unable to make that happen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd40\" name=\"cd40\">The PR director scrolled through the headlines.

But \u201clet\u2019s fly to the moon!\u201d big? That\u2019s pretty ambitious. It seems that\u2019s exactly what wacky Anahata is up to, according to fleets posted by the company\u2019s top sales exec, Niels Smeardon (@Niels_1973), who urged his followers to stop the tech giant from going to the moon. Smeardon\u2019s departure was announced internally two days ago\u200a\u2014\u200ashortly after the timestamp of these fleets. Could these be the ramblings of a disgruntled employee? Or could Anahata really be building a moon colony?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6a62\" name=\"6a62\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">It\u2019s not totally clear whether the fleets are real. After all, there are very few posts before this one by Niels_1973, and the bulk of his messages are about La Lala\u200a\u2014\u200ahardly something screaming tech credibility, though the pop starlet did once try to hump the internet at an awards show. But rumors of a top-secret project at Anahata have been floating about for the past few months, with many saying that founder Bobby Bonilo is looking to build a killer product that will serve a knockout punch to the company\u2019s main competitor, Galt.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1d13\" name=\"1d13\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">There\u2019s also a less exciting though somewhat credible explanation: There have been whispers that the company is interested in finding new places to put its data centers.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7668\" name=\"7668\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">If that\u2019s the case, well, you\u2019d think there\u2019d be cheaper options than the moon, but this is Anahata.

In the five years since she had taken over Anahata\u2019s PR team, she had not once spoken to Bobby directly. And this, she recalled with no small amount of resentment, despite having spun a massive copyright case against the company into a populist revolt against the music industry and pushed the U.S. government, which was investigating Anahata, to christen a new phrase in competition law: \u201cdynamic dominance.\u201d Just last week she had managed to keep photos of Bobby in a high-end Latvian brothel from making it to print.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b89d\" name=\"b89d\">Fischer returned to the phone with a bark.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fc48\" name=\"fc48\">\u201cBobby wants to know in which country you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">can </em>control what gets printed.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0d36\" name=\"0d36\">The PR director wracked her brain. \u201cRussia, Poland, some Southeast Asian countries\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201c</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ba35\" name=\"ba35\">\u201cThose won\u2019t work!\u201d Fischer snapped. \u201cWe are not moving the company to Russia.

The HMer got in the engineer\u2019s face and yelled some sort of insult; the engineer stumbled backwards a few steps before regaining his footing. He brought the tire to the ground and looked to his trainer for praise. Instead, the HMer sent him off down the field to run sprints.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b207\" name=\"b207\">Just a week following the reorganization, the tanned, sporty sales guys already seemed like naturals in their new jobs. It was like they had been destined to be personal trainers and massage therapists; no one had to train them or teach them anything.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"13f7\" name=\"13f7\">It couldn\u2019t have been a greater contrast to Jennie, who felt she wore her new engineering role like a little girl dressed up in her father\u2019s suit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2be4\" name=\"2be4\">But she knew it had to work out. If Bobby Bonilo had a master plan for the sales team, surely he had a master plan for her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"304d\" name=\"304d\">Jennie had been studying Bobby ever since joining Anahata. She had read his autobiography, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Becoming the Me</em>, four times and kept a collection of all his internal strategy memos, taping the most inspirational and visionary quotes to her wall. Every time it looked like Bobby was making a highly questionable decision, it would later turn out he was solving three or four problems at once. Bobby Bonilo was always a few steps ahead of everyone. His book had said as much.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"09d3\" name=\"09d3\">In this case, Bobby wasn\u2019t simply helping the sales team discover their natural talents. He was also achieving greater company unity. Engineers and HM staff were now coexisting peacefully. The sales employees had stopped tripping the engineers in the cafeteria, and the engineers had stopped programming their robots to chase the sales guys down the hallways. The internal email wars between the two groups had ended nearly overnight. In fact, the engineering staff seemed to have backed down entirely since the announcement of the HM program, no longer viewing their sales cum HM counterparts as enemies, but rather officially acknowledged subordinates, children who should be encouraged and supported in their new roles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6885\" name=\"6885\">Jennie\u2019s gaze moved across the field, pausing here and there on a bare chest or a chiseled set of cheekbones. It wasn\u2019t just HMers that caught her eye. Even some of the engineers were getting cuter. Many of them still walked with an odd, ape-like gait, but they somehow looked more\u2026vigorous, healthy. Even Sven, horrible Sven, seemed to be sporting a new set of biceps.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b4e1\" name=\"b4e1\">\u201cGet up, losers!\u201d screamed a voice at the other end of the field, where a pile of arms and legs twisted about like a frantic octopus above the tire course.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"259a\" name=\"259a\">She just couldn\u2019t understand why she wasn\u2019t succeeding in her new job. Of course it had seemed odd that Gregor would ask a nontechnical person to be the technical lead of Social Car. And that when he had asked her, he knew nothing about Jennie other than that she was a campus guide and receptionist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7cde\" name=\"7cde\">But Gregor must have known (maybe it was in her HR file?) that Jennie was a born leader, and that leaders don\u2019t need skills\u200a\u2014\u200athey just need to be leaders.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d81\" name=\"9d81\">Jennie certainly had that. She was convinced she was destined for something world-changing, like reversing climate change or melting the polar ice caps to give clean water to people in Africa.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6829\" name=\"6829\">So, while being assigned to Social Car wasn\u2019t quite the same thing as building an endangered elephant preserve, Jennie knew not to pass on such an opportunity. This was the cosmos shaking an enormous neon sign right at her, telling her it was time for her to do great things.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"25c4\" name=\"25c4\">But something had gone wrong in the universe; Jennie had somehow killed her own job.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9246\" name=\"9246\">Despite her lack of technical skills, Jennie didn\u2019t second-guess her decision to kill Social Car\u200a\u2014\u200aor Stalker Car, as she now called it. She was confident it would have been a disaster for Anahata and driven women away with its creepy features.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"458d\" name=\"458d\">But she also knew she had acted too hastily. After dramatically declaring halt to the project, Jennie found herself with no backup plan. Gregor was inaccessible, and Roni was completely MIA\u200a\u2014\u200aprobably on the moon colony the press kept talking about.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b5c\" name=\"2b5c\">She tried to patch things up by returning to the cubicle the following week to brainstorm ideas but had been forced to retreat. Swivel chairs blocked the cubicle entrance. Sven refused to speak to her, and Jonas kept his eyes glued to the wizards on his screen. And Arsyen, the weird guy who tried to give her that foul-smelling perfume, seemed to have disappeared. He had left a message scrawled across the whiteboard\u200a\u2014\u200a<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">KING ARSYEN!!!</em>\u200a\u2014\u200abut no other clue as to his whereabouts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"041a\" name=\"041a\">To make matters worse, her friends were all thriving. Gregor had replaced all the lobby receptionists with sign-in kiosks and assigned the women to new technical projects, telling them it was a part of an HR program to \u201cbring in more diverse perspectives.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c6d5\" name=\"c6d5\">Her closest friend, Karla, was now running a team that was building an internet hat\u200a\u2014\u200aor, more precisely, an internet sombrero. Glasses popped down from the brim\u2019s front to help you see webpages; headphones could pop in from the sides if you wanted to listen to music or audio files. Best of all, just by nodding your sombrero in the direction of something, the hat would help identify the object before you.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad9b\" name=\"ad9b\">Karla confessed to Jennie that she didn\u2019t really get why anyone would want an internet sombrero. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve got my computer at home. I\u2019ve got my mobile in my pocket. Why do I need a sombrero?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ab4a\" name=\"ab4a\">\u201cDid you ask them that?\u201d Jennie asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"82de\" name=\"82de\">\u201cOf course not. They would have thought I was an idiot. You just have to trust the engineers. They\u2019re so smart, you know?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e414\" name=\"e414\">\u201cBut did they ever think that maybe <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">they</em> would wear an internet sombrero but normal people probably wouldn\u2019t? I mean, it is\u2026<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">weird</em>\u2026right? Plus, what if it\u2019s too hot to wear a sombrero?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"18ad\" name=\"18ad\">Karla wrinkled her nose and giggled. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought! But they pointed out that\u2019s why they made it a sombrero\u200a\u2014\u200abetter sun protection! Genius, right? In any case, the sombrero won\u2019t be around forever. Even if the first iteration is a sombrero, V2 will be a wig, and V3 will be reduced to a toupee or beret. The guys say that we just have to get the hat closer and closer to being part of the human head. Cuz like, eventually, it\u2019s just a brain chip, you know? Like an extension of your head. Though it\u2019s too bad they just can\u2019t skip right to that. I don\u2019t really want to have to go around wearing an ugly hat for two years just to show I\u2019m a team player, you know?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e421\" name=\"e421\">Jennie nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e50c\" name=\"e50c\">\u201cThe guys on the team are really nice,\u201d Karla continued. \u201cThey say I take really good notes. You know, I always thought engineers were such dorks, but\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad8f\" name=\"ad8f\">Sven wasn\u2019t nice. Sven, with his messy blond hair and blue eyes and Johnny Rotten sneer. Sven who hated her and who never wanted to see her again. Sven who was an engineer. Sven who\u2026who was like an architect, really, like an artist who painted in numbers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"381d\" name=\"381d\">Sven, who had destroyed her chance at greatness.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"59ff\" name=\"59ff\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"4683\" name=\"4683\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he daily attention lavished on Jennie in Fried Fred\u2019s amounted to a short lunchtime victory followed by a long dismal afternoon. That day, she spent the afternoon tending to her plot in the company\u2019s organic garden and then curled up in a sleep capsule to reread Bobby\u2019s autobiography\u200a\u2014\u200ain particular the chapters on failure (very short) and success (very long).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cc14\" name=\"cc14\">The sun was in its last pulses of light as Jennie made her way toward the exit. She stopped for a moment by the gigantic squid, the tank now lit for nighttime with gently pulsing pink lights from below. The squid looked so happy and peaceful bobbing in that turquoise water. Why couldn\u2019t she be like a squid?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6365\" name=\"6365\">The squid spotted Jennie and unfurled two of its arms, extending them across opposite ends of the tank, as though to give her a hug. Jennie took a step forward and put her hand to the glass. A tentacle mirrored her move. She felt a tear on her cheek. Oh, squid. Her friend the squid.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cdc6\" name=\"cdc6\">Jennie put her face to the glass, and in a swish, the squid rotated backwards, exposing its mouth. It pressed its body against the glass as it chomped its jaws at her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2cdb\" name=\"2cdb\">Even the squid didn\u2019t understand her; Jennie was nothing more to it than a potential dinner.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8fc8\" name=\"8fc8\">As Jennie shuffled to the exit, her phone pinged with the sound of a new message. It was Arsyen, the Social Car engineer who had disappeared.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6856\" name=\"6856\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Hi Jenni, want chat?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a8b6\" name=\"a8b6\">She shook her head. She\u2019d rather hang out with the mute squid than talk to that creepy Arsyen. She ignored his message and put her phone back in her pocket.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"903b\" name=\"903b\">The campus had already cleared out, its lawn now empty of the voices and beeps and robots that roamed across it each day. Anahata\u2019s small green hills and winding streams now seemed like a scene from another part of America, a place where people took walks and made long-winded observations about the weather.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b846\" name=\"b846\">In her previous life, Jennie had loved to catch the campus in this state, to breathe in Anahata\u2019s freshly cut grass and optimism, but now she merely stared at her feet as she crossed the lawn.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"401e\" name=\"401e\">As she passed by Building 2, a small rock suddenly flew through the air and connected with her wrist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"96f9\" name=\"96f9\">\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0f0e\" name=\"0f0e\">Jennie jumped back and looked across the empty lawn, readying herself in the karate pose she had learned at her feminist book club. She looked to the left, then right, scanning for sudden movement or suspicious figures. There was nothing to be seen. Her shoulders settled back into their slump, and she began to make her way to her car.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1609\" name=\"1609\">\u201cPsst! Over here!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ac70\" name=\"ac70\">Jennie turned in the direction of the voice and saw a bush waving at her. She did a double take and confirmed that, yes, it was indeed a bush waving at her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6576\" name=\"6576\">\u201cIt\u2019s me\u200a\u2014\u200aRoni!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"294f\" name=\"294f\">\u201cRoni?\u201d She squinted at the bush.

When Jennie was close enough to make eye contact, Roni beckoned again with his green chin and then dropped below the shrubbery.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"15a4\" name=\"15a4\">She pushed the brush back and found Roni crouched low on the ground. He was wearing camouflage on his lower half and had painted streaks of green and brown under his eyes to match his leafy suit. Jennie suppressed a laugh and reminded herself that this was the guy in charge of Anahata hackathons, the guy who used to run Social Car and could help her win credibility among the engineers. She needed his help.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bdf8\" name=\"bdf8\">\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the outfit?\u201d Jennie asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5fbf\" name=\"5fbf\">\u201cIt\u2019s just an extra precaution,\u201d whispered Roni, peering out through the bushes. \u201cI am working on something confidential. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Very confidential!</em>\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"40a8\" name=\"40a8\">So that\u2019s why Roni had disappeared, leaving no clue as to his whereabouts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4906\" name=\"4906\">\u201cI could use your advice, too,\u201d she said. \u201cSocial Car\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cca5\" name=\"cca5\">\u201cYou <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">must</em> be quiet!\u201d Roni hissed. \u201cI will tell you what I can tell you. And then I need your advice. And then we can discuss your problem. In that order.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c7f\" name=\"0c7f\">Roni cleared his throat, jumped up for a moment to stretch his legs, then hopped back down into a crouching, frog-like pose, the fat suit bobbing over his legs, threatening to swallow them. He motioned her down to his level.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2716\" name=\"2716\">\u201cTell me, how can I get women to like engineers?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9c43\" name=\"9c43\">\u201cSorry? Not sure I understand.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7f90\" name=\"7f90\">\u201cThat\u2019s probably because I have not told you enough,\u201d Roni said. \u201cTo be clear, that was intentional.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c46d\" name=\"c46d\">Jennie rolled her eyes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2fda\" name=\"2fda\">\u201cOkay, okay, I will tell you more. But you must not say anything to anyone!\u201d Roni held a finger to his lips. \u201cWe have a project that holds the future of Anahata. I can\u2019t tell you all the details yet, but what I will say is that a key component is getting women to like engineers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2821\" name=\"2821\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"63c1\" name=\"63c1\">\u201cAs a first step,\u201d Roni continued, \u201cwe brought the Anahata women closer to the engineers and forced mixing of the sexes. You were an example of this\u200a\u2014\u200amaking a woman the technical lead of a project.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"825c\" name=\"825c\">Jennie couldn\u2019t help but smile. She had been right. Her assignment\u200a\u2014\u200aand Karla\u2019s, and all those other girls in Fried Fred\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200ait was all part of a weird experiment.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f4aa\" name=\"f4aa\">\u201cFrom what we saw, bringing you and other girls into the engineering departments <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">did</em> increase male/female interaction a bit. But there are two problems. First, you women interact now with the engineers, but you\u2019re still not <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dating</em> them, just <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">speaking</em> to them. We had not anticipated that these two actions were distinct. Second, some of the female leads\u200a\u2014\u200alike you\u200a\u2014\u200aare destroying ambitious engineering projects.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5c56\" name=\"5c56\">\u201cBut I\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d Jennie protested.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"59a4\" name=\"59a4\">\u201cDon\u2019t take offense. We believe your failure on Social Car has nothing to do with your abilities or intelligence but a more general limitation of your gender.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f54c\" name=\"f54c\">It was a demeaning conclusion, and the feminist in Jennie wanted to protest. But Roni was really just calling women failures, not Jennie specifically, and her ego was much more important to her than any larger social movement.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ae31\" name=\"ae31\">\u201cThat\u2019s actually <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em> the biggest problem,\u201d Roni said. \u201cBecause even if I can get you girls to stop ruining our engineering projects <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and </em>start dating the guys on your team, our approach still isn\u2019t scalable. We can\u2019t have women leading all of our technical projects if we want to be innovative. Besides, that would mean just one woman to every three to five men. Women can\u2019t reproduce quickly enough for that to be a successful ratio.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bad5\" name=\"bad5\">\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018reproduce\u2019? Are you talking about babies?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d980\" name=\"d980\">\u201cIgnore the reproduction part for now,\u201d said Roni, waving the thought away with his hand. \u201cThe point is, how do I get more women to interact with the engineers at Anahata? It\u2019s a real problem. Even when we got rid of the competition, we didn\u2019t see enough uplift in dating or\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d Roni smacked his hands together, \u201ccoupling.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a30a\" name=\"a30a\">\u201cI\u2019m not following you,\u201d said Jennie, shaking her head. \u201cBabies? Competition? Coupling?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2092\" name=\"2092\">\u201cForget the babies, forget the babies. There are no babies\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s part of the problem! But forget them for now. I will tell you about the competition part.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4475\" name=\"4475\">With a few grunts, Roni leaned forward in his suit, dragging his girth forward as he squatted close to the ground. He drew two stick figures in the dirt: one with an enormous head and the other with large arms. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that there were two guys you could pick: a guy with a big brain or a guy with big biceps.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5ae8\" name=\"5ae8\">\u201cYeah, there are a few of those around here,\u201d said Jennie, a smile inadvertently crossing her lips as she thought of the squad of buff HM guys who ran drills each morning.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1aeb\" name=\"1aeb\">\u201cNow say I\u2019ve gotten rid of those guys,\u201d he said, making an X over the muscle-bound figure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3b71\" name=\"3b71\">\u201cI don\u2019t <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">want</em> you to get rid of those guys.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"03f8\" name=\"03f8\">Roni grimaced. \u201cWell, we did it. That\u2019s what the Horizontal Moves program is about. The sales guys are all at the bottom of the Anahata hierarchy now. And our engineers are the gods they deserve to be. The good news is that our data shows that now, when you women do talk to the engineers, you appreciate their higher status. As a result, there is a much higher success rate than in the past. We call it \u2018coupling.\u2019 So the coupling rate is much higher, although it still remains extremely low. Make sense?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd84\" name=\"dd84\">Jennie thought of all the women she had seen flirting with the engineers in Fried Fred\u2019s. It did make sense in its odd little way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b0b4\" name=\"b0b4\">\u201cSo when we force the genders together, we have some good results, but generally, most of the women on campus aren\u2019t initiating conversations with the engineers. They just stay in their own buildings. So the two groups don\u2019t interact, conversations don\u2019t start, and coupling never occurs.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cb17\" name=\"cb17\">\u201cYou mean you want us to seek you guys out?\u201d Jennie laughed. \u201cYour logic is all wrong. Women aren\u2019t the hunters; we choose from everything that\u2019s offered to us. I mean, unless they\u2019re like me. I\u2019m very assertive. As a feminist, I believe that\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1f94\" name=\"1f94\">\u201cI want to know about normal women,\u201d Roni said. \u201cNot feminists.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3e13\" name=\"3e13\">\u201cWell, my point is that the engineers need to come find us. And then they have to convince us that they are the ones we want.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"651a\" name=\"651a\">\u201cOkay, Okay, I see,\u201d Roni said. \u201cSo we need a way to find the women. And then we need a way to facilitate conversation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e754\" name=\"e754\">Jennie nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"89a4\" name=\"89a4\">\u201cSo, you are a woman. Tell me how to do this.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7360\" name=\"7360\">She shrugged. \u201cWithout fundamentally changing the engineers? Hmm\u2026nothing occurs to me off the top of my head.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5cc4\" name=\"5cc4\">Roni\u2019s face fell, his fat suit slumping like a deflated balloon atop the caked mud.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"83bc\" name=\"83bc\">\u201cI should go,\u201d he sighed, casting his drawing stick into the bushes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c320\" name=\"c320\">Without saying more, he dropped onto his belly, his face now at eye level with Jennie\u2019s shoes. He began to crawl slowly away, dragging bits of leaves with him as his fat suit bounced behind the bushes. Jennie made a swifter exit and headed to the parking lot.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6a1d\" name=\"6a1d\">As she slid into her car a few minutes later, Jennie realized that she had forgotten to ask Roni about Social Car.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ff85\" name=\"ff85\">\u201cUgh,\u201d she groaned, grimacing as she imagined the coming weeks of boredom.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"07e2\" name=\"07e2\">Her phone dinged again with a message. It was Arsyen. The guy just couldn\u2019t take a hint.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"87d3\" name=\"87d3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Jenni, I need horses and guns. I have big revolution in pants.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b840\" name=\"b840\">\u201cWhat guy <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">doesn\u2019t</em> have a big revolution in his pants?\u201d Jennie muttered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b75e\" name=\"b75e\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I mean big revolution plans</em>, Arsyen wrote a second later. Which made even less sense than a revolution in his pants. This guy really needed help with his pickup lines.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f714\" name=\"f714\">She tossed her phone into the passenger seat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"731a\" name=\"731a\">And then it hit her\u200a\u2014\u200athe solution to Roni\u2019s problem. It was so blindingly obvious.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c00\" name=\"7c00\">Jennie turned her head and looked back at the bushes. At the far end of the building, with the aid of an overhead security light, she could see a bush rustling in the windless night, moving like a bloated, leafy phantom in the direction of the entrance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dda6\" name=\"dda6\">Jennie jumped out of the car and ran in pursuit of the waving bush.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"e71f\" name=\"e71f\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"ebd7\" name=\"ebd7\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he next morning, Jennie skipped into the Social Car cubicle with a box of bear claws and nearly tripped over a swivel chair that had fallen on its side. It seemed Sven and Jonas weren\u2019t even trying to keep her out anymore\u200a\u2014\u200athey just didn\u2019t care.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"87bd\" name=\"87bd\">It was obvious no work had been done in days. Drawings of robots were scattered across the whiteboard; Red Bull cans were stacked in a perfect pyramid, clearly untouched.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b82c\" name=\"b82c\">Jennie sidled up alongside Jonas, who didn\u2019t look up from his screen. From what she could tell, he was on a messaging forum, calling himself Wei and arguing about vegetables. To his left, Arsyen\u2019s desk was cleared off and spotless\u200a\u2014\u200aa rarity at Anahata. Two pink sponges were stacked in the center; above them sat a note from Arsyen asking Sven to please look after them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d337\" name=\"d337\">Jennie shifted in place just slightly so she could get a better look at her blue-eyed enemy. She studied his profile from across the cubicle and decided he actually wasn\u2019t bad-looking\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly if he could just get rid of the dorky plastic sandals and weathered summer camp T-shirt. Then again, a costume change would probably not have any bearing on his abrasive personality.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ce3\" name=\"3ce3\">Taking a deep breath, Jennie walked toward Sven\u2019s desk. She noticed his jaw tighten as she moved into his field of vision. She dropped her bait onto Arsyen\u2019s empty desk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d402\" name=\"d402\">Sven\u2019s nose lifted. Jonas scooted his chair to the left to grab a bear claw from the box, but her hand blocked his reach.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0589\" name=\"0589\">\u201cWhere\u2019s Arsyen?\u201d she asked him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1c41\" name=\"1c41\">\u201cWe have not seen him in 4.6 days,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"28b9\" name=\"28b9\">\u201cNo matter,\u201d said Jennie, lifting her hand. \u201cTwo people are ample resource to build our project.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2c2e\" name=\"2c2e\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">You</em> have an idea,\u201d snorted Sven, eyes glued to his screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e9a1\" name=\"e9a1\">\u201cNot only that.

But if that girl was online, things would be different, right? Like Jonas, a second ago you were chatting in a forum. You had no problem pretending to be someone else.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2c2b\" name=\"2c2b\">\u201cThat\u2019s because there are no consequences online,\u201d Sven said. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t want to talk to you, you just move on to the next person.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5ad5\" name=\"5ad5\">\u201cBecause the fear of rejection is a lot lower on the internet, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9704\" name=\"9704\">Jennie walked to the whiteboard and drew a rectangle. \u201cThis is a mobile phone,\u201d she said. Within the phone, she drew a bunch of squares with people\u2019s faces. \u201cNow what does this look like?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"da28\" name=\"da28\">\u201cA bit like the Social Car dashboard, I guess,\u201d said Sven, flipping open a can of Red Bull.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"aa6a\" name=\"aa6a\">\u201cI get it! I get it!\u201d shouted Jonas, jumping up and racing to the whiteboard. \u201cIf you put Social Car on a mobile phone, you suddenly can see all the girls around you.

As designers of Anahata\u2019s future prediction tool, the Genie team always let their product decide their next steps. The engineer stared at the Genie prediction and shrugged. There was no point in arguing with science.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a13a\" name=\"a13a\">Later that evening, sitting alone in the Genie cubicle, the engineer signed himself into the app. Soon he was staring at sixteen attractive faces\u200a\u2014\u200asixteen girls online right then, all near him, on the Anahata campus. He touched one photo, and the girl\u2019s picture filled the screen. Her name was Sarah, and her profile said she worked in Anahata\u2019s PR department. She was twenty-six, liked electronic music, romantic comedies, and baking cookies. He didn\u2019t like any of those things, but that didn\u2019t really matter. What did bother him was the small flower tattoo near her ear. He hated tattoos.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b12f\" name=\"b12f\">Next was Chinmei on the HR team. HR girls were pretty slutty\u200a\u2014\u200aor that was what the engineer\u2019s HM trainer had told him. She liked horses and walking her dog and blah blah blah. He opened the chat box.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c0f\" name=\"0c0f\">A Social Me prompt appeared.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8367\" name=\"8367\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Need a hand starting the conversation?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f272\" name=\"f272\">The engineer pushed the help button.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e733\" name=\"e733\">A line of suggested conversation appeared in the chat box, waiting for his approval: \u201cHey Chinmei, that\u2019s such a great pic. I love horses, too!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"939e\" name=\"939e\">The engineer wasn\u2019t convinced it was such a great pickup line, but he trusted the Social Me technology over anything he could come up with himself. He pressed send and then stared at the phone, as if expecting a perfumed genie to emerge from the port in a cloud of smoke. But no answer came. He wondered if other men had sent Chinmei similar messages.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e767\" name=\"e767\">He went back to the gallery of photos. Laura. Alice. Julia. He stopped on Julia, who had big, curly brown locks. He opened the chat box again, asked for Social Me\u2019s help, and didn\u2019t even bother to read its pickup line suggestions, figuring it was something complementing her hair. He hit send. He then went back to Alice and Laura\u2019s profiles and did the same, convinced that the more messages he sent, the more likely it was that at least one girl would respond to him. (The engineer had previously worked on Anahata\u2019s email team; he knew how effective spam was.) All in all, he hit up about twenty girls.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2ef4\" name=\"2ef4\">Soon after, his phone vibrated to indicate a new message. But it wasn\u2019t from a girl\u200a\u2014\u200ait was from the Social Me application.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"546f\" name=\"546f\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">No response yet?

He was now a declared lover of art, wine, and Asian fusion cooking. He also decided to add one bit of truth\u200a\u2014\u200ahis participation on the Genie project. It had a lot of buzz around campus, and he figured it would make him look good.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd97\" name=\"cd97\">Within minutes of completing his profile, the man had his first response. It was from a girl named Emily.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"ea26\" name=\"ea26\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">That\u2019s so cool that you knit!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"c584\" name=\"c584\">He laughed.

His eyes darted around the empty cubicle, looking for a candle or a blanket or something that would make Emily comfortable and put her in the mood\u200a\u2014\u200ain the mood for what, he wasn\u2019t sure, though he knew what <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">he</em> wanted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"493d\" name=\"493d\">There was nothing in his workspace but various gadgets, Red Bull cans, and the red gym shirt his HM trainer had given him. He rummaged about in his backpack until he found the reading lamp he liked to use whenever he spent the night in a sleep capsule. He set the lamp on his desk, threw the red T-shirt over it, and turned off the lights. From one corner of the room, a small light illuminated the floor in a gentle red glow. It was the best he could do. And if Emily was surprised to see this\u200a\u2014\u200a<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what if she really just wanted to show him how to knit?!</em>\u200a\u2014\u200ahe could just pretend he was one of those coders who liked to work in the dark.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4bfe\" name=\"4bfe\">He sat back in his chair and took a deep breath, readying himself for Emily\u2019s arrival.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a1e6\" name=\"a1e6\">Twenty minutes later, Emily was doing things to his body he had only ever seen on the internet, while Genie\u2019s future predictor compiler cast a green glow of zeros and ones across their bodies, spitting out new and promising predictions.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"b683\" name=\"b683\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"3c02\" name=\"3c02\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LP24FJ2KxZG7iT38iXDq7A.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"4c72\" name=\"4c72\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he Genie team was in an uproar, their alternating wails and accusatory shouts prompting Jennie and others in Building 7 to don noise-reduction headphones. The problem wasn\u2019t that one of their team members hadn\u2019t done any work in three days, discovered each morning in handcuffs, wearing little more than a proud smile. That was a mild inconvenience.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3885\" name=\"3885\">There was a much bigger problem\u200a\u2014\u200anamely that Genie\u2019s future predictor tool had failed to anticipate the full success of Social Me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"87dd\" name=\"87dd\">In the past week alone, Genie had predicted the outcome of a major European election, the fall of the yen against the dollar, and the winner of a Brazilian reality TV show. It had announced that one Anahata engineer would go on hunger strike until his preferred brand of potato chips was restocked in the micro-kitchen; it predicted another engineer would foment a revolution in a faraway country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9df8\" name=\"9df8\">It had even predicted that the Genie team members would all be invited to try the Social Me app.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3b64\" name=\"3b64\">But it had completely, totally failed to predict the app\u2019s success.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7967\" name=\"7967\">And three days into its existence, Social Me was an irrefutable success. While the company\u2019s stock price continued to fall and Wall Street declared that the \u201cfrivolous moon colony plan\u201d would be the end of Anahata\u2019s reign, things couldn\u2019t have been sunnier on campus. Birds chirped in the trees and fleet-footed cupids danced down the halls, jumping from one beanbag to the next, sprinkling their magical dust on those lucky enough to have been invited to try the app. Meanwhile, those without access queued outside the Social Me cubicle, begging for an invitation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d2c\" name=\"8d2c\">The Genie team had just one thing with which to console themselves. While they hadn\u2019t predicted a Social Me triumph, their tool was at least predicting a Social Me problem.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a62\" name=\"2a62\">The new Genie team lead, a redhead with even redder lips, delivered the news to Jennie like an arcade genie spitting out a cryptic future.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bd99\" name=\"bd99\">\u201cSocial Me has or is going to have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the time will come, I do not know. But expect a problem.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fdb8\" name=\"fdb8\">Noting Jennie\u2019s puzzled look, the redhead rolled her eyes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9d75\" name=\"9d75\">\u201cLook, I don\u2019t even get why we\u2019re building this product. Genie can\u2019t give concrete details, just confirmations about generally positive or negative things. I might as well tell you now that you\u2019re going to die one day. Do with the information as you see fit.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4028\" name=\"4028\">It was a useless warning, as Jennie already knew there was a problem in her hookup paradise. It was as plain as the faces staring back at her on the Social Me app.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c8e3\" name=\"c8e3\">The problem was Hot Ryan.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6403\" name=\"6403\">She had spotted him on Social Me the previous day. Hot Ryan was twenty-seven and loved going to the gym, cooking multicourse macrobiotic dinners, and taking long walks in the forest. He was everything she wanted in a boyfriend. His hair was a color Jennie was sure was called \u201crusset,\u201d and he had the kind of slightly angular face that she was sure could only belong to a man who had experienced both hardship and love and who was sensitive\u200a\u2014\u200aso sensitive that he felt every emotion, every loss, every moment in which his future girlfriend might leave his side. In his profile picture, he was wearing a knit sweater, sitting in front of a fireplace with a glass of red wine, inviting one lucky girl to join him for an evening of slow jams and lovemaking. Jennie could hear the fire crackling in the background, the smell of pine and winter filling her nose. Hot Ryan was dreamy, and he could be hers in a matter of seconds if she just clicked on the chat button.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"718f\" name=\"718f\">\u201cWe\u2019ve got another HMer on S&amp;M,\u201d she said over her shoulder, pinging Sven the link to Ryan\u2019s Social Me profile\u200a\u2014\u200athough not before first adding Ryan to her favorites folder in case she wanted to contact him later.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a8b8\" name=\"a8b8\">No girl wanted to date an HMer or be seen on campus with him\u200a\u2014\u200aeveryone knew they were the losers and meatheads of Anahata\u2019s employee base. But it seemed that guys like Hot Ryan had figured out how to hide their HM status from the app and were starting to monopolize all the conversations and messages from the girls, leaving the engineers empty-handed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"825f\" name=\"825f\">Sven took a look at Ryan\u2019s profile and let out a growl.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7258\" name=\"7258\">\u201cThese guys are like weeds! We get rid of one and another pops up in his place! And what\u2019s up with that sweater?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2f4a\" name=\"2f4a\">\u201cJealous much?\u201d said Jennie, turning in her chair toward Sven. She let her gaze linger on his face, appreciating the faint acne scars near his temples\u200a\u2014\u200athe reminder, no doubt, of a painful adolescence. She liked guys who were mildly bruised; their slight imperfections tempered their attempts at arrogance. They were nothing like the sales guys, nothing like that Niels Smeardon, who had seduced her and then made her wait outside on his lawn, in the cold, until a taxi came.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bbd5\" name=\"bbd5\">Sven blushed, and Jennie realized she was still staring.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1e5a\" name=\"1e5a\">\u201cMore importantly,\u201d she said, looking down at her mobile, \u201chow do you think they\u2019re getting onto Social Me? We restricted access to just the engineers and female employees.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5db5\" name=\"5db5\">\u201cMaybe some of the Horizontal Moves guys managed to steal some of the engineers\u2019 phones and replace their pictures,\u201d Sven said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b4f4\" name=\"b4f4\">Jonas turned in his chair. \u201cPerhaps they are exploiting a loophole in the code.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe78\" name=\"fe78\">Sven smirked. \u201cThat\u2019s like suggesting that me and my core competencies learned how to do a cost-benefit analysis overnight.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d17c\" name=\"d17c\">Jonas shrugged. \u201cThey must be doing something special to get into the app.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"51a0\" name=\"51a0\">\u201cLoophole or not, there will always be some way for a nonengineer to get on here if he really wants to,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cWe need to rig the system so that the girls <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">only</em> want to speak and meet the engineers. In other words, we need to get Jonas\u2019 profile, for example, to beat Hot Ryan.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2116\" name=\"2116\">\u201cOur site is eighteen-plus,\u201d Sven snickered. \u201cJonas isn\u2019t old enough to join.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c6a4\" name=\"c6a4\">Jonas stuck his tongue out. \u201cYou really think I am incapable of hacking into my own service?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fa50\" name=\"fa50\">Jennie grinned. She had indeed banned Jonas and Anahata\u2019s other child prodigies from using Social Me but soon discovered that such precautions were unnecessary. Jonas and the other boys had hacked in on the first day but, not understanding the attraction of speaking with girls, soon returned to their video games.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"db9c\" name=\"db9c\">\u201cOkay, so forget about Jonas. We need, like, Arsyen\u2019s profile to beat Hot Ryan,\u201d she said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1d71\" name=\"1d71\">Arsyen had sent her another message that morning. This time something about being stuck in an airport with donkeys. He was the perfect example of a guy who needed Social Me to land a girl.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"55f2\" name=\"55f2\">\u201cThe engineers will never beat the HMers on looks,\u201d Jenni continued. \u201cWe need something that makes a woman feel like there\u2019s a deeper connection with the guy she\u2019s talking to.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3f85\" name=\"3f85\">The men went quiet, seeming to wait for more input from Jennie. But she was already thinking about another problem, one that she did not share with her team members but had kept her awake the previous night.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c387\" name=\"c387\">Shortly after the Social Me launch, Jennie concluded that an engineer\u2019s first interaction with the app was crucial in determining whether he became a repeat visitor. Put simply, he was more likely to return to the app if he had a positive interaction with the opposite sex.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8a86\" name=\"8a86\">This was easier said than done. Even the all-powerful internet had its limits, and Jennie\u2019s analytical data showed that most of the engineers were needing several tries before they could land on a girl willing to talk to them for more than a few minutes. As a result, some of the engineers had already given up hope and abandoned the product entirely. If she wanted to keep her engineers on Social Me, she had to make sure that their first interaction with the opposite sex was positive\u200a\u2014\u200aor, better yet, that it led to a full-on coupling event.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c88e\" name=\"c88e\">So Jennie had taken the burden of coupling events on her own back\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally\u200a\u2014\u200aand spent the second day of the launch running from one sleep capsule to another, converting twenty engineers to satisfied Social Me users. By the end of the day, she was worn out (and slightly disgusted) and knew she couldn\u2019t do it on her own. The twenty escorts she had hired the next day made quick work of the Genie, Moodify, and infrastructure teams, and by week\u2019s end had ensured that hundreds of other Anahata engineers were reaching some personal form of ecstasy thanks to Social Me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3488\" name=\"3488\">But she knew her escort strategy wasn\u2019t scalable and wouldn\u2019t help Roni\u2019s moon colony problem. The engineers were certainly coming back for second helpings, but once they were no longer engaged with flirty escorts but normal Anahata women instead, the conversations quickly fell flat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e4b\" name=\"4e4b\">Flipping through the chat records, it was clear that the men simply weren\u2019t engaging the women the right way. If they used the Social Me interest generator feature, they could start a conversation with the girls, but the moment they stopped discussing knitting, pastels, or baking, the conversation screeched to a halt. They needed a fully automated solution that would help any engineer score an offline meetup.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ed9\" name=\"3ed9\">Jennie tapped her pen to her lips as she calculated how many more escorts she would need to make it through the week. She could feel Sven watching her and was surprised to feel her cheeks flush. Then something flashed inside her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"de46\" name=\"de46\">\u201cDo you think you could hack into Anahata\u2019s internal HR data?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9934\" name=\"9934\">Sven shook his head. \u201cImpossible.

Rather, the human resources offices were housed in an attractive, almost historic-looking brick structure surrounded by rose bushes on all sides\u200a\u2014\u200aa chastity belt of sorts whose thorns cut into Jennie\u2019s legs as she crouched next to Roni.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e8f0\" name=\"e8f0\">\u201cI\u2019ve never been out here before,\u201d Jennie whispered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ed1f\" name=\"ed1f\">\u201cIts location is no coincidence,\u201d Roni whispered back. \u201cNothing important happens here.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7445\" name=\"7445\">The final light went out, and the last employee left the building. Roni passed Jennie some black theater makeup. She smeared it across her face, mimicking the zigzags that ran across Roni\u2019s forehead and cheeks. He had assured her that this would work, that he had done it many, many times without detection.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6d4e\" name=\"6d4e\">Jennie and Roni crawled out from the bushes, keeping low to the ground. When he reached the door, Roni jumped to his feet, making Jennie question the whole purpose of their clandestine approach. He badged himself into the building without any problem. Human resources was not a high-security building, and any Anahata employee could get access with their badge.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1dc0\" name=\"1dc0\">Once inside, they made their way through the corridors, searching for the office of the senior vice president of human resources. At the end of the hall was a corner office with the nameplate they were looking for. \u201cPaul Barlow,\u201d it said in blue lettering, surrounded by smiling teddy bears holding clusters of balloons. Underneath was a folksy, hand-painted wooden sign: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Come in!</em> There was no doorknob, and the door itself was half open, suggesting that declining this friendly invitation to enter was a much greater offense than trespassing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a5f2\" name=\"a5f2\">Roni made a beeline for Paul\u2019s desk and fired up his computer. \u201cWe just need to break into his system and pull it out.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"882e\" name=\"882e\">\u201cHow are we ever going to figure out his password?\u201d Jennie hissed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2568\" name=\"2568\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve done this a million times.\u201d Roni\u2019s fingers tap-danced their way across Paul\u2019s keyboard.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1119\" name=\"1119\">Within seconds, the plain password prompt box gave way to a desktop landscape of lavender flowers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f504\" name=\"f504\">\u201cWhoa\u200a\u2014\u200afirst try!\u201d Jennie exclaimed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ae7c\" name=\"ae7c\">\u201cHR people tend to think with their hearts,\u201d Roni explained. \u201cEmotional people don\u2019t tend to create secure passwords.

On his pale blue walls, Paul had hung several photos of himself with his elderly mother on various European vacations. There were also his diplomas: an undergraduate degree in religious studies from Harvard and a psychology PhD from Stanford. Certificates in Reiki therapy, cognitive emotional therapy, advanced Feldenkreis, and the Henry Miller Wellness Program surrounded Paul\u2019s prized degrees in a big group therapy hug.

It wasn\u2019t anything particularly interesting. But then, flipping to the second page, Jennie found a recent performance evaluation from Beth\u2019s manager, identifying Beth as a top performer in her department but denying her a promotion until she could work on a few areas: Beth was apparently somewhat bossy and not sufficiently collaborative.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6fd8\" name=\"6fd8\">So many women at Anahata seem to have that problem, thought Jennie. If only they could make the women less bossy, maybe they would get further at Anahata.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a60\" name=\"7a60\">Jennie shook her head\u200a\u2014\u200athat was a problem for another day.

While Gregor probably thought of it as well-worn and comfy, Jennie felt as though she had just walked into a room set up only moments before, a temporary space where Gregor had halted just long enough to fire someone or intimidate any ambitious Anahata interior decorator. The office was nearly empty save for a computer on a desk, a recycling bin, and, on the wall, a solitary poster\u200a\u2014\u200aa photograph of a Delhi slum, with the caption <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Proximity Does Not Guarantee Intimacy</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4f87\" name=\"4f87\">Roni had just finished his pitch for Social Me, but Gregor had yet to respond. Jennie thought he looked bored\u200a\u2014\u200ahis face was fixed in a permanent blank. Was his disinterest all an act? He had shown no interest in her as a member of the opposite sex. She wasn\u2019t used to that\u200a\u2014\u200aand wasn\u2019t sure she liked it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8336\" name=\"8336\">Roni cleared his throat and tried again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e0cb\" name=\"e0cb\">\u201cThe data will make a big difference.

They override all the normal chemistry that would draw the women to the HM guys and instead focus them on finding good providers and long-term mates\u200a\u2014\u200aour engineers. The Building 1 moon chemistry team has figured out how to do all of this without losing any of the lust impulses that we want to maintain. In essence, we will be able to rechannel promiscuity, diverting it from legitimate sources of lust to artificial ones.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d714\" name=\"d714\">\u201cThe chemistry team has already confirmed these pheromones will also work on the moon,\u201d Jennie said, \u201cso we can recreate these behaviors again once we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9bf6\" name=\"9bf6\">\u201cAnd there\u2019s an additional benefit,\u201d Roni said. \u201cUp until now, we\u2019ve only been thinking about the heterosexual use case for Social Me\u200a\u2014\u200agetting the women attracted to our male engineers. But of course we also have other use cases to solve for, like homosexuality. As it turns out, the pheromones that turn the women into lusty aspiring housewives happen to react completely differently with male hormone receptors. Men in the marketing, PR, and HR departments who are exposed to our special pheromone blend will suddenly become attracted to other men, providing our gay engineers with an attractive pool of candidates as well.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d652\" name=\"d652\">Gregor\u2019s expression still hadn\u2019t shifted. \u201cFor Project Y to succeed, this attraction needs to be long term,\u201d he said. \u201cPheromones alone won\u2019t solve that.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"572c\" name=\"572c\">\u201cRight, that brings us to the second step,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cTake a look again at Beth on the app. We happened to find some additional information about her\u200a\u2014\u200ainformation that can improve the matching and interaction features by tenfold.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"49d1\" name=\"49d1\">\u201cWhat kind of information?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2ba2\" name=\"2ba2\">\u201cBirth date and relationship status, length of employment at Anahata\u200a\u2014\u200athat kind of thing,\u201d Jennie said.

Like which campus caf\u00e9s Beth eats at, what time she arrives at work.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d9c5\" name=\"d9c5\">\u201cSo whenever she uses her badge to access something.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"184b\" name=\"184b\">\u201cYeah, and, um, things like career successes and failures, psychological issues.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b438\" name=\"b438\">\u201cPsychological issues?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0bad\" name=\"0bad\">\u201cThe HR files, combined with our employees\u2019 internet activity, are a huge treasure trove of data,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cPeople are super confessional when they think they\u2019re just talking to a machine. We know everything about them.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1686\" name=\"1686\">\u201cIf you let us use it, we can make the algorithm much, much smarter,\u201d Roni jumped in. \u201cEntire human interactions can be engineered from nearly start to finish.

So using Beth\u2019s file as a test case, we built this into Social Me, and all of our metrics went through the roof.

The insight had been hers. She couldn\u2019t wait to tell her feminist book club that she was subverting societally imposed attraction paradigms by making women attracted to ugly men.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e4bd\" name=\"e4bd\">\u201cPlus,\u201d Roni continued, \u201cthe feature\u2019s activation is limited to only unattractive and low-rated profiles. That way, no HM candidates will get access to this extra help from the application. It will just be our engineers. Of course, those rare engineers whose ratings are naturally high\u200a\u2014\u200aoutliers who are good-looking or socially adept\u200a\u2014\u200awill also miss out on this feature, but that\u2019s no big deal. They\u2019re already doing fine with the girls.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f150\" name=\"f150\">\u201cLong term,\u201d Jennie added, \u201cwe think that by helping the engineers along with various conversation prompts, we start to train them in how to interact with women more successfully, which will help them in the offline world in all sorts of relationships. At some point they\u2019ll be able to take the training wheels off and have real conversations with real people on their own.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dd76\" name=\"dd76\">\u201cIn the short term,\u201d Roni said, \u201cwe keep the engineers happy, we keep them on the moon, and we destroy Galt. That\u2019s the main point, Gregor. This fixes our Project Y problem.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6c81\" name=\"6c81\">Gregor shook his head. \u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is that the fate of our social mission has come down to a hookup app.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"20f4\" name=\"20f4\">Jennie and Roni nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7744\" name=\"7744\">Although his expression hadn\u2019t shifted, Jennie could tell there was something underneath the feigned placidity. There was something dark in this man. Not that she cared.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"41e1\" name=\"41e1\">\u201cFine,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"24b9\" name=\"24b9\">\u201cYou mean you\u2019ll get us access to the data?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4f18\" name=\"4f18\">\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"33a7\" name=\"33a7\">Gregor stood and opened the door to his office. He kept his hand on the doorknob, as if worried they hadn\u2019t gotten the hint.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7646\" name=\"7646\">\u201cAnd that\u2019s, like, legally okay?\u201d asked Jennie, as she slowly backed out of the room. \u201cI mean, all the user data, the pheromones?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dc11\" name=\"dc11\">Gregor was trying to close the door on her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1d91\" name=\"1d91\">\u201cAnahata is a disruptive company,\u201d he said, slightly pushing the door against her toes. \u201cIf we don\u2019t upset people by doing something, they never get used to that thing, and then we can\u2019t do a new thing to upset them. It\u2019s the way technology moves forward.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f55\" name=\"8f55\">The door closed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e26\" name=\"7e26\">Roni turned to Jennie and gave her a high-five.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"f6a3\" name=\"f6a3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"1097\" name=\"1097\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"0218\" name=\"0218\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>rsyen was not as prepared as he had hoped. He had wanted to arm himself with a weapon of some sort, but Jennie was clearly so embarrassed by her earlier behavior that she hadn\u2019t even responded to any of his requests for help.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2cd6\" name=\"2cd6\">In fact, for all its mighty power, Anahata had proven surprisingly useless. From the airport, Arsyen filed a ticket in the company\u2019s internal system, asking for help with Pyrrhian corruption and security concerns. But it seemed the engineer who processed the request interpreted it as something having to do with Arsyen\u2019s hard drive and erased all of Arsyen\u2019s computer and account data. Now he was completely cut off.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d712\" name=\"d712\">To make matters worse, Arsyen had brought plenty of U.S. dollars with him but discovered they were of little use in Pyrrhia, where Korpeko had outlawed the existing currency (\u201cthe aimo\u201d) and replaced it with a barter system. In the border town of Kerfluff, Arsyen tried to obtain a mule by bartering one of Anahata\u2019s secret hardware products, but everyone in the town just tossed it aside like it was a cheap piece of plastic. As a result, it had taken him almost a week to hitchhike to Poodlekek.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5628\" name=\"5628\">And now here he was, traveling through the city his family had built over decades of rule.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d0fb\" name=\"d0fb\">Little had changed since he had fled. Goats continued to huddle outside the stores, hoping for a handout, and the bison-drawn carriages still outpaced the rickety buses that his father had introduced to Pyrrhia. As far as Arsyen could tell, there had been no investment in public works and no attempt to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure beyond the miles and miles of icy curling lanes, which originated alongside the capital\u2019s main road and wound throughout the Pyrrhian countryside. The one nod to modernity were the internet caf\u00e9s, which lined the streets like eager parade-goers, each competing with its neighbor via colorful signs and promises of free extra minutes. But they were all currently closed under Korpeko\u2019s strategy to cut off Poodlekek from the rest of the country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f9d\" name=\"8f9d\">They took the main road into the center, passing the statue of Jeeves, the great English sportsman flown to Poodlekek by Arsyen\u2019s grandfather in the 1960s to help install civilization and croquet fields across the country. Not far from him was the statute of Lascau, the French filmmaker summoned by Arsyen\u2019s father to produce Pyrrhia\u2019s first movies\u200a\u2014\u200adocumentaries and biopics exploring the great public works undertaken by the Aimo family. Jeeves and Lascau had both declared that Poodlekek would be the future capital of the world. And it would be, finally, once Arsyen reclaimed his throne. He would summon Bobby Bonilo, and together they would build a new Silicon Valley in Poodlekek\u200a\u2014\u200aa Silicon Poodle, or maybe Poodlecon Valley. It would be full of young people, well educated, designing apps and websites that would save the world\u2026and of course make Pyrrhia\u200a\u2014\u200aand the royal family\u200a\u2014\u200aloads of money.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a43b\" name=\"a43b\">But first he needed to confer with the Throne Reclamation Committee and ensure they were well-prepared for battle. Otherwise, Arsyen would happily grab Natia and go hang out in California until things were ready for him.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"0315\" name=\"0315\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"7332\" name=\"7332\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*g7ZwyqYQMX6dQxHgMVjTuw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*g7ZwyqYQMX6dQxHgMVjTuw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*g7ZwyqYQMX6dQxHgMVjTuw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*g7ZwyqYQMX6dQxHgMVjTuw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*g7ZwyqYQMX6dQxHgMVjTuw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"c185\" name=\"c185\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">If</span> Sven weren\u2019t a man of science; if he didn\u2019t believe attraction was simply the intersection of timing and hormones; if he had ever, even just once, managed to kiss a woman, kiss her deeply, and know what that touch could do to a rational human brain\u200a\u2014\u200athen he just might have considered the hypothesis that the woman before him, the one whom he had originally considered a harbinger of misery, was in fact destined to be his savior, who would reverse decades of frustration with one generous little act.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39d2\" name=\"39d2\">But instead Sven just stared at her image, dumb with lust but unable to entertain the greater cosmic possibilities. He assumed he wanted her simply because she might not want him. That had happened before.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a1e2\" name=\"a1e2\">His finger hovered above her picture, then flicked to a new photo, one of her with girlfriends, enjoying a night out. Then there was a photo of her with her computer. Another with her mom.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3a17\" name=\"3a17\">Sven sighed\u200a\u2014\u200athey already had so much in common. He leaned back in the sleep capsule, wondering how he had gotten himself into such a state about her. He set his phone down.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b065\" name=\"b065\">She was irritating, he told himself, she dressed like a bag lady, and she wasn\u2019t very smart.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"83de\" name=\"83de\">No, he countered, she had that California hippie chick vibe, and she was certainly smarter than him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"443f\" name=\"443f\">Ugh! He had to stop thinking about her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eff6\" name=\"eff6\">Sven extended his legs, stretching himself along the bed of the sleep capsule. He stared up at the capsule\u2019s hard-shelled ceiling, supposedly designed to mimic a womb. He doubted an actual female womb was made of shiny white plastic, but the ceiling\u2019s curve and the cocooning effect it produced was certainly relaxing\u200a\u2014\u200aas if you were in a different world. The curtained opening to the capsule ruined that effect somewhat, though it did make it easy to peer out into the hall. Sven adjusted the pillow, and a built-in speaker thanked him in a calming, therapeutic voice for his hard work that day. He wiggled his toes. A full recline was a luxury most standard beds and couches would never allow someone of his height.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"953f\" name=\"953f\">Sven picked up his mobile phone. There was a message from Arsyen\u2019s personal account\u200a\u2014\u200aa picture of him atop a mule, smiling, a broken-down bus and a line of scowling poor people behind him. He was asking whether Sven knew where to buy lasers in bulk. Such a funny guy. Was he building a startup? Something using lasers to solve poverty? He would have to find out more when his co-worker returned.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cb4d\" name=\"cb4d\">Sven ignored Arsyen\u2019s questions and sent him back a picture of his crooked second toe. That always made people laugh.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1158\" name=\"1158\">He returned to the picture of Jennie. She was as bossy and stubborn as Maria, his one almost-girlfriend. They could almost have been the same girl, though unlike Maria, Jennie seemed to bathe consistently, and her hippie dresses and occasional references to feminism and the environment seemed more like fashion accessories than a real belief system. Which pleased Sven, since only in America did there seem to be such a strong connection between poor hygiene and progressive politics.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1904\" name=\"1904\">Sven liked to hear Jennie talk about her grand plans for Mother Earth. She lectured Jonas on recycling Red Bull cans and told Sven that she would one day \u201creally fix things.\u201d Sven thought it was cute that a nontechnical person thought she could change the world. It was ambitious, even if it was clearly delusional.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"02ca\" name=\"02ca\">Sven considered the possibility that Jennie could be smarter than him, though he found that difficult to reconcile with the size of her breasts and her lack of an engineering degree. But she was definitely a good leader\u200a\u2014\u200aprobably the best he ever had at Anahata.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"744c\" name=\"744c\">He yawned and rubbed his eyes. Since Roni and Jennie\u2019s score of the prized employee data, he and Jonas\u200a\u2014\u200aaided by a handful of eager engineers\u200a\u2014\u200ahad been working nonstop on Social Me, making the application even smarter and more effective. They were almost ready to roll out the new version and had spent the day debugging the software and doing quality analysis.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3c54\" name=\"3c54\">Throughout the day, Sven had interacted with various women at the company using four fake profiles. Bob, Sam, Steve, and Logan all had different jobs, appearances, and interests. But to the credit of Social Me, all of them had experienced plenty of luck with the ladies that day.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2770\" name=\"2770\">In fact, all of Sven\u2019s twenty test interactions proved successful, the new version of the Social Me app generating such customized pickup lines and compelling conversation fillers that Sven\u2019s various profiles would certainly have had multiple coupling events in the offline world had he chosen to follow through. The new algorithm generated romantic French phrases for Steve after he chose Jamillah, who was registered in a company-sponsored French class. Bob had luck with Annie, convincing her that the best way to conquer her passive-aggressive behavior with her teammates was to engage in some role-play with him later that night. And Sam, armed with the knowledge of Camille\u2019s recent online purchase of a yoga mat, charmed her into doing a virtual downward dog with him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c756\" name=\"c756\">Sven told himself it was his self-discipline and commitment to science that had kept him from following through with any meetups. But he knew the truth was more nuanced: Talking with girls on an app was one thing; actually meeting them\u200a\u2014\u200awhen he might fail to meet their expectations\u200a\u2014\u200awas another entirely.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c645\" name=\"c645\">Just then, Sven\u2019s phone vibrated. It was a message for Logan from some girl who worked in marketing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd03\" name=\"dd03\">What would Jennie think of Logan? Of all Sven\u2019s fake profiles, Logan\u2019s was the one that came closest to the real Sven: tall, blond, and an engineer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1084\" name=\"1084\">Masking himself as Logan, Sven clicked on Jennie\u2019s profile and read the information she had filled in. It was all stuff that he already knew from working with her, like how she liked dolphins and reading entrepreneur biographies. He wondered what else the app knew about her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f01\" name=\"5f01\">Sven hit the chat button floating above Jennie\u2019s picture, and a Social Me prompt popped up, offering to help kick-start the conversation. This was the same feature he had been testing all day, but now his pulse quickened. He pushed the button again, and a heart icon pulsed three times, preparing his first courtship line. She would never know it was him; Sven hit send.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"46b6\" name=\"46b6\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Hi Jennie!

He hit the Social Me suggestion button again.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"0507\" name=\"0507\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Logan: I am trying to transcend my phallus.

Plus, he was out of Red Bull. He selected the autopilot option so that Social Me could continue to generate lines on his behalf, then made his way to the micro-kitchen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0521\" name=\"0521\">When he returned, the exchange seemed pretty intense.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"9b6c\" name=\"9b6c\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Jennie: But doesn\u2019t Sontag\u2019s model of Baudrillardist simulacra imply that sexual identity has significance, given that presemantic materialism is invalid?</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"b773\" name=\"b773\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Logan: The invalidity of presemantic materialism implies the negation of the intersectional immanence of the simulacra.</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"5896\" name=\"5896\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Jennie: That\u2019s an interesting point.

Hey check out this dolphin listicle!</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"30cc\" name=\"30cc\">Sven did a double take. How did they go from phalluses to dolphins? Was Social Me as confused as he was, or was this how Jennie\u2019s brain worked?</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"7157\" name=\"7157\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Jennie: I LOVE dolphins.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"7963\" name=\"7963\">Did Jennie not realize what was happening?

Jennie wanted to give him Second Sex!!! What <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">was</em> Second Sex?!? He stared at the empty text field, the cursor beating with promise. He had to stop this before Jennie found out who Logan really was. He tossed his phone to the back of the capsule. For minutes, he avoided it, face burning, listening to it vibrate with new messages from Jennie. He decided he would delete her messages without reading them, then come back into work the next day like nothing had ever happened. Jennie would never need to know. He could use Dogtown to ask her out in a few weeks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c591\" name=\"c591\">Just then there was a knock on the outside of the capsule wall. Sven drew back the curtain and peered out, ready to yell at the encroaching passerby. He yelped as he saw Jennie standing there, dressed in a crocheted top and long, flowery skirt.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a1a9\" name=\"a1a9\">Panicking, Sven let the curtain fall back, dying for a refresh button. How had Jennie known that Logan\u2019s profile belonged to him?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a8a\" name=\"4a8a\">But then it hit him: Of course Jennie would have known it was him. She had spent the day logging all the bugs reported by the various profiles; she could easily figure out which ones were coming from the different engineers on the team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3b76\" name=\"3b76\">Sven sunk lower in his capsule.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c2d7\" name=\"c2d7\">\u201cThe Social Car location detection is really quite effective,\u201d came Jennie\u2019s voice from outside the capsule. \u201cI told Jonas to turn it on only for women.

Peering out from the half-inch space separating curtain and wall, Sven studied Jennie\u2019s face, gradually traveling down her neck, following the hemp necklace that hovered just above her breasts.

Sprinklers leaped from their subterranean sleep, twisting in unison to the left, then right, ensuring that not a single blade of Anahata grass went unwatered. The sophisticated irrigation system kept the company\u2019s imported Irish grass fertile and sparkling, impervious to California\u2019s perpetual drought.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"995e\" name=\"995e\">The first Anahata jogger bounded across the sidewalk outside Building 2. Dressed in sleek black running gear, an orange HM emblazoned across the back of his jacket, the man reached Building 10 before even a minute had lapsed. In a few more leaps, he was off campus property, returning thirty minutes later, this time at a much reduced speed. He was now accompanied by five other runners, the newcomers all moving with considerable effort. The man lashed at their heels with a stick, spurring them forward as they jog-shlumped past the corner at Building 20, gasping their way toward the campus lake.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6c96\" name=\"6c96\">The runners passed by a rickety gray shuttle just entering campus, a bulge in its center bouncing perilously close to the pavement. It had wobbled its way up the freeway from San Jose and now stopped in front of Building 2. Men and women slowly filed out of their oversized hearse, joking with each other in Spanish as they badged themselves into Fried Fred\u2019s to begin work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"66e0\" name=\"66e0\">A few hours after the gray shuttle chugged back to the freeway, the purple-and-green Anahata buses began to arrive on campus. Bus to Building 1. Bus to Building 8. Their black roofs moved between the white lines of the campus parking lots, slotting in and out like ever-shifting dominoes. Bus to Building 3. Bus to Building 20. Employees stumbled out. Bus to Building 14. Bus to Building 24. Moving to an unseen metronome, the young men and women of Anahata continued on to their buildings, made their coffees, grabbed breakfast, and headed to their desks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e436\" name=\"e436\">One of the first meetings of the day was taking place in Building 4, where a girl with shiny black hair was more prepared for note-taking than decision-making. Her engineering team was waiting for her to make the final call on their highly technical problem, but the girl just shrugged. One of the engineers threw up his hands and left the room, pulling out his mobile phone and ignoring her feeble plea to return. He became so engrossed in his phone that he didn\u2019t notice the sleep capsule by the exit, which was shaking so vigorously that it seemed to be attempting liftoff. He exited the building, head down, mobile pointed in front of him. He cut across the lawn, trampled a flower bed, and left footprints in the newly raked volleyball court as he followed the blinking dot on his screen. A Galt recruiter jumped out of the bushes and dangled a set of Tesla keys before him, but the engineer\u2019s gaze was locked to his screen. He pushed past the recruiter, walked another ten paces, and came to a stop in front of a pair of red manicured toes. He looked up, blushed, and said, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1afa\" name=\"1afa\">\u201cHello?\u201d said a woman in Fried Fred\u2019s over the walkie-talkie, hitting the device a few times in hopes of a clearer transmission. \u201cDo you all have bleach?\u201d she asked. At the building next door, an older man in his sixties responded. He wiped his brow and reached below one of the counters, dragging out a large container. On his way to deliver the bleach to Fried Fred\u2019s, he called out across the kitchen to a female co-worker to see whether she had finished prepping the organic kale and quinoa salad. The salad selection changed daily, but his view of it did not: It didn\u2019t matter where you made the salad or how many unpronounceable ingredients it contained\u200a\u2014\u200aas a cafeteria worker, you still got paid the same.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8b6c\" name=\"8b6c\">Fifteen minutes later, a tidal wave hit the walls of Fried Fred\u2019s as the cafeteria staff opened the doors and engineers rushed in with the fever of toddlers in a toy store. The bang of the wok, the tunnel sound of the soda dispenser, the sizzle of the fajita station\u200a\u2014\u200aurgency and consumption mixed suddenly, newly, with light, feminine laughter, skipping past each pop and bang.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7ea7\" name=\"7ea7\">A man lined up five carts of catered lunch from Fried Fred\u2019s alongside the back entrance to Building 1. He knocked five times, the first three with the same speed, then a pause before the last two. The door opened, and a head slowly extended like a turtle from its shell. The head looked left, then right, then brought its entire body outside, revealing red Crocs and a faded T-shirt that said R-O-N-I. He pushed the carts into Building 1, taking care to secure the door behind him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a20\" name=\"5a20\">The operations employee in Building 22 postponed her lunch, crinkling her nose as she tried to make sense of the numbers before her. She had checked the data several times and was sure her figures were correct. According to her analysis, productivity rates at Anahata had inexplicably dropped ten percent over the previous week. While the deployment of the sales team to their new Horizontal Moves programs might have slowed sales employees\u2019 productivity, it made no sense that it would also slow the engineering teams. She assumed she had done something wrong and opened another spreadsheet to start over from scratch.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d127\" name=\"d127\">A few buildings away, the handful of Anahata sales executives who had been spared the Horizontal Moves program fidgeted in their seats, smoothing their black and navy blue suits with sweaty palms. Their heads turned in unison as Gregor Guntlag walked into the room. Without shutting the door behind him, and while continuing to thud his way across the room, he announced that all advertising services would be turned off in Africa to free up capacity for a special engineering project. Gregor rounded the far end of the table and now thudded his way in the direction of the door. Anyone unhappy with these changes, he said over his shoulder, was welcome to leave Anahata or join the Horizontal Moves program. The sole of his boots left a muddy trail as he exited the room.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aad1\" name=\"aad1\">Within minutes of Gregor\u2019s exit, a server at the edge of campus was pinged by an IP address in Nigeria. A split second later, a small business owner in Laos received a canned response from the Anahata customer service team.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"0816\" name=\"0816\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Thanks for your email!

He sat against the wall, head propped against its prickly stucco surface. He appeared malnourished and sickly, exhaustion gathering like puddles under his eyes. He closed his eyes to nap, a smile lingering on his face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c65b\" name=\"c65b\">In the building below him, a TV ran in the background of an empty lounge. Images of burning storefronts and rioting youths crossed the screen, captioned with the words, \u201cPyrrhia upheaval.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8ef2\" name=\"8ef2\">But the employees in Building 1 were too busy to bother with TV. They had been alternating work on Project Y with hours of Social Me fun\u200a\u2014\u200ainvestigations of moon rock composition with explorations of the differences in C and D bra cups. They were finding it difficult to concentrate on their main task, and they weren\u2019t the only ones.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"422f\" name=\"422f\">A man and a woman on the Genie team sat side by side in their cubicle, using Social Me to flirt with each other. Eventually the man worked up the courage to ask the girl to visit the squid tank with him in the main building. For an hour, they stood before the squid as it bobbed among the kelp, the two of them moving closer and closer together until their hands touched.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a064\" name=\"a064\">Two buildings away, a man and woman who had been working together on the Internet Sombrero project made out in the second-floor stairwell, their Internet Sombrero headphones plugged into their ears, piping in songs that matched their moods\u200a\u2014\u200aromantic saxophone sounds for her, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Thong Song</em> for him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"af1b\" name=\"af1b\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Thong Song</em> was also playing in the marketing department, where Roni had unleashed a fresh pheromone dump and cut the air conditioning. Timed to the beat, the women peeled off their prim cardigans and blazers, swung their chairs to face their purses, and reached for their phones. Their well-manicured nails tapped on the engineers\u2019 Social Me profiles. They smiled. And tapped again. And again. Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b119\" name=\"b119\">Down the hall from them, Jennie hummed a Grateful Dead song as she made her way to the smoothie bar.

With a groan that came neither from pain nor alcohol but rather a long, uncomfortable sleep, he pushed himself up onto his elbows and surveyed his surroundings. He was in a dusty motel room with one small window above his bed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e9ff\" name=\"e9ff\">He moved his hand to his head and ruffled his blond, uncombed hair, as though checking to see if it was still there. He touched his face and felt the slightest beginnings of a beard, his thin, slow-growing hairs jutting out like sharp grass across his chin and cheeks. He studied his hands, smooth and unharmed except for faint bracelet-like marks around his wrists. He was wearing a windbreaker that was covered in mud, partly obscuring an Anahata logo at the top right-hand corner. He glanced at his watch\u200a\u2014\u200ait was a long time since he last remembered doing anything or being in any particular place.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7027\" name=\"7027\">The man peered out the window and saw a dry, unfamiliar landscape below him. He ran to his door and initially touched the knob with caution, as though afraid it might be electrified. But it opened without incident, and he slowly poked his head out into the hall. A squat woman wearing a simple dress was entering what appeared to be a communal bathroom, mop in hand. She nodded hello with disinterest. On the floor next to his door was an English-language newspaper. Written across the front page was a headline:</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"0d31\" name=\"0d31\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png\" data-height=\"106\" data-image-id=\"1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"00f4\" name=\"00f4\">The word \u201cAnahata\u201d triggered something in him, and he suddenly remembered a basement and a bottle of wine. He scanned the rest of the article, but, like the headline, it was in English\u200a\u2014\u200aa language he did not fully understand. His eyes studied the date: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">May 15</em>.

But he could not make sense of the text.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e084\" name=\"e084\">The man returned to his cot, unsure of his next move. He suddenly became aware of the midday heat\u200a\u2014\u200aa strong, dry heat that reminded him of the desert. Removing his windbreaker, he felt something lightly jabbing at him from an interior pocket.

It made him worry that Korpeko no longer considered him a threat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4fed\" name=\"4fed\">A secret code name for the TRC, while annoying, at least confirmed his relevance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"07c2\" name=\"07c2\">\u201cSo, where are my legions of the reckoning?\u201d Arsyen asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ddf3\" name=\"ddf3\">\u201cOh\u2026around,\u201d said the chief strategist, waving his hand in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy for them to move about.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2078\" name=\"2078\">\u201cOf course,\u201d Arsyen nodded. \u201cThey must be careful.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f2e6\" name=\"f2e6\">\u201cSoon, Your Highness, you will take back the country,\u201d the chief strategist said. \u201cBut first, please take a seat and recover from your long journey. Some of your greatest supporters have come to welcome you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e04\" name=\"7e04\">The strategist ushered Arsyen to a high armchair that required him to jump slightly in order to seat himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c3fc\" name=\"c3fc\">Arsyen leaned back in the stiff-backed chair, a poor-man\u2019s replica of his father\u2019s throne, tall and red and not particularly comfortable, with pearls of human molars studding the arms. Arsyen was certain the teeth were fake.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f9a0\" name=\"f9a0\">Arsyen gazed down at the TRC members.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fd80\" name=\"fd80\">\u201dBring my subjects to me,\u201d he said, with a snap of the fingers that was both dismissive and demanding.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39c2\" name=\"39c2\">He was pleased to see how easily the imperial gestures were returning to him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0b5a\" name=\"0b5a\">Over the next hour, Arsyen was hand-fed prunes by the TRC secretary while the committee presented him to all the Aimo familiars they could round up\u200a\u2014\u200athe ones who weren\u2019t dead or in exile, which meant about six. Without exception, they were all terribly old; at least two of them didn\u2019t seem to know where they were.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e3b8\" name=\"e3b8\">They all flashed some sign of wealth\u200a\u2014\u200aan ivory knife, a shawl made of Embrian hair, or a bison\u2019s head cap\u200a\u2014\u200aas though it were a special code, a signal to Arsyen that he too would have the good life once he retook what was rightfully his.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3477\" name=\"3477\">But now that Arsyen had lived in Silicon Valley, he knew what real wealth looked like. Real wealth had jet-like yachts and yacht-like jets and didn\u2019t bother with ivory knives or Embrian hair shawls unless they were part of an orgy with supermodels. Real wealth wouldn\u2019t be interested in a bison head cap unless it was a bison shot during an environmentally sustainable safari involving kite surfing and volunteerism with a local tribal community.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"90e3\" name=\"90e3\">Watching the display of small-time wealth before him, Arsyen decided that when he was back in power he would make his country\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least himself\u200a\u2014\u200aSilicon Valley rich.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4952\" name=\"4952\">Nevertheless, Prince Arsyen smiled politely at his subjects\u2019 riches and stories and fabricated ones of his own in order to live up to the grandeur they imagined of his life in California. He spoke to them of pools and barbecues, of electric cars and Japanese toilets that cleaned one\u2019s bottom in a way that was at first invasive, then incredibly comforting.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2c55\" name=\"2c55\">\u201cWhat are Americans like?\u201d asked an old man who had come with his wife.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"07dc\" name=\"07dc\">\u201cThere is food everywhere,\u201d Arsyen said, \u201cand land for as far as the eye can see. The food rests atop the land, and the people gorge themselves upon it. Each home has a pool\u200a\u2014\u200anot for swimming, but rather for cleaning. And the people are so rich they do not ever need to move\u200a\u2014\u200athey just sit all day.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f57\" name=\"8f57\">The man and his wife smiled in unison, their gold teeth lined ear to ear like rotted corn. Arsyen felt his stomach turn. Once he was in power, he would fix the teeth of his people\u2026or at least the teeth of the richest, most beautiful women.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0b9b\" name=\"0b9b\">\u201cPrince Arsyen,\u201d his chief strategist said, \u201cmay we present to you some of your most valiant soldiers: Novasglod, Trodol, and Pogol.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6c5a\" name=\"6c5a\">Arsyen leaned forward in his chair, straining his eyes to discern the warriors emerging from the shadows.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bcee\" name=\"bcee\">The first, Novasglod, was pruned and puckered. She leaned heavily on her cane and had difficulty recovering from her bow before the prince.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bdb5\" name=\"bdb5\">The second, Trodol, seemed even older. Trodol had fought Korpeko\u2019s men as they stormed the imperial palace. He was missing his right leg and left ear and wheezed with each breath.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5498\" name=\"5498\">Arsyen turned his attention to the third man. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"476f\" name=\"476f\">Although standing before Arsyen, the man\u2019s face was turned away from the prince.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"429b\" name=\"429b\">\u201cPogol is a blind mute,\u201d the chief strategist whispered in Arsyen\u2019s ear. \u201cHe has been very involved with recruiting new followers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"61f5\" name=\"61f5\">Arsyen frowned. He hoped there would not be too many others like Pogol\u200a\u2014\u200aa blind mute just wasn\u2019t the face of youthful vitality that he wanted to project to the masses.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5380\" name=\"5380\">After a minute of pleasantries, Arsyen had the three supporters escorted away. This took several minutes, as none were adept at climbing the basement stairs. Arsyen watched their slow progress with impatience. Having to wait on other people was such an annoyance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"03aa\" name=\"03aa\">\u201cEnough!\u201d he cried when the door finally shut behind them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6e53\" name=\"6e53\">The TRC rushed forward in a crawling bow.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a1e7\" name=\"a1e7\">\u201cWe have much work to do, and it is time to discuss our attack.

He surveyed the four members before him. If he beheaded one of them, it would be an example to the others. But which one?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8326\" name=\"8326\">\u201cPrince Arsyen, you have nothing to worry about.

Everywhere.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8511\" name=\"8511\">Arsyen threw up his hands. But then he had an idea.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fd0b\" name=\"fd0b\">\u201cI know a revolutionary,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"42d9\" name=\"42d9\">\u201cRevolutionaries? You don\u2019t want to fall in with them,\u201d the chief strategist said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e1d7\" name=\"e1d7\">\u201cCommunists, likely,\u201d his wife said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4fe7\" name=\"4fe7\">\u201cNatia is the good type of revolutionary,\u201d Arsyen said. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s a woman. Women get a bit bored and need something to talk about, and that\u2019s how they fall into these things. My father always said that female revolutionaries are only revolutionaries until they\u2019re pregnant. Anyway, I think I know where she is\u200a\u2014\u200aat Sklartar\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"505b\" name=\"505b\">\u201cImpossible,\u201d said the treasurer. \u201cSklartar\u2019s home burned down during the coup.

Our army at the convalescent home will help us spread the word. Just give us a moment to discuss the plan.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45be\" name=\"45be\">The chief strategist waved the committee members closer, forming a tight ball of gray, weathered faces.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b318\" name=\"b318\">\u201cWe could have our army go house to house,\u201d Arsyen heard the chief strategist say. \u201cThe wheelchairs can cover a lot of ground in a day.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"057c\" name=\"057c\">\u201cWhat about a subversive theater performance?\u201d said another.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b16e\" name=\"b16e\">Arsyen shook his head. He had forgotten how useless old people were. Silicon Valley was right to ban them\u200a\u2014\u200ayouth and entrepreneurial daring were so much more important than experience.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"611b\" name=\"611b\">He shifted in his uncomfortable throne and felt his mobile phone dig into his thigh. He thought of his GaltPage. How many followers had joined Justice for Poodlekek since he last checked? Probably millions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"47d3\" name=\"47d3\">His supporters were waiting for him. They were his people. Young people. Innovators and disruptors.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"45ed\" name=\"45ed\">Arsyen slid off the chair and slipped up the stairs.

He wasn\u2019t sure she would be there, but Sklartar\u2019s old home was now a police station, and the police would surely arrest him on sight if he went there.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5c6f\" name=\"5c6f\">Natia\u2019s apartment was in a crumbling, 1970\u2019s-era building. Arsyen climbed three flights of stairs and could hear several voices coming from behind her door. He peered through a half-inch gap in the curtains of her front window. It was hard to make anything out, but it seemed there were several people, none of them in police uniform.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d412\" name=\"d412\">Arsyen knocked twice and within seconds Natia was there, staring back at him, as surprised by him as he was by the realness of her. He processed each bit of her separately\u200a\u2014\u200athe flushed cheeks, the long nose, the green eyes, the mole on the chin, the sturdy neck. Natia cut off his inspection with a hug.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9b16\" name=\"9b16\">\u201cI knew the email wasn\u2019t true! I knew you would come!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"35c0\" name=\"35c0\">Inside the cramped apartment were several other men. These were the strong, young Pyrrhian men he needed to retake his country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"257a\" name=\"257a\">\u201cWe\u2019re taking the city back!\u201d Natia said to Arsyen, pushing him toward the center of the room, where everyone was gathered around a man with a map. Arsyen wondered if this was Niels_1973.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"82a3\" name=\"82a3\">The man registered the arrival of the new visitor, his eyes flicking between Natia and Arsyen. The chance that Natia had perhaps been unfaithful crossed Arsyen\u2019s mind, but he pushed it away. What mattered was that he was there now, finally united with his beloved and ready to lead his people.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b1c\" name=\"7b1c\">Natia gripped his arm and unloaded all of the government\u2019s latest atrocities\u200a\u2014\u200athe cover-ups, the corruption, the \u201cshackles of oppression.\u201d As Natia spoke, Arsyen surveyed the room. The men seemed to be poor students and artists. They were well into their twenties, but there was no gold in their mouths. Their sweaters had holes in them. By California standards\u200a\u2014\u200abarring Berkeley, where a similar look was widely adopted by the citizenry\u200a\u2014\u200athe men appeared homeless.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"11cc\" name=\"11cc\">\u201cYou!\u201d said the man with the map, suddenly rising to his feet and shaking his finger at Arsyen. \u201cYou are Prince Arsyen!

His father would have been proud. Arsyen had just converted the very people who wanted to destroy his family\u200a\u2014\u200aand there were still thousands of his real supporters he could call on. He watched with satisfaction as Vgad put down his poker and turned to the other men.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"918b\" name=\"918b\">\u201cCome, we must finish our planning. We don\u2019t have time for these distractions.\u201d He beckoned the men to his map.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"802b\" name=\"802b\">Arsyen turned to Natia and tried to speak, but his military bluster did not translate to suave courtship. If only he could have a few minutes alone with her before they started their revolution. She was speaking to him, but it sounded like his Justice for Poodlekek page. Injustice. Injustice. Blah. Blah. It mattered, of course, but he really wished she\u2019d pay a bit more attention to his needs. Injustice would be there tomorrow and the next day; they could solve it then. Arsyen would eventually have to teach her that you can\u2019t really be a queen without allowing\u200a\u2014\u200aeven encouraging\u200a\u2014\u200aa bit of injustice in your kingdom.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1d09\" name=\"1d09\">But Natia continued to speak, urging him, touching his shoulder. She blushed whenever their gaze crossed and would occasionally let her hand drift to touch his.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c8a6\" name=\"c8a6\">Vgad periodically looked over at the two of them, using each opportunity to glare at Arsyen, who likewise sized up his competition. Vgad seemed as poor as the rest of them, and his clothes were standard-issue Red Cross, but he had clear eyes and a thick beard\u200a\u2014\u200athe trademark signs of Pyrrhian virility. Arsyen touched his own chin and felt the short stubble of two days without shaving. Vgad stood and addressed the group.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7d18\" name=\"7d18\">\u201cWe are ready to whistle.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d131\" name=\"d131\">\u201cWhistle?\u201d said Arsyen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4d81\" name=\"4d81\">\u201cIt\u2019s how we protest,\u201d Natia whispered. \u201cWe walk through the streets whistling in peaceful protest.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"00da\" name=\"00da\">Arsyen frowned. \u201cBut how does whistling\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ce51\" name=\"ce51\">\u201cComrade Natia,\u201d Vgad called from across the room, \u201clet\u2019s not waste anymore time. We have a plan\u200a\u2014\u200awith or without this pathetic prince. I for one have decided to whistle at the military barracks.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0bc7\" name=\"0bc7\">A tear fell from Natia\u2019s eye. \u201cYou are so brave, Comrade Vgad.\u201d She stepped toward him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"642d\" name=\"642d\">\u201cThe barracks are a very dangerous spot,\u201d said Vgad, his eyes meeting Arsyen\u2019s as he extended his hand to Natia. \u201cIt takes a brave man to whistle at the barracks.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"89b7\" name=\"89b7\">Arsyen saw them then, Natia and Vgad, their lips pursed at the barracks, exchanging whistles, then caresses, and then final, gasping breaths as they dodged and were ultimately hit by Korpeko\u2019s bullets. They would die in each other\u2019s arms. He felt his insides begin to shake, as though Natia were being pulled from his very marrow.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ff11\" name=\"ff11\">\u201cAnd I, Prince\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, Comrade Arsyen, will whistle at the imperial palace!\u201d declared Arsyen, raising his fist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"935c\" name=\"935c\">The room went silent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b290\" name=\"b290\">\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Natia rushed back to Arsyen\u2019s side. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t planned to whistle at the imperial palace just yet. There\u2019s a protest there tonight, but it will certainly be heavily guarded.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"743c\" name=\"743c\">\u201cThe protest is the protest of my people. There must be justice for Poodlekek!\u201d Arsyen cried.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e559\" name=\"e559\">Within minutes, Arsyen found himself equipped with a flag and a megaphone and was being pushed out the door by the group. He needed to find a moment to talk to Natia about his plans for them, but she kept pushing him forward as their group made its way down the stairs. She and twenty others would be accompanying him to the protest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5614\" name=\"5614\">\u201dMy army,\u201d said Arsyen, sweeping his hand across the group when they were all on the street.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"caca\" name=\"caca\">\u201cWe are the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">people\u2019s</em> army,\u201d Vgad growled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9810\" name=\"9810\">The sky had begun to fade into evening, and the streets were deserted. But as his eyes adjusted to the unlit streets, Arsyen began to spot shadowy figures darting between houses, moving in parallel to their group\u2019s own movements. They crept like thieves, jumping from one building to the next.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2860\" name=\"2860\">\u201cMembers of the resistance,\u201d Natia whispered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f196\" name=\"f196\">Soon Arsyen could spot the imperial palace in the distance. Even from several blocks away, the architect\u2019s abuse of classical architecture was apparent, with row after row of Corinthian columns surrounding the palace like rotting teeth. Marble flowers and peacocks adorned the Greek capitals, but the passing of years had weathered their relief, and it now seemed the fruit was eating the birds, swallowing the plumage in their mighty petals. Arsyen would have to rebuild everything.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"28bb\" name=\"28bb\">As they turned onto the imperial road, Arsyen gasped. Thousands of people were gathered in front of the palace. People carried signs bearing the words of Arsyen\u2019s new comrades.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3ee0\" name=\"3ee0\">\u201cGive us our land!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"67b6\" name=\"67b6\">\u201cSpeak the truth!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4ccd\" name=\"4ccd\">\u201cJustice for Poodlekek! Justice for Pyrrhia!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"98f7\" name=\"98f7\">Arsyen made his way through the crowd. New faces huddled around Natia and the other members of the group, pointing at Arsyen and pressing them with questions Arsyen couldn\u2019t hear. It was just as the TRC had told him. His people were there for him, urging him forward.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ff3\" name=\"9ff3\">Asyen and Natia pushed their way to the front. A group of women swarmed around them\u200a\u2014\u200amothers perhaps, their white handkerchiefs fluttering like anxious doves across their faces. \u201cHelp us!\u201d they cried, grasping Arsyen\u2019s hands.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e81\" name=\"3e81\">Natia pulled out a plastic recorder and played a few notes. All of the chatter ceased as people joined hands and began to whistle\u200a\u2014\u200aa rapid blast of tweets, coupled with the occasional errant showtune. Arsyen joined in by whistling the tune to his favorite video games.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5814\" name=\"5814\">The whistling spread across the crowd, and now everyone was doing it, whistling and swaying, and then Arsyen felt himself pushed forward, the crowd moving up the steps in a wave. They moved forward again, and then he fell and was lifted up and suddenly was perched on one of the comrade\u2019s shoulders, carried higher and higher until he was on the top step, looking out onto the derelict landscape of his city, onto the faces of his people. They stared back at him, lips pursed like fish, and he heard Natia\u2019s voice in his ear. \u201cWhistle, Arsyen, whistle! Let them hear the voice of the revolution!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"484a\" name=\"484a\">Arsyen ferociously pumped air through his lips as his girlfriend helped him off her ox-like shoulders. His eyes raced across the crowd, then over them, toward the city gates, looking for the Throne Reclamation Committee or someone who would tell him what to do next.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dad\" name=\"3dad\">Someone emerged from the crowd with a megaphone and handed it to Natia. Natia held up her hand to silence the crowd. \u201cThis man speaks for our hearts,\u201d she said, pointing to Arsyen. \u201cHe is the one who will bring justice to Poodlekek!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2878\" name=\"2878\">She surprised Arsyen with a kiss on the lips, a short but mighty kiss in which Arsyen saw fireworks explode across the sky, alighting his heart and the dreams of thousands of Pyrrhians. The crowd cheered. Then Natia pushed him forward and pressed the megaphone into his hands. The crowd threw up their arms.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3380\" name=\"3380\">\u201cSpeak!\u201d they shouted. \u201cSpeak!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7706\" name=\"7706\">Arsyen looked into the sea of faces and saw himself, people who looked like less handsome versions of him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8ebc\" name=\"8ebc\">Arsyen spoke. His lips were moving and a voice was speaking, but he was not there. It was not his voice, his mouth, or his brain that spoke. It was not his father\u2019s voice, or the voice of the TRC, or any voice Arsyen had ever imagined in any daydream of the throne. It was a stranger\u2019s voice, repeating what Arsyen had seen on his Justice for Poodlekek page\u200a\u2014\u200athe same invectives, the same charges against the government. With each squeeze of Natia\u2019s hand, Arsyen\u2019s calls for revolt grew stronger, and the cheers likewise grew in intensity. His people loved him, and he would give them more of what they wanted to hear.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b600\" name=\"b600\">\u201cIt is time for a new social order,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us rid our country of fancy palaces, of wealthy, corrupt landowners, and empty curling lanes. Pyrrhians unite! Comrades, we have nothing to lose but our chains!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9aaf\" name=\"9aaf\">The crowd roared and then surged, rushing toward the entrance of the imperial palace. What a wonderful thing to be one with one\u2019s people, Arsyen thought. To be a comrade.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b13e\" name=\"b13e\">\u201cLong live comrade-ism!\u201d he cried.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5573\" name=\"5573\">They tried to climb the tall gates, rattling the cage that housed the acropolis, kicking at the guards as they thrust their bayonets through the rails. Arsyen felt a strong arm pull him away from Natia, their hands separating as she screamed. He felt a sharp pain in his side, and then something against his head, and then nothing at all for a long time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e720\" name=\"e720\">When he awoke, Arsyen was in a dank cell lit by suspended torches. His supporters were nowhere in sight. He was completely alone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8324\" name=\"8324\">Maybe this hadn\u2019t been such a good idea.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"02db\" name=\"02db\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"a671\" name=\"a671\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"ae7f\" name=\"ae7f\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">G</span>regor studied Anahata\u2019s head of security as he briefed the group, his gaze moving from one member of the management team to the next, collecting their worried expressions with thinly masked delight. But Gregor refused to join in. He would save his concern and attention for when it mattered. None of this had any consequence unless Bobby joined the conversation. And for that, Bobby would need to wake up. Instead, every few minutes, a loud snore, like someone suffocating a pig, came from his end of the table.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"afe9\" name=\"afe9\">Gregor\u2019s mobile buzzed in his pocket with an update. It was yet another story about Anahata\u2019s share price.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"410a\" name=\"410a\">Anahata Shares Continue to Fall Over Moon Colony\u00a0Rumors</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"bfd2\" name=\"bfd2\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">News Wire News, 9:43 a.m. EST, May 21\u200a\u2014\u200aAnahata stock fell a further 5 percent today, marking a week in which the Palo Alto\u2013based internet firm shaved more than $300 from its share price in the wake of widespread investor belief that the company is losing focus.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e863\" name=\"e863\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The problem began earlier this month after a former senior executive, Niels Smeardon, claimed on social broadcasting site Flitter that the software giant was building a moon colony.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"82b8\" name=\"82b8\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">In a blog post issued in response, Anahata said Smeardon had already left the company at the time of his fleet, suggesting that the comments on Flitter were the work of a disgruntled employee. This morning, Smeardon posted a retraction of his moon colony comment on Flitter, stating he was sorry for any confusion. He said there was not any moon colony on Anahata and that his account had been hacked. Calls to Smeardon were not returned.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c120\" name=\"c120\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u201cThere is no Anahata colony today on the moon,\u201d an Anahata spokeswoman said.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c915\" name=\"c915\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Analysts, however, were skeptical.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"96ff\" name=\"96ff\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u201cMoon colonies just aren\u2019t a part of Anahata\u2019s core business,\u201d said Mark Roberts, an analyst with Sterling Platinum Capital. \u201cThe market wants to see more focus on Anahata\u2019s strongest products and advertising services\u200a\u2014\u200anot money being thrown at \u2018pie-in-the-sky\u2019 projects.

Maybe this is it for them.\u201d</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f868\" name=\"f868\">Gregor flipped to the next article. Galt had just released an update to the productivity tool they had copied from Anahata. The company had only just released it, what, a month ago? And already it had an update. Gregor couldn\u2019t help but admire Galt\u2019s speed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"544d\" name=\"544d\">He glanced again at Bobby. The founder slept at the head of the table, head thrown back, mouth open. It reminded Gregor of the war movies he watched as a child with his father, in which rain collected in the mouths of dead soldiers as the battle raged around them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e33\" name=\"4e33\">Gregor had never been interested in the company\u2019s financial affairs, but he had sat in enough management meetings over the years to have developed some sense of pecuniary trouble. He wondered what Fischer, Anahata\u2019s CFCAO, really thought about Anahata\u2019s share price. Bobby refused to discuss it and had told Fischer to keep his investor relations and PR teams from saying anything more about Niels or the moon to the outside world. The only thing he had approved was the retraction published that morning on Flitter by \u201cNiels,\u201d courtesy of the Progressa team. But even that effort had been lost amid the cacophony of investor and journalist voices predicting the company\u2019s downfall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fad8\" name=\"fad8\">\u201cLike the tide ebbs and flows, the stock moves up and down,\u201d Bobby had said in response. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t move one way, it couldn\u2019t move the other, and then there\u2019d be no point in having a stock market at all.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7fcf\" name=\"7fcf\">A <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">thud</em> suddenly sounded from the other end of the room. And then again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d5c5\" name=\"d5c5\">The head of security dropped a small, weighted beanbag a third time on the table, this time with even more force.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5bfe\" name=\"5bfe\">\u201cBlood! Guts! Swords! Chariots!\u201d he yelled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c6ee\" name=\"c6ee\">Bobby\u2019s eyes flew open, and for a brief second his arms flailed as though he were in a free-fall. His head darted around the room.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"81bb\" name=\"81bb\">\u201cWhere?

He quickly distributed enlarged photos, placing one directly in front of Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ca19\" name=\"ca19\">\u201cThis is where we believe he\u2019s being held\u200a\u2014\u200athe imperial palace.\u201d He pointed to a high-resolution aerial shot of a brown, acropolis-like structure. It sat atop a small hill, a large hunk of columns chomping down on the land like angry jaws.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0d5a\" name=\"0d5a\">\u201cHow can we be certain he\u2019s there?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cAnd who\u2019s \u2018he\u2019?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"27f1\" name=\"27f1\">Old Al sighed audibly.

He\u2019s been taken prisoner in his native Pyrrhia.

In my day, we would have hired only Americans to work in America.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dedd\" name=\"dedd\">The head of security allowed a moment of silence out of respect for the wisdom of the aged, then restarted his briefing from the top. This time, Gregor listened.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71c5\" name=\"71c5\">According to the security head, Arsyen hadn\u2019t badged into anywhere on campus in more than a week, though his own team had never reported him missing. Security had been alerted by his former manager, a guy named Roni, whom Arsyen had contacted, asking for help buying horses.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3d20\" name=\"3d20\">\u201cHorses?\u201d asked Bobby. \u201cOne of our product managers asked for horses?

I want the special long-sleeved, fireproof shirts we discussed, the ones with the purple Anahata logo and the little trees sprouting out of the H.

This wasn\u2019t just a battle to free an inconsequential country. If Anahata could succeed in overthrowing the government, Bobby was convinced the company would see a democracy uptick in its stock price.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8c85\" name=\"8c85\">Under Gregor\u2019s direction, Anahata\u2019s infrastructure engineers harnessed all their skills\u200a\u2014\u200aIP prestidigitation, networked hot-air balloons, Wi-Fi-enabled squirrels\u200a\u2014\u200ato work around the government\u2019s block and make the internet accessible again in Poodlekek.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d25\" name=\"9d25\">The search engineers created a new ranking algorithm, designed to ensure that negative articles about the despotic government would appear in the topmost position of Pyrrhia\u2019s search results. Immolated monks, raped women, limbless elderly, and dead orphans would all be listed on the first page for any number of search queries, with graphic images and tales of atrocity immediately leaping to the eyes of anyone searching for even the most innocent information. Even if the government managed to keep the internet down in Poodlekek, Anahata would flood the rest of the country with the reranked results. If previous Anahata revolutions were any indication, the incendiary results would incite unrest elsewhere in the country, eventually leading to revolt and a total collapse of the government. A new, progressive leader would take over, Arsyen would be freed, and the world would celebrate the triumph of democracy and Anahata.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fef8\" name=\"fef8\">For eight hours, the Moodify team worked to build a new Pyrrhian search engine, going through thirty cans of Red Bull, twenty bags of Anahata\u2019s signature organic potato chips, and trying their best to ignore the beckoning Circean pings from their Social Me app.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf67\" name=\"bf67\">Finally, in the darkest hours of morning, taurine and glucose dripping from their pores, they reached the last, dramatic step. The team typed in the final line of code. The cursor blinked back at them, pulsing like an explosive light. They turned to Gregor, who gave them the nod.

His ears hung like drooping question marks. A flat, expansive nose dominated his face as though a manifestation of his own imperial ambitions. The bones of his fingers popped in and out of their joints as his pudgy hands moved across his desk, sometimes reaching for a paper, other times for his porcelain teacup.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"09bc\" name=\"09bc\">The president leaned toward Arsyen, his pale, pockmarked face punctuated by bursts of red veins. Arsyen met his gaze and jutted out his chin but hardly felt so confident. He wiggled his hands behind his back, trying to loosen the ropes, but they seemed to grow tighter the more he squirmed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5df4\" name=\"5df4\">It occurred to Arsyen that the president might kill him. He was the exiled prince, after all. And while he had no desire to die, any outcome less than that was slightly insulting to someone of Arsyen\u2019s standing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e8e5\" name=\"e8e5\">But none of this was really his fault, and Arsyen hadn\u2019t truly intended to take back the throne just yet. It had just been an idea\u200a\u2014\u200aa passing fancy brought about by the intoxicating influence of the internet. Perhaps Arsyen could offer up the Throne Reclamation Committee in his place. Korpeko could save face, do a nice Sunday execution jamboree of the committee leaders, and everyone could go on their merry way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b8a3\" name=\"b8a3\">Arsyen\u2019s thoughts turned to Natia.

Perhaps he would never know.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"336f\" name=\"336f\">An aide tiptoed toward General Korpeko. The president\u2019s head cocked like a teapot to receive the whispered briefing. This had been the routine for the past ten minutes: a thirty-second briefing from an aide, a long study of Arsyen\u2019s face, then the arrival of a new aide and his news. Finally, after several minutes, the general addressed his prisoner.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e09\" name=\"7e09\">\u201cWell, Prince Arsyen?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"471c\" name=\"471c\">\u201cLook,\u201d Arsyen said, \u201cPyrrhia doesn\u2019t interest me.

It was clear that Korpeko would not be won over easily.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f28\" name=\"9f28\">Arsyen grimaced as he lowered himself from the chair to the ground to perform the traditional Pyrrhian bow\u200a\u2014\u200anose to the ground, fanny pointed skyward. It was a humiliating posture for a prince, and he knelt only long enough for Korpeko to register his submission. Then he sat back on his heels.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"482d\" name=\"482d\">\u201cPlease let me go,\u201d said Arsyen, his head still bowed. \u201cI promise you\u2019ll have no more trouble from me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8e3b\" name=\"8e3b\">\u201cSilence!\u201d said Korpeko, throwing his teacup past Arsyen\u2019s head, shattering it against the opposite wall. From his belt he pulled a gleaming Pyrrhian lobate blade, slicing the air with a swish.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b64e\" name=\"b64e\">A guard materialized and yanked Arsyen to his feet, only to then knock his legs out from under him. Arsyen fell and landed squarely on his hip. He howled, but no one cared. The president already seemed to have turned his attention elsewhere. He was conferring with someone new, a man Arsyen recognized as Colonel Okonkwi, Korpeko\u2019s right hand. Colonel Okonkwi\u2019s face was red and he sputtered as he spoke. A storm moved across the president\u2019s face, his eyes flicking rapidly between the two men.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6e0c\" name=\"6e0c\">Colonel Okonkwi gestured at a black screen occupying most of the wall opposite the president\u2019s desk. An aide pushed a button, and the screen was suddenly illuminated in white. He typed something into a device, and an Anahata search box appeared, the purple-and-green logo bouncing gently on the page. He then typed \u201cPyrrhia\u201d and hit the search button.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f449\" name=\"f449\">The president gasped. The first result accused the president of sleeping with dogs. The second charged his top advisers with corruption. The third was an unfortunate photo of him vomiting at a state dinner.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c553\" name=\"c553\">\u201cSearch for something else,\u201d the president ordered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dcec\" name=\"dcec\">The aide tried \u201cgovernment,\u201d then \u201celections,\u201d then \u201chealthy recipes for weight loss.\u201d But no matter what the query, the results seemed to be skewed, designed to show the worst of President Korpeko and his officials. Arsyen watched as the rigged search results cascaded down the screen. One result in particular seemed to catch the president\u2019s attention. It first appeared as the tenth result, then, within seconds, as the aide performed subsequent searches, the result moved up the list, gaining in popularity as a nation of Pyrrhians clicked to read its damning evidence\u200a\u2014\u200aa birth certificate suggesting that President Korpeko was not actually Pyrrhian but Embrian. In a manner of minutes, it was the top search result, no matter what the query.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55ac\" name=\"55ac\">The president\u2019s officials gazed at their leader and took a step back. Only Colonel Okonkwi, the president\u2019s longtime confidant, remained where he stood, his face hardening.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e091\" name=\"e091\">\u201cThis is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">your </em>fault,\u201d said the colonel, turning to Arsyen. \u201cYou are a traitor to your country.\u201d He turned to Korpeko. \u201cWhat shall we do with him?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5cfe\" name=\"5cfe\">The president, his eyes fixed on the screen, didn\u2019t answer. The colonel leaned in and repeated the question.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1311\" name=\"1311\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said the president finally, his voice almost inaudible.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8257\" name=\"8257\">\u201cTo the gallows!\u201d the colonel shouted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"70a1\" name=\"70a1\">The guard dragged Arsyen out the door, hauling him down a short corridor and then down four steep steps. The opulent tapestries and gold-plated furniture of the upper floor gave way to a dingier space sparsely populated with shabby chairs and cupboards.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"09d9\" name=\"09d9\">\u201cThe dungeon\u2019s full today, so the old kitchen will have to do for now,\u201d the guard said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d2eb\" name=\"d2eb\">Arsyen limped toward the room\u2019s sole chair, his hip throbbing after his fall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8905\" name=\"8905\">The guard walked over to the far end of the kitchen and opened what appeared to be a freezer stuffed with ice packs. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky we have these,\u201d he said, tossing a few at Arsyen. \u201cThe president has repetitive strain injury from curling, so we keep them stockpiled here. Throw one on your hip\u200a\u2014\u200awe don\u2019t want people thinking we tortured you before we killed you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"54a3\" name=\"54a3\">The guard shut the door and turned the key on the other side. Arsyen\u2019s eyes scanned the room. There were no windows and just a single door. The room was so dusty that he found himself sneezing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa87\" name=\"aa87\">The guard returned in a few minutes with a cold potato and some salt and sugar.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cf0c\" name=\"cf0c\">\u201cColonel Okonkwi wants to squeeze you into the noon executions. You\u2019re lucky, really\u200a\u2014\u200athe waiting list is long and the dungeon tends to make people\u2019s limbs rot. Enjoy your last few hours.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd26\" name=\"bd26\">Then the guard left, locking the door behind him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"392a\" name=\"392a\">Arsyen stared at the potato and pushed the plate away. Just a few days before, he had been in sunny California; now he was about to be executed for doing something that he only sort of intended to do, for a girl he barely knew, but for whom, even in this dark moment, he still pined.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d7b5\" name=\"d7b5\">Arsyen studied the kitchen\u200a\u2014\u200athe chipped white cabinets and dusty floor, an old broom resting against the fridge. Of all the ironies\u200a\u2014\u200athe prince turned janitor back in his palace, held prisoner in the filthiest spot.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7413\" name=\"7413\">So much dirt surrounded him. And without Arsyen, who would clean it up?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22cb\" name=\"22cb\">Arsyen had never loved being a janitor, but he recognized the importance of the job: Someone had to clean up the messes people made each day. All those men in the Valley went about building their riches and never looked back to see what filth they had left behind. They needed people like Arsyen to sweep things away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"655b\" name=\"655b\">And so it was, then, just hours from death, that Arsyen wondered why, with all the extraordinary brain power in Silicon Valley today, no engineer had ever tackled the fundamental human problem of dirt. Dirt affected everyone; dirt was democratic. Dirt scaled, dirt climbed, dirt 10x\u2019d everything it could. And there was so very, very much that lay below the surface of things. Arsyen vowed that if he somehow made it out of the palace alive, he would take the problem straight to Bobby Bonilo.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e6fa\" name=\"e6fa\">Arsyen felt his stomach rumble. The rumble turned to a growl, and he reconsidered the potato the guard had left him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"52c0\" name=\"52c0\">Arsyen sprinkled the potato with salt and took a bite. He wrinkled his nose and spit it out\u200a\u2014\u200athere was something wrong with that salt. He poured a bit into his hand and tasted it cautiously with his tongue. It looked like salt, but it wasn\u2019t salt. It was\u2026saltpeter? Totally useless as a salt seasoning, but it had proven useful in a pinch during Arsyen\u2019s cleaning experiments.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f1d\" name=\"8f1d\">Arsyen paused: Would God let him experiment with chemicals in heaven? Could he continue to work his Aimo Air Freshener there? Would Arsyen be a janitor or a king in heaven? Could he be a king if there was God?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f1e4\" name=\"f1e4\">Arsyen pushed away the plate and salt shaker.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"470b\" name=\"470b\">But a second later, they were back in front of him. Arsyen stared at the potato, then looked at the salt shaker, his mind spinning. Could it be?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d9e\" name=\"9d9e\">His gaze moved across the table, from the saltpeter, over to the sugar, and finally to his ice pack. He smiled for the first time in hours. From his jeans pocket, he pulled out a small heart-shaped bottle\u200a\u2014\u200athe Aimo Air Freshener he had planned to give Natia. And then he waited for the guard to return.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"6f6a\" name=\"6f6a\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\" id=\"bcd7\" name=\"bcd7\">Korpeko and\u00a0Okonkwi</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h3\" id=\"b9a0\" name=\"b9a0\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">In</span> the lavish command room of the imperial palace, the extent of the damage to Pyrrhia\u2019s internet was quickly becoming clear to the president and his colonel.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ab03\" name=\"ab03\">News of unrest in the capital had quickly spread throughout the country. In the city of Kolkikek, a man searching for a chat room was directed to a blog post about the government\u2019s cover-up of the train crash. In Pokikek, a woman searching for information on curling techniques was taken to a list of the government\u2019s excessive expenditures on exotic birds. In Krakikek, a college student researching European history was redirected to a video of the demonstration outside the imperial palace. It wasn\u2019t long before Klokikek, Pokikek, and Krakikek\u200a\u2014\u200aand a host of other Pyrrhian cities\u200a\u2014\u200awere up in arms, plotting action against corrupt local and national officials.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0dfa\" name=\"0dfa\">And then Anahata played its ace, bringing citizens across Pyrrhia to their feet, pitchforks in hand, as their searches for online porn were greeted by a 404 error page and a message that the government had censored all inappropriate images.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"845c\" name=\"845c\">The president dismissed all of his officials except Colonel Okonkwi. The two sat silently before their glasses of scotch, the president thinking back on his years of rule, the colonel contemplating the best military strategy to protect the country from revolt. As night fell, the crowds outside the palace grew louder, and the first gate, then the second, gave way to the angry masses. Colonel Okonkwi wondered how much time was left before his men began to abandon their posts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed97\" name=\"ed97\">Suddenly, a loud explosion from the floor below knocked Colonel Okonkwi to his knees. He dashed into the hall and nearly collided with an aide. \u201cIt\u2019s Prince Arsyen. He\u2019s gone,\u201d the panicked aide said. \u201cHe blew up a wall in the first-floor kitchen!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b603\" name=\"b603\">The colonel returned to the command room and locked the door behind him, preparing to summon his reserve army.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bd8d\" name=\"bd8d\">\u201cMy friend, sit,\u201d said President Korpeko, handing the colonel his glass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eb85\" name=\"eb85\">The command room was dark save for the white screen; its light cast a sickly pallor across the president\u2019s face. Just then, the search results on the screen began to melt together, dripping into a dark circle in the middle, then opening into a spiraling rainbow. The rainbow dissolved into the dancing face of Bobby Bonilo, chiseled and set against a blue sky. \u201cImprove humankind!\u201d said the talking head, floating through the clouds, blinking for just a few seconds before disappearing. And then the search results returned.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"446f\" name=\"446f\">\u201cWho was that man?\u201d Colonel Okonkwi raged.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3d16\" name=\"3d16\">\u201cAnahata,\u201d said the president quietly, but his mind had moved well beyond any thoughts of revenge.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0778\" name=\"0778\">President Korpeko had always known this day would come, but he had hoped to stave it off long enough to see his dreams to fruition. He now saw that his great hope\u200a\u2014\u200ato ease hundreds of years of hatred between his native Embria and his adopted Pyrrhia through a mutual love of curling\u200a\u2014\u200awould die with him. The curling high schools he had created would be restored to Aimo croquet preparatories. The lanes he had crafted alongside the main roads would be left to melt, the ice turning sooty, patches of weeds shooting up like a long-dormant plague. The statue of him in the central plaza, his body bent close to the ground, hand on the curling stone, eyes staring forward into the future, would be toppled by a gang of dirty, illiterate youths. In his place, the same statues, just with different faces and names, would be erected by Arsyen Aimo.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e43e\" name=\"e43e\">He shook his head and placed his hand on the shoulder of Colonel Okonkwi. \u201cMy friend, it is over. I will see you on the other side.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e47\" name=\"4e47\">President Korpeko walked slowly through the adjoining door to his private quarters. There, after kissing a photo of his prized curling stone and donning both Pyrrhian and Embrian bison capes, he put a bullet in his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b77b\" name=\"b77b\">Colonel Okonkwi heard the shot from the other side of the door.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"f251\" name=\"f251\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"41a3\" name=\"41a3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*PvZv9YyI9wvYmQ_Le0rHew.png\" data-height=\"106\" data-image-id=\"1*PvZv9YyI9wvYmQ_Le0rHew.png\" data-width=\"1400\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*PvZv9YyI9wvYmQ_Le0rHew.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PvZv9YyI9wvYmQ_Le0rHew.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PvZv9YyI9wvYmQ_Le0rHew.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"2bcf\" name=\"2bcf\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">B</span>obby was only three seconds into his pranayamic breathing when the suits cut him off.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"73d1\" name=\"73d1\">\u201cBobby.

With his pale, wrinkly body, he looked just like the suit next to him, who looked just like the two men sitting next to him, who\u200a\u2014\u200awell, didn\u2019t look anything like the Indian billionaire. But in spirit, at least, the suits were all the same. In Bobby\u2019s new society on the moon, there would be no suits. There would only be\u2026progress.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3731\" name=\"3731\">Bobby crossed his arms and leaned back in his chair, throwing his feet up on the table. He contemplated whether falling into a sudden nap would send the capitalists away. He wanted more time to think about innovation\u2026or breasts\u2026or innovation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"62ed\" name=\"62ed\">\u201cLook at it this way,\u201d said the Indian suit, cutting into his thoughts. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the share price back up, you\u2019re not going to have any money left to reinvest in the moon project.

He hadn\u2019t considered that possibility\u200a\u2014\u200aor any others, really, as he had forbidden Fischer to distract him with financials.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bdd5\" name=\"bdd5\">\u201cIf you want to save the moon colony, you have to save Anahata,\u201d the Indian suit said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"64d2\" name=\"64d2\">Bobby frowned.

He popped up now and then at internet conferences and industry events, but even then he was more whisper than presence. He hid in green rooms and VIP suites, sipped his cocktails in the shadows of discreet Davos and Sun City condos. But only those as powerful as the Fixer could claim to have seen him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9c1b\" name=\"9c1b\">Bobby liked to think he was equally elusive. In fact, his first thought after capitulating to the board\u2019s suggestion was that the Fixer should have to call <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">him</em>. But even Bobby could be practical and knew that telepathy had yet to be invented (though he had Gregor working on it). So he put his Progressa unit\u200a\u2014\u200ajust back from its operation in the Philippines\u200a\u2014\u200aonto the task of tracking him down.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6fa9\" name=\"6fa9\">There was a reason Bobby trusted his most confidential and tricky tasks to Progressa, the Anahata team in charge of solving big problems like poverty, famine, drought, and hassle-free distributed computing. He had realized early on that the same skills needed to save the world were also those needed to make pesky executives disappear\u200a\u2014\u200aor to quietly recruit slippery visionaries like the Fixer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c13\" name=\"0c13\">They tracked him down at a Hopi reservation near the Arizona border. The Fixer agreed to meet with Bobby, but in a place far away from the watchful eyes of technologists. And so, eighteen hours after the Anahata board meeting, Bobby hopped on his jet to the Santa Fe Holistic Wellness Center to find the Fixer alone in a meditation room containing only two burning candles, a miniature Japanese garden, and a freshly groomed goat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b25\" name=\"2b25\">The legendary tech healer briefly opened his eyes, acknowledging Bobby\u2019s trespass in his sacred space. At first glance, Bobby found the balding, middle-aged man unexceptional in appearance. But then the Fixer bent over in prayer. His belly pushed in and out of his caftan like a peach-colored pillow, in and out, in and out. Bobby found the rhythm of the breath soothing. He wondered if his own breath could also inspire such calm. He waited.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9c10\" name=\"9c10\">The Fixer inhaled and exhaled, inhaled and exhaled. With the persistence of the ocean tide, his caftan slowly inched its way up his lower back, soon revealing what Bobby had long heard to be true. Rising along the right of his spine were a series of hatchet marks, a tally of companies the Fixer had resurrected from the depths of bankruptcy, geopolitical nightmares, oil spills, and murdered mistresses.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d62e\" name=\"d62e\">Bobby knew that the Fixer would not speak to him right away\u200a\u2014\u200ait was standard practice in the technology industry to use meditation as a negotiation tactic. Letting the room sit in silence was an effective way to instill calm as well as establish dominance. Bobby sat back on his heels and began his own meditation, closing his eyes and silently repeating his latest mantra.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6c10\" name=\"6c10\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Not my will but Thy will, not my will but Thy will, not my will but Thy will\u2026</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"df91\" name=\"df91\">His mind was a blank canvas. It was a still lake. It was a round peach. It was a perfectly shaped breast.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ce8e\" name=\"ce8e\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Focus, Bobby!</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d9a5\" name=\"d9a5\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Not my will but Thy will, not my will but Thy will\u2026</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b5f1\" name=\"b5f1\">Bobby could feel the goat gnawing at his shirt. It shouldn\u2019t have bothered him\u200a\u2014\u200ait usually took just a few seconds of meditation to tune out life\u2019s little distractions. But now his mind kept flashing to the Fixer and the warnings from his board, his chant soon morphing to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Not my will but the Fixer\u2019s will</em>, then <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Not me but the Fixer</em>, and finally, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Not my money but Thy money</em>. He was glad no one could read his thoughts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5ad9\" name=\"5ad9\">Fifteen minutes later, the Fixer opened his eyes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4d83\" name=\"4d83\">\u201cHello, Bobby,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"846f\" name=\"846f\">\u201cHello,\u201d said Bobby, meeting his gaze.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"57e5\" name=\"57e5\">\u201cYou have caught me at a good time,\u201d the Fixer said. \u201cJust returned from an ashram in Goa.

A demo where they translated a conversation between a cat and his Korean owner in real time. And then, because they\u2019re Galt, they managed to reduce all the communication to just the most important bits.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e292\" name=\"e292\">\u201cWow,\u201d said Bobby, genuinely impressed\u200a\u2014\u200aand impressed that he was impressed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fd58\" name=\"fd58\">\u201cThey plan to launch it next year. They\u2019ve even figured out how to monetize. Every few minutes, the animal or person whose speech is being translated will read a text advertisement, targeted to your conversation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"088a\" name=\"088a\">Bobby\u2019s head darted around the room. The goat. The candle. The bonsai tree. What could he build that was better than GaltSpeak?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"01a5\" name=\"01a5\">\u201cThey say it will only take them one more year to extend the functionality to corpses,\u201d continued the Fixer, now turning to lock eyes with Bobby. \u201cThat\u2019s not just bleeding-edge innovation, that\u2019s an enormous monetization opportunity. After all, the dead on this planet far outnumber the living.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0ac3\" name=\"0ac3\">\u201cThe dead,\u201d Bobby said. His legs were shaking.

That plays to Galt\u2019s strength, not yours. Anahata just expands. It\u2019s all you know how to do. You\u2019re so desperate that you gobble everything up, thinking size alone will secure your future. But listen to me when I tell you that you have no future in the future.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1556\" name=\"1556\">\u201cNo,\u201d said Bobby, collapsing to the floor and burrowing his head into the yoga mat. \u201cNo, no, no, no!

And now his gut was telling him not to listen to this man\u200a\u2014\u200abut maybe his gut was wrong. Maybe it had been wrong for a long time, like ever since he had stopped taking his probiotics. How else could Galt have outpaced Anahata? They had monetizable cats\u200a\u2014\u200aeven monetizable <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dead</em> cats!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2923\" name=\"2923\">\u201cHold on,\u201d said Bobby, jumping to his feet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b707\" name=\"b707\">He walked to the far corner and opened the door. Gregor\u2019s combat boots shuffle-thudded into the room. The goat bleated. The Fixer\u2019s forehead wrinkled for a split second as he broke his pose to look toward the door. He took in Gregor\u2019s meditation-inappropriate camouflage attire.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5ebb\" name=\"5ebb\">\u201cThis is Gregor, our SVP of engineering,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b88\" name=\"5b88\">The Fixer pushed his hands together and gave a small bow. Gregor nodded and pitched forward only slightly, his eyes never leaving the Fixer\u2019s face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f141\" name=\"f141\">Bobby turned toward Gregor. \u201cHe says we need to build something on Mars.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"47b2\" name=\"47b2\">\u201cJust something small,\u201d said the Fixer, smiling at Gregor. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t know all the details about your moon colony\u200a\u2014\u200ajust what I have seen in the press. But then you wouldn\u2019t be here if it was all a lie, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f1da\" name=\"f1da\">Gregor did not answer. The Fixer shrugged.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6a2c\" name=\"6a2c\">\u201cI think it\u2019s great. Someone needs to think big like that. But it\u2019s a problem for your stock price\u200a\u2014\u200ayou need air cover. My idea is that we build something on Mars. It can be something meaningless but which we make seem significant. For example, what if I told you that I recently found evidence of microbial life on Mars? If you had that research in your pocket\u200a\u2014\u200aand I can make that happen, you know\u200a\u2014\u200ayou could easily construct a little microbe breeding cave there. We could say it\u2019s a step toward understanding the beginnings of the universe\u200a\u2014\u200aor that it will help us solve global warming. Something like that. Something so big and audacious that people are embarrassed to ask about the details.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"700b\" name=\"700b\">\u201cThe point is it doesn\u2019t really matter what we do\u200a\u2014\u200awe can blind everyone with data. This project will be public, relatively cheap, and we can confirm it immediately. Then we insinuate to the press that people confused our Mars project for a moon colony, and in the process correct the rumors that are swirling about right now.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e015\" name=\"e015\">Gregor grunted. Bobby looked over at him, desperate to read his reaction, but Gregor\u2019s face offered little insight into what he was thinking.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"83e3\" name=\"83e3\">The Fixer used the small Japanese rock garden to illustrate his plan. Bobby was transfixed by the small rake and the smooth, unhindered path it took across the garden. With each pass of the rake, his Galt fears seemed to attenuate.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"264c\" name=\"264c\">\u201cIf only we were all rakes,\u201d he whispered to Gregor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b66d\" name=\"b66d\">The Fixer pointed out the key elements of his plan, using bonsai trees and small rocks to reconstruct his microbe breeding cave. Bobby felt his confidence building. He could already read the success of the Mars plan in the lines snaking across the sand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"379e\" name=\"379e\">\u201cThis seems very elaborate,\u201d said Gregor, breaking Bobby\u2019s train of thought.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"15a1\" name=\"15a1\">\u201cBut this will get us to the moon,\u201d Bobby said. He turned toward the Fixer. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f85c\" name=\"f85c\">\u201cFirst, my fee. I want $20 million\u200a\u2014\u200a$10 million in cash, and $10 million payable when the stock rises $200 more than its current value. I am certain it will surpass that, but I\u2019m giving you a deal because I\u2019m genuinely excited by your innovative thinking.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7cdb\" name=\"7cdb\">\u201cDone,\u201d Bobby nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"00a2\" name=\"00a2\">\u201cSecond, the structure. In order to pull this off, we need to rearrange how all of Anahata works. Everyone must be moving as one fluid unit.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"517a\" name=\"517a\">\u201cYour vision is radical,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cIt should be accompanied by an equally radical new organizational structure.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5cf1\" name=\"5cf1\">\u201cI will need to have engineering, product, sales, and strategy reporting into me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"28b7\" name=\"28b7\">\u201cBut\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d said Gregor, his face suddenly collapsing as he looked to Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"acc6\" name=\"acc6\">Engineering was Gregor\u2019s world, and Bobby knew there was nothing more important to him in this world. But Bobby also knew none of that would matter if he couldn\u2019t get the company back on track. He would just have to find a way to make it up to Gregor later.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a2c6\" name=\"a2c6\">\u201cRadical vision requires radical transformation,\u201d Bobby nodded.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"be6d\" name=\"be6d\">\u201cIt\u2019s not simply that he\u2019s power hungry?\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dc8c\" name=\"dc8c\">\u201cIf I wanted control of everything,\u201d said the Fixer, \u201cI would have also asked for your other departments.

And by the way, I also want his office,\u201d he said, pointing at Gregor.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9236\" name=\"9236\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gregor,\u201d said Bobby, averting the engineer\u2019s gaze. \u201cBut I have no choice. Galt is monetizing corpses.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd87\" name=\"cd87\">Gregor\u2019s mouth opened, but he did not speak. He turned and made a brisk exit, momentarily slowed by the goat, which tried to block the door. Bobby felt a moment of sadness but quickly recovered once the Fixer offered him the miniature rake to play with.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"48cd\" name=\"48cd\">Dragging the rake through the rock garden, Bobby outlined his plans for the moon colony. He could tell the Fixer was excited by the idea, and the men agreed that speed was of the essence. The Fixer suggested they perform a sequence of sun salutations in lieu of a contract. \u201cThe word,\u201d he said, \u201cis more sincere than paper.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c30\" name=\"2c30\">They decided he would start the following Monday.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"4d5b\" name=\"4d5b\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"6c22\" name=\"6c22\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>hat Monday morning, even before rising from bed, Bobby did something he hadn\u2019t done in all of Anahata\u2019s ten-year history: He checked the company\u2019s share price. It was still falling\u200a\u2014\u200athat was no surprise\u200a\u2014\u200abut he wanted to peg it to an exact number to know exactly what bottom it had hit before the Fixer\u2019s arrival reversed its downward spiral.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"920b\" name=\"920b\">Things could only go up from here. Within 24 hours, the company\u2019s share price would be on the upswing; then, just a week later, Anahata would release its quarterly earnings report, recording an impressive forty percent growth from the previous quarter. The world would be in order yet again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a4cb\" name=\"a4cb\">Bobby jumped out of bed and skipped into his yoga room. Outside, the sky was a boundless blue. Somewhere up there was the Fixer, making his way toward Anahata in his golden fleet, the exhaust from his skyship leaving a trail of diamonds in its wake.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"33de\" name=\"33de\">He couldn\u2019t wait to share his moon colony vision with another great thinker. Gregor was great, but he was a doer. Sometimes you wanted to be with a be-er\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone who could just soak in the essence of genius. Once the Fixer was fully on board, maybe he and Bobby could meditate together or fund a solar-energy side project. The possibilities were endless when two great minds were united.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5bc8\" name=\"5bc8\">Bobby looked out the window, then inhaled and exhaled deeply. What a great day. Now was a good time to think about cold fusion. He hadn\u2019t thought about it in a while, and someone really needed to be doing that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d480\" name=\"d480\">Bobby\u2019s phone buzzed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"edb8\" name=\"edb8\">\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93c9\" name=\"93c9\">It was the Fixer. Cold fusion would have to wait.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c09e\" name=\"c09e\">\u201cLet\u2019s cut the pleasantries, Bobby. There\u2019s a problem. I\u2019m not flying in today.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"648d\" name=\"648d\">In the privacy of his yoga room, Bobby allowed a smug smile to settle on his face. For all his fanciness, it seemed the Fixer didn\u2019t own a backup jet. Bobby pictured him boarding a commercial flight, his body squirming awkwardly in a business-class seat where thousands of poorer rich people had sat their well-fed bottoms over the previous year.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"50cd\" name=\"50cd\">\u201cAfter I saw you, Galt came to me,\u201d the Fixer said. \u201cYou speaking to me made them want to speak to me. So my price has gone up since we last spoke.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1238\" name=\"1238\">Bobby rolled his eyes. Why was everyone so obsessed with money? Why couldn\u2019t they just follow their passions and go with the flow?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a8cb\" name=\"a8cb\">\u201cSo, how much do you want?\u201d Bobby asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"50ab\" name=\"50ab\">\u201cEnough so that I can go back to Galt and get them to give me even more money.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0349\" name=\"0349\">\u201cYou mean you\u2019ll be working with Galt regardless?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"846e\" name=\"846e\">\u201cGaltSpeak just seems more feasible than your moon colony thing,\u201d the Fixer said. \u201cAnd monetizing the thoughts of the dead is a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">huge</em> opportunity. Anyway, Galt probably thinks you\u2019re giving me a counteroffer right now. As we speak, my value is rising twofold\u200a\u2014\u200ano wait, threefold!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"175e\" name=\"175e\">\u201cBut we had a deal!\u201d Bobby said. \u201cWe did sun salutations together!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fd83\" name=\"fd83\">\u201cLook, I do downward dog with a lot of people. I only count pigeon pose, with both of us facing each other, inhaling and exhaling five times, as a true deal. If your team had done proper due diligence, you would have known that. But no hard feelings, right? Let\u2019s grab a beer at Davos.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"993b\" name=\"993b\">The Fixer hung up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b3ef\" name=\"b3ef\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Galt!</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa9a\" name=\"aa9a\">Despite his board\u2019s fears, Bobby himself wasn\u2019t worried about Wall Street. They only had one more week of this to go. Once Anahata posted its stunning quarterly results, no one would even care if Anahata said it was building a colony on the sun.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2848\" name=\"2848\">But Galt\u2026Galt!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"49e2\" name=\"49e2\">The Fixer would tell them everything about Anahata\u2019s moon colony, and then they would start to build their own version. They were so fast and scrappy, maybe they could even beat Anahata to the moon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0272\" name=\"0272\">His engineers would want to live on Galt\u2019s moon colony, eat Galt\u2019s moon food, and sleep with Galt\u2019s moon girls. Within five years Anahata would be nothing more than a relic of the early twenty-first century, and Bobby would be reduced to little more than a passing caption in a computer science museum.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1c04\" name=\"1c04\">\u201cNoooo!\u201d Bobby screamed. He jumped on his five-wheeled dragon bike and pedaled furiously to Anahata, his panic carrying him straight to Gregor\u2019s office in Building 1.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d1e4\" name=\"d1e4\">But his trusty engineer wasn\u2019t there. Nor was his stuff.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9338\" name=\"9338\">\u201cGregor!\u201d he yelled, running down the hall. The welders, architects, moon horticulturists, and rocket scientists looked up from their Social Me app to see their barefooted founder searching for Gregor inside space capsules and under tables. He circled the building four times, ran up and down its stairs three times (though once was just for fitness), before finally coming to a stop once again outside Gregor\u2019s empty office, throwing his body against the door and pounding his fists.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d7d2\" name=\"d7d2\">\u201cGregor!!!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"be24\" name=\"be24\">A familiar crew cut appeared in a doorway a few feet away. Bobby rushed forward, but Gregor took a step back into the room.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e3b0\" name=\"e3b0\">\u201cOh, Gregor! Where have you been?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9c46\" name=\"9c46\">\u201cYou kicked me out of my office, remember?\u201d said Gregor, keeping his distance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0032\" name=\"0032\">\u201cThe Fixer\u2019s not coming,\u201d said Bobby, throwing his hands up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8cea\" name=\"8cea\">Gregor shrugged and turned toward his desk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"159c\" name=\"159c\">\u201cGregor, he\u2019s going to go work for Galt. He\u2019ll tell them everything!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d864\" name=\"d864\">Gregor did an about-face, and Bobby saw his eyes widen. And then his face hardened.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d2df\" name=\"d2df\">\u201cWe can\u2019t let them beat us,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"36c2\" name=\"36c2\">\u201cHow soon can we launch Project Y?

And the moment you see that it\u2019s working, I want to launch Y.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1e26\" name=\"1e26\">Gregor opened his mouth, but Bobby held up his hand. He couldn\u2019t stay any longer. He was worried the Fixer would tell Galt about the new cafeteria menus Bobby was working on. Bobby had mentioned it while they were in eagle pose, and the Fixer had complimented him on his innovative plans for chia and hemp seeds. If Galt knew he was plotting a menu revamp, they might try to beat him to the punch. He had to speak to Anahata\u2019s head chef so they could rework the menus immediately. He had an idea that involved goji berries\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d87c\" name=\"d87c\">As Bobby raced across the lawn toward Fried Fred\u2019s, a fleeting sense of guilt descended upon him\u200a\u2014\u200aGregor was clearly still upset about the whole business with the Fixer. Bobby needed to find a way to make it up to him, but he also knew he didn\u2019t have the time right now to give Gregor the attention he wanted. Bobby had a company to save.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"4ee3\" name=\"4ee3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"5f61\" name=\"5f61\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*UfcQIjDHiCResZpvoJHlqQ.png\" data-height=\"106\" data-image-id=\"1*UfcQIjDHiCResZpvoJHlqQ.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*UfcQIjDHiCResZpvoJHlqQ.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UfcQIjDHiCResZpvoJHlqQ.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UfcQIjDHiCResZpvoJHlqQ.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"24f9\" name=\"24f9\">Not much was getting done at Anahata.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8ed6\" name=\"8ed6\">The sprinkler system went down, and the engineer who had designed the company\u2019s elaborate watering system was nowhere to be found. The lawn\u2019s signature green (#008000) had quickly given way to a more authentic, Californian brown, and the janitors arrived on campus each morning to find bedsheets and beanbags strewn across the lawn like slaughtered ghosts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"260f\" name=\"260f\">But none of the employees seemed to notice or care. They all had their heads pointed down at their phones, their bright heels and plastic Crocs clicking along an invisible course of pulsing lights. One spotted them coupled in stairwells, bushes, and sleep capsules; sometimes the glimpse of a foot or bare leg would emerge from the kale beds in the compost garden.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b5d4\" name=\"b5d4\">The shyer ones flocked to Roni\u2019s \u201cuser experience sessions,\u201d where the scent of vanilla candles and the gentle notes of bossa nova wafted through the room as engineers and female employees stood at opposite ends, like at a middle school dance, speaking to each other through the Social Me app.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"344c\" name=\"344c\">Meanwhile, the more outgoing ones ended up at Roni\u2019s Island Paradise\u200a\u2014\u200aformerly the volleyball court\u200a\u2014\u200aeach evening ablaze with orange tiki lights between the palm trees. Robot butlers rolled across the grass, offering a vodka Jell-O shot to any woman who had the Social Me application on her phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e242\" name=\"e242\">To the right of the Island Paradise, just past the main entrance, employees locked lips in beanbags below the dinosaur and rocket ship that charged across the building\u2019s skylight. To their right, a TV was on mute, flashing with the day\u2019s news. At the tenth minute of the broadcast, Anahata employee Arsyen Aimo briefly appeared on the screen, first shown raising the Pyrrhian flag above his head, then atop a podium in front of a large brown building, his fist raised in triumph. Below him, shattered in large chunks, were the remains of a statue of the deposed leader, President Korpeko.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e61\" name=\"4e61\">No one saw the news, and no one saw what was happening across the hall, either, where the Anahata squid moved across his tank, tentacles pumping vigorously through the water as if desperate to attract someone\u2019s attention.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c4ea\" name=\"c4ea\">On a positive note, not a single Anahata employee had defected to Galt in more than two weeks.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"142c\" name=\"142c\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"4cf3\" name=\"4cf3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BxzjgQgh6GKd_M0IcPXwtA.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"2d12\" name=\"2d12\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">G</span>regor charged into Building 1 and marched down the hall toward his office. Rounding the corner, he saw Roni hovering in the shadows, the outline of a female form hidden behind him, her blond hair half-obscured by a potted ficus. Gregor growled, and the girl scampered. Glaring at Roni, Gregor grabbed the ficus and dragged it down the hall, unsure of his aim with that particular ficus, but certain that the fewer hiding places Anahata provided, the sooner he could unearth his burrowing engineers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"52e8\" name=\"52e8\">He hauled the tree into his office and set it next to his desk.

Gregor considered restricting the hours the app was available or cordoning off the female staff. Perhaps he could replace the female employees with robots, or he could ask the Building 1 chemistry team to use its pheromone technology to turn the women into lesbians during working hours. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">If</em>, that is, he could find his Building 1 chemistry team. They were missing along with everyone else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"aadb\" name=\"aadb\">\u201cAgggh!\u201d Gregor hit his fist against the desk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4796\" name=\"4796\">He closed his eyes and tried to force calm, rational thought<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>How would Gregor Guntlag solve this problem?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5902\" name=\"5902\">He thought.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d207\" name=\"d207\">And he thought.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8131\" name=\"8131\">The answer was obvious.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"52cb\" name=\"52cb\">Gregor Guntlag wouldn\u2019t know what to do. He would ask Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0833\" name=\"0833\">But Bobby, of course, would offer no guidance. Nor would he ever recognize that this was all his fault.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a1c0\" name=\"a1c0\">If Bobby had simply fired Niels, Gregor wouldn\u2019t have had to go to such extremes to get rid of him. Then Niels never would have fleeted anything about the moon, the stock price wouldn\u2019t have sunk, the Fixer would never have entered\u200a\u2014\u200athen exited\u200a\u2014\u200atheir lives, the engineers would still be engineering, and the moon colony would still be a secret.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dcd5\" name=\"dcd5\">Instead, Bobby and Fischer were now off carousing with online sales girls; HR Paul was hiding from all of the company policy violations bumping, humping, and smacking their way across the campus; and Old Al was busy getting a colonoscopy. Only Gregor understood what was happening: Social Me, that tangential, ridiculous project, was destroying his masterpiece.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"17a2\" name=\"17a2\">Gregor stared at his mobile.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e7c1\" name=\"e7c1\">Although Social Me had been deployed to his phone at the same time as the rest of the company\u2019s engineering population, Gregor had yet to open it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c88\" name=\"7c88\">He tapped the cloying pink S&amp;M logo, and a dashboard vaguely similar to Social Car materialized before him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd4c\" name=\"dd4c\">Gregor hit a button that said \u201cmatch me.\u201d Profile photos of various female employees spun before his eyes like a slot machine, a kaleidoscope of blondes, brunettes and the occasional redhead. Gregor felt his eyes blur. He slammed his index finger into the phone, blindly choosing from the flickering profiles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6ad\" name=\"b6ad\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ding! Ding! Ding!</em> went the Social Me slot machine. He wondered just what he had won.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1990\" name=\"1990\">When he opened his eyes, Gregor saw a photo of an attractive woman, probably in her late twenties, staring up at him from his screen. He clicked on the profile to see what would happen next.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"90e6\" name=\"90e6\">Her name was Kerstin. She worked in HR and was a Capricorn. She liked swimming and was looking for \u201cnot Mr. Right\u200a\u2014\u200ajust Mr. Right Now.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"59b7\" name=\"59b7\">Just then, the Social Me message icon beeped and his phone vibrated. Kerstin was messaging him.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"0e34\" name=\"0e34\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">hi. ur checkin out my profile. like what u c?</em> ;-)</pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"1dca\" name=\"1dca\">Gregor felt his heart quicken. He looked to the door, hoping someone would enter just then, looking for advice or a product review. Anyone, any problem, would have served as a welcome interruption. But no one appeared. It was early evening and most of the employees had left\u200a\u2014\u200aor were hiding away somewhere on campus.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"10c3\" name=\"10c3\">He tapped his fingers on the desk, then stood and walked to the other side of the office. He didn\u2019t like the idea of interacting with someone on the app. He just wanted to understand how it worked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d915\" name=\"d915\">Gregor looked out the window. Two pairs of legs extended from a bush along the opposite building; by the volleyball court, bodies of a man and woman were smashed together in a never-ending embrace.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb59\" name=\"fb59\">Beyond them, far in the distance, Gregor spotted a robot butler abandoned in the field, its arms open in supplication. It was supposed to rain that week. Given the state of things, the robot would surely rust and no one would notice.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc47\" name=\"fc47\">Gregor could feel his throat constrict, the anger rising inside him. He tried to push it away. This was not a productive way to respond to a problem. He breathed deeply until he felt it recede.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5cf4\" name=\"5cf4\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Now, what would I normally do if there was something wrong with one of our products?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e55e\" name=\"e55e\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I would do a thorough feature-by-feature review.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a9ad\" name=\"a9ad\">Gregor sat down again and typed a message to Kerstin.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"f5d7\" name=\"f5d7\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">I am here</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"bc64\" name=\"bc64\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">what r u in the mood 4?</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"a98d\" name=\"a98d\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">I want to try the app.</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"54ff\" name=\"54ff\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">u want 2 try anything else?</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"460d\" name=\"460d\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">What do you mean?</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"09ff\" name=\"09ff\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">gregor, ur silly. u know what im saying.</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"9ce5\" name=\"9ce5\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">No I do not.</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"4abc\" name=\"4abc\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">ur older than me (hot) and run something in engineering (hot)</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"52de\" name=\"52de\">Gregor grimaced as much at Kerstin\u2019s spelling as at her flirtatiousness. He ignored Social Me\u2019s prompts to help him with his conversation, putting the phone aside for a moment so he could note some feedback for the Social Me team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3b27\" name=\"3b27\">He started with the design\u200a\u2014\u200aall pink and dizzying with its many profile pictures. It was miles away from Anahata\u2019s design aesthetic, which, as Bobby always reminded his employees, was \u201cpurple and green and magical like a fairy but practical like a gnome.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c72d\" name=\"c72d\">He then turned to the notification feature. It was smart but a bit too persistent. It would be better with \u2014</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5ec5\" name=\"5ec5\">His phone buzzed again.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"f120\" name=\"f120\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">Why don\u2019t you want to talk to me? I\u2019ve always wanted to talk to the big brain that runs Anahata.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"0cab\" name=\"0cab\">Gregor\u2019s eyes lingered on the screen, surprised to discover that Kerstin was suddenly capable of forming complete sentences.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"26ef\" name=\"26ef\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">I\u2019ve heard that nothing happens at this company without you.

How did she know him so well?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4ed8\" name=\"4ed8\">He studied her heart-shaped face and bright-green eyes. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Kerstin. </em>His babysitter\u2019s name had been Kerstin.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"9fd7\" name=\"9fd7\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">You\u2019re the big genius.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"8d87\" name=\"8d87\">Gregor blushed and decided he should respond. It was the best way to understand this coupling thing Jennie and Roni had been talking about.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"4ee8\" name=\"4ee8\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">I enjoy working at Anahata.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"2504\" name=\"2504\">Kerstin responded immediately\u200a\u2014\u200ashe must have been a fast typist.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"95ed\" name=\"95ed\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">It can be hard when it feels like people don\u2019t appreciate your talent.

She knew what it meant to toil in the shadows, to have people eschew progress and innovation in favor of philosophical debates and endless films in which people did nothing but talk and stare into clouds of cigarette smoke.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c99a\" name=\"c99a\">It meant\u2026she knew failure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9e3a\" name=\"9e3a\">Gregor stood and shut the door to his office, then returned to his desk and typed:</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"549d\" name=\"549d\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">It is good to meet a fellow European.</em></pre><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\" id=\"5f5f\" name=\"5f5f\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">gregor, i want us to be friends.</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"e723\" name=\"e723\">Kerstin seemed to have tired again of capital letters.</p><pre class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\" id=\"5acf\" name=\"5acf\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pre-em\">turn on the video button. let me see ur face</em></pre><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\" id=\"11b3\" name=\"11b3\">Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, Gregor pushed the video-chat icon within the Social Me app. Kerstin appeared on the screen, looking even prettier than her profile photo had suggested.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a2e9\" name=\"a2e9\">\u201cHi there,\u201d said Kerstin, smiling. She had no trace of a European accent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6a4b\" name=\"6a4b\">Gregor blushed and tried to smile.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"42ab\" name=\"42ab\">Without saying a word, Kerstin began to take off her top. She was smiling at the camera, biting her lip. Gregor felt the stirrings of an erection.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2a36\" name=\"2a36\">\u201cGregor likey?\u201d she asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fffb\" name=\"fffb\">She was the kind of woman who would normally ignore someone like him, and yet she was moving her bra strap off her shoulder, watching him watch her as it fell down her arm.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7bcd\" name=\"7bcd\">\u201cGregor,\u201d she said, leaning into the camera, \u201cyou\u2019ve gotta give to take. This can\u2019t be a one-way interaction. So, if you want me to continue, I need you to do one little thing for me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f1e6\" name=\"f1e6\">Gregor nodded and started to undo his belt buckle, surprised at the ease with which he had handed all control over to this mysterious woman. He had gotten his pants to his knees when Kerstin spoke again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4edd\" name=\"4edd\">\u201cNow click on the blue button to the right of the video.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"da9e\" name=\"da9e\">Gregor did as he was told, watching as Kerstin undid the clasp of her bra.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"63f8\" name=\"63f8\">He smiled at Kerstin.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"128b\" name=\"128b\">She smiled back at him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"205e\" name=\"205e\">Then a payment screen popped up. Kerstin was charging him $49.95 for a ten-minute session.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a6d6\" name=\"a6d6\">Gregor shrieked and threw down his phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"81c5\" name=\"81c5\">Gregor sat at his desk, unable to move. What had Anahata come to that one of its HR employees was running a porn business on the side?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c6cd\" name=\"c6cd\">But more than that, he was disgusted with himself. He was an engineer; only idiots clicked unknown links in emails and chat messages.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1dad\" name=\"1dad\">The computer on his desk began to beep. Gregor glanced at the screen. It was a video call from Bobby\u200a\u2014\u200aa welcome distraction from his thoughts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d7b\" name=\"8d7b\">Gregor scanned the room: the recycling bin, the poverty poster, the ficus tree. All was normal. The only thing out of place was Gregor. He quickly buckled his pants and answered the call.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"13bf\" name=\"13bf\">Bobby\u2019s face took over his screen. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, unbuttoned at the top, his hairy chest on display. He was sitting next to a plastic palm tree. Cardboard waves moved behind him like a cheap set from a high school prom.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e9bf\" name=\"e9bf\">\u201cHey!\u201d cheered Bobby, lifting a fruity, umbrellaed cocktail. \u201cCome join us at the Polynesian barbecue. Roni\u2019s gotten more than 500 Anahatis to come. Actually, Kerstin\u200a\u2014\u200ahey, Kerstin,\u201d said Bobby, turning away from the camera, \u201cCome on over. I\u2019m talking to Gregor.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"465f\" name=\"465f\">The temptress from Gregor\u2019s Social Me adventure bounced onto Bobby\u2019s lap.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c1b3\" name=\"c1b3\">\u201cKerstin\u2019s a rather entrepreneurial HR employee. She was telling me about her little side business this morning. It made me think that with video chats and Social Me, we could really empower a whole generation of women to become small business owners.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4033\" name=\"4033\">Gregor felt himself sinking in his chair.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c6aa\" name=\"c6aa\">\u201cSo I thought, hey, what better way to make it up to Gregor after that whole Fixer thing than by giving you the first test drive of Kerstin\u2019s product?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"17be\" name=\"17be\">Kerstin giggled and batted her eyes at Bobby, then turned her attention toward Gregor, pouting her glossy peach lips.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"83fd\" name=\"83fd\">\u201cWhat did you think about the UI of that payment screen? Watching you two, I was thinking it might be better if we put the payment button across her chest. You know, stretched from nipple to nipple.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9af9\" name=\"9af9\">Gregor opened his mouth but could not speak.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9f74\" name=\"9f74\">\u201cBy the way, how are we on Y? How soon can we launch? It seems like Social Me is working great and so\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b091\" name=\"b091\">\u201cYou!\u201d Gregor screamed, ripping the computer from the desk and hurling it to the ground, raising his boot over and over again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8000\" name=\"8000\">He knew it meant nothing. He could destroy as many machines as he wanted, but he could never destroy the information itself. His shame was forever recorded on Anahata\u2019s servers, forever stored in Bobby\u2019s memory.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb8e\" name=\"fb8e\">Gregor crumbled, his knife-straight posture folding in defeat. He felt himself move toward the door, shards of computer crunching below his feet. A plan began to form, something beyond him, beyond logic, the only chance to escape.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4bbc\" name=\"4bbc\">Twenty minutes later, Gregor found himself at home, grabbing his backpack and a knife. As he stomped through his kitchen, he stopped and descended to the basement. It had only been a few weeks and yet that day with Niels seemed very long ago. He grabbed a bottle from the rack closest to the stairs, not bothering to check the drink-by date. Then he was upstairs, back in his car, speeding out of Atherton and toward the freeway.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"993c\" name=\"993c\">As he headed south out of the Valley, his ancient Jeep swerving from one lane to another on an empty freeway, Gregor found himself crying for the first time since he had left his parents\u2019 home in Liechtenstein at the age of seventeen.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"81b7\" name=\"81b7\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"5b4c\" name=\"5b4c\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-height=\"107\" data-image-id=\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure\" id=\"1b59\" name=\"1b59\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"graf-dropCapQuote\">\u201c</span>Y</span>ou\u2019re late,\u201d boomed Arsyen, knowing full well that the man kneeling before him in the Grand Hall was not late in the slightest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf2a\" name=\"cf2a\">Arsyen\u2019s father had kept his advisers on their toes by falsely accusing them of minor acts of treachery.

Maybe he could include it in his next book, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Becoming the Me, Again</em>. A whole chapter on what people could learn from fat\u200a\u2014\u200aabout being more autonomous, more stubborn, having growth ambitions. Perhaps his editor would be more amenable to that idea than she had been about his proposed chapter on what people could learn from breasts (plentiful, variable, flexible, responsive\u200a\u2014\u200alike agile coding).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"92a4\" name=\"92a4\">Bobby exited the bathroom into the management meeting room on the adjoining side.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dba9\" name=\"dba9\">Everyone else was already there. Old Al had taken a seat opposite the door, and Fischer, as usual, had strategically placed himself near HR Paul, braving his colleague\u2019s flatulence just to ensure that his updates looked good in comparison to Paul\u2019s whiny complaints and touchy-feely reports on employee well-being. Across from Fischer was the chair Gregor usually claimed. Although the seat was empty, Bobby quickly averted his gaze. He never should have set Gregor up with Kerstin\u200a\u2014\u200aGregor hated pop-up advertisements. He was probably furious with Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1305\" name=\"1305\">Bobby caught Fischer fiddling with something on his phone and made a hissing sound. His CFCAO looked up and quickly placed his phone facedown on the table. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mouthed, knowing Bobby\u2019s dislike of the use of devices during management meetings.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1b56\" name=\"1b56\">Bobby took a seat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a3cb\" name=\"a3cb\">\u201cOkay, who\u2019s up first?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0dc1\" name=\"0dc1\">\u201cI am,\u201d said HR Paul. He bent over his computer to project some slides, and his oversized glasses fell toward his nose, forcing him to push them up every few seconds with his pudgy index finger. Bobby tapped his fingers on the table. If HR Paul was involved, a task always took double the time. There were so many people to consider, issues to debate, laws to follow, and, in this case, a button to find and then press.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e4a0\" name=\"e4a0\">Paul mumbled something about the presentation not loading properly\u200a\u2014\u200aas if it was the engineers\u2019 fault and not his own error. Bobby felt his lip curl. He wondered whether a punch to Paul\u2019s face would alter his ever-placid, cow-like expression.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dbf0\" name=\"dbf0\">Bobby touched the meditation beads on his wrist, trying to pull his thoughts back from the Dark Place. He closed his eyes, just as his yogi had taught him, and took a deep breath. When he emerged, he found himself gazing at his grumpy but lovable engineer, Old Al, Bobby\u2019s living piece of history. Bobby felt peace settle within him and leaned back in his chair.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ca78\" name=\"ca78\">\u201cWell, let me start with the good news,\u201d HR Paul said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a single defection to Galt in two weeks. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened in a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really</em> long time. I think it\u2019s because I told our HR staff to give free hugs to anyone who wants them. With their consent, of course, and only when observed by an employment lawyer.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9b9d\" name=\"9b9d\">Old Al snorted. \u201cIn my day, no one hugged anyone and we all got a lot more work done.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ad1d\" name=\"ad1d\">\u201cWell, that\u2019s the bad news,\u201d said Paul, clicking on to his first slide. \u201cThese are the latest productivity figures. The bottom line is that there\u2019s been a sixty percent drop in productivity over the past two weeks.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b331\" name=\"b331\">\u201cSixty percent?\u201d Fischer stood and approached the screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6aea\" name=\"6aea\">\u201cRight, it\u2019s not good,\u201d answered Paul, taking off his glasses and rubbing his face. \u201cEver since we stopped the sales team from doing sales, productivity has just tanked. You can see the decline begin around that time, and then it\u2019s accelerated week on week. But here\u2019s the weird thing\u200a\u2014\u200athe less productive the sales team is, the happier they become. We\u2019re now seeing very high sales team satisfaction.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cc9a\" name=\"cc9a\">\u201cThat\u2019s not surprising,\u201d Old Al said. \u201cWe\u2019re paying them to do pushups.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e89d\" name=\"e89d\">Bobby stared at the numbers on the screen and thought of his own productivity over the previous week. Between Social Me and yoga class, he really hadn\u2019t gotten much done.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"012f\" name=\"012f\">\u201cWhat do you think, Al?\u201d Bobby asked. Old Al was all-knowing\u200a\u2014\u200awhen he was awake.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"486b\" name=\"486b\">\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the HM program,\u201d Old Al said. \u201cEverything\u2019s moving slower here. The work, the food\u2026people\u2019s brains.\u201d His hand was shaking in HR Paul\u2019s direction. Paul frowned, but Bobby merely laughed. Al probably just had early onset Parkinson\u2019s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"76dd\" name=\"76dd\">The group stared at the slide until finally Bobby spoke up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d047\" name=\"d047\">\u201cYou are what observes, not what you observe,\u201d he said, his gaze moving slowly from one team member to the next. He had spent an hour working on that thought the previous day and was eager to see their reaction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"087c\" name=\"087c\">But Fischer seemed to be smelling his armpit, and Old Al was just tinkering with his hearing aid. HR Paul was listening, but Bobby didn\u2019t really care what he thought.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1e53\" name=\"1e53\">\u201cYou are what observes, not what you observe,\u201d Bobby tried again. His eyes took another pass around the room. No response.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f95\" name=\"1f95\">Where was Gregor? He would\u2019ve understood.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3e7b\" name=\"3e7b\">\u201cIgnore sales and look at the rest of the company,\u201d said Bobby, pointing at the right side of the graph. \u201cNotice that productivity for operations, online support, legal, and other support staff is only slightly down. The big drop\u200a\u2014\u200aand it\u2019s a huge drop\u200a\u2014\u200ais in engineering, PR, marketing, and HR.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"751c\" name=\"751c\">Bobby looked at HR Paul, who looked back at him dumbly. His eyes moved to Old Al, who was cleaning wax from his ears, and then on to Fischer, who was fiddling again with his phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6ab8\" name=\"6ab8\">\u201cSOCIAL ME!\u201d screamed Bobby. \u201cHow many of you have been messing around with it\u200a\u2014\u200alike you, Fisher, put your phone down!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ba87\" name=\"ba87\">Fisher\u2019s phone flew out of his hands, landing face-up next to Bobby. Susie, 23, an Aquarius from HR, flashed him a rosy smile.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"730d\" name=\"730d\">\u201cBut why would the productivity rates of HR, marketing, and PR fall if it\u2019s a tool designed for engineers?\u201d HR Paul said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b5bb\" name=\"b5bb\">\u201cThey\u2019re all women in those departments,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cThey are the Yokos sleeping with our Johns, the ones pulling them away from their work.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"577b\" name=\"577b\">\u201cOhhh.

He smiled and rose a bit in his seat. Next time he\u2019d exclude Fischer from his plans. He had to keep people guessing!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f53\" name=\"5f53\">Paul wiped at his eyes with his sleeve. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, avoiding Bobby\u2019s gaze, \u201cI for one never bought the line you fed us about greater profits through more automated sales.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8026\" name=\"8026\">\u201cAutomation is generally only good for the person doing the automating,\u201d Bobby shrugged. \u201cBeside, if you had known the truth, you would have raised all sorts of HR problems that would have slowed us down. The point is, we got rid of the competition and then gave the engineers an app to help act as the social lubrication.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7eac\" name=\"7eac\">\u201cLubrication is right,\u201d Fischer smirked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f1e9\" name=\"f1e9\">\u201cSo the answer seems to be that we should kill Social Me,\u201d HR Paul said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cde2\" name=\"cde2\">\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need Social Me. You live with a bunch of cats.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5646\" name=\"5646\">\u201cWe can\u2019t kill Social Me,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cThe engineers aren\u2019t productive, but they are <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">very</em> happy, and that\u2019s crucial to the success of Project Y. You yourself told us the other day that the latest happiness survey indicates ninety-eight percent satisfaction among the engineers. That\u2019s why no one\u2019s going to Galt.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1965\" name=\"1965\">\u201cSo we need to keep Social Me, but temper it somehow,\u201d Fischer said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"28c2\" name=\"28c2\">\u201cWe should just lock all these kids in their rooms until they get their work done,\u201d Old Al said. \u201cBack when I was at CERN, we used to make any physicist who was under thirty clean the floors with a toothbrush. It taught discipline.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e26a\" name=\"e26a\">Bobby held up his hand. \u201cIf our engineers are happy, they will stay at Anahata and we will continue to have the best people and the greatest innovation. Therefore, engineers\u2019 happiness is just as important as technological advancement. We need technological advancement to make money, and we need money to survive as a company. So\u2026,\u201d Bobby closed his eyes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"92ee\" name=\"92ee\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">My will not Thy will. Thy will not my will.

He had spent years preparing for nuclear fallout or a foreign invasion, building a bomb shelter in his backyard, arming himself to the teeth, and securing power and food supplies to last for at least two years. And yet at no point had he ever contemplated an event in which he would find himself relying on the natural environment for his survival.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a344\" name=\"a344\">What did it matter if the mushrooms were toxic, anyway? It would serve Bobby right. He imagined the founder confronted with his corpse, his face flooding with tears, body raging at the unjust universe that took his right-hand man away from him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e086\" name=\"e086\">Gregor shut his eyes and threw the mushrooms into his mouth, downing them with the remaining dregs of his wine.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a36b\" name=\"a36b\">\u201cMy death is on your hands, Bobby Bonilo!\u201d he shouted, shaking his fists at the sky.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4768\" name=\"4768\">Gregor lay back against a log and waited to die.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfaa\" name=\"dfaa\">Though, really, he knew he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Gregor had seen a squirrel picking at those mushrooms earlier, with no ill effect.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"afe3\" name=\"afe3\">Well, fine, he might be too cowardly to kill himself, but no matter what, he would not talk to Bobby ever again. He was done with Bobby, done with the internet, done with innovation and disruption and iteration and\u2026everything.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb41\" name=\"fb41\">He knew Bobby would try to win him back; they had been through this before. Bobby would call Gregor and apologize in his roundabout way, never actually saying he had done anything wrong, but instead talking about a Great Historical Wrong\u200a\u2014\u200ahow horrible it was that Nikolai Tesla had died in obscurity, or that people were still using answering machines in the twenty-first century. The subtext somehow being that it would be a much, much worse fate if Gregor were to stop helping Bobby bring magic to the world. And then Gregor always gave in.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b997\" name=\"b997\">But not this time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d83d\" name=\"d83d\">A deer and her fawn appeared in the clearing, not more than ten feet away. The fawn rubbed up against its mother, and she turned to brush her head against the fawn\u2019s neck. Gregor felt a tear on his cheek.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"47c5\" name=\"47c5\">\u201cIt\u2019s just rain,\u201d he said to no one in particular, quickly brushing away the tear with the sleeve of his windbreaker.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c13\" name=\"1c13\">He looked up at the sky, so blue and full of possibility. As the minutes passed, Gregor filled its canvas with people flying in self-powered vehicles, pedestrians strolling in a tube-like bridge above the ocean. He imagined drones spiriting medicine to rural medical clinics and delivering fast food to city dwellers. Slowly, the figures began to grow into giants. They wore Victorian costumes and all looked like his mother. They lectured him about physics in German.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1a74\" name=\"1a74\">Something was licking his hand. Gregor looked down and saw Bobby perched on his leg, his red, bushy tail brushing over Gregor\u2019s knee, his small hands wrapped around an acorn.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"deaf\" name=\"deaf\">\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re blowing this out of proportion?\u201d the squirrel asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9a29\" name=\"9a29\">\u201cYou make me do everything,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cI clean up all your messes, and you never even say thank you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"23c2\" name=\"23c2\">\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d the squirrel asked. \u201cFor me to say thank you?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"156a\" name=\"156a\">\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8b2c\" name=\"8b2c\">\u201cThank you.

Its arms waved in the air, pushing the clouds to the edges of the sky, filling it with purple and green swirls that unfolded into the Anahata logo.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c7ba\" name=\"c7ba\">Gregor lifted his palms into the sky and pushed it all away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dc6e\" name=\"dc6e\">\u201cYou ruined Social Me,\u201d said Gregor, shaking his finger at the squirrel. \u201cWe never should have turned it on for the whole campus.

The analysts, shareholders, and Suits of Nefarious Intent all crouched around their phones, asking cynical, doubtful questions, their hearts bleeding with greed. None of them could grasp Bobby\u2019s vision. They were always hoping to catch him out on a false step or slip of the tongue, looking to glean insight helpful to their various capitalist machinations.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c0b8\" name=\"c0b8\">Bobby found the whole thing repulsive, a bit like being forced to speak to just-above-average smart people.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"133c\" name=\"133c\">He took comfort in knowing he would be rid of them soon, leaving behind Fischer, his chief financial and corporate affairs officer, to deal with the terrestrial bankers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9886\" name=\"9886\">He would go out with a bang. Rather than hold an actual phone conference, as was now common practice in the industry, Bobby instead ordered Fischer to \u201cradicalize\u201d the event and invite all the relevant financial analysts out to Palo Alto, with the promise that Bobby would answer each and every one of their questions in person. In preparation, he had Shanley Field cleared of any errant robots and asked the marketing team to construct a suitable space where he could host the visiting analysts for the afternoon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f21\" name=\"5f21\">The marketing team, which up until that point had only ever orchestrated events for bloggers and engineers, decided to rent a circus tent. They set about making sure it was the most connected, Wi-Fi\u2019d tent in the world, ensuring that any analyst could livestream, live blog, and live eat from the comfort of a beanbag. One wall of the tent was covered in Red Bull cans, and another was lined with potato chips and beer. Masseuses were on hand to relieve any fiscal stress. A spiral staircase was installed in the tent\u2019s center, leading from the ground to the very tip of the tent. While it served no purpose, it pleased Bobby. \u201cStaircases are aspirational,\u201d he told Gregor and Fischer as they entered.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93b0\" name=\"93b0\">The three executives walked to the back of the tent, where they took their seats at a long table. There were twenty black-suited analysts before them, flown in that morning from New York and now squirming in their beanbag chairs, computers and notepads balanced on their knees.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eb90\" name=\"eb90\">Bobby\u2019s assistant flashed him the signal that everything was ready to go. Bobby pulled out his special gavel and began to knock: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">one, two, three, pause. </em>He giggled and did it again. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">One, two, three, pause.</em> It was like he was a musician! <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">One, two \u2014</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dc91\" name=\"dc91\">Fischer\u2019s hand came down on his and pried the gavel from Bobby\u2019s fingers. Then the CFCAO cleared his throat and began to read from the disclaimer prepared by the legal team.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b039\" name=\"b039\">\u201cWelcome to Anahata\u2019s first-quarter earnings call.

On the whole, they seemed younger than the suits of his board. This irritated Bobby\u200a\u2014\u200ayoung people were supposed to love technology. Instead, these men had chosen the old-man institution of banking; they were little more than well-dressed gamblers. All they wanted to talk about was how he could make them more money. They cared nothing for Anahata\u2019s Progressa program or its charitable endeavors. Bobby wondered whether his next project should aim to destroy banking altogether.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ec8c\" name=\"ec8c\">Or maybe he would just draw. Fischer had given him some crayons and paper before the start of the meeting, and Bobby now made use of them. He doodled on the corner of the quarterly report, sketching an idea he had for an enormous flying worm that would carry people through congested cities. Then he made a list of his ten favorite meditation retreats. When he tired of that, he worked on a few ab-tightening breathing exercises his personal trainer had taught him. He was just getting ready to do his neck rolls when he heard Fischer open the meeting to questions. It was the only part of the meeting Bobby ever found interesting; the only time the hunter capitalists had a chance to prick him with their judgments, questions, and irrelevant musings.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d7fd\" name=\"d7fd\">A German-accented analyst spoke first. \u201cThere are rumors that Galt is working on a drone so small it can enter people\u2019s ears and study their biomes and thoughts by analyzing their earwax. I\u2019m wondering what Anahata is planning to do in order to compete.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a85\" name=\"5a85\">Bobby winced. It didn\u2019t matter how much Anahata profits rose each quarter; the analysts were always fixated on Galt.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"194e\" name=\"194e\">\u201cWe focus on our own innovation,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay any attention to the competition.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"119c\" name=\"119c\">The next question was about differences in mobile versus desktop revenue\u200a\u2014\u200athe same question the analysts had asked the previous quarter, and the same one they would ask the next quarter. Bobby didn\u2019t bother to listen to Fischer\u2019s response. He knew his reliable CFCAO would give the same answer he always gave, which was essentially to say nothing at all.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c38d\" name=\"c38d\">Bobby craned his neck to catch a glimpse of the plastic clock attached with twisty ties to the spiral staircase. There was still a half-hour to go. His nerves tingled as he thought about what was to come. Once the questions were done and the tasteful, tree-shaped Anahata keychains had been dispensed to the analysts, Bobby would lead the crowd out onto the field, where he would unveil Project Y\u200a\u2014\u200athe biggest idea in the history of ideas.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e1da\" name=\"e1da\">The next analyst struggled to climb out of his beanbag chair, his acrobatics leaving one pant leg tucked halfway into the top of a purple-and-green-striped stock. Those were Anahata colors, Bobby observed with a smile. He wondered whether he should buy similar socks for his employees. Cotton or a cotton/polyester blend\u200a\u2014\u200awhich one screamed \u201chot young startup\u201d?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"700d\" name=\"700d\">The analyst at the mic was droning on.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1db6\" name=\"1db6\">\u201cEighty-four billion dollars not accounted over the past year\u2026moved between projects\u2026outputs not correlating with inputs\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a85a\" name=\"a85a\">Bobby felt a nudge in his side.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6a4a\" name=\"6a4a\">\u201cThe moon,\u201d Gregor whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s asking you about the moon.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"db01\" name=\"db01\">\u201cI have here the proof that you took company funds and diverted them into a secret project\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad06\" name=\"ad06\">The analyst\u2019s mouth continued to move, but the remainder of his sentence was drowned out by a sudden commotion at the front of the tent.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"9c29\" name=\"9c29\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"1e08\" name=\"1e08\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Q9l39z0lynYfzwfhQ1F_aA.png\" data-height=\"106\" data-image-id=\"1*Q9l39z0lynYfzwfhQ1F_aA.png\" data-width=\"1400\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Q9l39z0lynYfzwfhQ1F_aA.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Q9l39z0lynYfzwfhQ1F_aA.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Q9l39z0lynYfzwfhQ1F_aA.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"196a\" name=\"196a\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>ll eyes were now on the bedraggled figure who had just entered the tent. The man\u2019s pants were torn, and he wore a grime-blackened windbreaker, the trace of an Anahata logo still visible along the pocket. A pair of blue eyes peered out from dirty skin and mud-chunked hair. \u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">La luna!</em>\u201d gasped the man, his finger shaking as he pointed toward the front of the tent where the Anahata executives were sitting. \u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Van a la luna.

Bobby\u2019s assistant tried to speak to him, suggesting in a low voice that the man was lost, but he did not seem to understand English.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4330\" name=\"4330\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Les van a decir que no hay ninguna colonia, pero es mentira</em>,\u201d the man wheezed, lurching toward a cluster of analysts.

He placed a hand on the analyst\u2019s shoulder and leaned in, spreading his hot, putrid breath across the man\u2019s face. \u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">La luna!</em>\u201d he hissed, his finger pointing at the back of the tent, where Bobby, Gregor, and Fischer were sitting.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c29e\" name=\"c29e\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Est\u00e1n locos!

Within seconds, the zombie was toppled in a hail of purple and green beanbags.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cfdc\" name=\"cfdc\">The head of the security team rushed Bobby and Fischer out through the back flap, where Gregor was already waiting.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dd98\" name=\"dd98\">\u201cGo! Run!\u201d the head of security urged.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9b1d\" name=\"9b1d\">The three men began a slow, unpracticed gallop toward the other end of the field, leaving their head of security to play defense.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8fb5\" name=\"8fb5\">Back inside, the tent filled with conjecture and heated words, outrage soon propelling the analysts to their feet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"48b3\" name=\"48b3\">A senior analyst put his fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly. The room went silent. \u201cWhere\u2019d they go?\u201d he yelled, pointing at the table where the executives had been sitting.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"25aa\" name=\"25aa\">\u201cOut the back!\u201d shouted another.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"52f7\" name=\"52f7\">The analysts scrambled over each other, visions of a Wall Street\u2013style massacre filling their heads as they jumped over the beanbag-covered zombie and headed out the back flap of the tent. On the other side, they were met by the security team, which managed to tackle seven of them, reducing the army of analysts to thirteen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ec5\" name=\"9ec5\">Onward those thirteen pushed, their treadmill-trained legs carrying them at a much faster speed than the Anahata execs, whom they could now spot in the distance, awkwardly loping toward an enormous structure situated at the edge of the field, covered top to bottom in a red-and-white fumigation tent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ab1f\" name=\"ab1f\">The two groups raced forward, with the analysts quickly gaining ground. But just as soon as the Anahata execs seemed within their grasp, they disappeared into the tent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d4cb\" name=\"d4cb\">\u201cWe\u2019ll surround it!\u201d one of the analysts yelled. \u201cThe fumes will eventually drive them out!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"54cb\" name=\"54cb\">\u201cThe market needs answers!\u201d screamed another, carrying a beanbag above his head, already relishing the moment when he would watch it crash<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>atop Bobby\u2019s head, forcing him to answer the product roadmap question he had dodged on the last two earnings calls.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"758e\" name=\"758e\">The zombie was also in the race. He had climbed out from under the beanbag dog pile and followed the analysts out of the tent, staggering behind them initially, but quickly catching up after discovering a Segway lying next to the tent\u2019s exit. He motored ahead with practiced skill and soon was leading the pack. \u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">V\u00e1manos! V\u00e1manos!</em>\u201d he screamed, his two-wheeled chariot blowing dust in the face of his troops.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1beb\" name=\"1beb\">Just then, the analysts began to feel the ground rumble below their feet. A loud noise, as if someone had opened the exit door on a plane, suddenly invaded their ears. They pressed on toward the fumigation tent, but the shaking intensified, making it difficult to move. The men halted as the tent before them began to sway and heave, its outline violently transforming as though a wild animal were tearing at it from the inside. A crack appeared in the dirt, and then another, and another. Amid the shaking, the zombie was tossed from the Segway, landing on his face.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"15b5\" name=\"15b5\">The zombie spit out a mouthful of dirt and at first thought he might be suffering from a concussion, for what he saw before him seemed like a hallucination. The fumigation tent was rising, first a foot, now two, now five, then ten feet in the air, some sort of engine underneath it blowing the field\u2019s red dirt into the men\u2019s eyes, transforming the frozen analysts into rusted statues. It rose another few feet, and then the tent itself began to rip, coming apart in four sections like a banana peel, its skin gently floating to the ground, revealing an enormous boat-like structure rising ever farther into the sky. There were endless rows of windows, each portico occupied by a smiling face or, occasionally, the terrified stare of an animal. At the front of it all, framed in a wide window running the length of the bow, were Anahata\u2019s leaders. Gregor peered down at the zombie, a smile stretched wide across his face. To his left, Bobby beamed, pointing down at the analysts and even doing a little jig as the boat floated upward. Behind them, the tentacles of the Anahata squid waved frantically within its tank.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4c1f\" name=\"4c1f\">\u201cNooo!\u201d screamed the analysts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"abab\" name=\"abab\">\u201cNooo!\u201d screamed the zombie.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6760\" name=\"6760\">For a moment, as if it had heard their cry, the boat stopped, gently bobbing in the sky. But it did not rise farther or move beyond its spot above the field. Seconds passed, and the light bobbing became a strong jerking, soon accompanied by the sound of an engine sputtering. The boat fell ten feet, then rose again, fell, and rose.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6649\" name=\"6649\">From below, the analysts could hear the screams of its passengers. A chunk of metal fell from the vessel\u2019s side, crashing to the field and puncturing the tent where they had all sat just minutes before. Another chunk fell from portside, rushing to the ground in a multicolored comet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bea1\" name=\"bea1\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Que l\u00e1stima!</em>\u201d the zombie wailed. \u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Que l\u00e1stima!</em>\u201d His ears filled with a rumbling he would never forget.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"45cd\" name=\"45cd\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"4ad3\" name=\"4ad3\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Vo_IUQp4rETjS59DMeUBsQ.png\" data-height=\"106\" data-image-id=\"1*Vo_IUQp4rETjS59DMeUBsQ.png\" data-width=\"1400\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Vo_IUQp4rETjS59DMeUBsQ.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Vo_IUQp4rETjS59DMeUBsQ.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Vo_IUQp4rETjS59DMeUBsQ.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"b324\" name=\"b324\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">O</span>ne man had taken his suitcase. Another offered him a pink cocktail and a warm towelette. Even the squid waved hello. And now he was standing here, in a long, white arrival hallway, a bit cold, a bit uneven on his feet, but excited to explore his new home.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"082e\" name=\"082e\">He had waited two years for this, had added his name to the sign-up list just as soon as it appeared.

There was so much to see on the new moon campus that he wasn\u2019t sure where he should direct his attention. There was the squid, waving its arms in an endless tank that stretched from the space elevator landing dock all the way to the colony\u2019s first building. There was his new company badge, fluorescent and sparkling, occasionally lighting up as though it were communicating with his new environment. And then there was the girl, the tour guide named Jennie, dressed all in white, just like the rest of them, standing before them with a wide smile.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"14a3\" name=\"14a3\">The group followed Jennie through the hallway, past two large doors that led to the outside, emitting small gasps as they discovered their new home\u200a\u2014\u200aa gray, rocky landscape, groomed to make way for pathways and a gentle river that wound its way around the campus. A series of white two-story buildings sat within a smattering of shallow craters. At the center of it all was the volleyball court, sand freshly combed like a Zen garden, waiting under the dark sky for a new set of players to arrive. Behind the court, a neon cactus with arrows sprouting from its trunk pointed in various directions\u200a\u2014\u200ato the apartments, the mines, the gym, and other destinations. But instead, Jennie led them to the river\u200a\u2014\u200aa narrow, canal-like body filled with a thick, turquoise liquid that Jennie said was resistant to evaporation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8c95\" name=\"8c95\">One of the gondola cafeterias was there waiting for them. Everyone climbed aboard and began to pile around the different food stations as the gondola floated through campus. A muscular, good-looking gondolier made his way down the boat, taking drink orders and offering up the chef\u2019s special moon cookie. For a moment, the man reflected that he had never seen a waiter so well-suited for his job. The smooth gestures, his discreet, attentive style\u200a\u2014\u200ait was like the man had been born to do this.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4264\" name=\"4264\">But it was a passing thought that interested him little, and the man waved the gondolier away as he approached. The man was really only interested in speaking to Jennie. He had seen her somewhere before but couldn\u2019t manage to place her. He watched as she fingered her hair, then removed her white moonjacket. Underneath was a white T-shirt. There was something painted across her chest\u200a\u2014\u200aa moon and a sun, each encircling her breasts. Below them, in black block lettering:</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1bc5\" name=\"1bc5\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ask me about interplanetary feminism</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3d1b\" name=\"3d1b\">That did it\u200a\u2014\u200athis girl was the hot hippie receptionist who used to work in Building 7!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c0fc\" name=\"c0fc\">\u201cI think we\u2019ve met before on Earth,\u201d he said, as she passed by him on the gondola\u2019s noodle stand. \u201cYou\u2019re a campus tour guide, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e266\" name=\"e266\">\u201cI <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">was</em> a campus tour guide,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cI\u2019m now a moon orientation manager.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5ca7\" name=\"5ca7\">\u201cSo, uh, like giving tours of the moon?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0535\" name=\"0535\">\u201cTotally different,\u201d she said. \u201cMy job\u2019s to ensure that you all have a holistic perspective of the moon. First, because we\u2019re building a totally new society here and trying to reverse centuries of patriarchal constructs. And second, because you might get lost if I don\u2019t show you around.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"49d5\" name=\"49d5\">The man was confused; he didn\u2019t know how to answer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8566\" name=\"8566\">He shuffled back to where the rest of his group was sitting.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"047a\" name=\"047a\">\u201cYou know,\u201d said one of the other recruits, who had just seen him with Jennie, \u201cwe have Social Me up here. You can talk to her that way.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2dfb\" name=\"2dfb\">The man was well aware. As a member of the Genie team, he had been part of Social Me\u2019s terrestrial testing pool two years earlier. Unfortunately, the testing period had been short. Once Anahata went to the moon, they had disabled the service on Earth, claiming it had encountered a technical glitch that could only be overcome in a thinner atmosphere. No one believed the excuse, but almost everyone immediately applied for a spot on the moon colony.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b16\" name=\"2b16\">The gondola floated past the collection of Svevonius plants\u200a\u2014\u200aan Anahata creation, still in beta, that dispensed shots of pure oxygen from purple and green stamens\u200a\u2014\u200aand halted outside a large door marked \u201cAnahata 1.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6a0b\" name=\"6a0b\">The group disembarked and entered a huge atrium filled with light. On a white table were twenty devices\u200a\u2014\u200aone for each moongineer. Jennie stood in front of the table and turned toward her group.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"544f\" name=\"544f\">\u201cThe Anahata Space Project is about building a new world of wonderful people doing wonderful things. So, part of your role, like mine, is to help Anahata understand just what that looks like and how it should evolve. But the other part is less experimental. You are also here to work on top-secret projects. We have no worries of corporate espionage or snooping journalists here!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c4b3\" name=\"c4b3\">\u201cNow, Anahata wants to give you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">everything </em>on the moon\u200a\u2014\u200abut in a way that ensures we don\u2019t go the way of the Roman empire. We believe that all good things\u200a\u2014\u200achocolate, kombucha, and all the hot girls on Social Me\u200a\u2014\u200aare best used in moderation.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b220\" name=\"b220\">\u201cSocial Me?\u201d asked the lone female engineer in the group.

Now you\u2019re just a guide.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f5d\" name=\"2f5d\">The smile left Jennie\u2019s face. She opened her mouth to speak but was interrupted by something like a camera flash. The man\u2019s company badge pulsed with purple light, and an image of white text wrote itself across the pitch-black sky.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b78\" name=\"7b78\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Thanks for asking your important question about diversity on the moon. The Anahata Space Project is a pure meritocracy. If there\u2019s a disparity between the numbers of men and women among our engineering workforce, it\u2019s because women don\u2019t excel in science and engineering fields and there\u2019s not a large pipeline for us to hire from. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve contributed to nonprofits that work to help women understand science better from a very young age. We are also speaking out publicly about how important it is that society fix this problem. In the meantime, we have hired many women to work in areas where they can achieve great things.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5c80\" name=\"5c80\">\u201cWell, that\u2019s your answer,\u201d Jennie said flatly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"08a2\" name=\"08a2\">\u201cTell us more about Social Me!\u201d a male voice called out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"29fc\" name=\"29fc\">\u201cWe love Social Me!\u201d shouted another.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e699\" name=\"e699\">That seemed to perk her up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"eddf\" name=\"eddf\">\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to love Social Me,\u201d Jennie grinned. \u201cI actually invented it. I mean, I\u2019m, like, the founder of Social Me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5c8f\" name=\"5c8f\">Jennie began to clap for herself but was cut short by a tall man in the front, waving his hand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8dc1\" name=\"8dc1\">\u201cWhere\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"255e\" name=\"255e\">A frown settled on Jennie\u2019s face for a split second before vanishing. She pointed the tall man down the hall, then turned to the group.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9a19\" name=\"9a19\">\u201cNow let\u2019s talk about the devices you see behind me. They\u2019re moon mobiles, and they have something very special on them. We call it the Manager. It\u2019s essentially a task management application, but integrated into all aspects of your life.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6bc8\" name=\"6bc8\">Jennie grabbed one of the devices from the table and floated it before the crowd like a game-show hostess. As the device passed before the man, his badge vibrated and pulsated again with a purple light. A second later, he was surrounded by images of himself wearing white moon clothes, engaged in everyday activities like eating, sleeping, coding, and composting. No matter what the task, he appeared quite happy and content.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"01ed\" name=\"01ed\">\u201cThe Manager is always running as you go about your day,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cWhen you have breakfast in the morning, it logs that you had breakfast. You will get points for that activity, as our own research demonstrates that engineers who eat breakfast are more likely to come up with a revolutionary idea.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2a4f\" name=\"2a4f\">\u201cNext, you go to work and complete a task. Based on what the task was, you earn more points. For example, a product launch or patent filing earns more points than a small code submission. These points are then redeemed against certain premium activities, which you can request and cash in via the Manager\u200a\u2014\u200alike playing <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">World of Warcraft</em> for an entire weekday or meeting up with a girl on Social Me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a068\" name=\"a068\">\u201cI hear it takes one thousand points to get a date with Jennie,\u201d the man\u2019s friend whispered. \u201cThis guy I know, Sven, he\u2019s filed like forty patents since arriving here, and he spends it all on her.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c90a\" name=\"c90a\">The man looked at Jennie. She caught his eye and grinned just for him. He couldn\u2019t wait to get his hands on her app.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f202\" name=\"f202\">\u201cSo all that stuff we get at Anahata on Earth for free is now suddenly to be earned and paid for?\u201d the female engineer harumphed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cfc1\" name=\"cfc1\">\u201cEverything you had on Earth for free is still free here. Like food, massages, and personal trainers, just to name a few. But on the moon we also offer \u2018extraordinary experiences\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200athings that all of us would like to do but, if not done in moderation, could be really dangerous for the individual and the project as a whole. It\u2019s like we\u2019re giving you legal heroin\u200a\u2014\u200abut making sure you can\u2019t have it all the time. After all, no one wants you to become a drug addict, end up in a lunar gutter, and force all of us to do a really awkward intervention.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"321e\" name=\"321e\">The female harumpher kept harumphing. The man hoped she wouldn\u2019t be assigned to the same team as him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5c7a\" name=\"5c7a\">\u201cNow, of course, different people want different things,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cSo, while you may want to spend all of your points on Social Me, someone else may want to never have to lift their arm when they eat cereal in the morning. So that person will want to spend all their points on a personal feeder. Or maybe someone wants to have a go at playing on the moon crane for an hour. Not a problem\u200a\u2014\u200ajust submit twenty moon points to the Manager.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e920\" name=\"e920\">\u201cUsing the Manager, you can trade services or ask for a task to be performed for you\u200a\u2014\u200aat the price you\u2019re willing to offer. You can outsource what you hate and earn extra points by doing what you love. We\u2019ve gotten rid of money and liberated people in the process. It\u2019s a revolutionary economic approach.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cc59\" name=\"cc59\">\u201cBut you said the app is constantly logging what we do. Doesn\u2019t that mean Anahata is essentially following us all the time?\u201d the female engineer asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a3fb\" name=\"a3fb\">\u201cIt\u2019s entirely your choice whether you opt in to use the tool,\u201d Jennie said. \u201cDo you really think we\u2019d get away with designing an app for engineers that <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">wasn\u2019t </em>opt-in?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f88e\" name=\"f88e\">The crowd laughed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1e63\" name=\"1e63\">\u201cOf course, it does mean you won\u2019t be earning points,\u201d Jennie winked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"90aa\" name=\"90aa\">\u201cAlso, if, like me, you think a mobile app is <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">so</em> last century, you can choose to have the Manager installed in your body via a small, elegant incision.\u201d Jennie turned her palm and pointed at an invisible spot above her wrist. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9afe\" name=\"9afe\">\u201cIt all sounds like a sci-fi dystopia,\u201d the female engineer grumbled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e9af\" name=\"e9af\">Jennie smiled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6fc1\" name=\"6fc1\">\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the balance right between community management and dystopia. We think you\u2019ll find this all works really well, but definitely give us feedback via the online form. After all, this is Anahata, and what do we do?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0673\" name=\"0673\">\u201cWe solutionize and iterate!\u201d shouted the new moongineers.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"2ce1\" name=\"2ce1\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-height=\"149\" data-image-id=\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\" data-width=\"1401\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\" id=\"ed00\" name=\"ed00\">EPILOGUE</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h3\" id=\"e819\" name=\"e819\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">F</span>rom behind the observation glass, Gregor watched the new recruits as they floated past his office.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0b12\" name=\"0b12\">\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said a voice behind him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f10\" name=\"5f10\">Gregor turned briefly to acknowledge Bobby. Although it was already late afternoon, Bobby was still wearing his white pajamas. Atop his head, as on Gregor\u2019s, sat a white beret\u200a\u2014\u200athe latest improvement on Anahata\u2019s internet sombrero.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d898\" name=\"d898\">Gregor\u2019s gaze moved to the full-length screen on the opposite wall. He silently commanded his beret to flip past live camera footage of the cafeteria and a moonball game, then paused on one of the child prodigies sitting in his moon apartment. The boy was playing a video game, his hand reaching up now and then to pick at the pimples scattered across his cheeks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9482\" name=\"9482\">Bobby took a step closer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5dc3\" name=\"5dc3\">\u201cWhich one\u2019s that\u200a\u2014\u200aJonas? He looks a bit different to me. New haircut?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ee21\" name=\"ee21\">\u201cNo haircut, but we\u2019ve made improvements to him and the others over the past few weeks.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e052\" name=\"e052\">Gregor ran his fingers along the rim of his beret as if he was playing the piano. Jonas paused his video game, stood, and crossed the room to his small kitchen, where he removed some apples from the bowl.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a535\" name=\"a535\">\u201cYou\u2019ve convinced the engineers to eat fruit?\u201d Bobby asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9e4b\" name=\"9e4b\">Just then, the apples went flying into the air, orbiting the space above Jonas like a collection of small planets. One by one, they fell into his hands, touching his fingers for a split second before shooting up again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cc09\" name=\"cc09\">\u201cYou\u2019ve taught him to juggle!\u201d Bobby clapped. \u201cWas it nontrivial to execute?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0ae0\" name=\"0ae0\">\u201cNot really.

Jonas removed his shirt and unscrewed the metal plate embedded in his chest. He extracted a series of purple and green bolts and chips from inside his chest cavity and began to polish them with a nearby cloth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"89d7\" name=\"89d7\">\u201cGregor, this may well be your finest work. You\u2019ve thought of everything. Our child prodigy even repairs himself!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d1b1\" name=\"d1b1\">\u201cSome challenges remain,\u201d said Gregor, holding up his hand to pause Bobby\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cFor example, we\u2019ve made our prodigies technically and physically capable of almost anything, but emotionally, we can\u2019t seem to push them into adulthood.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39e6\" name=\"39e6\">He gestured at Jonas. \u201cThis one has an IQ of 184 but the emotional intelligence of a fourteen-year-old. It seems the smarter we make them, the more they regress emotionally.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d8f9\" name=\"d8f9\">Bobby shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it. For now, sentience is simply a means to an end. What we need is an army.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f17b\" name=\"f17b\">\u201cYes, the army. You\u2019ll be pleased to know that over the past month we\u2019ve managed to embed five of our child prodigies in Galt\u2019s engineering team.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b54c\" name=\"b54c\">\u201cAnd no one\u2019s caught on?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8ac8\" name=\"8ac8\">\u201cNot as far as we can tell. Once we created the cover\u200a\u2014\u200athat the young geniuses were recruited from poor foreign countries\u200a\u2014\u200athen we could hide all sorts of shortcomings, like their lack of school records, or the occasional failing of our English translation tool. It was all much easier than we expected. We signed their names to some open source projects and waited for the Galt recruiters to come after them.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e192\" name=\"e192\">\u201cGalt!\u201d Bobby laughed. \u201cThey seemed like such a threat once.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"413e\" name=\"413e\">\u201cThey <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">were</em> a legitimate threat,\u201d Gregor nodded. \u201cBut they went too far when they tried to reduce all communication on Flitter to just three syllables.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b5ce\" name=\"b5ce\">\u201cReduction will one day be <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">so</em> last century,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cIn the future, all people will want to do is expand\u200a\u2014\u200ato find more ways to talk about themselves, to be and become themselves. More words, more sounds, more pictures. Less thinking, but more of everything. In the future, we will all be very, very large. Galt will be so tiny, no one will even see them.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b920\" name=\"b920\">A gong chimed the hour, and Gregor switched to a camera trained on the colony\u2019s entrance. It was time for the squid\u2019s evening feeding, a special moment Gregor and Bobby shared each day.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5681\" name=\"5681\">Gregor zoomed in, and the squid\u2019s body filled the screen, its heaving mass seemingly threatening to break the glass. The men watched as its horny beak tore apart two fish at once. It seemed much happier now that it had a larger space to roam.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f1f2\" name=\"f1f2\">\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about Project Y expansion,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1181\" name=\"1181\">\u201cIt\u2019s an obvious next step,\u201d Gregor nodded. \u201cBut there will be some resistance. We\u2019ll have to convince people that our way is the right way.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f64a\" name=\"f64a\">Bobby sighed. \u201cI know the world needs stupid people, but sometimes I wish we could just get rid of them.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1406\" name=\"1406\">\u201cWe don\u2019t need to get rid of them. We just have to convince them,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cWhat if we open-sourced the project and made it freely available so that everyone can benefit? People like things that aren\u2019t controlled by corporations.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d0cc\" name=\"d0cc\">\u201cBut if it\u2019s free, people won\u2019t believe it\u2019s any good,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cAnd if we open-source it, then that means people can do what they want with it. And you and I both know that the best society is the one that Anahata controls\u200a\u2014\u200anot the one that it simply inspires.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0d24\" name=\"0d24\">\u201cWe could go to other planets,\u201d Gregor suggested. \u201cNeptune or Mars could be doable.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3fd5\" name=\"3fd5\">Bobby brightened and started to answer but was distracted by a blinking message on the screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"67a3\" name=\"67a3\">\u201cOh, it\u2019s Arsyen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember him\u200a\u2014\u200athe product manager who took over Pyrrhia. I\u2019ve added him to my World Leaders Mentorship Program.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"363a\" name=\"363a\">Bobby tapped his beret, and Arsyen\u2019s image filled the screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4d3b\" name=\"4d3b\">\u201cHello,\u201d said Bobby, waving at the screen. \u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cbff\" name=\"cbff\">Arsyen shook his head. \u201cPeople complain, always complaining. And there is crazy woman, my ex-girlfriend. She say I am capitalist-pig king who destroy country. She and her dirty students want to kill me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0898\" name=\"0898\">\u201cYou will not be recognized as a great leader until you are assassinated,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cThat is the price of freedom.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b67e\" name=\"b67e\">Arsyen frowned. \u201cI give no freedom. Why would I do that?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1336\" name=\"1336\">\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cLet\u2019s cover it in our next session. Anything else I can help you with?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ef9b\" name=\"ef9b\">\u201cYes, I have idea\u200a\u2014\u200abig idea,\u201d said Arsyen, grinning. \u201cI want you to make new Anahata here in Poodlekek. Clean place, with volleyball and croquet courts. Juice bar. Pretty online sales girls. Together we make Silicon Poodle.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3053\" name=\"3053\">\u201cSilicon Poodle,\u201d Bobby repeated.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"70c7\" name=\"70c7\">\u201cI make deal with you. You give me new palace and video games, I give you Silicon Poodle.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cecd\" name=\"cecd\">\u201cYou mean you outsource the country to us?\u201d asked Gregor, exchanging a glance with Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e380\" name=\"e380\">\u201cOutsource?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a474\" name=\"a474\">\u201cIt means to improve something by giving it to someone else to take care of it for you,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cYou outsource Pyrrhia to us, and we\u2019ll improve it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c3e4\" name=\"c3e4\">\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Arsyen, waving his hand. \u201cYou do what you want. Just make me big palace and get rid of dirty students.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2e4c\" name=\"2e4c\">\u201cWe will need to think about it,\u201d said Gregor, glancing at Bobby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"435c\" name=\"435c\">\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Bobby said, \u201cbut there is no reward without risk. No chalice of hope without a well of\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2685\" name=\"2685\">\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Gregor said. He touched his beret, and Arsyen\u2019s face disappeared from the screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c22\" name=\"1c22\">Bobby and Gregor sat in silence. The squid wiggled before them on the opposite wall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3f9d\" name=\"3f9d\">\u201cGregor, I want you to think of a drop of water as it flings itself over the waterfall\u2026Are you thinking of it?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a9f0\" name=\"a9f0\">\u201cYes, Bobby.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6fa3\" name=\"6fa3\">\u201cBy itself, that drop of water is just a drop of water. But when it joins with other drops, it becomes a river, then eventually becomes an ocean. One drop leads to two drops leads to an ocean. No one can live without the ocean.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9a54\" name=\"9a54\">Gregor was silent for a moment, then spoke.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dc3a\" name=\"dc3a\">\u201cYou mean we start with Pyrrhia, and then expand Project Y to the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"022d\" name=\"022d\">\u201cExactly,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c55f\" name=\"c55f\">\u201cBut\u2026if Arsyen outsources Pyrrhia to us, then we just govern his ignorant masses instead. How is that a good thing? Our moon colony works precisely because it <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">doesn\u2019t</em> cater to the masses.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f32b\" name=\"f32b\">\u201cWatch,\u201d said Bobby, walking over to the whiteboard, where he drew a collection of circles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b36\" name=\"6b36\">He wrote \u201cP\u201d in the middle of the center circle and tapped his pen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f194\" name=\"f194\">\u201cWe get Pyrrhia, we kick everyone out, and then we start from scratch just like we did with Project Y. Only the best and brightest of Pyrrhia will be part of the new society, which will be built on the same principles as Y.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6eb6\" name=\"6eb6\">\u201cAnd the rejects\u200a\u2014\u200athe ones who don\u2019t make it into the Pyrrhian utopia?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6080\" name=\"6080\">\u201cWe push them into Embria\u200a\u2014\u200aright here, next to Pyrrhia, you see? They are poor and won\u2019t be able to put up a fight. And when they protest, which of course they will, since normal people never recognize enlightenment, we will offer them the same deal: Let us run your country and make it perfect. Then we push their rejects into the next country, which will weaken that country and make them easier to\u2026help. One by one, the Earth\u2019s countries will begin to fall. They will all become terrestrial versions of our Space Project.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"03a2\" name=\"03a2\">\u201cEventually we\u2019ll run into a border that won\u2019t accept the rejects from all of our perfect societies,\u201d Gregor said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a20b\" name=\"a20b\">\u201cYes, but we leave those countries to the end, at which point our model will be obvious and desirable even to them. And if not, well, we have our army of child prodigies we can deploy to\u2026pacify them.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"afff\" name=\"afff\">\u201cAnd the masses of rejects?\u201d said Gregor, pointing at the collection of frowning stick figures that Bobby had drawn outside his circles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5aae\" name=\"5aae\">\u201cWe\u2019ll give them the chance to improve themselves by providing STEM schooling in the reject refugee camps that we\u2019ll establish in Siberia. And those who never improve themselves will be kept in Siberia, or maybe stored in a country that we could just purchase outright for this purpose\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe Canada. You can work that part out later. Anyway, the best part is that the more people we reject, the more parents will emphasize the importance of an engineering and science education. So, you see, this is good for humanity on multiple fronts.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"97ae\" name=\"97ae\">\u201cBut what if other countries come to Pyrrhia\u2019s defense?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3995\" name=\"3995\">\u201cWe won\u2019t <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">invade</em> anything. These countries will <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">want </em>our new world order,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cThey\u2019ll invite us in\u200a\u2014\u200ayou know, like you do with vampires.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b325\" name=\"b325\">Gregor nodded slowly, working through the numbers in his head.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"23d3\" name=\"23d3\">\u201cThis all seems very doable,\u201d he said. \u201cThough my team will need considerably more servers if we\u2019re going to tackle world domination.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d278\" name=\"d278\">\u201cJeez, Gregor, I\u2019m not talking about taking over the world,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5063\" name=\"5063\">Gregor\u2019s stiff, bushy eyebrows lifted slightly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"78e8\" name=\"78e8\">Bobby laughed. \u201cOkay, I guess I <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">am</em> talking about world domination. So, let\u2019s see\u2026we\u2019ll need more marketing schwag, more in-country cafeterias and masseuses. This is going to get expensive. It\u2019s not very fair\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, we\u2019re practically a nonprofit. Good work on behalf of society should be free.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"df59\" name=\"df59\">\u201cSo a country would pay us to invade them?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4a55\" name=\"4a55\">\u201cNot invading, Gregor, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">empowering</em>. Once we have a handful of Anahata-run countries, world domination will fund itself. But we do need to figure out an extra revenue stream to fund the initial rollout.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0813\" name=\"0813\">\u201cHow about we just automate everything and install a robot race?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b197\" name=\"b197\">\u201cUgh, think of all the social unrest we\u2019d have to wade through once the humans aren\u2019t really necessary anymore. And it\u2019ll just be too economically efficient\u200a\u2014\u200athere will be no one but robots left to buy our stuff.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7347\" name=\"7347\">\u201cBut we won\u2019t need money because robots don\u2019t need money,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cIn utopian societies, money becomes\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"35be\" name=\"35be\">\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want a robot society until our life-extension project is fully functional. After all, this is all pretty pointless if a robot can just kill me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9764\" name=\"9764\">Bobby turned to face the whiteboard and made a quick sketch of what appeared to be a lima bean.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"60ce\" name=\"60ce\">\u201cThe brain,\u201d said Bobby, tapping at the bean with his pen. \u201cThat\u2019s the answer. One day we will pay for everything with our thoughts.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"301e\" name=\"301e\">\u201cAn integration with the brain chip?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"25b9\" name=\"25b9\">\u201cOh, Gregor.\u201d Bobby smiled, shaking his head. \u201cI admire your ability to live in the present. I must confess it can get awfully lonely in the future\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f38f\" name=\"f38f\">Bobby\u2019s voice trailed. Gregor followed his gaze toward the observation glass, where a group of men and women strolled past. A blonde girl tossed her head and laughed. The sound of her shrill voice scratched like long, pink fingernails at Gregor\u2019s ears, but the engineer next to her was beaming. With them were a group of men, casually engaged in moonball as they made their way to work. Following a few steps behind them was a Horizontal Moves employee\u200a\u2014\u200aa Jack or Greg or Bif or Stu, his arms packed with useful muscles. He was balancing a mop and a load of fresh laundry as he followed the larger group toward the engineers\u2019 apartments. Everyone had their place.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"330b\" name=\"330b\">Gregor turned to the founder.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d839\" name=\"d839\">Bobby caught his eye and smiled.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1bb2\" name=\"1bb2\">\u201cYou know who could figure out how to monetize all of this?

The squid\u2019s body was thumping against the tank, its arms grabbing one, then another stalk of kelp, using them like poles to propel its incredible mass forward. Two arms, then four, then six, and eight, the arms grasped at whatever they could reach, kicking up sea dust as the squid\u2019s mouth dropped open, chomping at the water, its horny beak spearing any aquatic traveler as it swam through the water.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"893b\" name=\"893b\">\u201cLower the tank,\u201d Bobby commanded his beret.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a8b9\" name=\"a8b9\">Panels slid out from the under the tank, and the structure began to drop below the ground.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6cbe\" name=\"6cbe\">With a faint click, the tank disappeared below the surface, and the panels slid shut.

named Fred.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9e78\\\" id=\\\"9e78\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe northwest wall of the Palo Alto Sea Park shark tank broke at four a.m. on a hot August night, releasing into the park 780,000 gallons of water and fourteen angry sharks. They rode the wave in one sharp-toothed tsunami, penetrating the dolphin tank with open mouths, chasing the dolphins into new parts of the park.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c07d\\\" id=\\\"c07d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eDown came the manatee tank, the penguin\u2019s pen, and the piglet squid viewing room. The flamingo hut and the snake house withstood the pressure but flooded with water, the animals\u2019 terrestrial enclosures suddenly transformed into muddy aquariums. Noah\u2019s ark was now subject to a Darwinian reorganization in which for a few breathless seconds, snakes became exotic fish, tails dropping vertically like flutes bobbing in the water until they finally sank to the floor. Nearby, the flamingos honked in terror, their pink necks popping up above the waves like unfastened hooks, tangling in each other until they dropped below the surface.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3d01\\\" id=\\\"3d01\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAs the water from the tanks expanded to the edges of the park, the depths once housing the sea\u2019s greatest creatures were now reduced to mere puddles. Fish were left flapping against the asphalt; the beluga whale flattened seahorses and starfish as it barreled its way through the park in search of arctic water. No longer traveling forward with carnivorous glee, the sharks came to a stop near the snack bar and began rolling about on their dolphin-stuffed bellies, emitting wimpy cries that would have delighted fish lower on the totem pole were they too not gasping in their newly parched environment. Within minutes, self-pity transformed to anger, and in their final moments, the sharks turned on each other in a cannibalistic bloodbath.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3641\\\" id=\\\"3641\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt all happened so quickly that by the time the rescue crews arrived, there was little left to salvage. The crew moved swiftly from one section of the park to the next, their faces increasingly grim. The manta rays spread flat like leathery carpets, the snakes roping above them in a bloated tangle. Colorful fish lay on their sides, mouths gaping, scales shifting like crystals in the slowly rising sun.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2e7f\\\" id=\\\"2e7f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWord quickly spread of the catastrophe, and television news helicopters soon circled above. Everyone was looking for Belbo, Palo Alto\u2019s beloved walrus and official mascot. The rescue crew finally discovered the aquarium\u2019s prized pinniped underneath one of the felled walls, her death exacted by a slab of heavy concrete.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9bcd\\\" id=\\\"9bcd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAs the leader of the rescue crew turned to declare the end of their efforts, a loud croak bellowed from the northwest corner of the park. The crew ran toward the sound, which now repeated, like a foghorn, over and over. It was coming from the marine-themed jungle gym, one of the few structures that had survived the flood, thanks to its distance from the shark and dolphin tanks. As the crew approached, they saw a gray mass swaying atop the slide, partially blocking the sun. The rescuers shielded their eyes for a better view, and soon its form grew clearer. It was a one-eyed sea lion with a patch on its left eye.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"08a3\\\" id=\\\"08a3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAt the sight of the rescue team, the sea lion barked again and clapped its hands. It balanced a ball on its nose, then put its weight on its front flippers and lifted its tail up behind its head. Without thinking, the rescue crew laughed and clapped.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5c13\\\" id=\\\"5c13\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThen the sea lion jumped onto its belly and sailed down the slide, landing on its stomach, flappers out to its side and a smile on its face. The crew rushed to hug the sea lion, to applaud its survival skills, to hail the new mascot of Palo Alto. The animal clapped its hands again and croaked three times, and across Silicon Valley, the sea lion\u2019s bark dried the tears of the children watching the live news broadcasts. The sea lion showed them hope amid this sea of destruction.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f779\\\" id=\\\"f779\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOne of the newscasters named it Fred.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bae0\\\" id=\\\"bae0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eA few months later, when the ground had finally dried and the bitter memories of the lost aquarium had faded for all but lawyers and insurance companies, the lot was purchased by a young internet company called Anahata. The founder of the company demanded that Fred be included as part of the property deal.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"95c2\\\" id=\\\"95c2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eFred was given his own wading pool next to the founder\u2019s office but spent most of his time waddling about the company\u2019s halls, pooping in the cubicles and barking at employees he didn\u2019t like, forcing Anahata\u2019s engineers to purchase sound-reduction headphones so they could work undisturbed. Fred did as he pleased and, in doing so, impressed everyone with his stubborn refusal to change his ways.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8d12\\\" id=\\\"8d12\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhen Fred died of old age a few years later, all the employees gathered to pay their respects. During the dedication of a commemorative aquarium in the company\u2019s main building, the founder of Anahata, a man named Bobby Bonilo, told his employees that it was Fred who had taught him how to run his company. Fred, he said, had proven that it was fine to have one eye and waddle if you were better than anyone else at doing those things.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5520\\\" id=\\\"5520\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNo one understood the metaphor, but all the employees committed it to memory as important career advice.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0aa4\\\" id=\\\"0aa4\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe commemorative aquarium was soon filled with brightly colored fish and crustaceans, as well as a giant squid the founder flew back from a remote island in the Pacific. The squid wowed the crowd with its undulating arms, which extended almost the full length of the tank, and its chomping mouth, which tore apart most of the fish the moment they were dropped in the water.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0ce9\\\" id=\\\"0ce9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNearly a decade on, the squid is nearly the size of a school bus and the aquarium\u2019s only remaining inhabitant. It floats in the central building of Anahata, today the world\u2019s largest and most powerful technology company.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"33e0\\\" id=\\\"33e0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\\\" data-width=\\\"1401\\\" data-height=\\\"149\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"7465\\\" id=\\\"7465\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\\\" data-width=\\\"1401\\\" data-height=\\\"107\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7707\\\" id=\\\"7707\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eTo\\x3c/span\\x3e interview at Anahata was a privilege. And the next, nearly inevitable step\u200a\u2014\u200ato be rejected from Anahata\u200a\u2014\u200awas a great honor. Just making it into the company\u2019s lobby already indicated that one was superior to 99.39 percent of the world\u2019s population. To be accepted, of course, required passing an even higher bar.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b009\\\" id=\\\"b009\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOne by one, the gobsmacked Rejects filed past the Hopefuls sitting in the lobby, as unsure of their steps as they now were of their qualifications. They turned back to catch a final glimpse of Anahata\u2019s collection of gleaming white buildings, and smiled then, just briefly, knowing that despite their failure\u200a\u2014\u200aa failure from which they might never recover\u200a\u2014\u200aat least they were among the few to have glimpsed the world hidden behind the company\u2019s doors.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9880\\\" id=\\\"9880\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eArsyen Aimo surveyed his surroundings. It couldn\u2019t have been a friendlier place: wide green sofas, a gigantic refrigerator full of fresh juices, and a flight simulator to help pass the time in the unlikely event of a delay.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ed38\\\" id=\\\"ed38\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSitting on the very edge of the first couch was a young man, hair uncombed, T-shirt wrinkled, emitting a faint odor of sweat. Crumbs of breakfast cereal cast a pebbled road across his chest. A thin folder jittered in his hand, its transparency revealing a document whose tidy bullet points and blurbs belied the man\u2019s unkempt appearance. His knees bounced lightly up and down, and he rocked as he sat, lips moving silently as though he were counting to himself.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"cac4\\\" id=\\\"cac4\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOn the second couch was another man, this one in his mid-thirties and wearing a suit, his cologne the essence of a crisp morning in the mountains. His back was against the sofa, one ankle thrown across the opposite knee, an arm thrown over the cushion as if he were there to watch Sunday football. He kept checking his watch, darting glances both anxious and dismissive at the female receptionists.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"08d9\\\" id=\\\"08d9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eArsyen immediately recognized their types. The first was an engineer, the second a salesman. And there was no reason for Arsyen to think any more of either of them\u200a\u2014\u200aor the other fifteen iterations also waiting in the lobby\u200a\u2014\u200aas he had seen enough of both during his time in the Valley to identify their species by smell alone.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5b2a\\\" id=\\\"5b2a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eArsyen had other things on his mind; he was there to conquer his job interview. For he was Arsyen, Prince of Pyrrhia.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"875f\\\" id=\\\"875f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOr rather, a former prince who due to unfortunate circumstances had been reduced to working as a janitor in Silicon Valley.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"80bd\\\" id=\\\"80bd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOr, as he preferred to refer to it, a sanitation engineer.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7f9f\\\" id=\\\"7f9f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNot that he liked cleaning. He hated it. Prince Arsyen had not been raised in the Order of the Red Woodpecker\u200a\u2014\u200abuffed and preened and rubbed and polished to perfection by handmaidens each morning\u200a\u2014\u200awith the idea that he would leave the royal palace and clean people\u2019s toilets in America. (As a child, Arsyen didn\u2019t even know how to use a toilet, thanks to the service of his royal wipers.)\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6069\\\" id=\\\"6069\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut like most everything he undertook in life, Arsyen excelled at janitorial work\u200a\u2014\u200ahe was so good, in fact, that he usually finished his work in half the time of other janitors. Previous employers had occasionally misinterpreted his skill as laziness and accused him of not having logged sufficient time with the mop. But Arsyen knew that a truly exceptional company would see it differently.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ce7b\\\" id=\\\"ce7b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAnahata was that company, and this was no ordinary janitorial job. It paid better than any other Silicon Valley company by a full $3 an hour. If all went according to plan, in a few decades, Arsyen would save enough money to raise an army and reverse the unfortunate circumstances that had driven him from his country. His future, and the future of his adoring minions, depended on the outcome of this interview.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"17ff\\\" id=\\\"17ff\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eA recruiter entered the room, and the crowd of hopefuls looked his way.\\x3cstrong class=\\\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\\\"\\x3e \\x3c/strong\\x3eHis casual good looks and affable demeanor struck Arsyen as an effective ambassador for a company whose public image was one of approachable superiority.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8a17\\\" id=\\\"8a17\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cArsyen Aimo?\u201d the recruiter read from a sheet of paper.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d3c3\\\" id=\\\"d3c3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ePrince Arsyen, \\x3c/em\\x3eArsyen silently corrected him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bfdb\\\" id=\\\"bfdb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe recruiter used a badge to push past the security doors, and Arsyen\u2019s mouth moved in a silent \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eWow \\x3c/em\\x3eas he entered the building.

One could see across the entire building in a glance. Colorful beanbags were sprinkled here and there, and sleep capsules lined the walls, emitting the faint lullaby of snoring engineers. Each corner and space was maximized to project a sense of possibility, and employees seemed to congregate wherever the mood struck\u200a\u2014\u200aa beanbag suddenly the appropriate place for a conference call; a foosball or pingpong table a surface to plop one\u2019s computer.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3f94\\\" id=\\\"3f94\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cExtra.

He simply nodded and then motioned for Arsyen to follow. They made their way toward the opposite end of the building, then exited into a sunny courtyard and an immense stretch of pert, healthy grass that should never have been able to grow in California\u2019s desert landscape but seemed the natural complement to the bright, white buildings encircling the lawn. Palm trees swayed to an invisible breeze, casting the image of an island paradise in the expansive windows of each structure. For a brief moment, as they walked across a glass bridge over a small creek, Anahata\u2019s green, watery visions of itself surrounding them on all sides, Arsyen wondered which way was up. Legs and sand suddenly joined to palm trees in the reflections, and Arsyen turned, scanning the lawn for their origin. After a few seconds, he found them: a group of tanned girls in their early twenties playing volleyball on a sand court.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b525\\\" id=\\\"b525\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eArsyen studied their long limbs and sun-bleached ponytails. They leaped across the sand like lip-glossed gazelles. \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eI love America\\x3c/em\\x3e, he thought to himself. But he wasn\u2019t the only one watching. Amid the palm and water reflections on the windows, Arsyen could spot a face here and there, male onlookers with cheeks pressed up against the glass.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b20c\\\" id=\\\"b20c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThey entered a new building, similar to the previous one, and Arsyen was ushered into a small, white room. It looked like a normal office, except all the walls were made of glass\u200a\u2014\u200aa familiar layout in Silicon Valley. For most employees, these spaces were a symbol of transparency and openness. For sanitation engineers like Arsyen, they were just an invitation for dirty fingerprints.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5bc1\\\" id=\\\"5bc1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe recruiter sat Arsyen at a table in the center of the room.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"dd74\\\" id=\\\"dd74\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cWe\u2019ve found that it\u2019s most efficient for everyone to take a test before we invest in a conversation,\u201d he said.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"211e\\\" id=\\\"211e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cSorry?\u201d said Arsyen, perpetually annoyed that the English language required him to apologize when it was others who were unclear.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4969\\\" id=\\\"4969\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cYou\u2019re going to take a test now.

It was inescapable in the Valley\u200a\u2014\u200aon buses and billboards, hats and T-shirts. Valley people spoke of code like it was an act of progress, on par with a social movement. Over the years, as he mopped and scrubbed in the background, Arsyen had overheard more than a few hallway conversations in which scrawny men talked about using their code to change the world.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"823a\\\" id=\\\"823a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut knowing how to recognize code and knowing\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3e how\\x3c/em\\x3e to code were two very different things. Surely there was no way he could be expected to perform such a task. Arsyen grunted. It was in moments like this that he particularly missed his home country of Pyrrhia. There he would have had any number of servants who could have learned computer programming on his behalf.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"100b\\\" id=\\\"100b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3ePerhaps this was the right moment to inform the recruiter of his royal lineage. There had been no applicable dropdown box in the online application; no way for Arsyen to signal that he was not simply a great janitor, but someone whose very greatness had once been written into his country\u2019s constitution.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1431\\\" id=\\\"1431\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut such a direct declaration struck Arsyen as rather crass\u200a\u2014\u200aroyalty was to be recognized, not announced.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d2ea\\\" id=\\\"d2ea\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOf course, that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t help things along with a discreet nod toward his heritage. Arsyen ignored the recruiter\u2019s prompt to find the coding error\u200a\u2014\u200ahe had no clue, and in any case, such details were for clerks and commoners. Instead, he sketched a crude outline of a pointy crown across the length of the page.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bd50\\\" id=\\\"bd50\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cDone,\u201d announced Arsyen, pushing the paper across the table.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2b46\\\" id=\\\"2b46\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe recruiter glanced at Arsyen\u2019s paper and did a double take. \u201cWell, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ethat\u2019s\\x3c/em\\x3e a bold statement,\u201d he said finally, then excused himself and left the room.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7c55\\\" id=\\\"7c55\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMinutes later, a slightly balding man in his thirties entered carrying a brown paper bag. He was wearing a purple T-shirt with an orange cartoon character on the front; the sandals on his feet were made of red plastic. Arsyen was surprised by the ensemble. From what he had seen during his time in America, most sanitation engineers dressed inconspicuously, their very livelihood dependent on being able to make dirt\u200a\u2014\u200aand themselves\u200a\u2014\u200aas invisible as possible to the general population.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"934e\\\" id=\\\"934e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThis man looked more like a court jester.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"58a7\\\" id=\\\"58a7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cHi, I\u2019m Roni,\u201d he said, setting Arsyen\u2019s test on the table and extending his hand. \u201cYou got a r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0cdd\\\" id=\\\"0cdd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eArsyen shook his head.

Galt was one of the Valley\u2019s hottest startups, famous for having created a bunch of apps and tools that eliminated the tedium of journalism, research, essays, and speeches by reducing all thought and opinion to easily shareable, bite-sized chunks. Everything they did was about minimization\u200a\u2014\u200amaking the world \u201ceasier to digest.\u201d Some people predicted Galt was the next Anahata, though personally, Arsyen had found the company lacked any creativity or vision and was always asking him to take a second pass at the men\u2019s stalls.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"68c9\\\" id=\\\"68c9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cGalt, eh?

And so on and so on. So it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to agree on a proposal right from the start\u200a\u2014\u200abut also maximize their profit. It\u2019s basically a distribution problem.

He was assigned to Building 7, which housed some of the company\u2019s coolest projects, like Social Car and Builder. Maybe she could butter up to him and he could get her a job there. Though, on second thought, Arsyen seemed a little creepy and could misinterpret her intentions. The last thing Jennie needed was another work drama. A few weeks earlier she had made the mistake of hooking up with Niels Smeardon, Anahata\u2019s SVP of sales. She had done everything he wanted\u200a\u2014\u200atold him that his penis and sales strategy presentation were the biggest she had ever seen; she even let him balance his computer on her back so he could send a few urgent emails right after they had sex. And all of that had gotten her nothing but a reassignment by the HR team to the main reception area, far away from the sales buildings.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a038\\\" id=\\\"a038\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJennie continued to stew about her Niels hookup as she began to rattle off other campus facts to Arsyen. Sales were in Buildings 10 to 15, Operations from 15 to 20, anything supporting those teams from 20 to 27, and facilities and janitorial staff in Building 28. She saw Arsyen nod when she mentioned the janitors and wondered if he was one of those social activist employees, the type who made six figures but liked to spend the majority of his work hours railing about The Man and trying to make the cafeterias go full vegan.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6292\\\" id=\\\"6292\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJennie found those employees a bit annoying\u200a\u2014\u200athey were always complaining about the juice selection in the reception area\u200a\u2014\u200abut she still preferred them to people like Niels. He had taken home more than $100 million dollars last year in executive pay but hadn\u2019t even offered to order her a car ride home.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"039c\\\" id=\\\"039c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cWhat do you do at Anahata?\u201d asked Arsyen, interrupting Jennie\u2019s thoughts.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"edb3\\\" id=\\\"edb3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWas he just trying to make conversation, or was he questioning her competence?

Building 2 had moving walkways that would reverse direction every fifteen minutes\u200a\u2014\u200aa challenge to either time one\u2019s movements precisely or exercise by moving against the current.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0f94\\\" id=\\\"0f94\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cPast that door is the volleyball court,\u201d said Jennie, pointing just beyond the reversible walkway, \u201cand to the right is the swimming pool.

Each contained a handful of desks, and occasionally a table. The white walls were only shoulder height, and Arsyen could easily see who was inside. The view was the same no matter where he turned: square after square of men staring at their computer screens. The layout reminded him of ice cube trays.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f337\\\" id=\\\"f337\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRoni stopped next to a poster that read \u201cEntering a No Galt Zone!\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a7bc\\\" id=\\\"a7bc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cVoil\u00e0!,\u201d exclaimed Roni, his arm gesturing at the cubicle before him like a game show host.

Arsyen wondered why his fellow sanitation engineers were working on computers, and why there were no cleaning materials anywhere in sight. Perhaps cleaning happened differently at Anahata. Thoughts of unknown methods immediately filled his head, his exhilaration only slightly tempered by the sight of Red Bull cans stacked in a pyramid atop a side table. Roni grabbed an unopened can and tossed it to Arsyen. \u201cLife blood,\u201d he joked, grabbing one for himself.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4bb9\\\" id=\\\"4bb9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRoni tapped one of the cubicle dwellers on the shoulder.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5a75\\\" id=\\\"5a75\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cJonas, meet Arsyen,\u201d he said.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4413\\\" id=\\\"4413\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe seated figure turned slowly, and Arsyen realized that the gangly, pimply boy before him couldn\u2019t be more than sixteen. His skin was a shifting kaleidoscope of sallow and dark blotches. Enormous glasses covered his face from the eyebrows to the tip of the nose. Through the frames, his eyes studied Arsyen, and then moved to Roni, and then suddenly seemed to register the purpose of the introduction. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, in a thick but familiar accent. \u201cIt is nice to make your acquaintance.

The company\u2019s CEO, Bobby Bonilo, had forbidden the use of any electronic devices in the room, and the clock was the only way his management team could measure the progress of their interminable meetings. According to its current movements, one minute (soon to be minus one minute) had passed since Bobby had begun his latest yoga pose. Gregor Guntlag, Anahata\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, had many projects in the works to speed up time, but to date, even he couldn\u2019t manage to accelerate Bobby\u2019s sun salutations.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"979f\\\" id=\\\"979f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa,\u201d came a deep, raspy sound from the back of Bobby\u2019s throat. He was on all fours at the head of the table, his butt thrust toward the ceiling, the top of his white shirt falling to expose a pale back covered with moles. Bobby rested his knees on the table and sat back on his legs, a small gut spilling over his waistband like freshly baked bread. His eyes remained closed.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6332\\\" id=\\\"6332\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d The sound intensified. \u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa!

In addition to Gregor, there was Old Al, the company\u2019s only gray-haired engineer, occasionally useful for his fifty-four years of wisdom. A few seats down sat Greg Fischer, the chief financial and corporate affairs officer (CFCAO), who ran all the departments\u200a\u2014\u200alegal, finance, marketing, and PR\u200a\u2014\u200athat were seen as necessary evils in helping run a large company. Equal in irrelevance was HR Paul, the head of the human resources department, who was generally regarded as a nincompoop psychology PhD with a flatulence problem. And then there was Niels, aka The Salesman.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a515\\\" id=\\\"a515\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe master engineer and the master salesman did not like each other, but today Niels seemed to be paying Gregor no attention. Gregor grimaced as Niels bent his gel-slicked head over the small notepad that he carried around in his front pocket. He found the mere existence of Niels\u2019 notepad an insult to the advances of technology and word processing software.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8f6e\\\" id=\\\"8f6e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGregor had disliked Anahata\u2019s new head of advertising from the instant he spotted him on campus, a plastic smile fixed on his face, fancy designer suit falling from his shoulders like a second skin. With his wingtips pointed sharply in the direction of his target, Niels had approached Gregor to suggest the engineering team fix the advertising system interface so that Anahata\u2019s advertisers could more easily place their ads online. Gregor quickly informed Niels that Anahata was about its users first and foremost, and that its users\u200a\u2014\u200aand just as important, Anahata\u2019s engineers\u200a\u2014\u200adid not care about an improved advertising system. Implicit in his explanation was the unwritten philosophical hierarchy of Anahata: Engineers at the top, then users, and then, long after that, cheerleaders, janitors, creationists, and, finally, the Anahata sales team.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3e90\\\" id=\\\"3e90\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut Niels was slow on the uptake. He kept pushing for the change, eventually escalating the issue to Bobby. Bobby, in turn, sent Gregor and Niels an email asking them to speak to each other and not bother him with such small problems. Six years later, the two men still had not managed to do so. They only met in Bobby\u2019s management meetings, where they sat on opposite ends of the table and took opposing stances in almost any argument.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"55f9\\\" id=\\\"55f9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cHaaaaaaaaaa\u2026Haaaaaaaaaa\u2026Haaaaaaa\u2026Ha!

The intruder also seemed confused: He scanned the room, past Gregor, past Niels, and landed on Bobby. His eyes bulged, the grin vanished, and he took a step back.

Suddenly Gregor recalled where he had seen him. This was the product manager candidate Roni had pointed out, the one from Galt. They had decided to hire him just to bleed Galt of some of its top talent. Over the past month, Anahata had lost several of its best engineers to the startup.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"23a4\\\" id=\\\"23a4\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGregor gave Arsyen another look.

She was in attendance that day as part of what Bobby called \u201cradical transparency,\u201d a philosophy that, while often cited by Bobby, seemed to be in effect only every third Thursday. His assistant leaned over and showed him a list\u200a\u2014\u200aand some generous cleavage.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3590\\\" id=\\\"3590\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cOkay, everyone,\u201d said Bobby, nodding at her breasts. \u201cLet\u2019s show Arsyen what innovation looks like!\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5517\\\" id=\\\"5517\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBobby\u2019s assistant opened the door, and a product manager and his engineering team shuffled toward the table in an awkward, heaving lump.

It was nearly identical to a project Anahata was set to launch the following month. That Galt had beaten Anahata to market was no surprise: The startup had lured away two of Anahata\u2019s best productivity engineers the previous fall. In fact, it seemed that all of Anahata\u2019s work and thinking had made it into the final Galt tool.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9b9e\\\" id=\\\"9b9e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cI always said we would lose those engineers to Galt,\u201d growled Old Al, shaking a finger at HR Paul. \u201cWe knew they were getting calls from the recruiters every week, and we did nothing to stop it.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"906a\\\" id=\\\"906a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cThat\u2019s not true Al, and I don\u2019t feel like you are speaking to me in a productive manner,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe gave them strong counteroffers, and even took one of their mothers on a hot-air balloon ride.

It was the mark of an exceptional leader.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e8dd\\\" id=\\\"e8dd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRoni often recalled his first and only bathroom meeting with Bobby. Eight other employees had been present, each jockeying for position. They all wanted to stand next to him, near the hand dryer, but Roni beat them to it. Although the meeting lasted just four minutes and Bobby uttered only one sentence, they were a very long four minutes, and it was one very important sentence.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6b28\\\" id=\\\"6b28\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eEver since that day, Roni favored that same Building 3, southwest corner bathroom.

Roni was making a ton of money; all his needs were met. But he no longer felt a part of the in-crowd, privy to the hottest projects or latest internal gossip. He increasingly felt like the heart of the company was beating elsewhere. It was only a vague sense, but one akin to that of the young dragon slayer approaching the bridge, one careful step after another, the fog slowly clearing before him to reveal\u2026\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2d09\\\" id=\\\"2d09\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWas it because he had recently become a Republican?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9a86\\\" id=\\\"9a86\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn any case, Roni was sure something was afoot.

He was the technical lead of Social Car, one of the hottest, most anticipated projects at the company. But Roni had been at Anahata long enough to know a quirky project from a crucial one. And Social Car just felt a bit too much like the former. Roni wondered if it was just a distraction\u200a\u2014\u200aa deft sleight of hand by Bobby to divert attention from the true gamble of something much, much bigger taking form in Building 1.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8d73\\\" id=\\\"8d73\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe had made a few passes to uncover the truth. One of Roni\u2019s friends worked in Building 1. He had proved impenetrable to inquiry, claiming he was just \u201ctinkering with the ads algorithm.\u201d Gregor had likewise stonewalled him, mentioning something about Building 1\u2019s commitment to \u201cbreakthrough enterprise software products.\u201d Roni was enough of a Valley veteran to know that when an engineer feigned enthusiasm for business software, he was either lying about the software or lying about being an engineer. And that couldn\u2019t have been more true than with Gregor Guntlag, who was well known for his dislike of business, sales, and anything connected to advancing the dirty affairs of capitalism.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e867\\\" id=\\\"e867\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo Roni had thrown himself into other projects alongside his work on Social Car. Most notably, he had become the organizer of the company\u2019s quarterly hackathons, designed to bring engineers together from across the company to detect bugs and fix core software. But while he enjoyed mentoring the younger engineers, Roni was beginning to feel like an aging school dance chaperon who furnished the pizza and Red Bull and hung out awkwardly at the back of the hall. What he was doing didn\u2019t feel tangible or significant.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"31d1\\\" id=\\\"31d1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRoni sighed and pumped his Crocs against the door in a pitter patter of plastic.

There was something called Project Y\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe that was the secret thing happening in Building 1. Project Y needed to build an army. And they needed people like Jonas to infiltrate \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Why didn\u2019t they want Roni? Roni had a black belt in karate.

Roni stood on the toilet seat and used his Swiss army knife to quickly loosen the bolts on the ventilator above his stall. Stepping onto the toilet tank, he lifted himself into the air shaft and onto his belly. He began to shimmy his way forward in the darkness. Roni had done this once before\u200a\u2014\u200amany years earlier, when he misinterpreted his manager\u2019s instructions to build a product in \u201cstealth mode.\u201d He knew this shaft would eventually take him to the building\u2019s northern corner, where he could safely drop down through another bathroom.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"79a8\\\" id=\\\"79a8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe metal shaft felt cool against his stomach, and Roni moved through it with greater ease than he had remembered.

He could feel his fingers tingling, hear his heart pumping in the stifling air around him. Project Y was so close! And yet he had nothing but a trail of vague clues. He was following a thread through the dark labyrinth, the derisive laugh of his elusive dragon echoing through the air shafts.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"7875\\\" id=\\\"7875\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 74px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 10.6%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\\\" data-width=\\\"1401\\\" data-height=\\\"149\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Br559Kl9WNDLhQ0Rlu6ZKw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"a402\\\" id=\\\"a402\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\\\" data-width=\\\"1401\\\" data-height=\\\"107\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uvTgUixVEETqJrBryO83lw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6e0e\\\" id=\\\"6e0e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eA\\x3c/span\\x3ersyen burst into the cubicle, eager to tell Sven and Jonas all about his encounter with the famous Bobby Bonilo.

The project gained tons of attention in the press, and even Arsyen had heard of it. But he didn\u2019t understand the excitement. His father had invented an equally effective driverless car decades ago in Pyrrhia\u200a\u2014\u200aroyal chariots, entirely voice activated, that traveled on the backs of a pack of corgis imported from England.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4acc\\\" id=\\\"4acc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRoni said their team had been assigned the next stage of the driverless car project.

We can calculate how symmetrical your face is, then make adjustments to give it better symmetry. For Social Car, we wouldn\u2019t redo your entire face, but we could just do the first part of calculating symmetry, since it\u2019s a proxy for attractiveness.

You get rich before you\u2019ve even proven your product can make money. Then a big company like Anahata comes along and buys your startup. Sometimes it\u2019s just to acquire your employees\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can make millions of dollars if you just tell people you employ experts in A.I. and machine learning. Computer security, biohacking, and micro-algae are also good areas.

And, yeah, it kind of sucks that all your hard work and years of no sleep and sex will be destroyed, but hey, you\u2019re rich now, and you can go and invest money in things you really care about, like food security cameras or currency for sea animals or\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5128\\\" id=\\\"5128\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cBikek,\u201d said Jonas, looking up. \u201cBikek is the capital of Embria.

But Bobby\u2019s physical appearance was utterly ordinary, with a pale, slightly puffy face falling into a neck that connected to the gently disintegrating body of a man approaching middle age. He looked nothing like the pictures Arsyen had seen in magazines. There, Bobby\u2019s chiseled face seemed straight out of a cologne ad. He was always dressed in white T-shirts that showed off massive biceps, and in more than one article, a small glow circling the top of his brown, curly hair gave the impression of a celestial aura.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f842\\\" id=\\\"f842\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cEveryone so quiet.

I heard Bobby decided to get rid of all the chairs and desks in Building 1. He said they stopped people from thinking. So everyone works standing up, roaming about and having their thoughts collide in the hallways. It\u2019s supposed to encourage innovation and collaboration.

He had spent the entire night thinking up ways to postpone the team from settling on a clear direction. If he gave the engineers something new to consider, Arsyen wouldn\u2019t have to flesh anything out until after his trial period was over.

A local journalist had posted something in praise of Dogtown, and as a result, a few thousand people between San Francisco and the South Bay had downloaded it to their phones. While that should have been reason to celebrate, it instead led to a supply-demand imbalance: There seemed to be far more people who wanted to perform disagreeable tasks than there were people who needed disagreeable tasks to be performed for them.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2abc\\\" id=\\\"2abc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cThere are too many guilty liberals on Dogtown,\u201d Sven moaned. \u201cI\u2019ve essentially got everyone bidding on the same tasks.\u201d He showed Arsyen the long list of white faces volunteering to perform menial tasks for people of color. \u201cI tried to get someone to pick up a tub of ice cream for my fake Asian female profile last night, and the bidding war was so intense that I ended up getting it delivered for free. It\u2019s even more exaggerated if I use my Latino or African-American profiles. Every white person in San Francisco seems desperate to run errands for free just to prove they\u2019re really progressive.

The villagers had lived in the same place for centuries and knew everything about the world surrounding them. And yet the one thing they didn\u2019t understand, and no number of UN officials could convince them of, was that their practice of building their huts with all their livestock in the center posed a serious health risk and was responsible for many of the eye and skin diseases they had contracted. The purpose of the livestock in the center was to protect the animals from lions and other predators, and the villagers believed their sustenance was more important in the end than a worm in their skin.\\x3c/pre\\x3e\\x3cpre name=\\\"94a8\\\" id=\\\"94a8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pre graf-after--pre\\\"\\x3eSo the question is do we try to educate our engineers?

Ugly, unsettling numbers. While few people on the Anahata campus knew of its existence, Gregor\u2019s top-secret Project Y was the only endeavor that now mattered at the company. Everything else was an afterthought; a blip in the company\u2019s glorious ten-year history. Were the project to fail, it would mean the end of Anahata. A victory, on the other hand, would ensure the success of Anahata, the web, and all things good for decades to come. It would be Gregor\u2019s finest achievement, the greatest project to which he had ever put his name. He could not allow it to fail.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3760\\\" id=\\\"3760\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eYet by the numbers, it \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ewas\\x3c/em\\x3e failing, and not for any of the predictable reasons that often plagued brilliant Anahata ideas\u200a\u2014\u200aan inability to find willing commercial partners, or criticism that Anahata was violating some silly law. Such problems, governed as they were by ignorance and reactionaries, were far outside Gregor\u2019s control. In fact, his current inability to limit these kinds of interference was one of the main reasons Gregor found Project Y so exhilarating. If it succeeded, he would be able to protect his engineers from the ignorant masses, letting them build and create their dreams unencumbered. There would be no more defections to Galt, no more debates in the media about Anahata\u2019s relevance. Project Y would definitively establish Anahata as the most innovative company in the world, ever.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d7dc\\\" id=\\\"d7dc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGregor often found himself wondering what would have become of him had Anahata or Project Y existed in his early days as an engineer, when he first landed on the shores of Baltimore, fresh from the University of Liechtenstein, his head filled with ideas for space elevators and floating castles.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fd72\\\" id=\\\"fd72\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHis first major undertaking tackled the many lies and inaccuracies on the internet by using software that automatically corrected inaccurate opinions, comments, and blog posts.

After four years of working out of his one-room apartment in San Diego, surviving on little more than instant noodles and bananas, Gregor was forced to admit defeat.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"822a\\\" id=\\\"822a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut it was there in San Diego, standing next to a dumpster, ready to trash his metal monkey parts, that he met Bobby Bonilo. The future Anahata founder tossed him a quarter, thinking Gregor was homeless. But then Bobby saw the wires sprouting from the monkey\u2019s tail in Gregor\u2019s hand, took in the faded computing slogan on his T-shirt, and in a split second seemed to understand all of Gregor\u2019s dreams\u200a\u2014\u200aand their crushing defeat at the cruel hand of pragmatism.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a9bb\\\" id=\\\"a9bb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBobby had been the first to recognize Gregor\u2019s genius. \u201cHumans cling to the past. They will work tirelessly to destroy the most important advances of society,\u201d he had said. \u201cAs a visionary, you must know that your ideas are ahead of their time. They must only come to light when the world is ready for them\u200a\u2014\u200aor when you have too much power to be stopped.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bda8\\\" id=\\\"bda8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eProject Y was just that\u200a\u2014\u200abeyond its time, beyond any earthly concept of innovation. By that measure alone it would have failed in a normal environment. But Anahata now had what Gregor then lacked: boundless capital, a deep pool of engineering talent, and the power of a large country. Moreover, there was no public opinion standing in the way of Y. Its secrecy had been closely guarded, and Gregor was determined to keep its existence quiet until it was too late to be stopped.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8f0d\\\" id=\\\"8f0d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eInstead, the hurdle Gregor now found before him was a far more potent nemesis: the devil himself, Niels Smeardon, breathing fire and online advertising in the path of Gregor\u2019s engineering team.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0c02\\\" id=\\\"0c02\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNiels was the reason two Project Y product managers had come to Gregor\u2019s office that afternoon.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0382\\\" id=\\\"0382\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cFor the past week, we\u2019ve literally been twiddling our thumbs,\u201d one said. \u201cEvery step we take is blocked by sales.

These were the men who sold Anahata\u2019s internet ads\u200a\u2014\u200apithy phrases and punchy slogans advertising cruise ships and cancer treatments. They believed in dress shirts and strip clubs and golf and triathlons.

To any other observer, Niels might have seemed the ultimate captain, rallying his team to the win, throwing slaps and high-fives. But it was all an act. Niels was a man willing to knock down anyone who got in his way. Gregor had kept Project Y a secret from him for this very reason. Niels would destroy it for the very fact that it was Gregor\u2019s baby. And if Niels succeeded in sabotaging Y, it would be the end of everything.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2f45\\\" id=\\\"2f45\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe problem was that Gregor had no power over Niels. They were equals, if not in brain power, then at least according to Anahata\u2019s organizational chart. Only Bobby could tell Niels what to do. And while Gregor and Bobby dreamed up the idea for Project Y together, the founder had since taken a step back, tasking Gregor with making it a reality. This would have been fine were it not for the fact that Bobby seemed to have a weird affection for Niels, never suggesting that he really liked the guy, but also taking care to protect him from Gregor. He had even heard that Bobby and Niels occasionally did yoga together.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bcf8\\\" id=\\\"bcf8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGregor paced his office, Niels\u2019 gravelly voice and sales aphorisms trailing behind him: \u201cWith courage comes determination.\u201d \u201cLeadership is knowing when to lead.\u201d \u201cThose who win are those who win.\u201d He caught sight again of Niels on the field, this time tripping an oncoming opponent, the stunned player falling to the ground.

Now a third, more familiar face stared back at him. He recognized Roni Herman, the team lead. Roni was a bit past his prime, already in his early thirties, but still a well-liked figure on campus. In reviewing the distraction projects and their leaders that morning, Gregor had thought Roni could be an interesting candidate to join the Project Y team.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a9c7\\\" id=\\\"a9c7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cTake me to Roni Herman.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"73be\\\" id=\\\"73be\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe software beeped its assent, and a few minutes later, Gregor\u2019s car pulled alongside Roni\u2019s.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bbef\\\" id=\\\"bbef\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cSpeak to Roni,\u201d Gregor said.

Gregor glanced over at Roni\u2019s car, which was keeping perfect pace with his own. Roni climbed into the back of his car, searching for something.

Although Gregor refused to make eye contact, he imagined Roni was panicking, afraid he was about to be kicked off his project. Although Gregor volunteered at a community garden, gave millions each year to humanitarian crisis organizations, and voted only for socialists, he did like to cause a bit of microsuffering now and then. He felt it kept the engineers on their toes.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5a58\\\" id=\\\"5a58\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cOh, well, you know, I don\u2019t know how things would go if I came off it,\u201d said Roni, the panic painted across his face in bold pinkish strokes. \u201cI\u2019ve really led the team from the start and\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4ff1\\\" id=\\\"4ff1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGregor frowned.

It was a wonder that they could even keep their lenses open on alert given how mind-numbingly boring Anahata\u2019s security scene was, particularly during the night shift. In the wee hours of morning, nothing went into Anahata and nothing came out\u200a\u2014\u200aminus the occasional nocturnal engineer.

The Northern California air was just crisp enough to feel clean and pure, and the occasional headwind produced a surmountable challenge\u200a\u2014\u200athe kind of easy and achievable goal-setting that Niels liked for warming up to his workday. He followed his workout with a long shower, the rainforest setting gently splattering purified water on his head while a speaker piped in a soothing recording of a woman\u2019s voice appraising each inch of his body.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"908f\\\" id=\\\"908f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eYour muscles are so big.\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"45ca\\\" id=\\\"45ca\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eYour abs are very flat.\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0a14\\\" id=\\\"0a14\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eYour Adam\u2019s apple is prominent but tasteful.\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9895\\\" id=\\\"9895\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut that morning, Niels could focus only on Gregor Guntlag. The overly German German had hated him since day one and seemed intent on turning Bobby against him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"26a9\\\" id=\\\"26a9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBobby and Gregor were both nutjobs as far as Niels was concerned, but he was used to working with crazies. Fifteen years of working in the Valley and he had never worked for a CEO or founder who wasn\u2019t a sociopath or narcissist. They thought the world\u2019s problems existed in part to keep them intellectually stimulated, and that all those problems\u200a\u2014\u200amalaria, corruption, congressional deadlock, death, you name it\u200a\u2014\u200acould be solved by technologists. Their lack of focus was confused for genius. One moment they would be asking the entire company to dramatically change course, and the next moment they\u2019d be giving equal attention to the color of the lampshades in the lobby. And despite their staunch atheism, they all believed their success was somehow mythically predestined.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"47fd\\\" id=\\\"47fd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt was an absurd worldview, but one that Niels admired for its selfishness. Managing and manipulating these egomaniacs was an art he felt he had perfected.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bef7\\\" id=\\\"bef7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWith persistence and patience, Niels had worked on Bobby for six years, helping him understand that Anahata needed money to be successful and that Niels was the best lever he had to produce it in large quantities. As a result, Bobby generally left him alone. Gregor, on the other hand, had been less susceptible to Niels\u2019 charm. He did everything he could to sabotage Niels, always playing the contrarian in any management meeting and sending out his engineering lackeys to turn off a sales production task here and there. It was nothing sufficiently significant to warrant an outcry to Bobby, but just enough to annoy Niels and make clear that Gregor and his foot soldiers were behind the job.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a1da\\\" id=\\\"a1da\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo Niels was surprised by the peace offering that had appeared the previous night in the form of a blue chat bubble on his phone\u200a\u2014\u200aa chat message asking Gregor to come over to \u201cwork things out and bury the hatchet.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"683b\\\" id=\\\"683b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt was a shocking olive branch from Anahata\u2019s head engineer, and in retrospect, Niels realized he should have taken a screenshot of their exchange. Unfortunately, since Anahata chats were not stored (the result of Gregor and Bobby\u2019s joint paranoia about government surveillance), this historic exchange of civilities would have no record.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fdb4\\\" id=\\\"fdb4\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAfter an evening spent trying to discern Gregor\u2019s motives, Niels had finally replied that, yes, of course he\u2019d be happy to talk. But the whole thing smelled fishy. Perhaps Gregor wanted something that belonged to sales. If that was the case, it meant that Niels had already achieved Master Negotiator Rule #1: \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eAlways\\x3c/em\\x3e have the upper hand. (Viewing even the most casual encounters as an opportunity for personal gain was key to Niel\u2019s life philosophy. An ex-girlfriend had once accused him of dealing with their relationship like a business negotiation. Niels said he didn\u2019t understand how she could possibly think that anything in life was \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3enot\\x3c/em\\x3e a negotiation. He came away triumphant, although the woman did break up with him shortly thereafter.)\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"69b1\\\" id=\\\"69b1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNiels was confident he could work the meeting to his advantage. In fact, this could be the opening he needed to get Gregor to agree to put ads on Moodify bracelets.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"384b\\\" id=\\\"384b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn any other company, the management team would have salivated over the Moodify bracelets, with one billion dollars in projected profit in the first year alone. But not Gregor Guntlag, whose perennial argument against anything Niels wanted was that it wouldn\u2019t be good for Anahata users. Niels believed that \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3enot \\x3c/em\\x3egiving people advertisements was bad. If they didn\u2019t know something existed, how could they know they needed it? Only advertising could tell people what they needed to need.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"48d5\\\" id=\\\"48d5\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTypically, Bobby hadn\u2019t even listened to the discussion. He caught just the tail end of Gregor\u2019s rebuttal and seemed to defer the decision indefinitely with a wave of his hands. If you asked Niels, Bobby gave his head engineer far too much rope. Gregor was holding the company back from billions of additional revenue. And what did he do to make up for it? As far as Niels could tell, Gregor was simply there to execute Bobby\u2019s big ideas. All of Gregor\u2019s own projects had been massive failures. He was good at implementation but had no vision of his own.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1cbf\\\" id=\\\"1cbf\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNiels stepped out of the shower and surveyed himself in the bathroom mirror. He was forty-two but didn\u2019t show a single gray hair or wrinkle. By almost any measure, he was the picture of excellence in aging. He gave a quick, indulgent flex of his muscle and a flash of bleached teeth. He remembered that the Anahata employee he banged a few weeks back had commented on his nice smile. He racked his brain for a split second, trying to remember her name. She was that sexy hippie receptionist who kept asking him for career advice as he tried to take her clothes off. Janine. Jane. Jennie. It didn\u2019t matter. It was probably a bit stupid to hit on someone who worked at Anahata, but he wasn\u2019t going to worry about it. He always could have her fired if things got uncomfortable. So far, he hadn\u2019t even run into her on campus.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2c2d\\\" id=\\\"2c2d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNiels threw on his favorite Prada slacks\u200a\u2014\u200athe ones he wore to close a deal\u200a\u2014\u200aand finished getting dressed for work. He took a final look in the mirror and flashed his teeth.

Someone picked up, but instead of a \u201chello\u201d there was simply a buzzing sound, followed by the slow opening of the gate, revealing a long driveway abutted by row after row of towering pines.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3f92\\\" id=\\\"3f92\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOn some level, it made sense to Niels that Gregor would live in the wealthiest neighborhood in Atherton, itself the wealthiest city in the Valley. He was, after all, one of the earliest employees at Anahata and had made billions of dollars when the company went public. But Gregor was also the man who wore faded decades-old shirts every day, ate the same bland lentils at every lunch, and drove a beat-up Jeep to work. Niels had assumed he\u2019d eschew a fancy house and live in austerity in a small condo in crime-ridden East Palo Alto, or perhaps an inconspicuous cottage in the slightly smelly, middle-class part of Mountain View. Anything but the estate that was emerging before Niels\u2019 eyes\u200a\u2014\u200aa sprawling mansion the style of which Niels could only describe as nouveau-chateau, and whose inhabitants Niels would ordinarily assume to be a transplanted Texas blonde and her bejeweled poodle.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0dbb\\\" id=\\\"0dbb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe house was ostentation at its American best, its climbing spires and ornate Mediterranean palacio flourishes the odd manifestation of new money\u2019s dream of old Europe. At the end of the driveway was a large marble fountain\u200a\u2014\u200asix white swans spouting water onto a central lily pad. Rising up behind the fountain was a large marble staircase that led to the front door. Two long, peach-colored wings branched out from the entrance, each ending in a tall, Rapunzel-like tower.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"49e7\\\" id=\\\"49e7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGregor was waiting for him at the top of the marble steps, dressed in his typical uniform of white T-shirt, khaki pants, and combat boots. In his hand he held two beers, one of which was immediately thrust at Niels, as if Gregor was following a textbook instruction on how to relate to American men. The beer was warm, likely pulled from the pantry just minutes before. Even if this was all just a plot to get something out of him, at least the guy was making an effort. And in any case, it was kind of fun to witness Gregor\u2019s visible discomfort in his role as host.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"aaf9\\\" id=\\\"aaf9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIf the garish exterior of Gregor\u2019s palace had thrown Niels\u2019 preconceptions, the interior only reaffirmed them. Once inside, Niels could see nothing in the house beyond white walls and a single overhead light in each room. The few windows in existence were so high up from the floor that they reminded Niels of a cathedral\u2026or a prison.

Gregor pushed a button, and the door slowly slid into the wall, revealing a flight of stairs leading into darkness. In the seconds before their descent, Niels recalled an article he once read in a tech magazine, in which a successful Valley engineer kept a dungeon underneath his home, holding secret orgies while his nuclear family, clothed in matching pastel cottons, lived happily and unknowingly in the rooms upstairs.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"feea\\\" id=\\\"feea\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut when Gregor turned on the lights, the illuminated space below revealed nothing more than a simple wine cellar, with row after row of bottle racks, and in the center, two chairs and a wooden table.

It was a Chateau Margaux\u200a\u2014\u200athe holy grail of red wine. Niels couldn\u2019t help but grin.

One of the spindles was split in the middle, and the raw edge pushed into his spine. He suspected Gregor had never been inside a home furnishings store in his life, that he didn\u2019t see the inconsistency in offering up one of the world\u2019s most expensive wines in such a dank and uncomfortable setting. For all his engineering brilliance, Gregor would never even have made it past the sales team\u2019s entry-level \u201cHospitality &amp; Negotiation\u201d training course.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"336e\\\" id=\\\"336e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGregor poured the wine from the decanter and handed a glass to Niels.

Niels loosened his tie, Gregor slouched just slightly in his chair. It was an exceptional wine. And after they took their first sip, Niels had the sudden realization that this was the first nondisagreeable experience the two had shared since Niels joined Anahata six years earlier. Gregor even tried to offer a slight smile, pushing it onto his face as though it were a heavy wooden beam.

Arsyen took pains to conceal his true identity. From his experience, once a Pyrrhian woman knew she was in the presence of an Aimo, all hopes of reasonable conversation dissolved in a puddle of sighs. Instead, he told her about living in America, about drive-through pharmacies and the endless array of flavored sparkling water, and the importance of sanitation engineers like Arsyen, who fixed the various clogs, stains, and crumbs that could slow the infrastructure of a fast-moving startup.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"05b6\\\" id=\\\"05b6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eShe in turn wrote to him about her life in Poodlekek, Pyrrhia\u2019s capital. Natia worked as a switchboard operator for the national telecommunications firm, a graying dinosaur that was slowly moving Pyrrhia into the 1980s. She belonged to a political philosophy group, which met weekly to discuss why Marxism failed and whether man could subvert machine in a post-capitalist society. Arsyen found her little intellectual forays rather cute. There would be no need for political philosophy once royal reign was restored, but why discourage Natia from stretching her feminine brain in the meantime?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2c12\\\" id=\\\"2c12\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eShe was particularly passionate in her dislike of General (now President) Korpeko\u200a\u2014\u200athe source of the Aimo family\u2019s undoing.

He believed it was Pyrrhia\u2019s ticket to international fame\u200a\u2014\u200asufficiently obscure as to ensure little competition from wealthier countries. Korpeko had replaced all the bike lanes and gutters along main roads with curling courts, and no vacations or trips outside the country were allowed during the first week of February, now known as Pyrrhian Curling Week. Arsyen\u2019s stomach tightened each time he imagined Korpeko\u2019s curling lanes snaking across Pyrrhia\u2019s unmarred hills.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a98a\\\" id=\\\"a98a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cIt sounds nothing like the rich cultural life that once flourished under the royal family,\u201d Arsyen wrote to Natia, thinking of the literary salons and long afternoon croquet matches his family hosted at their summer palace for the Pyrrhian elite.

Then, when the time was right, he would return to Pyrrhia bronzed and wealthy, with his beautiful queen and her good orthodontics on display. Natia and the other women of Pyrrhia would weep at what they had lost, only able to take comfort in the possibility of becoming one of Arsyen\u2019s bathing maidens.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"32ac\\\" id=\\\"32ac\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo it was decided: Natia was out.

He wondered if that train was still there\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly the first-class carriage, outfitted with miniature foodstuffs. As a teenager, Arsyen often threw the train\u2019s gold-plated bison fries at his manservant Sklartar when the old man wasn\u2019t moving fast enough.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5d59\\\" id=\\\"5d59\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cThey say you could hear the screams of the children as the train flew through the air,\u201d the strategist said, \u201cthat the flames moved across the sky like a rocket.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5953\\\" id=\\\"5953\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cHuh,\u201d said Arsyen, his thumb pumping up and down on the console button as he sliced through the head of one of the king\u2019s henchmen.

Nothing was going to interrupt his game.

She too was obsessed with the train accident. She claimed the government had stopped any media from reporting the event, fearful that the news could put a damper on its bid to host the International Curling Championships the following year. Government workers had already begun repairing the bridge, and no effort was being made to dredge up the train. Meanwhile, the police were arresting anyone they believed was spreading rumors. All internet services were blocked in the capital, and Natia had been forced to travel outside the province to get to any caf\u00e9 with open access. \u201cIf they find out I am here, they will arrest me, or worse!\u201d She wrote. \u201cHelp us get the word out about what happened.

Whatever happened in Pyrrhia now would certainly be repeated in a year\u2019s time, with a new set of mothers rolled out to despair over the loss of their children at the hands of Korpeko\u2019s corrupt and negligent government. He needed to be patient and let these minor catastrophes accumulate.

He even half-started his own GaltPage a few months earlier to promote his Aimo Air Freshener\u200a\u2014\u200aa custom pink mixture he invented out of cleaning supplies so he could cover up the persistent stench of body odor that permeated the Galt meeting rooms. Its cotton candy scent would one day make Arsyen millions\u200a\u2014\u200aprovided he could figure out how to keep it from combusting.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8bbb\\\" id=\\\"8bbb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe hadn\u2019t gotten very far with his page back then, but Galt seemed to have made its product easier to use since he last tried.

And, Arsyen told himself, there was a potential bonus to be had in all of this: If enough people were interested in what he posted about Poodlekek, he could collect their contact info and sell them his air freshener once all the furor died down.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9d4b\\\" id=\\\"9d4b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eArsyen had worked in the Valley long enough to know that the key to social media was virality, not sincerity. So he renamed the page \u201cJustice for Poodlekek\u201d and posted Natia\u2019s text about the accident, calling for action. He then posted the link to Justice for Poodlekek in the comment section of every Pyrrhian blog and newspaper article he could find and wrote a review of Korpeko\u2019s government on the restaurant review site Help! Then he added pictures of Golden Bridge to his Photomatic account, using the retro and futuristic filters, as well as a bleaker one with a sprinkling of decapitated bodies.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5e39\\\" id=\\\"5e39\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eArsyen leaned back in his chair and put his hands behind his head.

But a while later, passing by his computer on the way to the kitchen, he saw that the previously blank comment section of Justice for Poodlekek now hosted a long list of responses.

What did he want to show Niels? A philosophy book? A line of code? A diorama? Regardless, Niels\u2019 expression would remain placid, unmoved, mouth silent in Guntlagian style until Gregor\u2019s desperation grew to the point where Niels would only need to repeat three words: \u201cAds on Moodify.\u201d Maybe he would even agree to let Niels put ads on employee T-shirts and the meeting-room chairs.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6e1c\\\" id=\\\"6e1c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhen had Gregor left exactly?

He had locked Niels in the cellar in order to assert his dominance and put Niels on edge. But these kinds of mind tricks and one-upmanship were old hat for a Master Negotiator. After all, Niels was the man who had challenged a quadriplegic music executive to a game of rugby; the man who hid \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eE. coli \\x3c/em\\x3ein an opponent\u2019s entree so he could pitch him on a business proposition as the other lay prostrate before the toilet for six hours. This wine cellar act was amateurish.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"269c\\\" id=\\\"269c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThat said, why would a grown man lock a work colleague in his basement? Was that something Germans found funny? Or maybe Gregor was in fact Austrian. The Austrians were famous for their appreciation of basements. For a split second, Niels\u2019 body tensed as he imagined Gregor descending the stairs in a pair of leather pants.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f585\\\" id=\\\"f585\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNiels closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and opened them again. He couldn\u2019t help but respect his opponent for planting these seeds of doubt. Five minutes passed, then ten. Niels felt splinters from the chair making inroads into the back of his arms. Shapes emerged from the shadows, then receded. Another twenty minutes passed.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"15c7\\\" id=\\\"15c7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNiels knew he shouldn\u2019t panic, but the shadows, the quiet, the unpredictability of his opponent all began to cloud his confidence. The longer he sat and paced and sat and paced, the more Niels became convinced that the taciturn Teuton was planning to leave him there all night, returning only once confident that he had broken the Master Negotiator.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"cbb7\\\" id=\\\"cbb7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNiels needed to plot his escape. From his shirt pocket, he pulled out the pen and pad of paper that he always carried with him. In a world of internet intangibles, Niels found reassurance in last-century items.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e2cd\\\" id=\\\"e2cd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHis high-level plan of attack was fairly easy to map. First, Niels needed to get himself out of the basement, and second, he needed to stop Gregor\u2019s moon colony plan. (Third, he needed to destroy Gregor, though that was a longer-term goal that would require a separate strategy and PowerPoint deck.)\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8b02\\\" id=\\\"8b02\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe question, of course, was how to go about these things. Niels considered the obvious\u200a\u2014\u200ahe could call another member of the management team. But as soon as Fischer, HR Paul, or Old Al showed up, Gregor would have some story ready and they would all have a good chuckle over Niels\u2019 paranoia. Word would get out around Anahata, and even his own team would eventually find out about his panicked call for help. Exhilarated by the scent of weakness, the salesmen would circle him like the killer sharks he had trained them to be. It would be the end of him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9a1a\\\" id=\\\"9a1a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eInstead, Niels sketched a mountain. At the base, he wrote, \u201cMe.\u201d At the summit, he wrote \u201cFREEDOM.\u201d Then he paused, realizing that he had failed to capture the full complexity of the situation. So he drew a second mountain next to the first. Now he had a mountain range. At the base of that second mountain, Niels wrote, \u201cGregor announces Moon Colony Plan.\u201d At the top, he wrote, \u201cI DESTROY the Moon Colony Plan!!!\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b94f\\\" id=\\\"b94f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAfter a few minutes, and a few trees and shrubs added to his drawing for good measure, Niels had the entire route mapped, from base camp to summit. He was ready to go. He leaped out of his chair and did fifty jumping jacks, followed by one hundred situps, enjoying the rush of blood through his body. Niels would save Anahata from the worst decision it could ever make, and possibly even get Gregor fired in the process.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6aed\\\" id=\\\"6aed\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe first step was simple. He would ring Bobby and suggest that he pick Niels up at Gregor\u2019s house for a midnight yoga class. Bobby was a sucker for yoga invites and had stated on numerous occasions that he wished the management team would chant together. Niels, for his part, thought yoga was the lazy man\u2019s excuse for exercise, but like golf and wine, he saw value in its acquisition. Yoga had not only helped him meet several lonely housewives, but had also distinguished him as the only member of Bobby\u2019s team who could execute \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eChaturanga Dandasana\\x3c/em\\x3e\u200a\u2014\u200aproviding a reasonable excuse for him to seed business ideas over sun salutations.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"888c\\\" id=\\\"888c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNiels pulled out his phone, selected Bobby\u2019s number, and was soon hit by his mountain\u2019s first boulder.

His email to Bobby hadn\u2019t gone through. In its place was a time-out message\u200a\u2014\u200athe data connection just wasn\u2019t strong enough.

His body shook, and he began to feel cold.

In fact, he had zero interest in Galt or Flitter or in reading anyone\u2019s thoughts other than his own. But a year earlier, he had tried to convince Galt to run Anahata\u2019s ads on their apps and opened a Flitter account, Niels_1973, to show them he \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ereally\\x3c/em\\x3e cared about their product. But eventually the deal fell through, and other than a few half-hearted fleets about some Anahata sports matches, Niels\u2019 account lay dormant for months.

It was irresponsible and a waste of his time.

It was the same performance Bobby had enacted a decade earlier, just a few days before Anahata became a publicly traded company. Summoned at midnight to a small Palo Alto park, the Anahata board of directors had watched Bobby\u2019s cryptic movements in horror, worrying in hissed whispers that he would repeat his routine at the sound of the market\u2019s opening bell. Then, as now, Gregor absorbed it as one might a nature program. He believed that watching Bobby (and watching Bobby watch others as they watched him) was the only path toward understanding the Anahata founder and his genius.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"80e6\\\" id=\\\"80e6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBecause for all of his billions, comprehension was the one thing Bobby Bonilo couldn\u2019t buy and would probably never have.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e1a1\\\" id=\\\"e1a1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut that\u2019s why he had Gregor, whose job it was to help translate Bobby\u2019s vision to reality. If Bobby was a genius and his ideas transformed the world, then Gregor\u2019s work was vital to human progress. If Bobby was a sociopath and his dreams lacked innovation, then it meant Gregor was a fool and his own work meaningless.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b157\\\" id=\\\"b157\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBobby was now rubbing the strip of bark against his cheek.

This was primarily the engineers, who believed that anything sent to the entire company would be devoid of data and facts, given it was necessary to be comprehensible to the lowest common denominator (aka sales).\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"562c\\\" id=\\\"562c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe second group responded with indifference. This was the support staff\u200a\u2014\u200apeople in departments like legal, finance, marketing, HR, and customer support\u200a\u2014\u200awho were reminded on a daily basis that their opinions and activities were not truly vital to the company\u2019s success. They knew that a shakeup at the top wouldn\u2019t change their status in the slightest. They read the email, shrugged their shoulders, and moved on with their meaningless day.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"811c\\\" id=\\\"811c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe third group responded with outrage. This was a small number of engineers who had actually read the email and found it unacceptable that the water slide and petting zoo they had requested months earlier still had not been granted, while other employees (clearly those from sales) were being granted a marathon-training allowance.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4383\\\" id=\\\"4383\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe final group was the sales team, who immediately understood the significance of Niels\u2019 departure. With just one nonchalant email from Bobby, a new world order was imposed, one in which bits and pixels trumped money and smarts trumped designer suits; a world in which golf clubs, fast cars, and weekend \u201cbusiness\u201d trips to Vegas would be replaced with gadgets, robots, and video games. They knew nothing would be the same.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fd98\\\" id=\\\"fd98\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAnd, in fact, the reality turned out to be worse than anything they predicted. (As any engineer would have pointed out, this was to be expected since the ability of the dimwitted sales team to predict much of anything was genetically limited.)\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"493b\\\" id=\\\"493b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eA few minutes following Bobby\u2019s memo, most members of the Anahata sales team received an email informing them that they had been chosen to participate in the Horizontal Moves (HM) program and that they should report to the sales auditorium in Building 13 at eleven a.m.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5766\\\" id=\\\"5766\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTheir excitement at being chosen for an exclusive program dissipated once they arrived at the auditorium. The plush purple sofas that usually welcomed them for Niels\u2019 quarterly strategy meetings had been replaced with fold-up metal chairs. There was no breakfast buffet, no robot butler ready to dispense coffee. Just a man from the HR team with a clipboard who spoke only long enough to repeat Bobby\u2019s memo and then direct the group to line up according to last name at different stations throughout the auditorium. There, he said, they would be given their new special assignments.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"00a7\\\" id=\\\"00a7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe employee who sold ads to fast-food restaurants was given a pair of purple Anahata sweatpants and told to report to the volleyball court, where he would start that morning as a personal trainer. The employee who sold ads to construction companies, henceforth known as HM #4002, was given sunscreen, a suit, and a life buoy and told to make his way to the pool. A former cubicle mate, now known as HM #3403, was made part of the concierge service, while his former boss, HM #2435, became an errand runner for engineers who hated leaving their desks. HM #12009, formerly specialized in selling ads to podiatrists, was assigned to give foot massages to a product manager named Arsyen Aimo. When the latter didn\u2019t show up to his first appointment, HM#12009 was reassigned to run the puppet and juggling shows in Building 4.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3cba\\\" id=\\\"3cba\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBefore leaving the auditorium, all the sales employees were given new orange badges that clearly identified them as a different class.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"467c\\\" id=\\\"467c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe next day, Horizontal Moves staff members who showed up for the company shuttle bus in San Francisco were curtly instructed to stand in a different line from the engineering staff; HM employees who drove to work were directed to separate parking lots located at the far end of campus. These employees were still allowed to eat in the cafeterias and take advantage of the many gyms and amenities, but they were assigned off-hours when they would be less likely to encounter engineering staff.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8fe1\\\" id=\\\"8fe1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThese weren\u2019t the only changes. The soccer field was closed for sports so it could be used as an amateur rocket launcher and robot playing field. The lap pool was taken over by a group of engineers who wanted to build a salamander farm. And the Friday afternoon drinks party in the main hall\u200a\u2014\u200awhich the sales team had long viewed as their territory\u200a\u2014\u200ano longer played hip-hop and pop music, but rather ambient sounds and repeats of \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eStar Trek\\x3c/em\\x3e.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0f42\\\" id=\\\"0f42\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe other Anahata employees took quickly and easily to the new hierarchy. They soon began referring to the former sales employees as Horizontal Movers, or simply by those two damning letters\u200a\u2014\u200aHM.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6287\\\" id=\\\"6287\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAs for the HM staff, even they had to admit life wasn\u2019t so bad on the bottom\u200a\u2014\u200alow stress for the same pay. Many of them spent their entire days working out, and their six-packs grew new, defined lines. Such accomplishments made them wonder whether their destiny had never been to sell things\u200a\u2014\u200aand intangible things in a virtual world, at that\u200a\u2014\u200abut rather just to be in incredible physical shape.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9914\\\" id=\\\"9914\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOf course, there were moments when they suddenly remembered the thrill of their old life, of hitting their monthly sales target and beating their colleagues in the number of new client acquisitions. When those memories hit, the HM puppeteers would suddenly transform their rehearsal of \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eSesame Street\\x3c/em\\x3e into \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eReservoir Dogs\\x3c/em\\x3e, the HM lullaby squad would change the engineer naptime music to death rock, and the HM physical trainers would find themselves assigning their engineering clients one thousand jumping jacks or a five-mile run. The engineers huffed and puffed, but it was of little consolation to the demoted employees; the stain of their new HM status stamped itself in blotchy red patches across their clients\u2019 faces.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b5da\\\" id=\\\"b5da\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut most of the time, they just admired their biceps.

But \u201clet\u2019s fly to the moon!\u201d big? That\u2019s pretty ambitious. It seems that\u2019s exactly what wacky Anahata is up to, according to fleets posted by the company\u2019s top sales exec, Niels Smeardon (@Niels_1973), who urged his followers to stop the tech giant from going to the moon. Smeardon\u2019s departure was announced internally two days ago\u200a\u2014\u200ashortly after the timestamp of these fleets. Could these be the ramblings of a disgruntled employee?

But rumors of a top-secret project at Anahata have been floating about for the past few months, with many saying that founder Bobby Bonilo is looking to build a killer product that will serve a knockout punch to the company\u2019s main competitor, Galt.\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1d13\\\" id=\\\"1d13\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eThere\u2019s also a less exciting though somewhat credible explanation: There have been whispers that the company is interested in finding new places to put its data centers.\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7668\\\" id=\\\"7668\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eIf that\u2019s the case, well, you\u2019d think there\u2019d be cheaper options than the moon, but this is Anahata.

The HMer got in the engineer\u2019s face and yelled some sort of insult; the engineer stumbled backwards a few steps before regaining his footing.

His book had said as much.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"09d3\\\" id=\\\"09d3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn this case, Bobby wasn\u2019t simply helping the sales team discover their natural talents. He was also achieving greater company unity. Engineers and HM staff were now coexisting peacefully. The sales employees had stopped tripping the engineers in the cafeteria, and the engineers had stopped programming their robots to chase the sales guys down the hallways. The internal email wars between the two groups had ended nearly overnight. In fact, the engineering staff seemed to have backed down entirely since the announcement of the HM program, no longer viewing their sales cum HM counterparts as enemies, but rather officially acknowledged subordinates, children who should be encouraged and supported in their new roles.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6885\\\" id=\\\"6885\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJennie\u2019s gaze moved across the field, pausing here and there on a bare chest or a chiseled set of cheekbones. It wasn\u2019t just HMers that caught her eye. Even some of the engineers were getting cuter. Many of them still walked with an odd, ape-like gait, but they somehow looked more\u2026vigorous, healthy. Even Sven, horrible Sven, seemed to be sporting a new set of biceps.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b4e1\\\" id=\\\"b4e1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cGet up, losers!\u201d screamed a voice at the other end of the field, where a pile of arms and legs twisted about like a frantic octopus above the tire course.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"259a\\\" id=\\\"259a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eShe just couldn\u2019t understand why she wasn\u2019t succeeding in her new job.

That\u2019s what the Horizontal Moves program is about. The sales guys are all at the bottom of the Anahata hierarchy now. And our engineers are the gods they deserve to be. The good news is that our data shows that now, when you women do talk to the engineers, you appreciate their higher status. As a result, there is a much higher success rate than in the past. We call it \u2018coupling.\u2019 So the coupling rate is much higher, although it still remains extremely low.

Birds chirped in the trees and fleet-footed cupids danced down the halls, jumping from one beanbag to the next, sprinkling their magical dust on those lucky enough to have been invited to try the app. Meanwhile, those without access queued outside the Social Me cubicle, begging for an invitation.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8d2c\\\" id=\\\"8d2c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe Genie team had just one thing with which to console themselves.

Hot Ryan was twenty-seven and loved going to the gym, cooking multicourse macrobiotic dinners, and taking long walks in the forest. He was everything she wanted in a boyfriend. His hair was a color Jennie was sure was called \u201crusset,\u201d and he had the kind of slightly angular face that she was sure could only belong to a man who had experienced both hardship and love and who was sensitive\u200a\u2014\u200aso sensitive that he felt every emotion, every loss, every moment in which his future girlfriend might leave his side. In his profile picture, he was wearing a knit sweater, sitting in front of a fireplace with a glass of red wine, inviting one lucky girl to join him for an evening of slow jams and lovemaking. Jennie could hear the fire crackling in the background, the smell of pine and winter filling her nose. Hot Ryan was dreamy, and he could be hers in a matter of seconds if she just clicked on the chat button.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"718f\\\" id=\\\"718f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cWe\u2019ve got another HMer on S&amp;M,\u201d she said over her shoulder, pinging Sven the link to Ryan\u2019s Social Me profile\u200a\u2014\u200athough not before first adding Ryan to her favorites folder in case she wanted to contact him later.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a8b8\\\" id=\\\"a8b8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNo girl wanted to date an HMer or be seen on campus with him\u200a\u2014\u200aeveryone knew they were the losers and meatheads of Anahata\u2019s employee base.

She let her gaze linger on his face, appreciating the faint acne scars near his temples\u200a\u2014\u200athe reminder, no doubt, of a painful adolescence. She liked guys who were mildly bruised; their slight imperfections tempered their attempts at arrogance. They were nothing like the sales guys, nothing like that Niels Smeardon, who had seduced her and then made her wait outside on his lawn, in the cold, until a taxi came.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bbd5\\\" id=\\\"bbd5\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSven blushed, and Jennie realized she was still staring.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1e5a\\\" id=\\\"1e5a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cMore importantly,\u201d she said, looking down at her mobile, \u201chow do you think they\u2019re getting onto Social Me?

She had indeed banned Jonas and Anahata\u2019s other child prodigies from using Social Me but soon discovered that such precautions were unnecessary.

But she was already thinking about another problem, one that she did not share with her team members but had kept her awake the previous night.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c387\\\" id=\\\"c387\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eShortly after the Social Me launch, Jennie concluded that an engineer\u2019s first interaction with the app was crucial in determining whether he became a repeat visitor. Put simply, he was more likely to return to the app if he had a positive interaction with the opposite sex.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8a86\\\" id=\\\"8a86\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThis was easier said than done. Even the all-powerful internet had its limits, and Jennie\u2019s analytical data showed that most of the engineers were needing several tries before they could land on a girl willing to talk to them for more than a few minutes. As a result, some of the engineers had already given up hope and abandoned the product entirely. If she wanted to keep her engineers on Social Me, she had to make sure that their first interaction with the opposite sex was positive\u200a\u2014\u200aor, better yet, that it led to a full-on coupling event.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c88e\\\" id=\\\"c88e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo Jennie had taken the burden of coupling events on her own back\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally\u200a\u2014\u200aand spent the second day of the launch running from one sleep capsule to another, converting twenty engineers to satisfied Social Me users. By the end of the day, she was worn out (and slightly disgusted) and knew she couldn\u2019t do it on her own. The twenty escorts she had hired the next day made quick work of the Genie, Moodify, and infrastructure teams, and by week\u2019s end had ensured that hundreds of other Anahata engineers were reaching some personal form of ecstasy thanks to Social Me.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3488\\\" id=\\\"3488\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut she knew her escort strategy wasn\u2019t scalable and wouldn\u2019t help Roni\u2019s moon colony problem. The engineers were certainly coming back for second helpings, but once they were no longer engaged with flirty escorts but normal Anahata women instead, the conversations quickly fell flat.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4e4b\\\" id=\\\"4e4b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eFlipping through the chat records, it was clear that the men simply weren\u2019t engaging the women the right way. If they used the Social Me interest generator feature, they could start a conversation with the girls, but the moment they stopped discussing knitting, pastels, or baking, the conversation screeched to a halt.

They override all the normal chemistry that would draw the women to the HM guys and instead focus them on finding good providers and long-term mates\u200a\u2014\u200aour engineers.

But of course we also have other use cases to solve for, like homosexuality.

From the airport, Arsyen filed a ticket in the company\u2019s internal system, asking for help with Pyrrhian corruption and security concerns. But it seemed the engineer who processed the request interpreted it as something having to do with Arsyen\u2019s hard drive and erased all of Arsyen\u2019s computer and account data.

In the border town of Kerfluff, Arsyen tried to obtain a mule by bartering one of Anahata\u2019s secret hardware products, but everyone in the town just tossed it aside like it was a cheap piece of plastic. As a result, it had taken him almost a week to hitchhike to Poodlekek.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5628\\\" id=\\\"5628\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAnd now here he was, traveling through the city his family had built over decades of rule.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d0fb\\\" id=\\\"d0fb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eLittle had changed since he had fled. Goats continued to huddle outside the stores, hoping for a handout, and the bison-drawn carriages still outpaced the rickety buses that his father had introduced to Pyrrhia. As far as Arsyen could tell, there had been no investment in public works and no attempt to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure beyond the miles and miles of icy curling lanes, which originated alongside the capital\u2019s main road and wound throughout the Pyrrhian countryside. The one nod to modernity were the internet caf\u00e9s, which lined the streets like eager parade-goers, each competing with its neighbor via colorful signs and promises of free extra minutes. But they were all currently closed under Korpeko\u2019s strategy to cut off Poodlekek from the rest of the country.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8f9d\\\" id=\\\"8f9d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThey took the main road into the center, passing the statue of Jeeves, the great English sportsman flown to Poodlekek by Arsyen\u2019s grandfather in the 1960s to help install civilization and croquet fields across the country.

Jeeves and Lascau had both declared that Poodlekek would be the future capital of the world. And it would be, finally, once Arsyen reclaimed his throne. He would summon Bobby Bonilo, and together they would build a new Silicon Valley in Poodlekek\u200a\u2014\u200aa Silicon Poodle, or maybe Poodlecon Valley. It would be full of young people, well educated, designing apps and websites that would save the world\u2026and of course make Pyrrhia\u200a\u2014\u200aand the royal family\u200a\u2014\u200aloads of money.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a43b\\\" id=\\\"a43b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut first he needed to confer with the Throne Reclamation Committee and ensure they were well-prepared for battle.

A full recline was a luxury most standard beds and couches would never allow someone of his height.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"953f\\\" id=\\\"953f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSven picked up his mobile phone. There was a message from Arsyen\u2019s personal account\u200a\u2014\u200aa picture of him atop a mule, smiling, a broken-down bus and a line of scowling poor people behind him. He was asking whether Sven knew where to buy lasers in bulk. Such a funny guy. Was he building a startup? Something using lasers to solve poverty? He would have to find out more when his co-worker returned.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"cb4d\\\" id=\\\"cb4d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSven ignored Arsyen\u2019s questions and sent him back a picture of his crooked second toe. That always made people laugh.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1158\\\" id=\\\"1158\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe returned to the picture of Jennie. She was as bossy and stubborn as Maria, his one almost-girlfriend. They could almost have been the same girl, though unlike Maria, Jennie seemed to bathe consistently, and her hippie dresses and occasional references to feminism and the environment seemed more like fashion accessories than a real belief system. Which pleased Sven, since only in America did there seem to be such a strong connection between poor hygiene and progressive politics.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1904\\\" id=\\\"1904\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSven liked to hear Jennie talk about her grand plans for Mother Earth. She lectured Jonas on recycling Red Bull cans and told Sven that she would one day \u201creally fix things.\u201d Sven thought it was cute that a nontechnical person thought she could change the world. It was ambitious, even if it was clearly delusional.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"02ca\\\" id=\\\"02ca\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSven considered the possibility that Jennie could be smarter than him, though he found that difficult to reconcile with the size of her breasts and her lack of an engineering degree. But she was definitely a good leader\u200a\u2014\u200aprobably the best he ever had at Anahata.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"744c\\\" id=\\\"744c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe yawned and rubbed his eyes. Since Roni and Jennie\u2019s score of the prized employee data, he and Jonas\u200a\u2014\u200aaided by a handful of eager engineers\u200a\u2014\u200ahad been working nonstop on Social Me, making the application even smarter and more effective. They were almost ready to roll out the new version and had spent the day debugging the software and doing quality analysis.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3c54\\\" id=\\\"3c54\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThroughout the day, Sven had interacted with various women at the company using four fake profiles. Bob, Sam, Steve, and Logan all had different jobs, appearances, and interests. But to the credit of Social Me, all of them had experienced plenty of luck with the ladies that day.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2770\\\" id=\\\"2770\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn fact, all of Sven\u2019s twenty test interactions proved successful, the new version of the Social Me app generating such customized pickup lines and compelling conversation fillers that Sven\u2019s various profiles would certainly have had multiple coupling events in the offline world had he chosen to follow through. The new algorithm generated romantic French phrases for Steve after he chose Jamillah, who was registered in a company-sponsored French class. Bob had luck with Annie, convincing her that the best way to conquer her passive-aggressive behavior with her teammates was to engage in some role-play with him later that night. And Sam, armed with the knowledge of Camille\u2019s recent online purchase of a yoga mat, charmed her into doing a virtual downward dog with him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c756\\\" id=\\\"c756\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSven told himself it was his self-discipline and commitment to science that had kept him from following through with any meetups. But he knew the truth was more nuanced: Talking with girls on an app was one thing; actually meeting them\u200a\u2014\u200awhen he might fail to meet their expectations\u200a\u2014\u200awas another entirely.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c645\\\" id=\\\"c645\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJust then, Sven\u2019s phone vibrated. It was a message for Logan from some girl who worked in marketing.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"dd03\\\" id=\\\"dd03\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhat would Jennie think of Logan? Of all Sven\u2019s fake profiles, Logan\u2019s was the one that came closest to the real Sven: tall, blond, and an engineer.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1084\\\" id=\\\"1084\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMasking himself as Logan, Sven clicked on Jennie\u2019s profile and read the information she had filled in. It was all stuff that he already knew from working with her, like how she liked dolphins and reading entrepreneur biographies. He wondered what else the app knew about her.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5f01\\\" id=\\\"5f01\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSven hit the chat button floating above Jennie\u2019s picture, and a Social Me prompt popped up, offering to help kick-start the conversation. This was the same feature he had been testing all day, but now his pulse quickened. He pushed the button again, and a heart icon pulsed three times, preparing his first courtship line. She would never know it was him; Sven hit send.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cpre name=\\\"46b6\\\" id=\\\"46b6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--pre-em\\\"\\x3eHi Jennie!

He had to stop this before Jennie found out who Logan really was. He tossed his phone to the back of the capsule. For minutes, he avoided it, face burning, listening to it vibrate with new messages from Jennie. He decided he would delete her messages without reading them, then come back into work the next day like nothing had ever happened. Jennie would never need to know. He could use Dogtown to ask her out in a few weeks.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c591\\\" id=\\\"c591\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJust then there was a knock on the outside of the capsule wall.

Sprinklers leaped from their subterranean sleep, twisting in unison to the left, then right, ensuring that not a single blade of Anahata grass went unwatered. The sophisticated irrigation system kept the company\u2019s imported Irish grass fertile and sparkling, impervious to California\u2019s perpetual drought.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"995e\\\" id=\\\"995e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe first Anahata jogger bounded across the sidewalk outside Building 2. Dressed in sleek black running gear, an orange HM emblazoned across the back of his jacket, the man reached Building 10 before even a minute had lapsed. In a few more leaps, he was off campus property, returning thirty minutes later, this time at a much reduced speed. He was now accompanied by five other runners, the newcomers all moving with considerable effort. The man lashed at their heels with a stick, spurring them forward as they jog-shlumped past the corner at Building 20, gasping their way toward the campus lake.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6c96\\\" id=\\\"6c96\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe runners passed by a rickety gray shuttle just entering campus, a bulge in its center bouncing perilously close to the pavement. It had wobbled its way up the freeway from San Jose and now stopped in front of Building 2. Men and women slowly filed out of their oversized hearse, joking with each other in Spanish as they badged themselves into Fried Fred\u2019s to begin work.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"66e0\\\" id=\\\"66e0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eA few hours after the gray shuttle chugged back to the freeway, the purple-and-green Anahata buses began to arrive on campus. Bus to Building 1. Bus to Building 8. Their black roofs moved between the white lines of the campus parking lots, slotting in and out like ever-shifting dominoes. Bus to Building 3. Bus to Building 20. Employees stumbled out. Bus to Building 14. Bus to Building 24. Moving to an unseen metronome, the young men and women of Anahata continued on to their buildings, made their coffees, grabbed breakfast, and headed to their desks.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e436\\\" id=\\\"e436\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOne of the first meetings of the day was taking place in Building 4, where a girl with shiny black hair was more prepared for note-taking than decision-making. Her engineering team was waiting for her to make the final call on their highly technical problem, but the girl just shrugged. One of the engineers threw up his hands and left the room, pulling out his mobile phone and ignoring her feeble plea to return. He became so engrossed in his phone that he didn\u2019t notice the sleep capsule by the exit, which was shaking so vigorously that it seemed to be attempting liftoff. He exited the building, head down, mobile pointed in front of him. He cut across the lawn, trampled a flower bed, and left footprints in the newly raked volleyball court as he followed the blinking dot on his screen. A Galt recruiter jumped out of the bushes and dangled a set of Tesla keys before him, but the engineer\u2019s gaze was locked to his screen. He pushed past the recruiter, walked another ten paces, and came to a stop in front of a pair of red manicured toes. He looked up, blushed, and said, \u201cHello.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1afa\\\" id=\\\"1afa\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cHello?\u201d said a woman in Fried Fred\u2019s over the walkie-talkie, hitting the device a few times in hopes of a clearer transmission. \u201cDo you all have bleach?\u201d she asked. At the building next door, an older man in his sixties responded. He wiped his brow and reached below one of the counters, dragging out a large container. On his way to deliver the bleach to Fried Fred\u2019s, he called out across the kitchen to a female co-worker to see whether she had finished prepping the organic kale and quinoa salad. The salad selection changed daily, but his view of it did not: It didn\u2019t matter where you made the salad or how many unpronounceable ingredients it contained\u200a\u2014\u200aas a cafeteria worker, you still got paid the same.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8b6c\\\" id=\\\"8b6c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eFifteen minutes later, a tidal wave hit the walls of Fried Fred\u2019s as the cafeteria staff opened the doors and engineers rushed in with the fever of toddlers in a toy store. The bang of the wok, the tunnel sound of the soda dispenser, the sizzle of the fajita station\u200a\u2014\u200aurgency and consumption mixed suddenly, newly, with light, feminine laughter, skipping past each pop and bang.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7ea7\\\" id=\\\"7ea7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eA man lined up five carts of catered lunch from Fried Fred\u2019s alongside the back entrance to Building 1. He knocked five times, the first three with the same speed, then a pause before the last two. The door opened, and a head slowly extended like a turtle from its shell. The head looked left, then right, then brought its entire body outside, revealing red Crocs and a faded T-shirt that said R-O-N-I. He pushed the carts into Building 1, taking care to secure the door behind him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5a20\\\" id=\\\"5a20\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe operations employee in Building 22 postponed her lunch, crinkling her nose as she tried to make sense of the numbers before her. She had checked the data several times and was sure her figures were correct. According to her analysis, productivity rates at Anahata had inexplicably dropped ten percent over the previous week. While the deployment of the sales team to their new Horizontal Moves programs might have slowed sales employees\u2019 productivity, it made no sense that it would also slow the engineering teams.

Their heads turned in unison as Gregor Guntlag walked into the room. Without shutting the door behind him, and while continuing to thud his way across the room, he announced that all advertising services would be turned off in Africa to free up capacity for a special engineering project. Gregor rounded the far end of the table and now thudded his way in the direction of the door. Anyone unhappy with these changes, he said over his shoulder, was welcome to leave Anahata or join the Horizontal Moves program.

With a groan that came neither from pain nor alcohol but rather a long, uncomfortable sleep, he pushed himself up onto his elbows and surveyed his surroundings. He was in a dusty motel room with one small window above his bed.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e9ff\\\" id=\\\"e9ff\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe moved his hand to his head and ruffled his blond, uncombed hair, as though checking to see if it was still there. He touched his face and felt the slightest beginnings of a beard, his thin, slow-growing hairs jutting out like sharp grass across his chin and cheeks. He studied his hands, smooth and unharmed except for faint bracelet-like marks around his wrists. He was wearing a windbreaker that was covered in mud, partly obscuring an Anahata logo at the top right-hand corner. He glanced at his watch\u200a\u2014\u200ait was a long time since he last remembered doing anything or being in any particular place.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7027\\\" id=\\\"7027\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe man peered out the window and saw a dry, unfamiliar landscape below him. He ran to his door and initially touched the knob with caution, as though afraid it might be electrified. But it opened without incident, and he slowly poked his head out into the hall. A squat woman wearing a simple dress was entering what appeared to be a communal bathroom, mop in hand. She nodded hello with disinterest. On the floor next to his door was an English-language newspaper. Written across the front page was a headline:\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"0d31\\\" id=\\\"0d31\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 53px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 7.6%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png\\\" data-width=\\\"1401\\\" data-height=\\\"106\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*oBvycgzh7b11W9Ljm5-z6w.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"00f4\\\" id=\\\"00f4\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3eThe word \u201cAnahata\u201d triggered something in him, and he suddenly remembered a basement and a bottle of wine.

It mattered, of course, but he really wished she\u2019d pay a bit more attention to his needs. Injustice would be there tomorrow and the next day; they could solve it then.

They moved forward again, and then he fell and was lifted up and suddenly was perched on one of the comrade\u2019s shoulders, carried higher and higher until he was on the top step, looking out onto the derelict landscape of his city, onto the faces of his people. They stared back at him, lips pursed like fish, and he heard Natia\u2019s voice in his ear. \u201cWhistle, Arsyen, whistle!

It was a stranger\u2019s voice, repeating what Arsyen had seen on his Justice for Poodlekek page\u200a\u2014\u200athe same invectives, the same charges against the government. With each squeeze of Natia\u2019s hand, Arsyen\u2019s calls for revolt grew stronger, and the cheers likewise grew in intensity.

Dirt affected everyone; dirt was democratic. Dirt scaled, dirt climbed, dirt 10x\u2019d everything it could. And there was so very, very much that lay below the surface of things. Arsyen vowed that if he somehow made it out of the palace alive, he would take the problem straight to Bobby Bonilo.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e6fa\\\" id=\\\"e6fa\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eArsyen felt his stomach rumble.

It looked like salt, but it wasn\u2019t salt. It was\u2026saltpeter?

In Pokikek, a woman searching for information on curling techniques was taken to a list of the government\u2019s excessive expenditures on exotic birds. In Krakikek, a college student researching European history was redirected to a video of the demonstration outside the imperial palace.

The two sat silently before their glasses of scotch, the president thinking back on his years of rule, the colonel contemplating the best military strategy to protect the country from revolt. As night fell, the crowds outside the palace grew louder, and the first gate, then the second, gave way to the angry masses.

The curling high schools he had created would be restored to Aimo croquet preparatories. The lanes he had crafted alongside the main roads would be left to melt, the ice turning sooty, patches of weeds shooting up like a long-dormant plague. The statue of him in the central plaza, his body bent close to the ground, hand on the curling stone, eyes staring forward into the future, would be toppled by a gang of dirty, illiterate youths.

He popped up now and then at internet conferences and industry events, but even then he was more whisper than presence. He hid in green rooms and VIP suites, sipped his cocktails in the shadows of discreet Davos and Sun City condos. But only those as powerful as the Fixer could claim to have seen him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9c1b\\\" id=\\\"9c1b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBobby liked to think he was equally elusive.

But even Bobby could be practical and knew that telepathy had yet to be invented (though he had Gregor working on it). So he put his Progressa unit\u200a\u2014\u200ajust back from its operation in the Philippines\u200a\u2014\u200aonto the task of tracking him down.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6fa9\\\" id=\\\"6fa9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThere was a reason Bobby trusted his most confidential and tricky tasks to Progressa, the Anahata team in charge of solving big problems like poverty, famine, drought, and hassle-free distributed computing. He had realized early on that the same skills needed to save the world were also those needed to make pesky executives disappear\u200a\u2014\u200aor to quietly recruit slippery visionaries like the Fixer.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0c13\\\" id=\\\"0c13\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThey tracked him down at a Hopi reservation near the Arizona border. The Fixer agreed to meet with Bobby, but in a place far away from the watchful eyes of technologists. And so, eighteen hours after the Anahata board meeting, Bobby hopped on his jet to the Santa Fe Holistic Wellness Center to find the Fixer alone in a meditation room containing only two burning candles, a miniature Japanese garden, and a freshly groomed goat.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2b25\\\" id=\\\"2b25\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe legendary tech healer briefly opened his eyes, acknowledging Bobby\u2019s trespass in his sacred space. At first glance, Bobby found the balding, middle-aged man unexceptional in appearance. But then the Fixer bent over in prayer. His belly pushed in and out of his caftan like a peach-colored pillow, in and out, in and out. Bobby found the rhythm of the breath soothing. He wondered if his own breath could also inspire such calm. He waited.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9c10\\\" id=\\\"9c10\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe Fixer inhaled and exhaled, inhaled and exhaled. With the persistence of the ocean tide, his caftan slowly inched its way up his lower back, soon revealing what Bobby had long heard to be true. Rising along the right of his spine were a series of hatchet marks, a tally of companies the Fixer had resurrected from the depths of bankruptcy, geopolitical nightmares, oil spills, and murdered mistresses.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d62e\\\" id=\\\"d62e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBobby knew that the Fixer would not speak to him right away\u200a\u2014\u200ait was standard practice in the technology industry to use meditation as a negotiation tactic.

You can see the decline begin around that time, and then it\u2019s accelerated week on week. But here\u2019s the weird thing\u200a\u2014\u200athe less productive the sales team is, the happier they become.

The analysts, shareholders, and Suits of Nefarious Intent all crouched around their phones, asking cynical, doubtful questions, their hearts bleeding with greed. None of them could grasp Bobby\u2019s vision. They were always hoping to catch him out on a false step or slip of the tongue, looking to glean insight helpful to their various capitalist machinations.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c0b8\\\" id=\\\"c0b8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBobby found the whole thing repulsive, a bit like being forced to speak to just-above-average smart people.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"133c\\\" id=\\\"133c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe took comfort in knowing he would be rid of them soon, leaving behind Fischer, his chief financial and corporate affairs officer, to deal with the terrestrial bankers.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9886\\\" id=\\\"9886\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe would go out with a bang. Rather than hold an actual phone conference, as was now common practice in the industry, Bobby instead ordered Fischer to \u201cradicalize\u201d the event and invite all the relevant financial analysts out to Palo Alto, with the promise that Bobby would answer each and every one of their questions in person. In preparation, he had Shanley Field cleared of any errant robots and asked the marketing team to construct a suitable space where he could host the visiting analysts for the afternoon.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5f21\\\" id=\\\"5f21\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe marketing team, which up until that point had only ever orchestrated events for bloggers and engineers, decided to rent a circus tent. They set about making sure it was the most connected, Wi-Fi\u2019d tent in the world, ensuring that any analyst could livestream, live blog, and live eat from the comfort of a beanbag. One wall of the tent was covered in Red Bull cans, and another was lined with potato chips and beer. Masseuses were on hand to relieve any fiscal stress. A spiral staircase was installed in the tent\u2019s center, leading from the ground to the very tip of the tent. While it served no purpose, it pleased Bobby. \u201cStaircases are aspirational,\u201d he told Gregor and Fischer as they entered.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"93b0\\\" id=\\\"93b0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe three executives walked to the back of the tent, where they took their seats at a long table.

Anahata undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward or backward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, historical revisionism, or otherwise, and at no point should any statement be considered binding or reflective of the full truth.

On the whole, they seemed younger than the suits of his board. This irritated Bobby\u200a\u2014\u200ayoung people were supposed to love technology. Instead, these men had chosen the old-man institution of banking; they were little more than well-dressed gamblers. All they wanted to talk about was how he could make them more money. They cared nothing for Anahata\u2019s Progressa program or its charitable endeavors. Bobby wondered whether his next project should aim to destroy banking altogether.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ec8c\\\" id=\\\"ec8c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOr maybe he would just draw. Fischer had given him some crayons and paper before the start of the meeting, and Bobby now made use of them. He doodled on the corner of the quarterly report, sketching an idea he had for an enormous flying worm that would carry people through congested cities. Then he made a list of his ten favorite meditation retreats. When he tired of that, he worked on a few ab-tightening breathing exercises his personal trainer had taught him. He was just getting ready to do his neck rolls when he heard Fischer open the meeting to questions. It was the only part of the meeting Bobby ever found interesting; the only time the hunter capitalists had a chance to prick him with their judgments, questions, and irrelevant musings.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d7fd\\\" id=\\\"d7fd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eA German-accented analyst spoke first. \u201cThere are rumors that Galt is working on a drone so small it can enter people\u2019s ears and study their biomes and thoughts by analyzing their earwax.

He knew his reliable CFCAO would give the same answer he always gave, which was essentially to say nothing at all.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c38d\\\" id=\\\"c38d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBobby craned his neck to catch a glimpse of the plastic clock attached with twisty ties to the spiral staircase. There was still a half-hour to go. His nerves tingled as he thought about what was to come. Once the questions were done and the tasteful, tree-shaped Anahata keychains had been dispensed to the analysts, Bobby would lead the crowd out onto the field, where he would unveil Project Y\u200a\u2014\u200athe biggest idea in the history of ideas.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e1da\\\" id=\\\"e1da\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe next analyst struggled to climb out of his beanbag chair, his acrobatics leaving one pant leg tucked halfway into the top of a purple-and-green-striped stock.

A loud noise, as if someone had opened the exit door on a plane, suddenly invaded their ears. They pressed on toward the fumigation tent, but the shaking intensified, making it difficult to move. The men halted as the tent before them began to sway and heave, its outline violently transforming as though a wild animal were tearing at it from the inside. A crack appeared in the dirt, and then another, and another. Amid the shaking, the zombie was tossed from the Segway, landing on his face.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"15b5\\\" id=\\\"15b5\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe zombie spit out a mouthful of dirt and at first thought he might be suffering from a concussion, for what he saw before him seemed like a hallucination. The fumigation tent was rising, first a foot, now two, now five, then ten feet in the air, some sort of engine underneath it blowing the field\u2019s red dirt into the men\u2019s eyes, transforming the frozen analysts into rusted statues. It rose another few feet, and then the tent itself began to rip, coming apart in four sections like a banana peel, its skin gently floating to the ground, revealing an enormous boat-like structure rising ever farther into the sky. There were endless rows of windows, each portico occupied by a smiling face or, occasionally, the terrified stare of an animal. At the front of it all, framed in a wide window running the length of the bow, were Anahata\u2019s leaders. Gregor peered down at the zombie, a smile stretched wide across his face. To his left, Bobby beamed, pointing down at the analysts and even doing a little jig as the boat floated upward. Behind them, the tentacles of the Anahata squid waved frantically within its tank.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4c1f\\\" id=\\\"4c1f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cNooo!\u201d screamed the analysts.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"abab\\\" id=\\\"abab\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cNooo!\u201d screamed the zombie.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6760\\\" id=\\\"6760\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eFor a moment, as if it had heard their cry, the boat stopped, gently bobbing in the sky. But it did not rise farther or move beyond its spot above the field. Seconds passed, and the light bobbing became a strong jerking, soon accompanied by the sound of an engine sputtering. The boat fell ten feet, then rose again, fell, and rose.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6649\\\" id=\\\"6649\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eFrom below, the analysts could hear the screams of its passengers.

There was so much to see on the new moon campus that he wasn\u2019t sure where he should direct his attention. There was the squid, waving its arms in an endless tank that stretched from the space elevator landing dock all the way to the colony\u2019s first building. There was his new company badge, fluorescent and sparkling, occasionally lighting up as though it were communicating with his new environment. And then there was the girl, the tour guide named Jennie, dressed all in white, just like the rest of them, standing before them with a wide smile.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"14a3\\\" id=\\\"14a3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe group followed Jennie through the hallway, past two large doors that led to the outside, emitting small gasps as they discovered their new home\u200a\u2014\u200aa gray, rocky landscape, groomed to make way for pathways and a gentle river that wound its way around the campus. A series of white two-story buildings sat within a smattering of shallow craters. At the center of it all was the volleyball court, sand freshly combed like a Zen garden, waiting under the dark sky for a new set of players to arrive. Behind the court, a neon cactus with arrows sprouting from its trunk pointed in various directions\u200a\u2014\u200ato the apartments, the mines, the gym, and other destinations. But instead, Jennie led them to the river\u200a\u2014\u200aa narrow, canal-like body filled with a thick, turquoise liquid that Jennie said was resistant to evaporation.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8c95\\\" id=\\\"8c95\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOne of the gondola cafeterias was there waiting for them. Everyone climbed aboard and began to pile around the different food stations as the gondola floated through campus. A muscular, good-looking gondolier made his way down the boat, taking drink orders and offering up the chef\u2019s special moon cookie. For a moment, the man reflected that he had never seen a waiter so well-suited for his job. The smooth gestures, his discreet, attentive style\u200a\u2014\u200ait was like the man had been born to do this.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4264\\\" id=\\\"4264\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut it was a passing thought that interested him little, and the man waved the gondolier away as he approached. The man was really only interested in speaking to Jennie. He had seen her somewhere before but couldn\u2019t manage to place her. He watched as she fingered her hair, then removed her white moonjacket. Underneath was a white T-shirt. There was something painted across her chest\u200a\u2014\u200aa moon and a sun, each encircling her breasts.

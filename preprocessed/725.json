Built by his brother Domitian in 82 A.D., the year after Titus\u2019 death and deification, it\u2019s often called a triumphal arch because of the high relief depictions of Roman soldiers carrying the treasures of the Second Temple \u2014 the seven-branched Menorah, the silver trumpets, the Table of the Shew Bread \u2014 in Titus\u2019 triumphal procession of 71 A.D.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Apotheosis-of-Titus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Apotheosis of Titus relief on the vault of the Arch of Titus\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36817\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Apotheosis-of-Titus-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Apotheosis-of-Titus-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Apotheosis-of-Titus-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Apotheosis-of-Titus-430x282.jpg 430w\" title=\"Apotheosis of Titus relief on the vault of the Arch of Titus\" width=\"150\"/></a>That\u2019s just one motif, however. The central panel in the single arch\u2019s soffit relief depicts Titus being carried to the heavens by an eagle. The inscription also emphasizes the recently deceased emperor\u2019s divinity: \u201cSENATUS/ POPULUSQUE ROMANUS/ DIVO TITO DIVI VESPASIANI F(ilio)/ VESPASIANO AUGUSTO\u201d (The Senate and People of Rome [dedicate this arch] to the divine Titus Vespasian Augustus, son of the divine Vespasian).</p>\n<p>Titus\u2019 real triumphal arch was erected in 81 A.D., the year he died, at the curved east end of the Circus Maximus. The triple arch was explicitly dedicated to Titus\u2019 conquest of Judea and Jerusalem. It\u2019s not very well known today because in the Middle Ages it fell victim to the Roman thirst for building materials, leaving only old epigraphic records, coins and drawings testifying to its existence.

A few years later the powerful Frangipani family had control of the Circus Maximus. They built a mill powered by the Mariana and a tower, the Torre della Moletta, was integrated into the Frangipani\u2019s defensive fortifications extending up the Palatine. Modest homes and squatters\u2019 huts grew up all over what had once been a triumphal arch. The grounds of the Circus Maximus were converted to agricultural use, irrigated by the Mariana.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-ancient-1580.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='Engraving of Circus Maximus in antiquity, Arch of Titus right, as printed in \"De ludis circensibus\" by Onofrio Panvinio, etchings by \u00c9tienne Dup\u00e9rac, published 1600.' class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-36819\" height=\"306\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-ancient-1580-430x306.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-ancient-1580-430x306.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-ancient-1580-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-ancient-1580-200x142.jpg 200w\" title='Engraving of Circus Maximus in antiquity, Arch of Titus right, as printed in \"De ludis circensibus\" by Onofrio Panvinio, etchings by \u00c9tienne Dup\u00e9rac, published 1600.' width=\"430\"/></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-print-1580.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='Engraving of Circus Maximus ca. 1560 when it was irrigated farmland, mill, tower, dwellings and decaying fortifactions right, as printed in \"De ludis circensibus\" by Onofrio Panvinio, etchings by \u00c9tienne Dup\u00e9rac, published 1600' class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-36820\" height=\"293\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-print-1580-430x293.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-print-1580-430x293.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-print-1580-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Circus-Maximus-print-1580-200x136.jpg 200w\" title='Engraving of Circus Maximus ca. 1560 when it was irrigated farmland, mill, tower, dwellings and decaying fortifactions right, as printed in \"De ludis circensibus\" by Onofrio Panvinio, etchings by \u00c9tienne Dup\u00e9rac, published 1600' width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>After the Unification of Italy in 1870, construction of the huge retaining walls along the banks of the Tiber and the Lungotevere boulevards cut off the Mariana or drove it underground into culverts. Most of the medieval construction around the Arch of Titus was demolished in the 1930s and 1940s, leaving only the tower, where Saint Francis of Assisi reputedly stayed on his last trip to Rome in 1223 as guest of the Graziano Frangipani\u2019s widow and Franciscan lay sister Jacopa, still standing. Excavations at the time revealed medieval canals and walls made of ancient marbles pilfered from the arch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Remains-of-Arch-of-Titus-at-Circus-Maximus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Remains of Arch of Titus at Circus Maximus\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36827\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Remains-of-Arch-of-Titus-at-Circus-Maximus-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Remains-of-Arch-of-Titus-at-Circus-Maximus-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Remains-of-Arch-of-Titus-at-Circus-Maximus-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Remains-of-Arch-of-Titus-at-Circus-Maximus-430x295.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Remains-of-Arch-of-Titus-at-Circus-Maximus.jpg 1400w\" title=\"Remains of Arch of Titus at Circus Maximus\" width=\"150\"/></a>Now archaeologists excavating the eastern hemicycle of the Circus Maximus <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11638975/Massive-triumphal-marble-arch-built-by-Romans-to-honour-Emperor-Titus-discovered.html\" target=\"_blank\">have found large blocks of Carrara marble</a> (<em>marmor lunensis</em>) that were part of the \u200b\u200battic, entablature and columns of the Arch.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Archaeologists found more than 300 marble fragments of the monument, some of them the size of a small car.</p>\n<p>They discovered the bases of the four giant columns that formed the front of the arch, as well as the plinths on which they rested and traces of the original travertine pavement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>From the remains experts were able to calculate the arch\u2019s original dimensions. It was 17 meters (56 feet) wide, 15 meters (49 feet) deep with columns 10 meters (33 feet) high. The full height including the attic has yet to be determined. In antiquity there was the monumental bronze sculpture of a quadriga on top of the arch which would have added significant vertical heft.</p>\n<p>Excavation is difficult because the remains were found about 10 feet below ground level, which is on the wrong side of the water table. Further digging is going to require blocking off the water in the area, a particular challenge considering a river literally ran through the arch and its ruins for hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists want to reconstruct as much of the arch as possible using the technique of anastylosis which attempts to put the ancient pieces back together as accurately as possible with only the modern materials necessary for structural stability. In order to do that, they\u2019ll have to find a solution to the water seepage problem and a million euros, two daunting prospects. Since that\u2019s sure to take time, the foundations will be reburied shortly for their own protection. Meanwhile, archaeologists are working on a virtual model of the triumphal Arch of Titus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/05/28/news/circo_massimo-115493901/#gallery-slider=115510532\" target=\"_blank\">Here\u2019s a puny slideshow of the site</a>.

Pairs of divers \u2014 one Parks Canada underwater archaeologist paired with one Royal Canadian Navy ice diving expert \u2014 explored the wreck in shifts for 12 hours a day for a week in the middle of April.

There are 60 charters in the collection, all from the Fleming family of Biggar in the South Highlands of Scotland dating between the 14th and the 17th centuries. </p>\n<p>The Fleming family played an important role in medieval Scottish history. Flemish knights and merchants came to Britain from Flanders as early in the 11th century. The Flemings of Biggar are thought to have descended from a knight who was given lands in Devonshire by William the Conqueror. Some Flemish knights fought for King Stephen during the upheavals of the Anarchy. When Henry II came to the throne, the Flemings who had been on Stephen\u2019s side were banished and found refuge in Scotland under King David I (reigned 1124 \u2013 1153). The first Fleming of this family recorded in Scotland was Baldwin Le Fleming who settled in Biggar and was appointed Sheriff of Lanarkshire by David I. As sheriff he controlled the Upper Clyde Valley which was of great strategic importance as the gateway to Scotland for any number of hostile invaders. Baldwin served under two more kings after David \u2014 his grandsons Malcolm IV and King William the Lion. </p>\n<p>The Fleming holdings expanded significantly in the 14th century when Robert Fleming was granted the fiefdom of Cumbernauld in Dunbartonshire by Robert the Bruce. It was a reward for Fleming\u2019s involvement in one of the era\u2019s most notorious incidents: when Robert the Bruce stabbed John \u201cRed\u201d Comyn, his main competition for the throne of Scotland, to death in the church of the Greyfriars in Dumfries on February 10th, 1306. Fleming reputedly decapitated Red Comyn and presented the head to the Bruce telling him \u201cLet the deid shaw,\u201d meaning \u201cLet the deed show.\u201d That phrase became the Fleming family motto thereafter.</p>\n<p>Robert Fleming died shortly thereafter, but his son Malcolm would benefit even more directly from Red Comyn\u2019s death. Robert the Bruce granted him the barony of Kirkintilloch which had belonged to Comyn.  The Flemings held Cumbernauld Castle until Cromwell destroyed it in 1650, and along the way gained and lost or sold a number of properties and associated titles. Flemings continued to be closely linked to generations of Scottish monarchs. Much of this history survives in the form of charters, most of them land grants, and the Fleming family collection includes many kings and queens \u2014 David II, Robert III, James III, James IV, Charles II, Mary, Queen of Scots \u2014 as parties to the charters.</p>\n<p>The charters, written in Latin and many still bearing the wax seals of their signers, had not been studied, translated or published before Robertson donated them. The Fisher Library is making up for lost time by digitizing and researching the charters. Once the documents are scanned, the library is sending high resolution images to the University of St Andrews Institute of Scottish Historical Research where researchers can translate and study them. </p>\n<p>The first two charters sent to the University of St Andrews <a href=\"http://flemish.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2015/05/07/the-fleming-family-charter-collection-and-the-dark-side-of-fifteenth-century-family-life/\" target=\"_blank\">have already proved intriguing</a>. The earliest of them dates to 1395 and grants to Patrick Fleming, younger son of Sir Malcolm Fleming of Biggar, the lands of Glenrusto and Over Menyean in the Tweed valley. The second is dated November 3rd, 1421, and transfers property from Malcolm Fleming, grandson of the Malcolm party to the 1395 grant, to his cousin James, son of the Patrick who was the other party to the 1395 grant. Gelnrusto and Over Menyean are two of the properties transferred to James.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Charter-dated-3rd-November-1421-issued-from-Cumbernauld-Castle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-36793\" height=\"320\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Charter-dated-3rd-November-1421-issued-from-Cumbernauld-Castle-430x320.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Charter-dated-3rd-November-1421-issued-from-Cumbernauld-Castle-430x320.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Charter-dated-3rd-November-1421-issued-from-Cumbernauld-Castle-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Charter-dated-3rd-November-1421-issued-from-Cumbernauld-Castle-200x148.jpg 200w\" title=\"Charter dated November 3rd, 1421, issued from Cumbernauld Castle granting properties to James Fleming\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>This may seem like the dry business of a large family with a vast feudal estate, but the 1421 charter is unusual in that it is part of an indenture. The cutouts along the top of the document are the equivalent of an anti-forging watermark today. Both parties to the indenture would have copies with uneven edges, preventing one of the parties from forging a document that gave them some advantage. What makes the mark of indenture noteworthy in this case is that this type of contract was employed when there were disputes, not in simple transfers of property between family members.</p>\n<p>Comparing this document to an inventory of charters in the National Library of Scotland reveals the hidden machinations and violence behind this intrafamily land transfer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the same time as receiving this grant, James Fleming made a separate formal resignation of the lands referred to in the charter to his cousin. This included a penalty clause: should James, at a later date, quarrel with Malcolm over the latter\u2019s rights to these lands, James was bound to surrender another estate, Monicabo in Aberdeenshire. This clause is a strong pointer to the fact that what was going on in November 1421 was no simple property deal but involved a degree of coercion of the lesser man, James Fleming, by his more powerful cousin.</p>\n<p>Direct evidence of the extent of this coercion is provided by a final document. This is a copy of what is described in the inventory as a \u2018writ\u2019, a suitably vague term. In this, James Fleming clears Malcolm Fleming of Biggar and his accomplices of any part in the death of his father, Patrick Fleming, and agrees to end any hostility towards Malcolm. This document would obviously repay further examination but even this record makes clear that the land transactions were associated with the killing of their previous holder. It is surely not a huge stretch to suggest that Patrick Fleming had been killed in a dispute over his estates and that, after his death, his son was being forced to surrender the lands in question to a man implicated in the killing. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Malcolm had all the cards in this relationship. He was the head of the family and had supporters in the highest echelons of power. James had to take this land settlement and its confidentiality clause forcing him to keep his mouth shut about the shady circumstances surrounding his father\u2019s demise or he\u2019d wind up empty-handed and very probably as dead as his father.</p>\n<p>Researchers hope that as the digitization of the Robertson Collection continues, more of this story and other unexplored facets of Scottish history will be revealed.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Murder through the lines of medieval land charters\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36792\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36792#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-36773\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36773\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Scythian gold vessels found with opium, cannabis residue\">Scythian gold vessels found with opium, cannabis residue</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, May 28th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gold-from-Scythian-grave.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36775\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gold-from-Scythian-grave-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gold-from-Scythian-grave-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gold-from-Scythian-grave-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gold-from-Scythian-grave-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gold from Scythian kurgan, ca. 2,400 years old.

The artifacts were discovered in the summer of 2013 when kurgan Sengileevskoe-2 was being excavated in advance of power-line construction. Archaeologist Andrei Belinski didn\u2019t expect to find anything of note \u2014 the kurgan had already been looted \u2014 but after a few weeks of digging, the team encountered a thick layer of clay. Underneath the clay was a rectangular chamber lined with flat stones that held a treasure trove of 2,400-year-old solid gold artifacts. </p>\n<p>The trove consists of two gold bucket-shaped vessels turned upside down on top of three gold cups with holes in their bases, a heavy gold ring, two neck rings and a bracelet. Their total weight is 3.2 kilos (seven pounds). Seeing a black residue at the bottom of the vessels, Belinksi had forensic criminologists in Strovopol analyze the substance. It tested positive for opium and cannabis, providing archaeological evidence for a practice mentioned by ancient Greek historian of dubious accuracy Herodotus.</p>\n<p>Herodotus gives an account in <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.4.iv.html\" target=\"_blank\">Book IV of his <em>History</em></a> of Scythians using hemp in a purification ritual after the funeral of a king.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After the burial, those engaged in it have to purify themselves, which they do in the following way. First they well soap and wash their heads; then, in order to cleanse their bodies, they act as follows: they make a booth by fixing in the ground three sticks inclined towards one another, and stretching around them woollen felts, which they arrange so as to fit as close as possible: inside the booth a dish is placed upon the ground, into which they put a number of red-hot stones, and then add some hemp-seed. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed, and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can exceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy, and this vapour serves them instead of a water-bath; for they never by any chance wash their bodies with water.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Old-man-slays-youth-Bastard-Wars.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-36774\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Old-man-slays-youth-Bastard-Wars-200x200.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Old-man-slays-youth-Bastard-Wars-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Old-man-slays-youth-Bastard-Wars-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Old-man-slays-youth-Bastard-Wars-430x430.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Old-man-slays-youth-Bastard-Wars.jpg 1352w\" title=\"Old man slays youth, possible Bastard Wars reference, on gold vessel. Image by Andrei Belinski.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The elaborate decoration on one of the upside down gold vessels may also tie into one of Herodotus\u2019 anecdotes. At the beginning of Book IV, he describes the Schythian warriors returning home after 28 years of war in Persia to find that their wives gave up on them years ago and had children with their slaves instead. The sons, knowing they would not be accepted by the cuckolded husbands, attempted to block their return. They were successful at first, winning battle after battle, but soon they were overcome by the mere symbols of their slave heritage.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhat are we doing, Scythians? We are fighting our slaves, diminishing our own number when we fall, and the number of those that belong to us when they fall by our hands. Take my advice \u2014 lay spear and bow aside, and let each man fetch his horsewhip, and go boldly up to them. So long as they see us with arms in our hands, they imagine themselves our equals in birth and bravery; but let them behold us with no other weapon but the whip, and they will feel that they are our slaves, and flee before us.\u201d </p>\n<p>The Scythians followed this counsel, and the slaves were so astounded, that they forgot to fight, and immediately ran away.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This conflict became known as the Bastard Wars. One of the vessels has a scene of an older bearded man slaying a young warrior, a possible reference to the Bastard Wars. Andrei Belinski thinks the imagery isn\u2019t referring to a specific battle, but is more likely to be a metaphoric representation of chaos in the wake of a king\u2019s death, an appropriate subject for royal grave goods.

When your puzzle is 4,000 pieces of Anglo-Saxon gold, silver and gem-festooned objects, sorting out which are part of the same artifact is essential. Thus one of the most important and complicated labours in the first phase of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32928\" target=\"_blank\">conservation of the Staffordshire Hoard</a> was the grouping together of fragments according to their physical and stylistic characteristics. From the grouping exercise, researchers identified more than 1,500 fragments of silver gilt foil they believe were part of an extremely rare Anglo-Saxon helmet. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-3-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36761\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-3-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-3-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-3-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Section-of-reconstructed-helmetband-3-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Section of reconstructed helmet band with frieze of warriors \u00a9 Birmingham Museums Trust\" width=\"200\"/></a>Only four other examples of Anglo-Saxon helmets have been found, including one <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/h/helmet_from_sutton_hoo.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">unearthed in the famous Sutton Hoo ship burial</a> in 1939, so it\u2019s imperative that the puzzle be pieced together. It\u2019s a painstaking job, figuring out how 1,500 sheets and strips of foil, many of them no larger than 10mm (.4 inches) across, fit together. So far they\u2019ve been able to piece together a zoomorphic frieze and many of the <a href=\"https://www.historicengland.org.uk/news-and-features/news/secrets-staffordshire-hoard-revealed\" target=\"_blank\">fragments making up the helmet band</a> that runs around the circumference of the object. The helmet band designs are die-stamped warriors armed and kneeling. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a glimpse of the tiny pieces of a zoomorphic frieze from the helmet conservators are negotiating:</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/illHSuYSBvk&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The Sutton Hoo helmet is silver. The Staffordshire Hoard is gilded.

There are more than 70 pommels in the Staffordshire Hoard, but this one is unique. Reassembled from 26 fragments, the gold, gold filigree, garnet, niello and inlaid glass pommel has a rounded piece on the shoulder called a \u201csword-ring.\u201d Although only one of the pommel\u2019s sword-rings has been found in the hoard, the construction indicates there were two originally, one on each side. This is the first pommel ever discovered to have two sword-rings, making it an entirely new type. It is also lavishly decorated in a combination of Anglo-Saxon and British or Irish motifs. It may even have a combination of early Christian and traditional polytheistic decorative themes \u2014 the garnet and glass inlaid disk could be a stylized Christiana cross, while three serpents on the back of the pommel are pagan. </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Back-of-reconstructed-sword-pommel-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36758\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Back-of-reconstructed-sword-pommel-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Back-of-reconstructed-sword-pommel-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Back-of-reconstructed-sword-pommel-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Back-of-reconstructed-sword-pommel-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust-430x288.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Back-of-reconstructed-sword-pommel-\u00a9-Birmingham-Museums-Trust.jpg 1517w\" title=\"Back of reconstructed sword pommel \u00a9 Birmingham Museums Trust\" width=\"150\"/></a>Chris Fern, project archaeologist, said \u201cThe Staffordshire Hoard links us with an age of warrior splendour. The gold and silver war-gear was probably made in workshops controlled by some of England\u2019s earliest kings, to reward warriors that served those rulers, when multiple kingdoms fought for supremacy. The skill of the craftsmen is equally thrilling to behold, with many of the finds decorated with pagan and Christian art, designed to give spiritual protection in battle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe newly recognised pommel is truly exciting. It combines multiple different styles of ornament, much in the same way as the earliest 7th century illuminated manuscripts do, like the Book of Durrow. It suggests the coming together of Anglo-Saxon and British or Irish high cultures.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The second stage of conservation and research has been funded to the tune of \u00a3400,000 by Historic England, but they need to raise another \u00a3120,000 to complete the project. This phase will entail the conservation and physical joining of the fragments that have been matched to each other, a comprehensive study of the exquisite cloisonn\u00e9 cellwork seen on so many pieces from the hoard (see the gold and garnet Bible bindings  in the video below for an example), a microscopic analysis of materials that are as of yet unidentified, contextual research of the practice of hoarding and the creation of an online database of the complete hoard by 2017.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to donate to the cause, you can <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/Staffordshire-Hoard\" target=\"_blank\">make an online payment here</a>.

The restoration by experts at the Superior Institute for Conservation and Restoration (ISCR) took three years. The surface was cleaned, pollutants and paint from past retouchings removed.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time the ISCR has worked on this icon. In 1951 it was restored by Cesare Brandi, ISCR founder and pioneer art restorer. The icon was in dangerously bad condition due to the decay of the wood panel on which it was originally painted. Brandi transferred the work to canvas and filled in areas of missing paint using a thin watercolor cross-hatching technique he had pioneered in the restoration of the frescoes in the church of Saint Mary of the Truth in Viterbo after they were reduced to rubble by an Allied bomb in 1944. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Icon-during-restoration.jpeg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36746\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Icon-during-restoration-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Icon-during-restoration-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Icon-during-restoration-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Icon-during-restoration-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Icon-during-restoration.jpeg 1000w\" title=\"Icon during restoration. Photo by Angelo Rubino \u00a9ISCR.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The next time the icon left the church was in 2012 for an exhibition of 14 of Rome\u2019s medieval icons at the Palazzo Venezia. That\u2019s where it became clear that Brandi\u2019s retouchings had become problematic over the six decades. ISCR restorers removed paint from Brandi\u2019s and previous interventions. The small gaps were then filled by being covered with tissue paper and painted with watercolor, the larger gaps by stucco and cross-hatch paintings. The technique Brandi used is still a staple of art restoration today; it\u2019s the materials and analytic technology that have improved by leaps and bounds.</p>\n<p>Cesare Brandi also restored other famous icons in Rome, including the Madonna of Ara Coeli, an 11th century tempera on wood panel which replaced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_of_Foligno\" target=\"_blank\">a masterpiece by Raphael</a> on the high altar of the church of Ara Coeli on the Capitoline Hill, and the <a href=\"http://charlottelaydominicans.org/2014/07/22/the-madonna-of-san-sisto/\" target=\"_blank\">Madonna of San Sisto</a>, now at the monastery of Santa Maria del Rosario in the Monte Mario neighborhood, which dates to the 7th century and is the oldest icon in the city. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Madonna-icon-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36748\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Madonna-icon-det-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Madonna-icon-det-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Madonna-icon-det-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Madonna-icon-det-430x646.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Madonna-icon-det.jpg 665w\" title=\"Face detail of the restored icon. Photo by Angelo Rubino \u00a9ISCR.\" width=\"99\"/></a>The Madonna di Sant\u2019Alessio icon was painted by an unknown Roman artist in the mid-13th century in the style of the Advocate Madonna, an iconographic type emphasizing Mary\u2019s intercessionary role on behalf of humanity that was very popular in medieval Rome. For a few centuries before and after the first millennium, the Advocate Madonna type, depicted without the Christ child, her right hand raised, her left against her chest, was considered the quintessential Roman Madonna.</p>\n<p>The church, originally dedicated to Saint Boniface of Tarsus alone, was expanded to include Saint Alexius in the masthead by Sergius, the Greek metropolitan bishop of Damascus who had fled the advancing Islamic forces and settled in Rome in 977 A.D. According to his legend Alexius was born and raised to a wealthy senatorial family in 4th-5th century Rome, but the cult venerating him started in Syrian where the saint was said to have lived as a beggar after abandoning his youth of privilege and comfort. After a church sexton had a miraculous vision of the Madonna which pointed to him as a holy man, Alexius fled his newfound fame and returned to Rome where his parents, who did not recognize him, let him live in a cubby under the staircase out of Christian charity. It wasn\u2019t until his death 17 years later that his autobiography was found clenched in his hand and he was finally recognized as their long-lost son. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Basilica-of-Saints-Boniface-and-Alexius.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36750\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Basilica-of-Saints-Boniface-and-Alexius-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Basilica-of-Saints-Boniface-and-Alexius-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Basilica-of-Saints-Boniface-and-Alexius-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Basilica-of-Saints-Boniface-and-Alexius-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Basilica of Saints Boniface and Alexius\" width=\"150\"/></a>Sergius brought the cult of Saint Alexius to Rome with him where it found fertile ground since Romans love a native son. The site of the church on the Aventine even garnered an apocryphal association with Saint Alexius: it was said to be the location where his father Euphemianus\u2019 home stood, the stairs under which he had lived in humility and poverty incorporated into the walls of the church. While he\u2019s still a saint in the Latin Church, his cult has faded. It\u2019s in the Eastern Church, particularly in Russia, where Alexius is one of the most venerated saints, a frequent subject of poems and stories and the reason Alexei was such a popular name for Tsars.</p>\n<p>The newly restored icon plays into the legend of Saint Alexius as well. In the sexton\u2019s vision where Mary identified Alexius as true holy man, she spoke through her icon. According to this tale, Sergius brought the icon from the church in Edessa with him when he went to Rome. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Icon of the Madonna restored to former splendor\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36743\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36743#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-36729\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36729\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Lost Reich Chancellery horses found in warehouse\">Lost Reich Chancellery horses found in warehouse</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, May 25th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36734\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-2-97x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-2-97x150.jpg 97w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-2-195x300.jpg 195w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-2-430x659.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bronze horses by Josef Thorak found in Bad Duerkheim warehouse.

When Berlin became the target of ever more frequent bombings in 1943, the horses were moved from their positions on either side of the Reich Chancellery staircase to the sculpture factory in Wriezen, a town 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of Berlin. The Wriezen complex was used to produce large-scale Nazi sculptures and architectural features using a workforce of skilled and unskilled Italian and French prisoners of war. It also had storage sheds containing art treasures looted from Nazi-occupied territories. </p>\n<p>The town was occupied by Soviet troops in 1945 and became part of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The next time the statues were seen, it was 1950 and they were on the sports field of a Red Army barracks in the town of Eberswalde (Brandenburg). Thorak\u2019s <em>Walking Horses</em> spent 38 years on the field and they saw some rough treatment. Damaged by bullet holes, the horses were painted over in gold. At some point their tales broke off and were reattached crudely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Horses-removed-from-warehouse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36732\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Horses-removed-from-warehouse-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Horses-removed-from-warehouse-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Horses-removed-from-warehouse-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Horses-removed-from-warehouse-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Horses-removed-from-warehouse.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Horses removed from warehouse.

In January of 1989 Busshart published an article about the horses in <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</em>, a Frankfurt daily newspaper. A few weeks later, a reader told her that the horses were gone. Experts believe they were sold by the GDR government which in 1989 was facing its imminent demise and was in dire need of hard currency. They disappeared from the record at that point only to reappear again in mysterious online sales postings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36736\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-horses-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bronze horses transported on a flatbed trailer in Bad Duerkheim. Photo by Fredrik von Erichsen/dpa.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The investigation began in 2013 when an informant told the Berlin police that someone was attempting to sell the pair of horses online. Last year, Arthur Brand, who runs a private firm that researches the ownership history of artworks with a specialty in tracing art the Nazis stole from Jews, saw photographs of the horses in a sale offer seeking 8 million euros ($8.9 million) for the pair. At first he thought the pictures had to be fakes, that the horses were long gone, destroyed in the death throes of the GDR. After following the trail through German archives, old newsreels, his contacts in the Russian military and even satellite images, Brand came to believe the photographs showed the genuine article. In late 2014, Brand <a href=\"http://www.wduv.com/ap/ap/entertainment/dutch-art-sleuth-helps-german-police-track-down-na/nmMBM/\" target=\"_blank\">relayed his information to the Berlin police</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the eight suspects claims he is the legitimate owner of the tons of art in the Bad Duerkheim warehouse. According to his attorney, Andreas Hiemsch, the man lawfully acquired the art from the Red Army more than 25 years ago and even offered to loan some of them to museums. Sorting out legal ownership is going to be a challenge. The Red Army/GDR sale may be hard to document; the Federal Republic of Germany has a claim as the successor of the GDR; the artists\u2019 heirs might have a viable ownership claim. It could be years before it\u2019s all sorted.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"255\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/c/embed/240581c4-00bd-11e5-8c77-bf274685e1df\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"420\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Lost Reich Chancellery horses found in warehouse\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36729\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36729#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-36706\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36706\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Plaster casts of Vesuvius\u2019 victims restored\">Plaster casts of Vesuvius\u2019 victims restored</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, May 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pompeii-cast.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36711\" height=\"95\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pompeii-cast-150x95.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pompeii-cast-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pompeii-cast-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pompeii-cast-430x273.jpg 430w\" title=\"Plaster cast of Vesuvius victim has crumbled away over the years to reveal bones\" width=\"150\"/></a>When Vesuvius erupted on August 24th, 79 A.D., a column of ash and pumice rained down on Pompeii, depositing as much as a foot per hour in some parts of the city. Fleeing the shower of stone and ash, many people took shelter in buildings, a deadly choice as it happened, since within six hours from the beginning of the eruption, the weight of accumulated pumice fall caused roofs and walls to collapse. An anomalously high percentage of the remains of people who died in this phase of the eruption \u2014 345 individuals, or 88% of the people killed during the pumice fall deposit phase \u2014 were found indoors, killed by the buildings they had taken fled to for protection. Out of the people found outdoors (49 of them, or 12% of the pumice fall victims), most of them were probably killed by debris from collapsing structures. The rest were likely felled by larger stones striking them at ballistic speeds.</p>\n<p>Most of the remains discovered, 650 people, were found in pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) deposit, 334 (51%) of them outdoors, 316 (49%) indoors. There is no evidence that they were burned to death. They were encased by fine ash and covered by the pyroclastic flow that blanketed the town, sealing in the ash and pumice layer and suffocating the people trapped underneath it to death.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mother-and-child-cast.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36708\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mother-and-child-cast-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mother-and-child-cast-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mother-and-child-cast-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mother-and-child-cast-430x283.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cast of mother and child\" width=\"150\"/></a>The ash and pyroclastic layers hardened quickly around the bodies. The soft tissues decomposed over time, leaving only bones in cavities once occupied by whole bodies. More than 1700 years later, excavators of the ancient site noticed that underneath the skeletal remains of a young woman was an imprint of her breasts and body. They didn\u2019t know how to preserve it, however, so the imprint was lost as excavations continued, as were similar such finds. </p>\n<p>The breakthrough came on February 5th, 1863, when Giuseppe Fiorelli, Pompeii\u2019s director of works who introduced a revolutionary new scientific rigor to the excavation of the city, was told by a labourers that they had found a cavity with bones at the bottom. Fiorelli told them to stop digging immediately and had plaster poured into that cavity and two others found nearby. They waited two days for the plaster to dry and then chipped away the ash exposing the cast of a person killed during the eruption of Vesuvius almost 1800 years earlier. Facial expressions, clothes, the position of the bodies all were perfectly captured by the plaster casts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dog-from-House-of-Orpheus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36722\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dog-from-House-of-Orpheus-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dog-from-House-of-Orpheus-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dog-from-House-of-Orpheus-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dog-from-House-of-Orpheus-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cast of writing dog from House of Orpheus\" width=\"150\"/></a>Plaster had been used once before in 1856 to capture an imprint in the ash, but it was the imprint of a long-gone architectural feature, not of a human being. That was Fiorelli\u2019s brilliant innovation. He remained director of works until 1875. Under his leadership, plaster casts were made of people, animals \u2014 most famously the dog on its back with four legs in the air found in the House of Orpheus \u2014 furniture, doors, window frames, even the holes in the ground left by roots. The plaster casts of roots allowed archaeologists to identify plants with enough precision to recreate the landscaped pleasure gardens of the wealthy a well as the more practical vegetable gardens that fed the people of Roman-era Pompeii.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Plaster-cast.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36713\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Plaster-cast-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Plaster-cast-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Plaster-cast-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Plaster-cast-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Plaster cast of man curled up in fetal position\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was the expressive pathos of the human figures, their final moments frozen in time by the volcano that killed them, that has made a profound impression in all who have seen them since 1863. Luigi Settembrini, professor of Italian literature at the University of Naples, visited the site just a few days after the first castings were made. That night, February 13th, 1863, unable to sleep, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=STcCAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA334\" target=\"_blank\">he wrote a letter</a> to Fiorelli.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s impossible to see those three cast figures and not feel moved. [\u2026] They\u2019ve been dead for 18 centuries, but they are human creatures seen in their agony. This is not art, not imitation, but their bones, the reliquaries of their flesh and clothes mixed with plaster: it\u2019s the pain of death that reacquired body and shape. [\u2026] Up until now there have been discovered temples, houses and other objects to interest the curiosity of cultured people, artists and archaeologists, but now you, oh my Fiorelli, have discovered human pain, and whoever is human feels it.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Resin-cast-of-Pompeii-victim.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36723\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Resin-cast-of-Pompeii-victim-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Resin-cast-of-Pompeii-victim-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Resin-cast-of-Pompeii-victim-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Resin-cast-of-Pompeii-victim-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Resin cast of Maiden of Oplontis \" width=\"150\"/></a>The filling of the cavities with plaster has continued ever since. In 1984 they tried a different medium, resin instead of plaster. Inspired by the lost wax method of bronze casting, archaeologists injected wax into the cavity left by the body of a young woman found in the Villa of Lucius Crassius Tertius in Oplontis. Once the wax was hardened, it was coated in plaster. The wax was then melted and the empty plaster cast filled with liquid epoxy resin. The result was a transparent cast through which you could see the Maiden of Oplontis\u2019 bones and her jewelry in situ. Although its transparency and durability are marked advantages, resin casting is complicated, time consuming and expensive. Today Pompeii\u2019s archaeologists are still using plaster. It\u2019s a tricky process. Only a small percentage of the remains found can be cast \u2014 there are only around 100 plaster casts (including animals) out more than 1,100 bodies found \u2014 due to the condition of the ash shell, and the bones are very brittle. The plaster has to be thick enough to support the bones suspended in it but thin enough to flow freely into nooks and crannies so it can capture all possible detail.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Restorer-works-on-cast.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36707\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Restorer-works-on-cast-150x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Restorer-works-on-cast-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Restorer-works-on-cast-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Restorer-works-on-cast-430x279.jpg 430w\" title=\"Restorer rehydrates plaster cast\" width=\"150\"/></a>Because the casts are human remains, archaeologists have been reluctant to restore them. The very old plaster has begun to degrade, however, exposing the bones inside. Now, as part of the <a href=\"http://www.pompeiisites.org/Sezione.jsp?titolo=Pompeii%20Projects&amp;idSezione=985\" target=\"_blank\">Great Pompeii Project</a>, a program of restoration and stabilization of many endangered areas of the ancient archaeological site, all 86 plaster casts of human remains are being restored. The plaster is being rehydrated where possible and repaired where it has crumbled away. The casts have been X-rayed and laser scanned so archaeologists knew exactly where everything inside was before they began to work on the plaster. With the precise data mapping of the laser scan, restorers have also been able to create precise replicas of the cast with 3D printing. That will be very helpful going forward for traveling exhibitions and the like.</p>\n<p>This video, which I would strongly recommend muting, shows an overview of the restoration, starting with the casts being moved from the areas of the archaeological site where they\u2019ve been on display to the restoration workshop (set up in one of Pompeii\u2019s ancient buildings) of the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Naples and Pompeii. It\u2019s remarkable how much it looks like the wounded being carried on stretchers to a field hospital full of war casualties.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/fnBwgJQzbgQ&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>Twenty of the restored casts will go on display in Pompeii\u2019s amphitheater as part of the <a href=\"http://mostrapompeieuropa.it/en/exhibition.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pompeii and Europe</em></a> exhibition starting May 27th and running through November 2nd.

A sharp-eyed and damn decent collector spotted them in an online sale and notified the authorities who traced them in a property in south London. The place was raided by detectives from the Metropolitan Police Art &amp; Antiques Unit in January and the panels recovered. A 50-year-old man from Wales has been arrested for the theft.</p>\n<p>The panels were part of a rood screen, a tracery partition separating the nave from the chancel, built between 1460 and 1470. Inset in Gothic arches that mimic the design of the church\u2019s stained glass windows are a series of 40 oak panels painted with figures of God, Mary, the Apostles and a panoply of saints. They are of extremely high quality, \u201ccathedral quality,\u201d according to the art historian Dr. Neil Rushton of the Churches Conservation Trust. Painted by a top artist of the period at the same time the church was constructed, the rood screen panels are colorful evidence of how much money, mainly from the wool trade, was in the area in the second half of the 15th century. They are the country\u2019s best surviving examples of this kind of art from the late Middle Ages, almost all of which was destroyed in the Reformation, and therefore of national importance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-panel-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36699\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-panel-det-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-panel-det-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-panel-det-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-panel-det-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recovered-panel-det.jpg 1023w\" title=\"Recovered panel of St. Victor of Marseilles detail\" width=\"200\"/></a>The panels that were stolen depict St. Victor of Marseilles and St. Margaret of Antioch, lesser known saints which make them rarer than the panels with more common iconography. Because of their rarity, there was speculation at the time of the theft that it may have been commissioned by an underworld collector who coveted these specific pieces, but the commissioned theft idea always gets deployed after these sort of crimes and it usually turns out to be a lot more Keystone Cops and a lot less Thomas Crown. This case is no different. Commissioned thefts don\u2019t wind up for sale online.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holy-Trinity-Church.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26625\" height=\"109\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holy-Trinity-Church-150x109.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holy-Trinity-Church-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holy-Trinity-Church-200x145.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Holy-Trinity-Church-430x313.jpg 430w\" title=\"Holy Trinity Church, Torbryan, Devon\" width=\"150\"/></a>Churches have increasingly been frequent targets of thieves, often for the scrap value of their architectural materials like lead roof tiles or even <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20840\" target=\"_blank\">paving stones and grave markers</a>. Art is a riskier proposition since it\u2019s more likely to be recognizable, but that hasn\u2019t stopped thieves from taking the chance before at the Holy Trinity Church. Four of the original 40 panels were stolen in the 1990s and three more were taken in 2003. Those seven panels are still missing which makes the recovery of the two most recent thefts even more significant. </p>\n<blockquote><p>West Mercia Police are now leading the investigation into the theft as part of Operation Icarus, which has also recovered a treasure trove of other church artefacts, including stonework, friezes, statues, paintings, brasses, misericords, stained glass and bibles. The police are appealing for help in identifying the artefacts, which include the misericords from St Cuthbert\u2019s Church at Holme Lacy in Herefordshire, also in the care of The Churches Conservation Trust. </p>\n<p>In response to the original theft, The Churches Conservation Trust conducted a thorough audit of security at Holy Trinity, Torbryan and a new alarm system is now in place at the church to protect its contents in future. A new scheme of interpretation is also being developed to explain the artworks and the history of this unique Grade I listed church to visitors. A service at the church on 30th May will give thanks for the return of the panels.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rood-screen-panels-before-theft.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36697\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rood-screen-panels-before-theft-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rood-screen-panels-before-theft-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rood-screen-panels-before-theft-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rood-screen-panels-before-theft-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Rood screen panels before the theft\" width=\"150\"/></a>The 45 cm (17.7 inches) by 15 cm (6 inches) panels were stolen between August 2nd and 9th of 2013 when the church was open to the public. They are believed to have been pushed out of their casing from the front, but a panel of an unknown female saint to the immediately left of the stolen pieces was seriously damaged in the process. It was punched through and a large shard from the top of the panel to the saint\u2019s legs broke off. Now that the missing panels have been recovered, it\u2019s clear there was damage done to them as well during the theft. The restoration is expect to cost \u00a37,000 ($10,843) and the Churches Conservation Trust has launched a campaign to raise the funds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rood-screen-after.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26611\" height=\"116\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rood-screen-after-150x116.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rood-screen-after-150x116.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rood-screen-after-200x155.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rood-screen-after-430x335.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rood-screen-after.jpg 1506w\" title=\"Rood screen panels after the theft\" width=\"150\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/Torbryan/Donatenow/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to donate online</a>.

Researchers from the National Museum of Denmark and the University of Copenhagen studied the remains of her body, clothes and accessories using a combination of biomolecular, biochemical and geochemical techniques to determine not just where she was born and raised, but also to trace her movements in the years before her death and burial. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150521/srep10431/full/srep10431.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full study here</a>.</p>\n<p>The grave of Egtved Girl was excavated from the eastern side of the Storeh\u00f8j barrow in 1921. She had been put to rest in a hollowed out oak trunk lined with cow hide and grave goods placed inside with her. Next to her head was a box made of bark containing a bronze awl and a hair net. At her feet was a birch bucket with a brown residue composed of ingredients like bog cranberries, wheat and lime tree pollen that were used to make a kind of mead. She wore bronze arm rings on each arm, an earring in one ear and a bronze belt plate of impressive size. A horn comb was attached to her belt. Her clothing was a short woven tunic and a cord skirt 15 inches long wound twice around her waist. both made of wool.</p>\n<p>Although so many organic materials survived her long slumber, most of her own tissues decayed. Only her blonde hair, teeth, nails, and a small amount of skin and brain remained. Her bones probably dissolved in the acidic environment inside the coffin. A bundle of cloth was found to containing the cremated remains of a child 5-6 years old. A few charred bone fragments from the child were found in the bark box near her head. Egtved Girl was probably not her mother as her teeth indicate she was just 16-18 at the time of death. Dendrochronological analysis of the coffin dated the burial to 1,370 B.C.</p>\n<p>For so young a woman to have such a high status burial is very rare. She must have held an important position in society, possibly a priestess or a ritual dancer. You might think, therefore, that she was local. To pinpoint her origins, the multi-disciplinary study used strontium isotope analysis of her first molar. They also tested the strontium isotope signature of the occipital bone of the child buried with her. The results were statistically indistinguishable, so the girl and the child came from the same place. Comparison to the Danish baseline and the specific strontium isotope values of the Egtved burial site excluded Denmark as their likely place of origin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sampling-wool-thread-from-the-Egtved-Girls-blouse.-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-36688\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sampling-wool-thread-from-the-Egtved-Girls-blouse.-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sampling-wool-thread-from-the-Egtved-Girls-blouse.-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sampling-wool-thread-from-the-Egtved-Girls-blouse.-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sampling-wool-thread-from-the-Egtved-Girls-blouse.-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sampling wool thread from the Egtved Girl's blouse. Photo by Karin Margarita Frei.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Her clothes weren\u2019t local either. Strontium isotope analysis found only a single wool cord in the container with the child\u2019s cremated remains that was of Danish origin. The rest of the wool fibers tested, all of them very high quality, had varied strontium isotope values that indicate the sheep grazed in an area with a widely varied ecology. The possible range for the origin of Egtved Girl, the child she was buried with and her garments stretches from southern Scandinavia to southern Germany, but researchers believe she was from the Black Forest which has a variety of strontium isotope values commensurate with those in the wool fibers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIn Bronze Age Western Europe, Southern Germany and Denmark were the two dominant centres of power, very similar to kingdoms. We find many direct connections between the two in the archaeological evidence, and my guess is that the Egtved Girl was a Southern German girl who was given in marriage to a man in Jutland so as to forge an alliance between two powerful families,\u201d [University of Gothenburg professor] Kristian Kristiansen says.</p>\n<p>According to him, Denmark was rich in amber and traded amber for bronze. In Mycenaean Greece and in the Middle East, Baltic amber was as coveted as gold, and, through middlemen in Southern Germany, large quantities of amber were transported to the Mediterranean, and large quantities of bronze came to Denmark as payment. In the Bronze Age, bronze was as valuable a raw material as oil is today so Denmark became one of the richest areas of Northern Europe.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmber was the engine of Bronze Age economy, and in order to keep the trade routes going, powerful families would forge alliances by giving their daughters in marriage to each other and letting their sons be raised by each other as a kind of security,\u201d Kristian Kristiansen says.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Egtved-Girls-scalp-hair-remains-brain-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-36687\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Egtved-Girls-scalp-hair-remains-brain-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Egtved-Girls-scalp-hair-remains-brain-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Egtved-Girls-scalp-hair-remains-brain-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Egtved-Girls-scalp-hair-remains-brain-photo-by-Karin-Margarita-Frei-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Egtved Girl's hair, bark container, bone comb. Photo by Karin Margarita Frei.\" width=\"200\"/></a>To determine her travels in the two years before her death, the research team used her nine-inch-long hair. The strontium signature indicates she that 13-15 months before she died, she was somewhere with very similar strontium values to the place she was born. Then she moved probably to Jutland where she stayed for about 9 or ten months before going back home for four to six months. Her last trip was to Egtved about a month before her death. This is the first time researchers have been able to trace the movements of a prehistoric person with such precision.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our study provides evidence for long-distance and periodically rapid mobility. Our findings compel us to rethink European Bronze Age mobility as highly dynamic, where individuals moved quickly, over long distances in relatively brief periods of time.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Bronze Age Egtved Girl was not from Denmark\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36686\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/36686#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2015/05/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

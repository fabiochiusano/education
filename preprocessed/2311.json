One particular area of the cave is replete with finger painted lines in a variety of geometric shapes called finger fluting that were made by children. Researchers have identified the marks of four children between two and seven and four adults working in this chamber.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt suggests it was a special place for children. Adults were there, but the vast majority of artwork is by children,\u201d said Jess Cooney, a PhD student at [Cambridge University]\u2019s archaeology department.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s speculation, but I think in this particular chamber children were encouraged to make more art than adults. It could have been a playroom where the children gathered or a room for practice where they were encouraged to make these marks in order that they could grow into artists and make the beautiful paintings and engravings we find throughout the cave, and throughout France and Spain. Or it could have been a room used for a ritual for particular children, perhaps an initiation of sorts.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Most of the art in the cave is finger fluting. The animal figures it is most famous for are actual a small minority of the paintings. Artists, adult and child alike, would run their fingers over a soft red clay and then draw swirls and triangles on the cave wall. The size of the lines indicates the size of the fingers doing the painting. Designs high on the wall and on the ceiling indicate that the small children were being held up by adults, and the juxtaposition of different hands suggest a small adult, possibly an older brother, painting alongside a seven-year-old girl, and an adult guiding the fingers of a two-year-old. </p>\n<p>The most prolific artist throughout the entire cave complex is a five-year-old girl. The range of the paintings done by children indicates that the Stone Age dwellers of Rouffignac placed few restrictions on their children\u2019s movements. The were painting the walls even in the darkest, most distant caves. </p>\n<p>Some of the children\u2019s art goes beyond swirls and lines. There are finger fluted animals and what look like outlines of faces, but most notably there are hut shapes called tectiforms which are symbols native to one area of France. Those tectiforms are the first known example of Stone Age children creating symbolic figures.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" height=\"265\" id=\"FiveminPlayer\" width=\"430\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"/><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://embed.5min.com/517170167/&amp;sid=813/\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"/><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"265\" name=\"FiveminPlayer\" src=\"http://embed.5min.com/517170167/&amp;sid=813/\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"430\" wmode=\"opaque\"/></object></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Stone Age children finger painted on cave walls\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/13012\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/13012#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12994\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12994\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Conan Doyle\u2019s lost first novel published\">Conan Doyle\u2019s lost first novel published</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, September 29th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sir_arthur_conan_doyle-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-13002\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sir_arthur_conan_doyle--179x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sir_arthur_conan_doyle--179x300.jpg 179w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sir_arthur_conan_doyle--89x150.jpg 89w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sir_arthur_conan_doyle-.jpg 468w\" title=\"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" width=\"179\"/></a>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, back before he was a sir, was a physician struggling to build a private practice. He supplemented his meager income, as he had while a medical student at the University of Edinburgh, by writing short stories that were published in magazines. His first short story to make it into print, <a href=\"http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-mystery-of-sasassa-valley/\" target=\"blank\"><em>The Mystery of the Sasassa Valley</em></a>, was published in the Chambers\u2019s Edinburgh Journal in 1879. </p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t much money to be made selling stories to magazines, however, and the common practice at the time was to publish content anonymously. He would later note in <a href=\"http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/my1doyle.htm\" target=\"blank\">an 1893 article in The Idler magazine</a> that over his years of writing short stories, he earned an average of less than 50 pounds a year from his work and he was still a complete unknown. Conan Doyle realized that if he wanted to make a name for himself as an author, he would have to write a novel. Sometime between 1883 and 1884, he did so and mailed the manuscript to a publisher. Then disaster struck.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alack and alas for the dreadful thing that happened!  The publishers never received it, the post office sent countless blue forms to say that they knew nothing about it, and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of it.  Of course it was the best thing I ever wrote.  Who ever lost a manuscript that wasn\u2019t?  But I must in all honesty confess that my shock at its disappearance would be as nothing to my horror if it were suddenly to appear again\u2014in print.  If one or two other of my earlier efforts had also been lost in the post my conscience would have been the lighter.  This one was called \u201cThe Narrative of John Smith,\u201d and it was of a personal-social-political complexion.  Had it appeared I should have probably awakened to find myself infamous, for it steered, as I remember it, perilously near to the libellous.  However, it was safely lost, and that was the end of another of my first books.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrativejohnsmithmanuscript-e1317350712638.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-13001\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrativejohnsmithmanuscript-e1317350712638-183x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrativejohnsmithmanuscript-e1317350712638-183x300.jpg 183w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrativejohnsmithmanuscript-e1317350712638-91x150.jpg 91w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrativejohnsmithmanuscript-e1317350712638.jpg 520w\" title='First page of \"The Narrative of John Smith\" manuscript' width=\"183\"/></a>Psych, Conan Doyle! You only <em>thought</em> it was safely lost! Really, though, he pysched himself out because the original manuscript never did turn up; he just rewrote the whole thing from memory but only told his mother so nobody realized it. He made no reference to it in his 1924 autobiography and subsequent biographers assumed that the first novel was lost for good. It wasn\u2019t until 1970 when Arthur\u2019s youngest son Adrian Conan Doyle died and his wife had an expert examine the huge collection of Conan Doyle\u2019s papers Adrian had left her that a group of four notebooks containing an unpublished, untitled novel were noticed. </p>\n<p>The notebooks still weren\u2019t identified as The Narrative of John Smith at that point. They remained in the Conan Doyle archive and no scholars paid them any mind. The title was only associated with the rewritten manuscript in 2004, when the heirs of Anna Conan Doyle, Adrian\u2019s wife, decided to sell the collection of Conan Doyle papers at a Christie\u2019s auction. The Christie\u2019s experts identified the four notebooks in <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/conan-doyles-first-novel/4290253/lot/lot_details.aspx?from=salesummary&amp;intObjectID=4290253&amp;sid=71422040-8018-4199-a454-0dbd017923cf\" target=\"blank\">Lot 11</a> as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s lost first novel, <em>The Narrative of John Smith</em>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The narrator ranges widely over the fields of history, religion, philosophy, medicine, science, music and prophecy; he advances views on domestic interiors, art, the future of China, the United States and Great Britain and he draws on his experiences from sealing in the Arctic, to ballooning and to travel in South Africa. He also refers to literature citing the stories of Bret Harte and Turgenev\u2019s Fathers and Sons.</p>\n<p>It is evident that Conan Doyle began to revise the text of the first volume (changing the name of the doctor from Julep to Turner, for instance, and making other alterations). Mrs Rundle was a precursor of Sherlock Holmes\u2019s housekeeper Martha Hudson. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/cgi-bin/press.cgi?story=1429\" target=\"blank\">British Library bought the manuscript</a> for \u00a347,800 ($84,749) to add to their already extensive Conan Doyle collection. Sir Arthur\u2019s daughter, Dame Jean Conan Doyle, had left 900 documents to the library in her will. In addition to the notebooks, the British Library purchased 1,200 other Conan Doyle documents from the Anna Conan Doyle auction. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrative.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-13005\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrative-188x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrative-188x300.jpg 188w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrative-94x150.jpg 94w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrative-643x1024.jpg 643w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/narrative.jpg 681w\" title='\"The Narrative of John Smith\" cover' width=\"125\"/></a>Until now, few people had had the opportunity to see the dawn of Conan Doyle as a novelist.

It is also remarkably prescient, foreseeing the rise of America and China as superpowers, the advent of aeroplanes and submarines, and even space exploration. Stephen Fry, who has also seen the book, hailed Conan Doyle\u2019s breadth of interests. \u201cHe was the first popular writer to tell the wider reading public about narcotics, the Ku Klux Klan, the mafia, the Mormons, American crime gangs, corrupt union bosses and much else besides. His boundless energy, enthusiasm and wide-ranging mind, not to mention the perfect, muscular and memorable prose, are all on display here in a work whose publication is very, very welcome indeed.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can purchase a copy now from the <a href=\"http://shop.bl.uk/mall/productpage.cfm/BritishLibrary/ISBN_9780712358415\" target=\"blank\">British Library bookshop</a> or pre-order it on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Smith-Arthur-Conan-Doyle/dp/0712358412/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317337664&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"blank\">Amazon US</a> (the scheduled publication date is October 15).

It had been loaded in Calcutta with an immense load of commodities \u2014  2,600 tons of pig iron, 1,765 tons of tea, 220 tons of silver ingots \u2014 headed for Liverpool.  A merchant vessel built in 1919 for the British India Steam Navigation company, the <em>Gairsoppa</em> was unable to withstand the attack. That one torpedo blasted a hole in the hull and took down the foremast, severing all the radio cables and leaving the ship unable to communicate a distress call. The ship sank in just 20 minutes, taking its valuable cargo with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Gairsoppa-toilet-water-closet.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-12982\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Gairsoppa-toilet-water-closet-300x225.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Gairsoppa-toilet-water-closet-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Gairsoppa-toilet-water-closet-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Gairsoppa-toilet-water-closet-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" title=\"One of Gairsoppa's water closets with an intact toilet \" width=\"200\"/></a>The 85-member crew sadly did not survive. Many of them made it to the lifeboats even under German machine gun fire, but then two of the three lifeboats capsized in the rough waters. The final lifeboat made it to the Cornwall shore 13 days later, but it too capsized while drifting along the coast and only one survivor was fished out: Second Officer R.H. Ayres, who received many awards for his bravery in trying to save his fellow passengers. (He lived a long life and passed away in 1992.)</p>\n<p>In 1989, the British government attempted a salvage operation to recover the precious metals that sank on the <em>Gairsoppa</em>.

Four of them are part of the original seven scrolls discovered by a Bedouin shepherd in a cave at Qumran, just above the Dead Sea, in 1947. One of them, the Temple Scroll, was discovered in a cave less than a mile away in 1956. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Isaiah-scroll.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-12963\" height=\"127\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Isaiah-scroll-300x190.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Isaiah-scroll-300x190.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Isaiah-scroll-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Isaiah-scroll-1024x649.jpg 1024w\" title='Israel Museum staffer points to \"Jerusalem\" written in the Great Isaiah Scroll' width=\"200\"/></a>The <a href=\"http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah\" target=\"blank\">Great Isaiah Scroll</a>, the <a href=\"http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/temple?id=0\" target=\"blank\">Temple Scroll</a>, the <a href=\"http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/war\" target=\"blank\">War Scroll</a>, the <a href=\"http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/community\" target=\"blank\">Community Rule Scroll</a> and the <a href=\"http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/habakkuk\" target=\"blank\">Commentary on the Habakkuk Scroll</a>, five of the most complete and important scrolls discovered in caves on the banks of the Dead Sea, are kept in a highly secured vault by <a href=\"http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/home.aspx\" target=\"blank\">the Israel Museum, Jerusalem</a>. The isolation is necessary to protect the 2,000-year-old documents from any further deterioration, but it also means anyone who would like to peruse these invaluable Biblical manuscripts would have to jump through nearly impossible hoops. </p>\n<p>Not any more. Photographer Ardon Bar-Hama has taken high resolution pictures up to 1,200 megapixels and Google technology has created a database that allows anyone with an Internet connection to get so close to the scrolls that you can see the most minute details of ink and parchment. Each scroll is introduced with more about its contents and history, both written and in short explanatory videos. The <a href=\"http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/\" target=\"blank\">Dead Sea Scrolls Online</a> site lets users click on the Hebrew text to get an English translation, and you can join the site via Google Connect to suggest translations in other languages or just to leave comments.

This project will go several steps beyond high resolution photography. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The MegaVision system will enable the digital imaging of every Scroll fragment in various wavelengths in the highest resolution possible and allow long term monitoring for preservation purposes in a non-invasive and precise manner. The images will be equal in quality to the actual physical viewing of the Scrolls, thus eliminating the need for re-exposure of the Scrolls and allowing their preservation for future generations. The technology will also help rediscover writing and letters that have \u201cvanished\u201d over the years; with the help of infra-red light and wavelengths beyond, these writings will be brought \u201cback to life\u201d, facilitating new possibilities in Dead Sea Scrolls research.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This project is scheduled to be complete by 2016. By then, the Israel Museum\u2019s digitization should also be complete, so if all goes well, the entirety of the Dead Sea Scrolls will be online and available to us all within five years. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"First five Dead Sea Scrolls go online\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12958\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12958#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12950\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12950\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Witches and hookers and saints, oh my!\">Witches and hookers and saints, oh my!</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, September 26th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nailed-woman.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12952\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nailed-woman-109x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nailed-woman-109x300.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nailed-woman-54x150.jpg 54w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nailed-woman.jpg 306w\" title=\"13th century skeleton with nails marked by yellow triangles\" width=\"109\"/></a>An archaeological team excavating the Tuscan port town of Piombino hoping to find the remains of its patron saint has instead <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.corriere.it%2Fcronache%2F11_settembre_22%2Ftomba-strega_b6936be2-e545-11e0-ac8f-9ecb3bbcc6bf.shtml\" target=\"blank\">uncovered the skeletal remains</a> of two 13th century women of questionable repute. Approximately 25-30 years old at time of death, they were both buried in the bare earth, without a coffin or even a shroud, very much against custom. </p>\n<p>One of women had seven curved, one-and-a-half-inch-long nails placed in her mouth after death and 13 more nails jammed into the ground all around her body. Archaeologists speculate that the ones around her body were used to nail the body to the ground in some kind of exorcism ritual to prevent her using witchcraft to rise from the dead. </p>\n<p>The other woman was buried with a leather pouch holding 17 bone dice. Games of chance were against civil and ecclesiastic law during the Middle Ages, and although the laws were constantly flouted, a women associated with dice was a woman associated with immorality. Also, 17 was and remains an extremely unlucky number in Italy. (The story I\u2019ve heard about why it\u2019s unlucky is that the Roman number for 17, XVII, is an anagram of \u201cvixi\u201d which is Latin for \u201cI have lived\u201d which is just like saying you\u2019re dead and is therefore an ill omen.

Not only are they strangely bare and contain those odd accouterments, but they are also in consecrated ground. There\u2019s a chapel on the grounds purportedly marking the burial spot of Saint Cerbonius, the sixth century A.D. bishop and patron saint of Piombino. The team was looking for the saint\u2019s burial and for the remains of a medieval cathedral that was once dedicated to him when they found the ladies. If the women were social outcasts, one of them demonic, the other degenerate, neither of them worthy of a decent burial, how come they got to go to their eternal rest in a cathedral cemetery next to a saint? </p>\n<p>Forgione speculates that they may have had the advantage of powerful friends and families surviving them who arranged for them to have at least a chance at heaven by ensuring their bodies were placed in consecrated ground. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Piombino-cemetery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12955\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Piombino-cemetery-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Piombino-cemetery-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Piombino-cemetery-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Piombino-cemetery.jpg 634w\" title=\"Burials around Piombino chapel\" width=\"200\"/></a>The excavation will continue through the end of the month. They have already found 350 burials in four eight-by-ten meter (26 by 33 feet) sites on each side of the chapel, and there are strong indications that the cemetery goes on for another 65 feet inland and another 33 feet or so towards the sea. Such a large, well-populated cemetery indicates that little Piombino, the only known Etruscan port city, remained a thriving town through the Middle Ages. </p>\n<p>Archaeologists are working against the clock, though. The cliff side is eroding faster than they can dig.

Also, if these were professional thieves, they made a poor choice. The necklace is insured for $19,000, and could easily go for even more at auction, but that\u2019s almost entirely historical value, and it\u2019s almost impossible to sell a well-known historical piece without someone noticing.

This necklace was not among her most valuable pieces. It was recovered from the wreckage after <em>Titanic</em> went down. Legend has it it was found stuffed in the pocket of a butler when his body was recovered from the water. Mrs. Widener was traveling with a valet of her husband\u2019s, so it\u2019s certainly plausible that he could have grabbed something shiny before he made a break for it. </p>\n<p>Eleanor boarded <em>Titanic</em> at Cherbourg with her husband, Philadelphia streetcar magnate George Dunton Widener, her son, Harvard graduate and avid book collector Harry Elkins Widener, her maid Amalie Gieger and her husband\u2019s manservant Edwin Keeping. On the evening of April 14, they threw a private dinner for Captain Edward J. Smith and other distinguished first class types. The Captain left the table at 9:00 PM. The ship struck its fateful iceberg at 11:40 PM.</p>\n<p>When the calamity became clear, George Widener pressed his wife and her maid into lifeboat number four (also carrying Mrs. Astor). She at first had refused to leave his side, but he insisted. As the lifeboat pushed off into the night, Eleanor watched her beloved George and Harry go down with the unsinkable ship.</p>\n<p>Three years after the <em>Titanic</em> tragedy, Eleanor Widener donated $3.5 million to Harvard to build a library in her son\u2019s name. The Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library opened in 1915. She donated Harry\u2019s collection of 3,300 rare books, and more were donated by her other children, Harry\u2019s brother and sister, in 1944.

In places, its roof was up to 15 metres [50 feet] high, or more than three times the height of a double-decker bus. Large brick-faced concrete piers or pillars, some three metres wide and still visible in part, supported at least eight parallel bays with wooden roofs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis was a vast structure which could easily have housed wood, canvas and other supplies and certainly would have been large enough to build or shelter ships in. The scale, position and unique nature of the building lead us to believe it played a key role in shipbuilding activities,\u201d comments Southampton\u2019s Professor Keay, who also leads the archaeological activity of the BSR.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/shipyard2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-12908\" height=\"168\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/shipyard2-300x168.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/shipyard2-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/shipyard2-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/shipyard2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Computer model of shipyard facade\" width=\"300\"/></a>They\u2019ve found a wide vaulted area that formed the western wall of the complex and the western-most bay. Estimates based on this one bay suggest they were 12 meters (40 feet) wide and 58 meters (190 feet) long. The piers on the northern end facing the Claudian basin were 6 x 5 feet, while the ones on the southern end on the Trajanic basin were larger at 10 x 5.5 feet, so archaeologists think that the primary entrance point was a massive arch on southern side, with a smaller but still notable entrance on the north. </p>\n<p>Epigraphic evidence supports the existence of a major shipyard in Portus. Inscriptions found at the site mention that the guild of shipbuilders (the corpus fabrum navalium portensium) had a presence in the port. There\u2019s artistic evidence that Roman\u2019s had shipyards like this. A mosaic found in a villa just outside the ancient city of Rome shows the facade of a large building with a ship nestled in each arched bay.</p>\n<p>One key piece of evidence still missing is the remains of any of the ramps that would have been necessary to launch newly built ships from dry dock into the harbor. Professor Keay thinks they may be hidden beneath the concrete embankment built in the early 20th century.

It was in Britain that he decided to prove his commander-in-chief chops by sending governor Quintus Lollius Urbicus north of Hadrian\u2019s Wall into southern Scotland. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hadrians_Wall_map.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12898\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hadrians_Wall_map-120x150.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hadrians_Wall_map-120x150.png 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hadrians_Wall_map-241x300.png 241w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hadrians_Wall_map.png 800w\" title=\"Map of the Hadrian and Antonine walls\" width=\"120\"/></a>Around 142 A.D. Antonius ordered that a wall be built marking the new northern border of Britannia. Urbicus deployed troops from the II Augusta, VI Victrix and XX Valeria Victrix legions to build the wall, starting with a foundation of stone topped with a turf rampart that was as high as 13 feet in places. The height of the wall was supplemented by a deep and wide ditch on the north side for added protection against the Caledonian hoards. It took 12 years to build and ended up stretching 39 miles across Scotland coast to coast from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde. </p>\n<p>For reasons not entirely clear to this day, the Romans abandoned the Antonine Wall just eight years after its completion in 162 A.D. Since the turf wall didn\u2019t last as well as Hadrian\u2019s stone one, what we have left in place today are the defense ditches, remains of the stone foundations of the wall and of the 20 plus forts and fortlets that guarded its length. Excavations have also unearthed a wealth of artifacts, including some that put Hadrian\u2019s fancy pants wall to shame.</p>\n<p>The University of Glasgow\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/collections/permanentdisplays/theantoninewall/\" target=\"blank\">The Hunterian Museum</a> in Glasgow has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/sep/19/antonine-wall-gaps-roman-occupation\" target=\"blank\">just opened a new permanent gallery</a> dedicated to the sculptures and artifacts found over three centuries of research, excavation and study of the Antonine Wall.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Through The Hunterian\u2019s rich collections the gallery investigates four key themes: The building of the Wall \u2013 its architecture and impact on the landscape; the role of the Roman army on the frontier \u2013 the life and lifestyle of its soldiers; the cultural interaction between Roman and indigenous peoples, and evidence for local resistance; and the abandonment of the Wall and the story of its rediscovery over the last 350 years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Among on the artifacts on display are 16 of the 19 surviving distance slabs, marble slabs elaborately carved by the legions to mark their work on the wall.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The sculptures are, in general, more elaborate and richly decorated than their counterparts on Hadrian\u2019s wall, featuring such scenes as Victory placing a laurel wreath on a Roman legionary standard, and the distinctive mascots of the soldiers\u2019 legions: a running boar for the XX; a Pegasus and a Capricorn (after the Emperor Augustus\u2019s star sign) for the VI.</p>\n<p>The sculptures also clearly project the move north as a splendid military victory: several depict Caledonians being trampled by Roman cavalry, or simply crouching in submission, bound and naked.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The gallery emphasizes that life along the wall was not the stark existence you might expect from the northernmost border of the Roman Empire. The remains of bathhouses have been found along the wall, and the number of valuable consumer goods like red Samianware dishes and glass found suggest that some people in the area lived very well indeed.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-XX-legion.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12897\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-XX-legion-e1316659031425-150x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-XX-legion-e1316659031425-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-XX-legion-e1316659031425-300x239.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-XX-legion-e1316659031425-1024x817.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-XX-legion-e1316659031425.jpg 1560w\" title=\"Distance slab of the XX Valeria Victrix legion\" width=\"130\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-VI-legion.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12895\" height=\"83\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-VI-legion-e1316659215480-150x95.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-VI-legion-e1316659215480-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-VI-legion-e1316659215480-300x191.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-VI-legion-e1316659215480-1024x652.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Distance slab of the VI Victrix legion\" width=\"130\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-II-legion.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12896\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-II-legion-e1316659337783-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-II-legion-e1316659337783-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-II-legion-e1316659337783-300x209.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/distance-slab-of-the-II-legion-e1316659337783-1024x714.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Distance slab of the II Augusta legion\" width=\"130\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"The Antonine Wall gets its own gallery\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12889\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12889#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2011/09/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

The size of the lines indicates the size of the fingers doing the painting.

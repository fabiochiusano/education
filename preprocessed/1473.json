This advising role was cleared with AOL and TechCrunch's editors and has concluded. Constine's fianc\\u00e9e Andee Gardiner co-founded startup accelerator Founders Embassy. Constine's cousin Darren Lachtman is the founder of influencer advertising startup Niche that was acquired by Twitter, and he's since left and founded teen content studio Brat. Constine does not write about Founders Embassy or Brat. Constine has personal acquaintances stemming from college housing circa 2007 with founders at Skybox Imaging (now Terra Bella), Hustle, Snapchat, and Robinhood, but does not maintain close social ties with them nor does that influence his writing. Constine occasionally does paid speaking engagements at conferences, but only those funded by companies he does not cover. Constine owns a small position in Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, does not day-trade, and discloses his positions directly in articles where appropriate. Constine does not do consulting, angel investing, or public stock trading beyond public stock invesments by his parents' estate that he has no role in managing or advising.]<\\/p>\",\"cbAvatar\":\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\\/image\\/upload\\/v1415412437\\/xje35licfau9iewxnf44.png\",\"twitter\":\"joshconstine\",\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\\/1603003\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\"}]}}],\"author\":[{\"id\":5188242,\"name\":\"Greg Kumparak\",\"url\":\"\",\"description\":\"\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/author\\/greg-kumparak\\/\",\"slug\":\"greg-kumparak\",\"avatar_urls\":{\"24\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9b107c9f9a43a21d8c93fcdefcc97dcd?s=24&d=identicon&r=g\",\"48\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9b107c9f9a43a21d8c93fcdefcc97dcd?s=48&d=identicon&r=g\",\"96\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9b107c9f9a43a21d8c93fcdefcc97dcd?s=96&d=identicon&r=g\"},\"links\":{\"homepage\":\"http:\\/\\/www.kumparak.com\",\"twitter\":\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/grg\",\"crunchbase\":\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/person\\/greg-kumparak\"},\"position\":\"Editor\",\"cbDescription\":\"<p>Greg Kumparak is an editor at TechCrunch.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Greg started at TechCrunch in May of 2008.

Over 85 startups pitched on stage yesterday , and another huge batch launched today. Previously held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, this YC Demo Day instead took over a massive warehouse in San Francisco. Like yesterday\u2019s pitches, today\u2019s were split across two stages (\u201cPioneer\u201d and \u201cMission\u201d) running in parallel \u2014 so even if you were there, you couldn\u2019t see everything alone. We picked our top 10 startups from Day 1 to make it easier to keep up. You can check out our 9 favorite startups from Day 2 here . Here are all of the companies that launched today, and our notes from their presentations. YSplit : Splitting utility bills and other recurring payments with roommates or loved ones is a huge pain where one person has to front the money and then nag the others to get paid back. YSplit offers virtual debit cards that make it easy to automatically split bills and collect cash from users\u2019 bank accounts. By charging a 2 percent interchange fee to merchants, YSplit could build a solid business from the 26 million shared homes in the US alone. The Juggernaut : A subscription publication focusing on South Asian stories. They hire freelance writers, publish one story per day, and charge users $5 a month. We wrote about The Juggernaut here. \u00a0 Searchlight : Reference checks can screen out bad hires, yet many businesses wait until the very end of the interview cycle or don\u2019t do extensive checks. Searchlight offers reference checks as a service. Job candidates invite their references to submit testimonials, which Searchlight collects and organizes into reports about someone\u2019s work style, ideal environment, and skillset. Searchlight earns an average of $250 per job hopes to investigate all 30 million skilled hires in the US per year.

Next it wants to move into modernizing the process of booking spaces on campus as well as instructor and tuition payments. \u00a0 AI Insurance : Cloud-based software for insurance claims. By moving things to the cloud rather than filing cabinets, the founders say they can save \u201cthousands of hours per claim\u201d. Their goal, once they\u2019ve got enough claim data, is to use AI to determine things like how much a claim might ultimately cost. \u00a0 Nebullam : Growing crops indoors can produce more food per acre that\u2019s not dependent on weather, but the problems are the high labor costs and payback times for expensive equipment. Nebullam wants to be the John Deere of indoor farming. It sells a vertical farming cube and other equipment that can maximize yield and minimize costs. With a CEO who grew up on a farm, it\u2019s already managed a 3 year payback time for its equipment vs an industry standard for 7 years. Pronto : Ride-sharing for smaller cities in Latin America.

Currently doing 62,000 trips per month. \u00a0 LEAH Labs : People spend $500 million per year on chemotherapy for their dogs, even though the treatment only extends their life temporarily without curing their disease. LEAH Labs wants to cure B-cell lymphoma cancer in dogs using Car T cells, a powerful new treatment method. There have been $20 billion in recent Car T cell company exits, but none of the big players are focused on dogs. LEAH Labs falls under the USDA instead of the FDA, so it requires less investment to get approved, which translate into $5,000 treatments. \u00a0 Balto : A platform for fantasy sports league managers to make money from their work. As fantasy sports betting moves toward legality in more states, they want to capture the audience already making bets through other means. \u00a0 Visly : Developers waste a ton of time rebuilding the same product for iOS, Android, and web and Visly says only 15 percent of developers use tools to simplify this.

It\u2019s been growing 50 percent week over week ( Correction: we previously wrote \u201cmonth over month\u201d; YC tells us that growth was week over week) thanks to deals with large property management companies that offer the marketplace as a perk to their residents.

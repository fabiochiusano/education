He quickly climbed back down and fled, leaving behind unused bottles of paint thinner, a backpack, disposable lighters and the ladder. Firefighters were on the scene promptly, but there was some confusion about whether the fire was still burning and the Cultural Heritage Administration had warned the crews to proceed with caution so as not to damage the ancient structure. When the conflagration blew up again, it was too large to put out immediately. By the end of the five hour battle to put out the blaze, the gate had collapsed and was a smoldering pile of wreckage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25010\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire-430x305.jpg 430w\" title=\"Firefighters attempt to douse the flames at the Namdaemun\" width=\"150\"/></a>A <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/12/world/main3820290.shtml?source=search_story\" target=\"_blank\">suspect was apprehended the next day</a>. A search of his home found a can of paint thinner and leather gloves used in the arson and he confessed immediately, pleading the public\u2019s forgiveness. Apparently he destroyed this ancient and beautiful monument because he was mad at the government for ignoring a petition he filed complaining that property developers had not paid him proper compensation for land that had been expropriated to build an apartment complex. A four page screed on the topic was also found at his home by police. </p>\n<p>He was 69 when he committed this crime, hardly an impetuous youth, and it wasn\u2019t the first he set fire to a historical monument. He was convicted in April of 2006 for setting a fire that burned down part of UNESCO World Heritage site Changgyeong Palace in Seoul. In an example of justice gone very wrong indeed, he was given a suspended 18-month jail sentence and a fine of a few thousand dollars. He was convicted of the arson of Namdaemun in October of 2008.

Seoul has lost a great many of its historic monuments to modernization, occupation and war. This ancient gate, one of four built along the walls protecting Seoul just six years after the city became the capital of the then-new Joseon Dynasty (1392 -1910), was the oldest wooden structure in the city. It was given the formal designation of National Treasure Number One in 1962 during a previous restoration to repair damage from the Korean War (1950-1953) and the Japanese Occupation (1910-1945). It was only opened to the public for the first time since the occupation in 2006.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25017\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906-430x295.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906.jpg 1065w\" title=\"Namdaemun in 1906\" width=\"150\"/></a>As horrific as the devastation was, there was still a fair amount of recoverable material from the site, enough to support a restoration. Authorities thankfully had made detailed architectural plans 182 pages long of the gate before opening it to the public in 2006, so restorers had accurate measurements and construction details to go on. However, given the opportunity to start from scratch, the government decided to restore the gate to its original form, rebuilding walls destroyed by the Japanese during the occupation and <a href=\"http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2899170\" target=\"_blank\">using only traditional construction methods</a>. Instead of the modern paint and tiles employed during the restoration of the 1960s, this restoration would use only hand-made roof tiles fired in traditional kilns and natural paints, which had to be imported from Japan because there are no traditional paint manufacturers left in Korea, for the <em>dancheong</em>, the gloriously colorful decorative painting. Carpenters and stonemasons would use no power tools. It was hammers and chisels all the way.</p>\n<p>Before the first hammer could strike, historians spent two years researching how the gate had looked originally. Surviving workers from the 1961 restoration were consulted for their memories of what had been changed. Craftsmen worked painstakingly to salvage every last part of the burned structure. Bent nails were heated and straightened one at a time at a rate of 50 to 70 a day. One team identified and tagged each piece of burned wood using radio frequency identification to find whatever could be reused and to collect more information about how they had once been put together. They recovered an incredible total of more than 60,000 original wooden pieces to reuse during the restoration. The 68 stone animals on the roof were pieced back together from fragments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-before-fire.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25016\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-before-fire-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-before-fire-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-before-fire-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-before-fire-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Namdaemun in 2006 when newly opened to the public\" width=\"150\"/></a>What could not be reused was recreated using materials as close to the original as possible. Pine wood from old growth trees, very rare in Korea today, was located so there would be time to fell the trees and cure them properly before using them. People flocked to donate pines from their property, so many that experts had their pick of the most noble pines left in the country. They ultimately chose 167 trees from 12 locations, including 20 trees from the Jungyeong Tomb in the city of Samcheok, the source of the pines used by the royal family during the Joseon Period. The total weight tally for the project was 26 tons of pinewood.</p>\n<p>The roof tiles were almost obliterated by the fire, but 95% of them were factory-made versions installed during the 1961 restoration. All 23,369 of the new clay roof tiles were produced using traditional methods which result in a lighter weight, unique tile. This was no mean feat. According to traditional tile maker Han Hyung-joon of Jaewajang, who bears the outstanding title of Intangible Cultural Asset No. 91, there are only three kilns left in South Korea that produce traditional tiles. Making thousands and then shipping them to Seoul was tricky because the tiles can easily be cracked by temperature changes and damaged during transportation. </p>\n<p>Master carpenter Shin Eung-soo (71) led the project, overseeing a team of 1,000 top woodworkers, stonemasons, blacksmiths and other craftsmen who had to work as their ancestors had. Even <a href=\"http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/culturesports/2013/04/29/58/0701000000AEN20130429006600315F.HTML\" target=\"_blank\">the tools themselves required research to find</a>. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Lee Eui-sang, a 72-year-old mason who participated in the project, said the government\u2019s plan to restore Sungnyemun in a traditional way perplexed him at first.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do because all the tools used by the nation\u2019s traditional masons disappeared in the middle of 1970s,\u201d he said.

It took five years and $24.4 million, which really is impressively close to the estimate considering the kind of detailed handcrafting that went into recreating the gate in all its glory.</p>\n<p>On Saturday the gate will be reopened with a traditional <em>cheondo</em> ceremony to eliminate all bad luck and with a performance of traditional folk Korean folk song <em>Arirang</em>. The signboard on the front of the gate, repaired from surviving pieces of the old tablet with some new patching and now covered by a tarp, will be unveiled. Given the revival of traditional customs that this restoration has engendered, it\u2019s eminently fitting that the reopening should feature the same ceremonies traditionally used to inaugurate new homes.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Seoul\u2019s 14th c.

This is a big turn-around from four months ago when the ancient remains were slated to be moved far out of the way to make station construction easier.</p>\n<p>In January, the Central Archaeological Council acceded to demands from the Attiko Metro company and decreed that the antiquities unearthed at the site of the future Venizelos subway station would be removed in their entirety to the Pavlos Melas camp in western Thessaloniki. Attiko Metro said it was not technically feasible to conserve the remains properly and build the station around them, and the General Director of Public Works supported them, as did the Deputy Minister of Education, Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports. The subway line is already four years behind schedule thanks to the excavation and the implosion of Greece\u2019s finances; the government feared further delays might endanger the entire project. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-ancient-ruins-at-subway-stop-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-25003\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-ancient-ruins-at-subway-stop-2-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-ancient-ruins-at-subway-stop-2-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-ancient-ruins-at-subway-stop-2-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-ancient-ruins-at-subway-stop-2-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-ancient-ruins-at-subway-stop-2.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Workers excavate ancient ruins at Thessaloniki subway stop\" width=\"150\"/></a>Archaeological organizations responded to the ministerial decree with swift and public outrage. Polyxeni Veleni, the Director of the 16th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, described it poetically: \u201cIt is our Parthenon. Would you like to see Parthenon on Mount Taygetus?\u201d (That\u2019s a mountain on the south Peloponnese between Sparta and Kalamata, about 100 miles southwest of Athens.) The municipal leaders of Thessaloniki agreed. The city already lost much of its ancient history to hasty development after World War II, and thus the second most important city in the Byzantine Empire after Constantinople has little of its illustrious past to show for it. </p>\n<p>This discovery is a window into that history, and it\u2019s not the kind of find that can be dug up and shipped to a museum. It\u2019s like a core sample of the city, a large section that preserves 83 yards of the 3rd century A.D. Roman marble-paved main street built over the Greek one from 300 B.C. that passed through the center of the city, the remains of buildings, columns, foundations from the 6th through the 9th centuries A.D., a monumental Roman-era gate and pieces of large public buildings from the 7th century that are rare finds anywhere in the Byzantine world. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-decumanus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25002\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-decumanus-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-decumanus-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-decumanus-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-decumanus-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Thessaloniki-decumanus.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Roman decumanus under Thessaloniki's modern main road, ca. 200 A.D.\" width=\"150\"/></a>This was the heart of the city, the crossroads that the main public buildings, smaller retail structures and the public market clustered around for centuries. The daily life of Thessalonians is literally inscribed into the stone. The marble slabs of the road are marked by wheel ruts from years of cart travel and some of them have children\u2019s board games etched into the surface, a kind of permanent hopscotch pitch. </p>\n<p>The headlines are calling it Thessaloniki\u2019s Pompeii because apparently any extensive ruin of an ancient city is a Pompeii now, but what\u2019s great about this discovery is not that it\u2019s frozen in time, but rather an illustration of many phases the city went through from ancient Greece, to Roman rule to Byzantine and up to the present considering that the modern Egnatia street up top follows the path of the Roman decumanus below.

It was an international sensation. </p>\n<p>While still on board the Ni\u00f1a as it approached the Iberian peninsula in mid-February, Columbus wrote the letter to Ferdinand and Isabella reporting his findings. Either when he landed in Lisbon on March 4th or the harbour of Palos on March 15, 1493, Columbus sent the letter to the king and queen and a copy to Luis de Santangel, Ferdinand II\u2019s finance minister who had raised all the money for the voyage and convinced their majesties to approve of Columbus\u2019 plan. He may also have sent a third to Gabriel Sanchez, Treasurer of Aragon; there\u2019s a fair amount of confusion about the recipients and the sources of the copies.</p>\n<p>Although there is some evidence that the King and Queen weren\u2019t keen to have the letter get out \u2014 no copies of their majesties\u2019 letter were ever published \u2014 by early April, a printed copy the Santangel letter was published in Spain. In May, a Latin translation was circulating in Rome, and the Latin version spread to cities all over Europe within weeks. It had already been set to Italian verse by June, 1493. You can read <a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NPXCTYxu-R4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA10\" target=\"_blank\">an English translation here</a>.</p>\n<p>Pope Alexander VI certainly saw the Latin version of the letter in Rome, and in any case by then he was fully versed in the discovery because he had to arbitrate between Portugal and Spain on the question of who got to claim the New World. Portugal asserted that the new territories belonged to the Portuguese crown, despite the fact that Spanish ships had made the discovery, because previous papal bulls had granted Portugal extremely broad rights to any dominions populated by non-Christians. <a href=\"http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/indig-romanus-pontifex.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Romanus Pontifex</em></a>, for example, issued in 1455 by Pope Nicholas V, stipulated that the King Alfonso and his heirs had exclusive dominion over all lands and seas \u201cthough situated in the remotest parts unknown to us, and subject them to their own temporal dominion\u201d and that no other power, ecclesiastical or temporal, may interfere with this great Christianizing conquest in any way.</p>\n<p>Ferdinand and Isabella accepted the previous bulls, but asked Pope Alexander VI to review the question. The pope was Valencian now, so they figured, correctly as it happened, that they might just pull a rabbit out of a hat, or rather a rich new colony out of a mitre. Diplomatic negotiations between Portugal and Spain began in April. Meanwhile, the Pope got to work busily on crafting a new bull. <a href=\"http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/indig-inter-caetera.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Inter Caetera</em></a> was issued on May 4, 1493, superseding three edicts issued that same day and the day before. <a href=\"http://www.reformation.org/dudum-siquidem.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dudum Siquidem</em></a>, which resolved some of the issues <em>Inter Caetera</em> had left open, was issued September 26th, 1493. </p>\n<p>All of this was going down while Pinturicchio and his assistants lavishly frescoed the Pope\u2019s apartment. <em>Resurrection</em> was painted on the wall of the Hall of Mysteries, one of three rooms in the apartment that were Alexander VI\u2019s personal living space. The pope himself is portrayed prominently in the painting, on his knees, hands joined in prayer, before Christ\u2019s resurrected golden glory. Considering how the Pope spent a great deal of 1493 dealing with the ramifications of Columbus\u2019 discovery, and how all these political issues were framed in terms of who should get to convert the newly-found pagans to Christianity, it makes sense that they would make a cameo in this fresco.</p>\n<p>After Alexander VI\u2019s death in 1503, the apartment was closed by his successor Pope Pius III. Neither he nor anyone else for a few centuries wanted to be associated with the scandalous Borgia papacy, so the rooms with their gorgeous frescoes were sealed off for almost 400 years. Pope Leo XII finally opened them in 1889. Their years of disuse had kept the rooms in good condition and kept subsequent popes with bad taste from messing with the frescoes. The rooms are now part of the Vatican Library. Since 1973, they\u2019ve housed the Vatican Collection of Modern Religious Art, a collection of more than 600 donated works by the likes of Chagall, Kandinsky and Gaugin.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"First images of Native Americans in Vatican fresco?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24975\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24975#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-24949\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24949\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Pinault to return bronze rat, rabbit heads to China\">Pinault to return bronze rat, rabbit heads to China</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, April 27th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Summer-Palace-bronze-rat.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Summer Palace bronze rat\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24954\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Summer-Palace-bronze-rat-122x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Summer-Palace-bronze-rat-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Summer-Palace-bronze-rat-200x244.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Summer-Palace-bronze-rat-430x525.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Summer-Palace-bronze-rat.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Summer Palace bronze rat\" width=\"122\"/></a>The vicissitudes of the bronze rat and rabbit heads looted from the Summer Palace by Anglo-French troops in 1860 and offered for sale at the epic <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/2049\" target=\"_blank\">Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berg\u00e9 auction</a> in February 2009 will come to an unexpected end later this year with their repatriation to China.

The rat and rabbit were once part of a clepsydra (a water clock) in the garden of the Old Summer Palace near Beijing. Heads of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac mounted on human bodies served as water spouts, each head spouting water for a designated two-hour period.

The fountain clock adorned the entrance to the Hall of Calm Seas (Haiyantang) palace, built in 1759, which was a masonry palace inspired by the Grand Trianon at Versailles.</p>\n<p>By the time of Qianlong Emperor\u2019s death, the European art and architecture trend in China was pass\u00e9. In 1795, the pipeworks were melted down so it no longer functioned as clock or fountain, but the external design was untouched; the heads and every other visible part of it remained in place. That would end in 1860 courtesy of the Second Opium War.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Haiyantang-fountain.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Print of Hall of Calm Seas (Haiyantang) palace with water clock in front\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24962\" height=\"85\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Haiyantang-fountain-150x85.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Haiyantang-fountain-150x85.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Haiyantang-fountain-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Haiyantang-fountain-430x244.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Haiyantang-fountain.jpg 1408w\" title=\"Print of Hall of Calm Seas (Haiyantang) palace with water clock in front\" width=\"150\"/></a>On September 29, 1860, two envoys from the French and British expeditionary forces and their escort, who were in the town of Tung-Chow outside Beijing to negotiate a truce, were imprisoned and tortured. Apparently there had been some sort of scuffle between a French officer and some Chinese soldiers, and General Sang-ko-lin-sin ordered the whole Anglo-French party arrested. Although the two envoys and 14 of their escort survived, 20 died in a most brutal fashion.</p>\n<p>The British and French were furious. The envoys had been under a flag of truce, so arresting and savaging them was a violation of custom and law. They saw it as a form of extortion, an attempt by the Chinese to strengthen their negotiating position by kidnapping. If it was, it backfired dramatically.</p>\n<p>In retaliation, and to deter any future notions of kidnap and torture as negotiating tools, the British High Commissioner to China, also eighth Lord Elgin and the son of the despoiler of the Parthenon marbles, ordered that the Summer Palace be destroyed. The complex was by then populated only by a handful of eunuchs and servants and although there were Imperial troops in the environs, they weren\u2019t about to rush in to protect the old pile. Foreign troops had already begun to loot it before the envoys were released; Elgin took it to a whole new level, saying, \u201cWhat remains of the Palace, which appears to be the place at which several of the British captives were subjected to the grossest indignities, will be immediately levelled to the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles George Gordon, who would later become a famous martyr of British imperialism after his beheading in the Siege of Khartoum, was there as a 27-year-old volunteer with the Royal Engineers. He had just arrived in China in September and was among the troops dispatched by Elgin to do the deed. In a letter home, he described the destruction of the palace:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe accordingly went out, and after pillaging it, burned the whole place, destroying, in a vandal-like manner, most valuable property, which could not be replaced for four millions. We got upward of \u00a348 apiece prize money\u2026I have done well. The people are very civil, but I think the grandees hate us, as they must after what we did the Palace. You would scarcely imagine the beauty and magnificence of the places we burnt. It made one\u2019s heart sore to burn them; in fact, these palaces were so large, and we were so pressed for time, that we could not plunder them carefully. Quantities of gold ornaments were burned, considered as brass. It was wretchedly demoralising work for an army. Everybody was wild for plunder.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ruins-of-Haiyantang-today.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ruins of the Hall of Calm Seas and the fountain today\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24961\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ruins-of-Haiyantang-today-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ruins-of-Haiyantang-today-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ruins-of-Haiyantang-today-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ruins-of-Haiyantang-today-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ruins of the Hall of Calm Seas and the fountain today\" width=\"150\"/></a>The grandees definitely hated them, and the people weren\u2019t exactly fans either. They still harbor massive resentment over these events, and the destruction of the Summer Palace has become a symbol of how European powers despoiled and humiliated China. Today what\u2019s left of the palace is a heritage park, and Chinese buyers public and private have spent tens of millions of dollars at auctions attempting to reclaim the bronze zodiac heads and the national pride they represent. The state-owned Poly Group purchased the ox (Christie\u2019s, 2000, $78.98 million), tiger (Sotheby\u2019s, 2000, $35.98 million) and monkey (Christie\u2019s, 2000, $1.03 million) and put them on display in the Poly Art Museum. Macau and Hong Kong casino billionaire Stanley Ho bought the boar (Sotheby\u2019s, 1987, $770,000) and donated it to the Poly Art Museum. In 2007, he bought the horse for $8.9 million from a Taiwanese collector who had bought it from Sotheby\u2019s London in 1989 for $400,000. He donated that one to the Capital Museum in Beijing.</p>\n<p>There are only two other heads known to have survived: the rat and rabbit. The remaining five \u2014 dragon, dog, snake, sheep and rooster \u2014 have never surfaced on the market or been published or publicly acknowledged in any way. That\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t out there somewhere, but if they did make it, they\u2019re deep undercover.</p>\n<p>This is why when the last two bronze heads were put up for auction, there was an immediate hue and cry. The Chinese government lodged a protest. A group of Chinese lawyers attempted to halt the sale but had no legal grounds since the pieces have been circulating on the market since they were pillaged. Pierre Berg\u00e9, Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s longtime companion and owner of the incredible collection that ultimately sold for almost half a billion dollars, offered to <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/1968\" target=\"_blank\">give them to China free of charge</a> if China agreed to \u201cgive in return human rights, the liberation of Tibet, and a welcome for the Dalai Lama.\u201d China, needless to say, was not amused and chose to decline the offer.</p>\n<p>The auction went ahead and the rat and rabbit ostensibly sold for $20 million apiece to a phone buyer. That buyer soon revealed himself to be Cai Mingchao, a Chinese collector and auctioneer who had no intention of paying for the pieces. It was <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/2106\" target=\"_blank\">a protest purchase</a> and he insisted the bronzes should be given to China on moral principle.</p>\n<p>I thought at the time that Christie\u2019s would contact the runner-up and sell it for the next highest bid, but apparently Berg\u00e9 just decided to keep them. At some point between the auction\u2019s end and today, Pinault apparently bought the rat and rabbit heads. There are no specifics on when he purchased them or how this was transacted.</p>\n<p>We do know that China immediately hit Christie\u2019s with sanctions, drowning them in complex paperwork requirements that in addition to choking sales also made it clear to Chinese buyers that the government was not pleased with Christie\u2019s, so it would probably be best to avoid them if you wanted to stay in its good graces.</p>\n<p>Today, however, relations are much thawed. Downright toasty, in fact, seeing as Christie\u2019s was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/arts/design/christies-is-poised-to-auction-art-in-china.html\" target=\"_blank\">granted a license earlier this month</a> allowing it to operate independently on the Chinese mainland, the first international auction house so honored. Pinault himself is also deeply involved in doing business in China, which is flush with new money and a taste for the luxury and retail brands Kering owns. I wonder if he called up Berg\u00e9 a month ago and threw him a few tens of millions of dollars to secure the sweetest of hostess gifts in time for his trip to China.</p>\n<p>And thus a hope <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000669/066943eo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">expressed by Victor Hugo in November of 1861</a> (pdf) has come to pass.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One day two bandits entered the Summer Palace. One plundered, the other burned. [\u2026] All the treasures of all our cathedrals put together could not equal this formidable and splendid museum of the Orient. It contained not only masterpieces of art, but masses of jewelry. What a great exploit, what a windfall! One of the two victors filled his pockets; when the other saw this he filled his coffers. And back they came to Europe, arm in arm, laughing away. Such is the story of the two bandits.[\u2026]</p>\n<p>Before history, one of the two bandits will be called France; the other will be called England. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>The French empire has pocketed half of this victory, and today with a kind of proprietorial naivety it displays the splendid bric-\u00e0-brac of the Summer Palace. I hope that a day will come when France, delivered and cleansed, will return this booty to despoiled China.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Pinault to return bronze rat, rabbit heads to China\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24949\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24949#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-24925\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24925\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Medieval skeleton bonanza under Edinburgh car park\">Medieval skeleton bonanza under Edinburgh car park</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, April 26th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24928\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 92px) 100vw, 92px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot-2-92x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot-2-92x150.jpg 92w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot-2-185x300.jpg 185w\" title=\"Knight's grave found under Edinburgh parking lot\" width=\"92\"/></a>Archaeologists excavating an Edinburgh parking lot destined to become the site of a rainwater catchment tank keep running into medieval skeletons. The first one discovered in March was a dramatic find: a <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/medieval-knight-remains-found-in-edinburgh-car-park-1-2833518\" target=\"_blank\">knight with a richly carved sandstone slab</a> marking his high rank and likely profession. This was just a month after the Richard III announcement, so there were much exclamation about how UK parking lots are apparently a rich vein of medieval warrior remains. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/more-parking-lot-skeletons.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24927\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/more-parking-lot-skeletons-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/more-parking-lot-skeletons-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/more-parking-lot-skeletons-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/more-parking-lot-skeletons-430x305.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/more-parking-lot-skeletons.jpg 1002w\" title=\"Two more skeletons found on the same site\" width=\"150\"/></a>At least two other skeletons were found at the time, but they were overshadowed by the knight and his fancy accessories. Now archaeologists have announced that <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/latest-news/7-more-skeletons-found-near-old-town-knight-grave-1-2908534\" target=\"_blank\">seven more complete skeletons and one partial have been found</a> under the same parking lot. There are three adults, four infants and a solitary skull. Just beneath the knight\u2019s burial is a skeleton which appears to be that of an adult female. Just to the right of the knight\u2019s sandstone slab are the remains of an infant. Their proximity to the knight may indicate a close familial relationship.</p>\n<p>This brings the total number burials under this car park to at least ten. All of the bones were found within the perimeter established by an ancient wall, perhaps the wall of a family crypt. Radiocarbon dating is still ongoing, but archaeologists have dated the carving style of the slab to the 13th century.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s in keeping with the history of the site. A monastery was built there in the 13th century. Blackfriars Monastery was founded in 1230 by King Alexander II of Scotland. Much like the Greyfriars monastery under that other parking lot in Leicester, it was destroyed by a mob during the Reformation (John Knox\u2019s rather than Henry VIII\u2019s, though) and the exact location was lost. When archaeologists began the excavation, they expected to find monastery remains somewhere in the area, and it seems they landed right on them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24930\" height=\"82\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot-150x82.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot-150x82.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot-200x110.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Knight-parking-lot-430x237.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ross Murray excavates the knight's grave\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was the sandstone slab which marked the spot. Archaeologists first encountered the corner of it and then unearthed the full piece. Carved on its surface are a Calvary Cross \u2014 a Latin cross mounted on three steps representing the hill on which Jesus was crucified \u2014 and a broadsword. In heraldic terms, the three steps of the Calvary Cross symbolize the three Christian graces (faith, hope, charity) and its use is often linked to the bearer having erected a cross in Rome or taken up arms in a crusade. </p>\n<p>The head of the cross is not your standard horizontal bar. The arm-ends appear to be fleurs-de-lis, which are not only lovely floral motifs representing purity but also have the barbed looked of fighting spears. The flowers are linked in the middle by a diamond shape and enclosed by a circle. Fleur-de-lis crosses became popular in the Middle Ages as replacements for the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23957\" target=\"_blank\">traditional Celtic Crosses</a> which often had round halos embracing the crossing point. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/knight-detail.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24929\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/knight-detail-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/knight-detail-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/knight-detail-198x300.jpg 198w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/knight-detail-430x648.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of the knight's skeleton showing his fine teeth\" width=\"99\"/></a>This unusual cross and its companion sword strongly suggest the grave of a fighting man of high status. Osteological analysis has not been completed yet, but Ross Murray, project officer for contract firm <a href=\"http://www.headlandarchaeology.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Headland Archaeology</a>, notes that the skeleton was that of a strong, healthy, well-built man about six feet tall, a particularly impressive height in the 13th century. His height, powerful build and good teeth were the product of a consistently good diet from an early age.</p>\n<p>The location of the burial also underscores his social importance. Archaeologists are still unsure of the layout of the monastery, but it\u2019s possible that he and the rest of the group were buried inside the walls of the building rather than in an outdoor graveyard. The closer the burial to the church, the wealthier and more influential the person. That slab was meant to be seen and it doesn\u2019t look very weathered to me, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if it were an indoor grave.</p>\n<p>The remains of a later building have also been found on the site. Royal High School was built there in 1578. It was demolished in 1774 to make way for a larger facility, Old High School, which was built in 1777. Sir Walter Scott and James Pillans, inventor of the blackboard, went to school there. The excavation area is known as High School Yards because the parking lot was once part of Old High School\u2019s yard. </p>\n<p>All of the human remains will be fully excavated, examined by osteoarchaeologists and then reburied in a respectful manner. The architectural remains will be preserved in situ, I\u2019m glad to report. According to Richard Lewis of the Edinburgh City Council, the remains of Blackfriars Monastery and Royal High School will be left on the site as artifacts of national significance which would be destroyed should they be removed.</p>\n<p>The Old High School building was purchased by the University of Edinburgh in 1905 to house various disciplines. In 1995 it housed the Department of Archaeology which Ross Murray attended. He fondly recalls hanging out in the High School Yards area during breaks between classes, just a few steps away from where he would find a wealth of medieval remains. </p>\n<p>The building is being renovated at the highest green standards and will become the <a href=\"http://edinburghcentre.org/about-us.html\" target=\"_blank\">Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation</a>, dedicated to researching and inventing new, sustainable low carbon technologies. Hence the rainwater catchment system which will apparently still be installed but without interfering with the structural remains.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Medieval skeleton bonanza under Edinburgh car park\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24925\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24925#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-24871\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24871\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to \u201cHear my voice.

The museum is custodian of a vast collection of 200 early audio recordings made by Alexander Graham Bell, his cousin Chichester Bell and their associate Charles Sumner Tainter during their time experimenting with new recording technology. The company they founded, Volta Laboratory Association, only lasted from 1881 to 1886, but during that brief period they worked with an astounding variety of technologies. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Phonorecord-by-Alexander-Graham-Bell.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24887\" height=\"145\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Phonorecord-by-Alexander-Graham-Bell-150x145.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Phonorecord-by-Alexander-Graham-Bell-150x145.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Phonorecord-by-Alexander-Graham-Bell-200x194.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Phonorecord-by-Alexander-Graham-Bell-430x418.jpg 430w\" title=\"Phonorecord with the voice of Alexander Graham Bell\" width=\"150\"/></a>They weren\u2019t all original inventions. Some of the work Bell et al did was on pre-existing technology that was in its infancy. They experimented and developed it far beyond their creators\u2019 work. The results were significant milestones in the history of audio technology. Their laterally cut discs were early versions of the format which became the industry standard for the 78/45/33 RPM discs some of us old people still remember. They also pioneered the creation of a system of master recordings coupled with mass production stamping and developed photographic discs, the principle that would later be put to work in optical film soundtracks. </p>\n<p>The Volta partners stored these important early recordings, devices and notes at the Smithsonian almost as soon as they produced them in case they needed evidence of their work for patent purposes. None of the recordings in the Volta collection can be played today because the players don\u2019t exist/work and even if they did, the recordings themselves are too damaged to be run through the wringer of those early machines. Imagine how frustrating it must be for a museum to have hundreds of historically significant documents they can\u2019t read. </p>\n<p>Optical scanning solves the problem because it doesn\u2019t touch the delicate surface of recordings at all. It scans them using a specially designed machine which creates a high-resolution digital map of the medium surface. The map is then processed to remove scratches and skips, and software reproduces the audio content in a digital sound file.</p>\n<p>The pilot program focused on scanning six of the Volta recordings on different media including a variable density photo disc, a green wax vertical cylinder cut on brass and beeswax on composition board. Since the pilot, donations from private and public sources have allowed Berkeley to work on another three recordings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-detail-on-phonorecord.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24886\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-detail-on-phonorecord-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-detail-on-phonorecord-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-detail-on-phonorecord-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-detail-on-phonorecord-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Inscription detail from the disc\" width=\"150\"/></a>The first one, a wax on composition board disc, has an inscription on the wax that looked very promising.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Record made April 15, 1885<br/>\nby A.G.B. and C.A.B.<br/>\nto test reproduction of numbers</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since the museum had a transcript in Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s hand of a recording of many numbers done on April 15th, 1885, and concluding <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bell-transcript.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24919\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bell-transcript-95x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bell-transcript-95x150.jpg 95w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bell-transcript-191x300.jpg 191w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bell-transcript-430x675.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bell-transcript.jpg 1182w\" title=\"Bell transcript\" width=\"95\"/></a>with a signoff by the inventor, they had reason to hope that this disc might contain the voice of the man himself.

It\u2019s one of the earliest in the Volta Laboratory collection, a highly modified Edison phonograph Bell dubbed the graphophone.

The dearly beloved were unearthed by archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology and Art History and the Cluj National History Museum excavating the courtyard of the <a href=\"http://www.lmst.ro/franciscan_monastery_en\" target=\"_blank\">Sigismund Toduta Music High School</a>, originally a 15th century Dominican monastery. </p>\n<p>The monastery was built around 1455 on the site of a Roman church and an earlier 13th century monastery. It was active only for a century before it was secularized in 1556 amidst the upheaval of the Reformation. The lovers therefore can be contextually dated to between the 1450s and 1556. The material and style of the coffin nails confirms the 1450-1550 date range.</p>\n<p>According to Adrian Rusu, senior researcher at the Institute of Archaeology, there is a possible Romeo and Juliet angle here (which of course is being promoted far and wide despite its tenuousness) in that the man appears to have been killed by a blunt-force blow that broke his sternum, while there is no immediately obvious cause of death for the woman. Her skeleton is that of a healthy 30 year old. She can\u2019t have committed suicide Juliet-style when her man died because she would not have been allowed to be buried in consecrated ground, and certainly not within the hallowed walls of a monastery. Perhaps, Rusu speculates, she died from a heart attack or a stroke brought on by the shock of his accidental death.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Skeletons-holding-hands-Cluj-Napoca-Romania-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-24839\" height=\"238\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Skeletons-holding-hands-Cluj-Napoca-Romania-2-200x238.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Skeletons-holding-hands-Cluj-Napoca-Romania-2-200x238.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Skeletons-holding-hands-Cluj-Napoca-Romania-2-125x150.jpg 125w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Skeletons-holding-hands-Cluj-Napoca-Romania-2-430x511.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skeleton lovers after additional excavation\" width=\"200\"/></a>Sure, he is totally pulling that explanation out of his fundament and his appreciation for the PR value of our collective cultural vernacular, but it is mysterious that they died fairly young, at the same time and only one of them shows signs of fatal trauma. I can think of several explanations that don\u2019t require the broken heart ex machina, though. She could have died first of an illness that can\u2019t be detected in the bones or that hasn\u2019t been yet. She could have had an unfortunate encounter with the wrong mushroom. The male then entirely by coincidence had some kind of workplace accident or tangled with the wrong horse that broke his sternum with one well-placed kick. Really, there are many possibilities.</p>\n<p>Two other sets of remains were found in the same area, one of an infant and the leg bones of another individual. Whether they bear any relation to the lovers is unknown. One genuine fact that can be deduced from the burial is that they must have been relatively wealthy, or had wealthy family members, to afford such a premium spot inside the monastery. This was an inner courtyard with a fountain and decorative garden and an area for the monks to pray and read religious texts. Placement here was like a turbo boost of sin forgiveness, something particularly desirable when a person died unexpectedly and thus without a final confession.</p>\n<p>This excavation is phase one of a larger restoration project. The Dominican monastery is one of three important ecclesiastical structures from the Middle Ages still standing in Cluj. (The other two are the 15th century gothic St. Michael\u2019s Church and the 15th century late gothic Calvinist Reformed Church.) It\u2019s in desperate need of extensive archaeological renovation. When the courtyard was concreted over in the 20th century, it created a major water problem.

In addition to its architectural significance \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.lmst.ro/files/galerie/6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">look at this amazing door</a> \u2014 it\u2019s also directly connected to a remarkable historical first: the first edict of religious toleration promulgated by a European ruler. In 1556, Isabella Jagiellon, Queen Dowager of Hungary (which included Transylvania), and her son John II Sigismund were invited by the legislative assembly to put the country, ravaged by wars between Archduke Ferdinand of Austria and the Ottoman Empire of Suleiman the Magnificent, back together. The Diet elected John king but as he was only 16, Isabella was co-ruler. During the transitional period when they worked on rebuilding government, she and John lived in the monastery for nine months. </p>\n<p>In 1557 she issued the Edict of Religious Tolerance which declared:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Each person [should] maintain whatever religious faith he wishes, with old or new rituals, while we at the same time leave it to their judgment to do as they please in the matter of faith, just so long as they bring no harm to bear on anyone at all. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This was forty years before Henry IV of France issued the famous Edict of Nantes granting freedom on conscience to the Protestant Huguenots after years of religious wars.</p>\n<p>Queen Isabella died in 1559. Her son, the first and only Unitarian king, continued to support religious freedom during his rule, sponsoring popular public debates and issuing the <a href=\"http://www.uupcc.org/docs/edict-of-torda.doc\" target=\"_blank\">Edict of Torda</a> in 1568.<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/John-II-Sigismund.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24851\" height=\"144\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/John-II-Sigismund-150x144.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/John-II-Sigismund-150x144.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/John-II-Sigismund-200x192.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/John-II-Sigismund-430x414.jpg 430w\" title=\"King John II Sigismund\" width=\"150\"/></a></p>\n<blockquote><p>His majesty, our Lord, in what manner he \u2013 together with his realm \u2013 legislated in the matter of religion at the previous Diets, in the same matter now, in this Diet, reaffirms that in every place the preachers shall preach and explain the Gospel each according to his understanding of it, and if the congregation like it, well. If not, no one shall compel them for their souls would not be satisfied, but they shall be permitted to keep a preacher whose teaching they approve. Therefore none of the superintendents or others shall abuse the preachers, no one shall be reviled for his religion by anyone, according to the previous statutes, and it is not permitted that anyone should threaten anyone else by imprisonment or by removal from his post for his teaching. For faith is the gift of God and this comes from hearing, which hearing is by the word of God.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Therefore this monastery bears the distinction of having been victim of religious conflict \u2014 it was sacked twice before it was decommissioned \u2014 and the place that helped nurture ground-breaking religious tolerance. Surely that alone makes it worth funding. (Also the door.)</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Medieval skeletons found holding hands in Romania\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24838\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24838#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-24822\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24822\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Richard III documentary airs on Smithsonian Channel\">Richard III documentary airs on Smithsonian Channel</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, April 23rd, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Richard-III-reconstructed.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-24828\" height=\"138\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Richard-III-reconstructed-200x138.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Richard-III-reconstructed-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Richard-III-reconstructed-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Richard-III-reconstructed-430x297.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Richard-III-reconstructed.jpg 867w\" title=\"Richard III reconstructed\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Smithsonian Channel is airing a documentary on the discovery of Richard III\u2019s skeleton. I caught <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/sn/show.do?show=3381029\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The King\u2019s Skeleton: Richard III Revealed</em> </a> last night. You can watch it next on Saturday, April 27th at 5:00 PM, and on Sunday, April 28th at 10:00 AM.</p>\n<p>Even though it was advertised as \u201cnew,\u201d I assumed when I saw it on the schedule that it was <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/richard-iii-the-king-in-the-car-park/4od#3479296\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The King in the Carpark</em></a>, the documentary that aired on Channel Four in the UK the day of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23196\" target=\"_blank\">the announcement</a>. I think in substance it is the same documentary, but there have been some changes made for a US audience. The only one I can identify for sure, not having seen the UK version, is that the narrator is American. If anybody has seen them both, I\u2019d love to hear of any other differences you detected. </p>\n<p>The cameras follow Simon Farnaby, a comedic actor and writer I\u2019ve never heard of before whose sole tenuous relevance to this story that I could determine is that he\u2019s from York. Anyway he seems to be the Greek chorus, our stand-in of ignorant wonder to whom the archaeologists, historians and scientists explain things in lieu of addressing the viewer directly. He also serves to hold Philippa Langley\u2019s hand, metaphorically and literally, whenever she hyperventilates.</p>\n<p>Much of the story of the dig, discovery and analysis is known to me now, but there were still some interesting surprises in the documentary. For instance, the team noted at the February press conference that the skeleton was actually found on first day, but they didn\u2019t get into the details of that. The documentary shows the discovery, how those leg bones are the first thing found at the dig, how they\u2019re covered back up to wait for future information since at that point they have no idea if they\u2019d even found the Greyfriars church and priory yet. </p>\n<p>Thirteen days later, all three trenches have been dug and archaeologists are able to determine from the artifacts that this was the Greyfriars site and the layout of the structures. Once the floorplan is clear, they return to those skeletal legs because they now realize that they are buried in the east of the church under the choir, which was exactly where Richard III was thought to have been buried.  </p>\n<p>Fun fact: after they cover the bones back up on day one, storm clouds quickly gather and it began to rain. Philippa Langley thinks that\u2019s downright eerie. Rain in England at the end of August? It feels like a message from Richard, donchaknow. Certainly not an entirely expected minor weather event seen every day. Certainly not that.</p>\n<p>Another interesting bit is when Simon visits a historian who shows him a couple of paintings of Richard and how they were tampered with, Medieval Photoshop style, by Tudor artists to make Richard look freaky. They added curves to one shoulder to make him look hunchbacked, narrowed his eyes, even carved his thumb to a point so it looks like he has a demon claw rather than regular human fingers.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, back at the dig they bring the earth movers in to extend the first trench crosswise at the place where the leg bones were found. The original trench isn\u2019t wide enough to expose the rest of the skeletal remains, so the machines have to peel off more pavement and modern layers of soil while the precious legs bones were just beneath them. It\u2019s amazing how delicate heavy machinery can be.</p>\n<p>Next up is bone specialist Joe Appleby who takes over in her Outbreak suit to do the careful excavation that will hopefully reveal the rest of the skeleton. Yay she finds a skull! Oops, she found it when she drove her pickaxe through it. It\u2019s cool, though, because the skull is at a weird angle compared to the legs so it\u2019s probably not from the same skeleton. </p>\n<p>Twist! Yes it is! The weird angle, Joe finds, is due to the marked curvature of the spine. She calls in Simon and Philippa to show them what she\u2019s found, and Philippa loses the ability to stand when she sees that s-curve in the spine. She has to sit down on a mudpile because that\u2019s one of her biggest bugaboos: Richard couldn\u2019t have been a hunchback because how could he have worn armour and fought?</p>\n<p>Then Joe makes her feel better. At least there\u2019s no evidence that his right arm was withered, she tells Philippa. Philippa replies: \u201cSome good news them.\u201d Yes, finally some good news after the tragic discovery of a skeleton with scoliosis in the location where Richard III was buried.</p>\n<p>The bones are bagged and sent to the lab for the long process of analysis. The skull goes to Turi King because she\u2019s going to attempt DNA extraction from the teeth. You see her removing one of them, but the narration uses the plural so she had to remove more than one, clean them and grind them into powder in order to get any DNA out of them. That answers the question of whether the tooth loss visible in the skull was pre, peri or postmortem.</p>\n<p>The DNA results are going to take months, so off goes Simon to York to talk about how Richard was perceived by the locals. Spoiler: they liked him.</p>\n<p>Back at the lab again, we get to see the process of identifying the metal object that was found between two of the skeleton\u2019s vertebrae. The researcher X-rayed the piece, compared it to arrows of Richard\u2019s time and ultimately determines that it\u2019s not an arrowhead but a pre-existing nail, possibly Roman, that just happened to wind up in the burial.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Reconstruction-in-process.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24830\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Reconstruction-in-process-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Reconstruction-in-process-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Reconstruction-in-process-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Reconstruction-in-process-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Reconstruction-in-process.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Reconstruction in process\" width=\"150\"/></a>There\u2019s also a rather cool bit about the creation of the facial reconstruction using specialized software. It\u2019s neat to see the muscles being digitally added on to the skull.</p>\n<p>So finally it\u2019s time for the full osteological presentation. Philippa, Simon, Joe Appleby and Dr. Pierce Mitchell (specialist in deformities) meet over the bones. Mitchell says he would have been a hunchback with one shoulder higher than the other.

Out. She can\u2019t stay in the room anymore because she can\u2019t deal with seeing him laid out like that with his glaring scoliotic spine making a mockery of her years of dedication to the idea that the only deformity in Richard was projected onto him posthumously by Tudor propagandists. Simon has to go out and pet her for a while to validate her tender feelers.</p>\n<p>When they return, Mitchell points out that when he calls him a hunchback, he just means in the colloquial sense of someone with a spinal deformity. He didn\u2019t actually have a hump on his back. When he was clothed, it would only look like one was shoulder slightly higher than the other.</p>\n<p>Things get weird again when the facial reconstruction is complete. Philippa, led by Simon, enters the room with her eyes closed. She opens them to behold the reconstructed face of Richard III. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look the face of a tyrant. I\u2019m sorry, but it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s like you could just talk to him. Have a conversation right now.\u201d She does not lean in for a kiss, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Philippa-and-Richard-sittin-in-a-tree.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24829\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Philippa-and-Richard-sittin-in-a-tree-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Philippa-and-Richard-sittin-in-a-tree-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Philippa-and-Richard-sittin-in-a-tree-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Philippa-and-Richard-sittin-in-a-tree-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Philippa and Richard sittin in a tree\" width=\"150\"/></a>but that\u2019s the level of vibe we\u2019re talking about here. There\u2019s a reason they didn\u2019t leave her alone with him.</p>\n<p>The show concludes with the DNA results. Adorably, Turi King takes Michael Ibsen to a private room to share the results with him first, because he\u2019s family. Then she tells Simon and Philippa and there is much subdued English rejoicing.</p>\n<p>My final verdict is that it\u2019s definitely worth watching just to see the discovery unfold the way it did. It\u2019s lighter on the science and archaeology than I would have liked, but I was steeled for that by the many excellent comments y\u2019all left on the Richard blog entries.</p>\n<p>A positive final note: there are no cheeseball reenactments of historical events. When historians and the narrator are talking about Richard\u2019s rise to throne, his life, the princes in the tower, the Battle of Bosworth, his death, the descriptions are accompanied with a stylized, highly atmospheric animation. The art is kind of great and there are some excellent ravens involved. I really enjoyed the animations. Whoever did that needs to make a feature-length movie of the life and death of Richard III.</p>\n<p>Edit: Here\u2019s an animated telling of Shakespeare\u2019s <em>Richard III</em> courtesy of WandaSusie which is very similar, if not identical, in style. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the exact same animation as figures in the documentary, though.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJXTreobkfc&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Richard III documentary airs on Smithsonian Channel\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24822\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24822#comments\">14 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-24803\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24803\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rare gold find in 4,400-year-old Beaker burial\">Rare gold find in 4,400-year-old Beaker burial</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, April 22nd, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Beaker-vessel-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24806\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Beaker-vessel-in-situ-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Beaker-vessel-in-situ-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Beaker-vessel-in-situ-200x178.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Beaker-vessel-in-situ-430x383.jpg 430w\" title=\"Beaker vessel fragments in situ\" width=\"150\"/></a>Archaeological from <a href=\"http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Wessex Archaeology</a> excavating a gravel quarry in Berkshire <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/fourthousand-year-old-goldadorned-skeleton-found-near-windsor-8581819.html\" target=\"_blank\">discovered a rare 4,400-year-old Beaker burial</a> 18 months ago.

Five tubular (80s flashback!) beads made from folded pieces of sheet gold were found, once part of a necklace. Black disc beads of a jet-like material called lignite were also part of the necklace. Archaeologists found thirty lignite beads and 29 fragments of amber beads, so this was an elaborate necklace indeed. Lignite beads were also discovered near her hand, perhaps from a matching bracelet. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Amber-beads.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24809\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Amber-beads-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Amber-beads-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Amber-beads-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Amber-beads-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Amber rounds\" width=\"150\"/></a>Larger perforated amber rounds were found in a row down her body. They were probably extremely fancy, extremely expensive buttons going down the front a Copper Age version of a cardigan. </p>\n<p>Lastly, a large pottery beaker with nicely even stripes probably applied using a comb-like stamp was placed on her hip, an unusual position for the beaker in the Beaker burials. They are usually found by the feet or shoulders.</p>\n<p>All of this elegance and quality strongly suggests the woman was someone of impeccably high status.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Archaeologist Gareth Chaffey of Wessex Archaeology, who is directing the ongoing excavation, said that the woman unearthed at the site \u201cwas probably an important person in her society, perhaps holding some standing which gave her access to prestigious, rare and exotic items. She could have been a leader, a person with power and authority, or possibly part of an elite family \u2013 perhaps a princess or queen.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lead isotope analysis performed on the gold found that it was mined in south-east Ireland and southern Britain. The lignite beads are from Eastern England and the amber buttons probably from the Baltic, although it may have been local amber found on beaches. Scientists hope that further analysis will answer some questions about how the gold was procured and traded along existing trade routes.  </p>\n<p>This find is not the only significant discovery achaeologists have made since they began excavating Kingsmead Quarry in 2003. During the Copper Age and for thousands of years after that, the quarry was in a floodplain on the shore of the Thames. Its convenient access to water ensure it was inhabited by many subsequent generations. The excavations have found evidence of human occupation steadily from the Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages.</p>\n<p>The quarry is owned by the CEMEX building materials company. They have funded the ongoing excavation to the tune of \u00a34 million ($6,000,000), and it certainly had paid off in terms discoveries. More than 28 hectares of the quarry have been excavated now. There are ancient artifacts, Neolithic houses, entire landscapes that have been exposed to expert eye. The plan is to continue digging for another two years.</p>\n<p>Wessex Archaeology and CEMEX will be displaying some of the discoveries, including the gold beads, at<a href=\"http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/Berkshire/horton2013/event\" target=\"_blank\"> an event at Wraysbury Village Hall</a>, Berkshire, on Saturday April 27th between 10.30 AM and 3.30 PM. Admission is free. Visitors not only get to see the artifacts in person, but they also get to meet the archaeologists working on the project and examine a skeleton.</p>\n<p>They hope to have the Beaker artifacts on display in a museum by the end of the year.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Rare gold find in 4,400-year-old Beaker burial\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24803\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24803#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-24785\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24785\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to King Charles I\u2019s Order of the Garter sash?\">King Charles I\u2019s Order of the Garter sash?</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, April 21st, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triple-portrait-King-Charles-I-Anthony-van-Dyck-1635-1636.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24791\" height=\"126\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triple-portrait-King-Charles-I-Anthony-van-Dyck-1635-1636-150x126.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triple-portrait-King-Charles-I-Anthony-van-Dyck-1635-1636-150x126.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triple-portrait-King-Charles-I-Anthony-van-Dyck-1635-1636-200x168.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triple-portrait-King-Charles-I-Anthony-van-Dyck-1635-1636-430x361.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Triple-portrait-King-Charles-I-Anthony-van-Dyck-1635-1636.jpg 1499w\" title='\"Charles I in Three Positions\" by Anthony van Dyck 1635-1636' width=\"150\"/></a>Anthony Van Dyck painted many portraits of doomed King Charles I and his courtiers. The most famous among them is probably <em>Charles I in Three Positions</em>, a triple portrait that shows the king face-on, in full left profile and in three-quarters right profile. </p>\n<p>Now one of the gems in the <a href=\"http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/404420/charles-i-1600-1649\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Collection</a>, the portrait was originally a work piece sent to the sculptor Gianlorenzo Bernini in Rome. He had been commissioned by Pope Urban VIII to make a bust of King Charles which the pope would then present as a gift to the Catholic Queen Henrietta. Since the king was not able to sit for Bernini in person, he commissioned his favorite painter, Van Dyck, to make a portrait showing him from several angles which could be used as a schematic by the sculptor. He sports a different silk outfit in each to give Bernini textural options and there\u2019s a tear-drop pearl earring that would make Vermeer salivate in the three-quarters profile, but in all three looks he wears similar delicate lace overlay collars and the blue ribbon of the Order of the Garter.</p>\n<p>Bernini, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21385\" target=\"_blank\">never one to mince words</a>, royalty or no royalty, is said to have remarked upon examination of the triple portrait:  \u201cNever have I beheld features more unfortunate.\u201d It seems premonitory in hindsight given just how unfortunate Charles\u2019 ending was, but he probably just meant that all of Van Dyck\u2019s Baroque flourishes and all the lace and silk in King Charles\u2019 closet couldn\u2019t make him look like any less of a sad sack, which, I think we can all agree, is a pretty fair assessment.</p>\n<p>Still, Bernini managed to enhance Charles\u2019 qualities enough that the bust, finished in the summer of 1636 and presented to their majesties in July 1637, was a huge hit with King and Queen. It didn\u2019t push the sovereign over the edge to Catholicism as the Pope had hoped it would, but it at least curried favor. The court roundly agreed that it was a most excellent likeness exquisitely executed, if you\u2019ll pardon the term. Charles gave Bernini an expensive diamond ring to reward him for his work. Sadly, the bust was almost as short-lived as the king. It was destroyed by a fire in Whitehall Palace in 1698. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Copy-of-Bernini-bust-of-Charles-I.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24786\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Copy-of-Bernini-bust-of-Charles-I-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Copy-of-Bernini-bust-of-Charles-I-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Copy-of-Bernini-bust-of-Charles-I-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Copy-of-Bernini-bust-of-Charles-I-430x543.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Copy-of-Bernini-bust-of-Charles-I.jpg 1581w\" title=\"Possibly copy of Bernini bust of Charles I, ca. 1700-1750\" width=\"118\"/></a>There\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/35856/charles-i-1600-1649\" target=\"_blank\">portrait bust of King Charles I from the early 18th century</a> in the Royal Collection which some believe to be a copy of Bernini\u2019s piece, but there\u2019s no evidence the sculptor ever saw the original before it was lost. The king is wearing something that looks like the three-quarters profile outfit with that big puff of bunched diagonal silk, but the lace collar is much smaller and more twee, and the king\u2019s jaw line bears no relation to the original. He is wearing his Order of the Garter medallion and ribbon, though. </p>\n<p>As for the Van Dyck painting, Bernini kept it. It passed to his heirs after his death and remained in the Bernini Palace on the Via Del Corso until it was bought by an agent of British art dealer William Buchanan in 1802. After passing through the hands of two private collectors, it was purchased for the Royal Collection by King George IV in 1822.</p>\n<p>But what happened to the King Charles I\u2019s Order of the Garter ribbon? He may have brought it with him to the scaffold. We know he gave one of the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21559\" target=\"_blank\">George badges that are part of the Order\u2019s regalia to William Juxon</a>, the Bishop of London, just before he was beheaded, but Parliament confiscated and sold everything of Charles\u2019 they could get their hands on to creditors who immediately resold whatever they got, so ownership histories have gotten very muddled. Besides, a blue ribbon, as fond as the king was of it, can\u2019t have been seen as a high ticket item, and as a textile is far easier to destroy than to preserve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eikon-Basilike-and-sash-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-24788\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eikon-Basilike-and-sash-3-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eikon-Basilike-and-sash-3-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eikon-Basilike-and-sash-3-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eikon-Basilike-and-sash-3-430x260.jpg 430w\" title=\"Eikon Basilike and ribbon pieces\" width=\"150\"/></a>However in 1949, a viable candidate actually surfaced. Queen Mary, grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II, was given a first edition of <a href=\"http://anglicanhistory.org/charles/eikon/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Eikon Basilike: The Portraicture of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings</em></a>. This book was published in 1649 just 10 days after King Charles\u2019 execution and is purportedly musings written by the king himself on his reign, the hardships he endured, his enemies, his faith. There\u2019s long been a debate as to the authorship, but there is evidence that he wrote at least parts of it, or that it was derived from his personal papers. </p>\n<p>The copy given to Queen Mary had four lengths of blue silk ribbon attached to the binding. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-18th-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-24787\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 94px) 100vw, 94px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-18th-c-94x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-18th-c-94x150.jpg 94w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-18th-c-189x300.jpg 189w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-18th-c-430x680.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Inscription-18th-c.jpg 479w\" title=\"Inscription in the Eikon Basilike, apparently 18th c.\" width=\"94\"/></a>An inscription at the front of the book claimed that these were the remains of King Charles\u2019 Order of the Garter sash. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe Book was the gift of Sir Oliver Flemming Master of the Ceremonies to King Charles the First, together with ye ribband strings which were the Garter His Majesty wore his George on.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nobody was going to take the inscription\u2019s word for it, though.

Charles reigned from 1625 until 1649, and he sat for that Van Dyck portrait in 1635-6. It\u2019s also the proper width and length for a Garter sash, 10 centimeters (four inches) wide and 136 centimeters (53.5 inches) long. </p>\n<p>So we still don\u2019t know for sure that it\u2019s King Charles I\u2019s Order of the Garter sash \u2014 the wording of the inscription appears to be from the 18th century \u2014 but we now know that it certainly could be. The book and ribbons will be going on display along with the painting. A lace collar that dates to around 1636 that is believed to have belonged to Charles will join them to truly bring the painting to life.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"King Charles I\u2019s Order of the Garter sash?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24785\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24785#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2013/04/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

4th</a>, after five years of painstaking restoration following a devastating fire. </p>\n<p>On 8:40 PM on Sunday, February 10th, 2008, a man climbed a ladder to the second floor of the gate, poured paint thinner on the floor and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7238210.stm\" target=\"_blank\">set it on fire</a> with a disposable lighter. He quickly climbed back down and fled, leaving behind unused bottles of paint thinner, a backpack, disposable lighters and the ladder. Firefighters were on the scene promptly, but there was some confusion about whether the fire was still burning and the Cultural Heritage Administration had warned the crews to proceed with caution so as not to damage the ancient structure. When the conflagration blew up again, it was too large to put out immediately. By the end of the five hour battle to put out the blaze, the gate had collapsed and was a smoldering pile of wreckage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25010\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-collapses-during-fire-430x305.jpg 430w\" title=\"Firefighters attempt to douse the flames at the Namdaemun\" width=\"150\"/></a>A <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/12/world/main3820290.shtml?source=search_story\" target=\"_blank\">suspect was apprehended the next day</a>.

Seoul has lost a great many of its historic monuments to modernization, occupation and war. This ancient gate, one of four built along the walls protecting Seoul just six years after the city became the capital of the then-new Joseon Dynasty (1392 -1910), was the oldest wooden structure in the city. It was given the formal designation of National Treasure Number One in 1962 during a previous restoration to repair damage from the Korean War (1950-1953) and the Japanese Occupation (1910-1945). It was only opened to the public for the first time since the occupation in 2006.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-25017\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906-430x295.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namdaemun-gate-1906.jpg 1065w\" title=\"Namdaemun in 1906\" width=\"150\"/></a>As horrific as the devastation was, there was still a fair amount of recoverable material from the site, enough to support a restoration.

However, given the opportunity to start from scratch, the government decided to restore the gate to its original form, rebuilding walls destroyed by the Japanese during the occupation and <a href=\"http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2899170\" target=\"_blank\">using only traditional construction methods</a>. Instead of the modern paint and tiles employed during the restoration of the 1960s, this restoration would use only hand-made roof tiles fired in traditional kilns and natural paints, which had to be imported from Japan because there are no traditional paint manufacturers left in Korea, for the <em>dancheong</em>, the gloriously colorful decorative painting.

One team identified and tagged each piece of burned wood using radio frequency identification to find whatever could be reused and to collect more information about how they had once been put together.

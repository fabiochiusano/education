{"content": "A final report by a British parliamentary committee which spent months last year investigating online political disinformation makes very uncomfortable reading for Facebook \u2014 with the company singled out for \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cbad faith\u201d responses to democratic concerns about the misuse of people\u2019s data. In the report, published today , the committee has also called for Facebook\u2019s use of user data to be investigated by the UK\u2019s data watchdog. In an evidence session to the committee\u00a0 late last year , the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) suggested Facebook needs to change its business model \u2014 warning the company risks burning user trust for good. Last summer the ICO also called for an ethical pause of social media ads for election campaigning, warning of the risk of developing \u201ca system of voter surveillance by default\u201d. The UK parliamentary enquiry looked into both Facebook\u2019s own use of personal data to further its business interests, such as by providing access to users\u2019 data to developers and advertisers in order to increase revenue and/or usage of its own platform; and examined what Facebook claimed as \u2018abuse\u2019 of its platform by the disgraced (and now defunct ) political data company Cambridge Analytica \u2014 which in 2014 paid a developer with access to Facebook\u2019s developer platform to extract information on millions of Facebook users in build voter profiles to try to influence elections . The committee\u2019s conclusion about Facebook\u2019s business is a damning one with the company accused of operating a business model that\u2019s predicated on selling abusive access to people\u2019s data. \u201c Far from\u00a0 Facebook acting against \u201csketchy\u201d or \u201cabusive\u201d apps, of which action it has produced no\u00a0 evidence at all, it, in fact, worked with such apps as an intrinsic part of its business model,\u201d the committee argues. \u201c This explains why it recruited the people who created them, such as Joseph Chancellor [the co-founder of GSR, the developer which sold Facebook user data to Cambridge Analytica]. Nothing in Facebook\u2019s actions supports the statements of Mark Zuckerberg who, we\u00a0 believe, lapsed into \u201cPR crisis mode\u201d, when its real business model was exposed. \u201cThis\u00a0 is just one example of the bad faith which we believe justifies governments holding a\u00a0 business such as Facebook at arms\u2019 length. It seems clear to us that Facebook acts only\u00a0 when serious breaches become public. This is what happened in 2015 and 2018.\u201d \u201cWe consider that data transfer for value is Facebook\u2019s business model and that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s statement that \u2018we\u2019ve never sold anyone\u2019s data\u201d is simply untrue\u2019,\u201d the committee also concludes. We\u2019ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the committee\u2019s report.\u00a0 Update:\u00a0 Facebook said it rejects all claims it breached data protection and competition laws. In a statement attributed to UK public policy manager, Karim Palant, the company told us: We share the Committee\u2019s concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence. We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee\u2019s recommendation for electoral law reform. But we\u2019re not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for 7 years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do. We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users. While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse. Last fall Facebook was issued the maximum possible fine \u00a0under relevant UK data protection law for failing to safeguard user data from Cambridge Analytica saga. Although it is appealing the ICO\u2019s penalty , claiming there\u2019s no evidence UK users\u2019 data got misused. During the course of a multi-month enquiry last year\u00a0 investigating disinformation and fake news , the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee heard from 73 witnesses in 23 oral evidence sessions, as well as taking in 170 written submissions. In all the committee says it posed more than 4,350 questions. Its wide-ranging, 110-page report makes detailed observations on a number of technologies and business practices across the social media, adtech and strategic communications space, and culminates in a long list of recommendations for policymakers and regulators \u2014 reiterating its call for tech platforms to be made legally liable for content. Among the report\u2019s main recommendations are: Among the areas the committee\u2019s report covers off with detailed commentary are data use and targeting; advertising and political campaigning \u2014 including foreign influence; and digital literacy. It\u00a0argues that regulation is urgently needed to restore democratic accountability and \u201cmake sure the people stay in charge of the machines\u201d. \u201cProtecting our data helps us secure the past, but protecting inferences and uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is what we will need to protect our future,\u201d the committee warns. Ministers are due to produce a White Paper on social media safety regulation this winter and the committee writes that it hopes its recommendations will inform government thinking. \u201cMuch has been said about the coarsening of public debate, but when these factors are brought to bear directly in election campaigns then the very fabric of our democracy is threatened,\u201d says the committee. \u201cThis situation is unlikely to change. What does need to change is the enforcement of greater transparency in the digital sphere, to ensure that we know the source of what we are reading, who has paid for it and why the information has been sent to us. We need to understand how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data.\u201d The report calls for tech companies to be regulated as a new category, \u201cnot necessarily either a \u2018platform\u2019 or a \u2018publisher\u201d, but which legally tightens their liability for harmful content published on their platforms. Last month another UK parliamentary committee also urged the government to place a legal \u2018duty of care\u2019 on platforms to protect users under the age of 18. The government said then that it has not ruled out doing so. We\u2019ve reached out to the DCMS for a response to the latest committee report.\u00a0 Update:\u00a0 A department spokesperson told us: The Government\u2019s forthcoming White Paper on Online Harms will set out a new framework for ensuring disinformation is tackled effectively, while respecting freedom of expression and promoting innovation. This week the Culture Secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues. We welcome this report\u2019s contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the UK the safest place to be online. We will respond in due course. Competition concerns are also raised several times by the committee. \u201cCompanies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like \u2018digital gangsters\u2019 in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,\u201d the DCMS committee writes, going on to urge the government to \u00a0investigate whether Facebook specifically has been involved in\u00a0 any anti-competitive practices and conduct a review of its business practices\u00a0 towards other developers \u201cto decide whether Facebook is unfairly using its dominant\u00a0 market position in social media to decide which businesses should succeed or fail\u201d.\u00a0 \u201cThe big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,\u201d it adds. The committee suggests existing legal tools are up to the task of reining in platform power, citing privacy laws, data protection legislation, antitrust and competition law \u2014 and calling for a \u201ccomprehensive audit\u201d of the social media advertising market by the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, and a specific antitrust probe of Facebook\u2019s business practices. \u201cIf companies become monopolies they can be broken up, in whatever sector,\u201d the committee points out. \u201cFacebook\u2019s handling of personal data, and its use for political campaigns, are prime and legitimate areas for inspection by regulators, and it should not be able to evade all editorial responsibility for the content shared by its users across its platforms.\u201d The social networking giant was the recipient of many awkward queries during the course of the committee\u2019s enquiry but it refused repeated requests for its founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify \u2014 sending a number of lesser staffers in his stead. That decision continues to be seized upon by the committee as evidence of a lack of democratic accountability. It also accuses Facebook of having an intentionally \u201copaque management structure\u201d. \u201cBy choosing not to appear before the Committee and by choosing not to respond personally to any of our invitations, Mark Zuckerberg has shown contempt towards both the UK Parliament and the \u2018International Grand Committee\u2019, involving members from nine legislatures from around the world,\u201d the committee writes. It doubles down on the accusation that Facebook sought to deliberately mislead its enquiry \u2014 pointing to incorrect and/or inadequate responses from staffers who did testify. \u201cWe are left with the impression that either [policy VP] Simon Milner and [CTO] Mike Schroepfer deliberately misled the Committee or they were deliberately not briefed by senior executives at Facebook about the extent of Russian interference in foreign elections,\u201d it suggests. In an unusual move late last year the committee used rare parliamentary powers to seize a cache of documents related to an active US lawsuit against Facebook filed by an app developer called Six4Three. Seized cache of Facebook docs raise competition and consent questions The cache of documents is referenced extensively in the final report, and appears to have fuelled antitrust concerns, with the committee arguing that the evidence obtained from the internal company documents \u201cindicates that Facebook was willing to override its users\u2019 privacy settings in order to transfer data to some app developers, to charge high prices in advertising to some developers, for the exchange of that data, and to starve some developers\u2026 of that data, thereby causing them to lose their business\u201d. \u201cIt seems clear that Facebook was, at the very least, in violation of its Federal Trade Commission [privacy] settlement,\u201d the committee also argues, citing evidence from the former chief technologist of the FTC,\u00a0 Ashkan Soltani . On Soltani\u2019s evidence, it writes: Ashkan Soltani rejected [Facebook\u2019s] claim, saying that up until 2012, platform controls did not exist, and privacy controls did not apply to apps. So even if a user set their profile to private, installed apps would still be able to access information. After 2012, Facebook added platform controls and made privacy controls applicable to apps. However, there were \u2018whitelisted\u2019 apps that could still access user data without permission and which, according to Ashkan Soltani, could access friends\u2019 data for nearly a decade before that time. Apps were able to circumvent users\u2019 privacy of platform settings and access friends\u2019 information, even when the user disabled the Platform. This was an example of Facebook\u2019s business model driving privacy violations. While Facebook is singled out for the most eviscerating criticism in the report (and targeted for specific investigations), the committee\u2019s long list of recommendations are addressed at social media businesses and online advertisers generally. It also calls for far more transparency from platforms, writing that: \u201cSocial media companies need to be more transparent about their own sites, and how they work. Rather than hiding behind complex agreements, they should be informing users of how their sites work, including curation functions and the way in which algorithms are used to prioritise certain stories, news and videos, depending on each user\u2019s profile. The more people know how the sites work, and how the sites use individuals\u2019 data, the more informed we shall all be, which in turn will make choices about the use and privacy of sites easier to make.\u201d The committee also urges a raft of updates to UK election law \u2014 branding it \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d in the digital era. Its interim report, published last summer , made many of the same recommendations. But despite pressing the government for urgent action there was only a cool response from ministers then, with the government remaining tied up trying to shape a response to the 2016 Brexit referendum vote which split the country (with social media\u2019s election-law-deforming help ). Instead it opted for a \u2018 wait and see \u2018 approach. The government accepted just three of the preliminary report\u2019s forty-two recommendations outright, and fully rejected four. Nonetheless, the committee has doubled down on its preliminary conclusions, reiterating earlier recommendations and pushing the government once again to act. It cites fresh evidence, including from additional testimony, as well as pointing to other reports (such as the recently published\u00a0 Cairncross Review ) which it argues back up some of the conclusions reached.\u00a0 \u201cOur inquiry over the last year has identified three big threats to our society. The challenge for the year ahead is to start to fix them; we cannot delay any longer,\u201d writes Damian Collins MP and chair of the\u00a0 DCMS \u00a0Committee, in a statement. \u201cDemocracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised \u2018dark adverts\u2019 from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia. \u201cThe big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.\u00a0 Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.\u201d \u201cThese are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission.\u00a0 We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,\u201d he added. \u201cThe age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end. The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator.\u201d The committee says it expects the government to respond to its recommendations within two months \u2014 noting rather dryly:\u00a0\u201cWe hope that this will be much more comprehensive, practical, and constructive than their response to the Interim Report, published in October 2018. Several of our recommendations were not substantively answered and there is now an urgent need for the Government to respond to them.\u201d It also makes a point of including an analysis of Internet traffic to the government\u2019s own response to its preliminary report last year \u2014 in which it highlights a \u201chigh proportion\u201d of online visitors hailing from Russian cities including Moscow and Saint Petersburg\u2026 Source: Web and publications unit, House of Commons Source: Web and publications unit, House of Commons \u201cThis itself demonstrates the very clear interest from Russia in what we have had to say\u00a0about their activities in overseas political campaigns,\u201d the committee remarks, criticizing the government response to its preliminary report for claiming there\u2019s no evidence of \u201csuccessful\u201d Russian interference in UK elections and democratic processes. \u201cIt is surely a sufficient matter of concern that the Government has acknowledged that interference has occurred, irrespective of the lack of evidence of impact. The Government should be conducting analysis to understand the extent of Russian targeting of voters during elections,\u201d it adds. Another interesting tidbit from the report is confirmation that the ICO has shared the names of three \u201csenior managers\u201d at Facebook who knew about the Cambridge Analytica data breach prior to the first press report in December 2015 \u2014 which is the date Facebook has repeatedly told the committee was when it first learnt of the breach, contradicting what the ICO found via its own investigations. The committee\u2019s report does not disclose the names of the three senior managers \u2014 saying the ICO has asked the names to remain confidential (we\u2019ve reached out to the ICO to ask why it is not making this information public) \u2014 and implies the execs did not relay the information to Zuckerberg. The committee dubs this as an example of \u201ca profound failure\u201d of internal governance, also branding it as evidence of \u201cfundamental weakness\u201d in how Facebook manages its responsibilities to users. Here\u2019s the committee\u2019s account of that detail: We were keen to know when and which people working at Facebook first knew about\u00a0the GSR/Cambridge Analytica breach. The ICO confirmed, in correspondence with the Committee, that three \u201csenior managers\u201d were involved in email exchanges earlier in\u00a02015 concerning the GSR breach before December 2015, when it was first reported by The\u00a0Guardian. At the request of the ICO, we have agreed to keep the names confidential,\u00a0but it would seem that this important information was not shared with the most senior\u00a0executives at Facebook, leading us to ask why this was the case. The scale and importance of the GSR/Cambridge Analytica breach was such that its occurrence should have been referred to Mark Zuckerberg as its CEO immediately. The fact that it was not is evidence that Facebook did not treat the breach with the seriousness it merited. It was a profound failure of governance within Facebook that its CEO did not\u00a0know what was going on, the company now maintains, until the issue became public to us\u00a0all in 2018. The incident displays the fundamental weakness of Facebook in managing its responsibilities to the people whose data is used for its own commercial interests. Responding to the full report in a statement, UK information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: The DCMS inquiry has been vital to understanding the increasingly complex era of digital political campaigning, big data and disinformation online and we have welcomed the opportunity to contribute to it. We\u2019re pleased with the committee\u2019s support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning. The ICO\u2019s investigations into these areas continue and we\u2019ll be reviewing the full report with interest. We also support the report\u2019s references to the growing public debate on internet harms. Personal data, and its use for all forms of micro-targeting, is central to the work of the ICO. We welcome the debate on how best to protect people online and we look forward to the proposals in the Government\u2019s online harms white paper.

and examined what Facebook claimed as \u2018abuse\u2019 of its platform by the disgraced (and now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/cambridge-analytica-shuts-down/\">defunct</a>) political data company Cambridge Analytica \u2014 which in 2014 paid a developer with access to Facebook\u2019s developer platform to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">extract information on millions of Facebook users</a> in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/heres-cambridge-analyticas-plan-for-voters-facebook-data/\">build voter profiles to try to influence elections</a>.</p>\n<p>The committee\u2019s conclusion about Facebook\u2019s business is a damning one with the company accused of operating a business model that\u2019s predicated on selling abusive access to people\u2019s data.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;

It seems clear to us that Facebook acts only\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">when serious breaches become public. This is what happened in 2015 and 2018.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWe consider that data transfer for value is Facebook\u2019s business model and that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"mark-zuckerberg\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> statement that \u2018we\u2019ve never sold anyone\u2019s data\u201d is simply untrue\u2019,\u201d the committee also concludes.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the committee\u2019s report.\u00a0<strong>Update:\u00a0</strong>Facebook said it rejects all claims it breached data protection and competition laws.</p>\n<p>In a statement attributed to UK public policy manager, Karim Palant, the company told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We share the Committee\u2019s concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence.</p>\n<p>We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee\u2019s recommendation for electoral law reform. But we\u2019re not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for 7 years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.</p>\n<p>We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.</p>\n<p>While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last fall Facebook was issued the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/uk-watchdog-hands-facebook-500k-fine/\">maximum possible fine</a>\u00a0under relevant UK data protection law for failing to safeguard user data from Cambridge Analytica saga. Although it is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/21/facebook-appeals-uk-data-watchdogs-500k-cambridge-analytica-fine/\">appealing the ICO\u2019s penalty</a>, claiming there\u2019s no evidence UK users\u2019 data got misused.</p>\n<p>During the course of a multi-month enquiry last year\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/fake-news-17-19/\">investigating disinformation and fake news</a>, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee heard from 73 witnesses in 23 oral evidence sessions, as well as taking in 170 written submissions. In all the committee says it posed more than 4,350 questions.</p>\n<p>Its wide-ranging, 110-page report makes detailed observations on a number of technologies and business practices across the social media, adtech and strategic communications space, and culminates in a long list of recommendations for policymakers and regulators \u2014 reiterating its call for tech platforms to be made legally liable for content.</p>\n<p>Among the report\u2019s main recommendations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear legal liabilities for tech companies to act against \u201charmful or illegal content\u201d, with the committee calling for a compulsory Code of Ethics overseen by a independent regulatory with statutory powers to obtain information from companies; instigate legal proceedings and issue (\u201clarge\u201d) fines for non-compliance</li>\n<li>privacy law protections to cover inferred data so that models used to make inferences about individuals are clearly regulated under UK data protection rules</li>\n<li>a levy on tech companies operating in the UK to support enhanced regulation of such platforms</li>\n<li>a call for the ICO to investigate Facebook\u2019s platform practices and use of user data</li>\n<li>a call for the Competition Markets Authority to comprehensively \u201caudit\u201d the online advertising ecosystem, and also to investigate whether Facebook specifically has engaged in anti-competitive practices</li>\n<li>changes to UK election law to take account of digital campaigning, including \u201cabsolute transparency of online political campaigning\u201d \u2014 including \u201cfull disclosure of the targeting used\u201d \u2014 and more powers for the Electoral Commission</li>\n<li>a call for a government review of covert digital influence campaigns by foreign actors (plus a review of legislation in the area to consider if it\u2019s adequate) \u2014 including the committee urging the government to launch independent investigations of recent past elections to examine\u00a0\u201cforeign influence, disinformation, funding, voter manipulation, and the sharing of data, so that appropriate changes to the law can be made and lessons can be learnt for future elections and referenda\u201d</li>\n<li>a requirement on social media platforms to develop tools to distinguish between \u201cquality journalism\u201d and low quality content sources, and/or work with existing providers to make such services available to users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Among the areas the committee\u2019s report covers off with detailed commentary are data use and targeting; advertising and political campaigning \u2014 including foreign influence; and digital literacy.</p>\n<p>It\u00a0argues that regulation is urgently needed to restore democratic accountability and \u201cmake sure the people stay in charge of the machines\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cProtecting our data helps us secure the past, but protecting inferences and uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is what we will need to protect our future,\u201d the committee warns.</p>\n<p>Ministers are due to produce a White Paper on social media safety regulation this winter and the committee writes that it hopes its recommendations will inform government thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch has been said about the coarsening of public debate, but when these factors are brought to bear directly in election campaigns then the very fabric of our democracy is threatened,\u201d says the committee. \u201cThis situation is unlikely to change. What does need to change is the enforcement of greater transparency in the digital sphere, to ensure that we know the source of what we are reading, who has paid for it and why the information has been sent to us. We need to understand how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data.\u201d</p>\n<p>The report calls for tech companies to be regulated as a new category, \u201cnot necessarily either a \u2018platform\u2019 or a \u2018publisher\u201d, but which legally tightens their liability for harmful content published on their platforms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/social-media-should-have-duty-of-care-towards-kids-uk-mps-urge/\">Last month</a> another UK parliamentary committee also urged the government to place a legal \u2018duty of care\u2019 on platforms to protect users under the age of 18. The government said then that it has not ruled out doing so.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve reached out to the DCMS for a response to the latest committee report.\u00a0<strong>Update:\u00a0</strong>A department spokesperson told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Government\u2019s forthcoming White Paper on Online Harms will set out a new framework for ensuring disinformation is tackled effectively, while respecting freedom of expression and promoting innovation.</p>\n<p>This week the Culture Secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues.</p>\n<p>We welcome this report\u2019s contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the UK the safest place to be online. We will respond in due course.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>\u201cDigital gangsters\u201d</h2>\n<p>Competition concerns are also raised several times by the committee.</p>\n<p>\u201cCompanies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like \u2018digital gangsters\u2019 in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,\u201d the DCMS committee writes, going on to urge the government to<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0investigate whether Facebook specifically has been involved in\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">any anti-competitive practices and conduct a review of its business practices\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">towards other developers \u201cto decide whether Facebook is unfairly using its dominant\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">market position in social media to decide which businesses should succeed or fail\u201d.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThe big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,\u201d it adds.</p>\n<p>The committee suggests existing legal tools are up to the task of reining in platform power, citing privacy laws, data protection legislation, antitrust and competition law \u2014 and calling for a \u201ccomprehensive audit\u201d of the social media advertising market by the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, and a specific antitrust probe of Facebook\u2019s business practices.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf companies become monopolies they can be broken up, in whatever sector,\u201d the committee points out. \u201cFacebook\u2019s handling of personal data, and its use for political campaigns, are prime and legitimate areas for inspection by regulators, and it should not be able to evade all editorial responsibility for the content shared by its users across its platforms.\u201d</p>\n<p>The social networking giant was the recipient of many awkward queries during the course of the committee\u2019s enquiry but it refused repeated requests for its founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify \u2014 sending a number of lesser staffers in his stead.</p>\n<p>That decision continues to be seized upon by the committee as evidence of a lack of democratic accountability. It also accuses Facebook of having an intentionally \u201copaque management structure\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy choosing not to appear before the Committee and by choosing not to respond personally to any of our invitations, Mark Zuckerberg has shown contempt towards both the UK Parliament and the \u2018International Grand Committee\u2019, involving members from nine legislatures from around the world,\u201d the committee writes.</p>\n<div>\u201cThe management structure of Facebook is opaque to those outside the business\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">and this seemed to be designed to conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">decisions.

So even if a user set their profile to private, installed apps would still be able to access information. After 2012, Facebook added platform controls and made privacy controls applicable to apps. However, there were \u2018whitelisted\u2019 apps that could still access user data without permission and which, according to Ashkan Soltani, could access friends\u2019 data for nearly a decade before that time. Apps were able to circumvent users\u2019 privacy of platform settings and access friends\u2019 information, even when the user disabled the Platform. This was an example of Facebook\u2019s business model driving privacy violations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Facebook is singled out for the most eviscerating criticism in the report (and targeted for specific investigations), the committee\u2019s long list of recommendations are addressed at social media businesses and online advertisers generally.</p>\n<p>It also calls for far more transparency from platforms, writing that: \u201cSocial media companies need to be more transparent about their own sites, and how they work. Rather than hiding behind complex agreements, they should be informing users of how their sites work, including curation functions and the way in which algorithms are used to prioritise certain stories, news and videos, depending on each user\u2019s profile. The more people know how the sites work, and how the sites use individuals\u2019 data, the more informed we shall all be, which in turn will make choices about the use and privacy of sites easier to make.\u201d</p>\n<p>The committee also urges a raft of updates to UK election law \u2014 branding it \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d in the digital era.</p>\n<p>Its interim report, published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/30/fake-news-inquiry-calls-for-social-media-levy-to-defend-democracy/\">last summer</a>, made many of the same recommendations.</p>\n<h2>Russian interest</h2>\n<p>But despite pressing the government for urgent action there was only a cool response from ministers then, with the government remaining tied up trying to shape a response to the 2016 Brexit referendum vote which split the country (with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/its-official-brexit-campaign-broke-the-law-with-social-medias-help/\">social media\u2019s election-law-deforming help</a>). Instead it opted for a \u2018<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/fake-news-threat-to-democracy-gets-back-burner-response-from-uk-govt/\">wait and see</a>\u2018 approach.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The government accepted just three of the preliminary report\u2019s forty-two recommendations outright, and fully rejected four. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Nonetheless, the committee has doubled down on its preliminary conclusions, reiterating earlier recommendations and pushing the government once again to act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">It cites fresh evidence, including from additional testimony, as well as pointing to other reports (such as the recently published\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-cairncross-review-a-sustainable-future-for-journalism\">Cairncross Review</a>) which it argues back up some of the conclusions reached.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><u></u>\u201cOur inquiry over the last year has identified three big threats to our society. The challenge for the year ahead is to start to fix them; we cannot delay any longer,\u201d writes Damian Collins MP and chair of the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">DCMS</span>\u00a0Committee, in a statement. \u201cDemocracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised \u2018dark adverts\u2019 from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.</p>\n<p class=\"m_-6925419690342602897Default\"><u></u><u></u><u></u>\u201cThe big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.\u00a0<u></u><u></u><u></u>Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"m_-6925419690342602897Default\"><u></u><u></u><u></u>\u201cThese are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission.\u00a0<u></u><u></u><u></u>We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p class=\"m_-6925419690342602897Default\">\u201cThe age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end. The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator.\u201d</p>\n<p>The committee says it expects the government to respond to its recommendations within two months \u2014 noting rather dryly:\u00a0\u201cWe hope that this will be much more comprehensive, practical, and constructive than their response to the Interim Report, published in October 2018. Several of our recommendations were not substantively answered and there is now an urgent need for the Government to respond to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>It also makes a point of including an analysis of Internet traffic to the government\u2019s own response to its preliminary report last year \u2014 in which it highlights a \u201chigh proportion\u201d of online visitors hailing from Russian cities including Moscow and Saint Petersburg\u2026</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1784706\" style=\"width: 644px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1784706\" class=\"wp-image-1784706 size-large\" height=\"628\" sizes=\"(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?w=634\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=300,297 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=128,128 128w\" width=\"634\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1784706\">Source: Web and publications unit, House of Commons</p></div></p>\n<p>\u201cThis itself demonstrates the very clear interest from Russia in what we have had to say\u00a0about their activities in overseas political campaigns,\u201d the committee remarks, criticizing the government response to its preliminary report for claiming there\u2019s no evidence of \u201csuccessful\u201d Russian interference in UK elections and democratic processes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is surely a sufficient matter of concern that the Government has acknowledged that interference has occurred, irrespective of the lack of evidence of impact. The Government should be conducting analysis to understand the extent of Russian targeting of voters during elections,\u201d it adds.</p>\n<h2>Three senior managers knew</h2>\n<p>Another interesting tidbit from the report is confirmation that the ICO has shared the names of three \u201csenior managers\u201d at Facebook who knew about the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"cambridge-analytica\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge Analytica <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> data breach prior to the first press report in December 2015 \u2014 which is the date Facebook has repeatedly told the committee was when it first learnt of the breach, contradicting what the ICO found via its own investigations.</p>\n<p>The committee\u2019s report does not disclose the names of the three senior managers \u2014 saying the ICO has asked the names to remain confidential (we\u2019ve reached out to the ICO to ask why it is not making this information public) \u2014 and implies the execs did not relay the information to Zuckerberg.</p>\n<p>The committee dubs this as an example of \u201ca profound failure\u201d of internal governance, also branding it as evidence of \u201cfundamental weakness\u201d in how Facebook manages its responsibilities to users.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the committee\u2019s account of that detail:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were keen to know when and which people working at Facebook first knew about\u00a0the GSR/Cambridge Analytica breach. The ICO confirmed, in correspondence with the Committee, that three \u201csenior managers\u201d were involved in email exchanges earlier in\u00a02015 concerning the GSR breach before December 2015, when it was first reported by The\u00a0Guardian. At the request of the ICO, we have agreed to keep the names confidential,\u00a0but it would seem that this important information was not shared with the most senior\u00a0executives at Facebook, leading us to ask why this was the case.</p>\n<p>The scale and importance of the GSR/Cambridge Analytica breach was such that its occurrence should have been referred to Mark Zuckerberg as its CEO immediately. The fact that it was not is evidence that Facebook did not treat the breach with the seriousness it merited. It was a profound failure of governance within Facebook that its CEO did not\u00a0know what was going on, the company now maintains, until the issue became public to us\u00a0all in 2018. The incident displays the fundamental weakness of Facebook in managing its responsibilities to the people whose data is used for its own commercial interests.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responding to the full report in a statement, UK information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The DCMS inquiry has been vital to understanding the increasingly complex era of digital political campaigning, big data and disinformation online and we have welcomed the opportunity to contribute to it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re pleased with the committee\u2019s support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning. The ICO\u2019s investigations into these areas continue and we\u2019ll be reviewing the full report with interest.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also support the report\u2019s references to the growing public debate on internet harms. Personal data, and its use for all forms of micro-targeting, is central to the work of the ICO. We welcome the debate on how best to protect people online and we look forward to the proposals in the Government\u2019s online harms white paper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This report was updated with comment from Facebook, the UK government and the ICO</em></p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n<input class=\"shortlink\" readonly=\"\" title=\"Article Shortlink\" type=\"text\" value=\"\"/>\n</footer>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div><!-- end React-root duplication div -->\n</div><!--end #root-->\n<noscript style=\"display:none;\">\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&amp;ev=PageView&amp;noscript=1\" width=\"1\"/>\n</noscript>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t// Configure the PARSELY window global to disable auto-tracking.\n\t\t// Must load before the Parse.ly script itself.\n\t\twindow.PARSELY = {\n\t\t\tautotrack: false,\n\t\t\tonload:    this.onload,\n\t\t};\n\t</script>\n<script data-parsely-site=\"techcrunch.com\" id=\"parsely-cfg\" src=\"//d1z2jf7jlzjs58.cloudfront.net/keys/techcrunch.com/p.js\"></script>\n<!-- JSON-LD -->\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n\t\t{\"@context\":\"http:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"TechCrunch\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"imageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/themes\\/techcrunch-2017\\/images\\/logo-json-ld.png\",\"width\":\"600\",\"height\":\"60\"}},\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/02\\/17\\/uk-parliament-calls-for-antitrust-data-abuse-probe-of-facebook\\/\"},\"headline\":\"UK parliament calls for antitrust, data abuse probe of Facebook\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2018\\/04\\/gettyimages-944363556.jpeg?w=680\",\"width\":680,\"height\":459},\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-18T00:01:25+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2019-02-18T11:39:45+00:00\",\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Natasha Lomas\"}],\"description\":\"A final report by a British parliamentary committee which spent months last year investigating online political disinformation makes very uncomfortable reading for Facebook &#8212; with the company singled out for &#8220;disingenuous&#8221; and &#8220;bad faith&#8221; responses to democratic concerns about the misuse of people&#8217;s data.

developers and advertisers in order to increase revenue and\\/or usage of its own platform; and examined what Facebook claimed as &#8216;abuse&#8217; of its platform by the disgraced (and now <a

But we&#8217;re not waiting.

In all the committee says it posed more than 4,350 questions.<\\/p>\\n<p>Its wide-ranging, 110-page report makes detailed observations on a number of technologies and business practices across the social media, adtech and strategic communications space, and culminates in a long list of recommendations for policymakers and regulators &#8212; reiterating its call for tech platforms to be made legally liable for content.<\\/p>\\n<p>Among the report&#8217;s main recommendations are:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>clear legal liabilities for tech companies to act against &#8220;harmful or illegal content&#8221;, with the committee calling for a compulsory Code of Ethics overseen by a independent regulatory with statutory powers to obtain information from companies; instigate legal proceedings and issue (&#8220;large&#8221;) fines for non-compliance<\\/li>\\n<li>privacy law protections to cover inferred data so that models used to make inferences about individuals are clearly regulated under UK data protection rules<\\/li>\\n<li>a levy on tech companies operating in the UK to support enhanced regulation of such platforms<\\/li>\\n<li>a call for the ICO to investigate Facebook&#8217;s platform practices and use of user data<\\/li>\\n<li>a call for the Competition Markets Authority to comprehensively &#8220;audit&#8221; the online advertising ecosystem, and also to investigate whether Facebook specifically has engaged in anti-competitive practices<\\/li>\\n<li>changes to UK election law to take account of digital campaigning, including &#8220;absolute transparency of online political campaigning&#8221; &#8212; including &#8220;full disclosure of the targeting used&#8221; &#8212; and more powers for the Electoral Commission<\\/li>\\n<li>a call for a government review of covert digital influence campaigns by foreign actors (plus a review of legislation in the area to consider if it&#8217;s adequate) &#8212; including the committee urging the government to launch independent investigations of recent past elections to examine\\u00a0&#8220;foreign influence, disinformation, funding, voter manipulation, and the sharing of data, so that appropriate changes to the law can be made and lessons can be learnt for future elections and referenda&#8221;<\\/li>\\n<li>a requirement on social media platforms to develop tools to distinguish between &#8220;quality journalism&#8221; and low quality content sources, and\\/or work with existing providers to make such services available to users<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p>Among the areas the committee&#8217;s report covers off with detailed commentary are data use and targeting; advertising and political campaigning &#8212; including foreign influence; and digital literacy.<\\/p>\\n<p>It\\u00a0argues that regulation is urgently needed to restore democratic accountability and &#8220;make sure the people stay in charge of the machines&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Protecting our data helps us secure the past, but protecting inferences and uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is what we will need to protect our future,&#8221; the committee warns.<\\/p>\\n<p>Ministers are due to produce a White Paper on social media safety regulation this winter and the committee writes that it hopes its recommendations will inform government thinking.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Much has been said about the coarsening of public debate, but when these factors are brought to bear directly in election campaigns then the very fabric of our democracy is threatened,&#8221; says the committee. &#8220;This situation is unlikely to change. What does need to change is the enforcement of greater transparency in the digital sphere, to ensure that we know the source of what we are reading, who has paid for it and why the information has been sent to us. We need to understand how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The report calls for tech companies to be regulated as a new category, &#8220;not necessarily either a &#8216;platform&#8217; or a &#8216;publisher&#8221;, but which legally tightens their liability for harmful content published on their platforms.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/01\\/31\\/social-media-should-have-duty-of-care-towards-kids-uk-mps-urge\\/\\\">Last month<\\/a> another UK parliamentary committee also urged the government to place a legal &#8216;duty of care&#8217; on platforms to protect users under the age of 18.

So even if a user set their profile to private, installed apps would still be able to access information. After 2012, Facebook added platform controls and made privacy controls applicable to apps. However, there were \\u2018whitelisted\\u2019 apps that could still access user data without permission and which, according to Ashkan Soltani, could access friends\\u2019 data for nearly a decade before that time. Apps were able to circumvent users\\u2019 privacy of platform settings and access friends\\u2019 information, even when the user disabled the Platform. This was an example of Facebook\\u2019s business model driving privacy violations.<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>While Facebook is singled out for the most eviscerating criticism in the report (and targeted for specific investigations), the committee&#8217;s long list of recommendations are addressed at social media businesses and online advertisers generally.<\\/p>\\n<p>It also calls for far more transparency from platforms, writing that: &#8220;Social media companies need to be more transparent about their own sites, and how they work.

The ICO confirmed, in correspondence with the Committee, that three \\u201csenior managers\\u201d were involved in email exchanges earlier in\\u00a02015 concerning the GSR breach before December 2015, when it was first reported by The\\u00a0Guardian. At the request of the ICO, we have agreed to keep the names confidential,\\u00a0but it would seem that this important information was not shared with the most senior\\u00a0executives at Facebook, leading us to ask why this was the case.<\\/p>\\n<p>The scale and importance of the GSR\\/Cambridge Analytica breach was such that its occurrence should have been referred to Mark Zuckerberg as its CEO immediately. The fact that it was not is evidence that Facebook did not treat the breach with the seriousness it merited. It was a profound failure of governance within Facebook that its CEO did not\\u00a0know what was going on, the company now maintains, until the issue became public to us\\u00a0all in 2018. The incident displays the fundamental weakness of Facebook in managing its responsibilities to the people whose data is used for its own commercial interests.<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Responding to the full report in a statement, UK information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The DCMS inquiry has been vital to understanding the increasingly complex era of digital political campaigning, big data and disinformation online and we have welcomed the opportunity to contribute to it.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We\\u2019re pleased with the committee\\u2019s support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning. The ICO\\u2019s investigations into these areas continue and we\\u2019ll be reviewing the full report with interest.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We also support the report\\u2019s references to the growing public debate on internet harms.

people\u2019s data.</p> <p>In the report, <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.pdf\">published today</a>, the committee has also called for Facebook\u2019s use of user data to be investigated by the UK\u2019s data watchdog.</p> <p>In an evidence session to the committee\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/facebook-must-change-and-policymakers-must-act-on-data-warns-uk-watchdog/\">late last year</a>, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) suggested Facebook needs to change its business model \u2014 warning the company risks burning user trust for good.</p> <p>Last summer the ICO also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/\">called for an ethical pause of social media ads</a> for election campaigning, warning of the risk of developing \u201ca system of voter surveillance by default\u201d.</p> <p>The UK parliamentary enquiry looked into both Facebook\u2019s own use of personal data to further its business interests, such as by providing access to users\u2019 data to developers and advertisers in order to increase revenue and/or usage of its own platform; and examined what Facebook claimed as \u2018abuse\u2019 of its platform by the disgraced (and now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/cambridge-analytica-shuts-down/\">defunct</a>) political data company Cambridge Analytica \u2014 which in 2014 paid a developer with access to Facebook\u2019s developer platform to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">extract information on millions of Facebook users</a> in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/heres-cambridge-analyticas-plan-for-voters-facebook-data/\">build voter profiles to try to influence elections</a>.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s conclusion about Facebook\u2019s business is a damning one with the company accused of operating a business model that\u2019s predicated on selling abusive access to people\u2019s data.</p> <p>\u201c<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Far from\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Facebook acting against \u201csketchy\u201d or \u201cabusive\u201d apps, of which action it has produced no\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">evidence at all, it, in fact, worked with such apps as an intrinsic part of its business model,\u201d the committee argues. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">This explains why it recruited the people who created them, such as Joseph Chancellor [the co-founder of GSR, the developer which sold Facebook user data to Cambridge

style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">believe, lapsed into \u201cPR crisis mode\u201d, when its real business model was exposed. </span></p> <p>\u201cThis\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">is just one example of the bad faith which we believe justifies governments holding a\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">business such as Facebook at arms\u2019 length. It seems clear to us that Facebook acts only\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">when serious breaches become public. This is what happened in 2015 and 2018.\u201d</span></p> <p>\u201cWe consider that data transfer for value is Facebook\u2019s business model and that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"mark-zuckerberg\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> statement that \u2018we\u2019ve never sold anyone\u2019s data\u201d is simply untrue\u2019,\u201d the committee also concludes.</p> <p>We\u2019ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the committee\u2019s report.\u00a0<strong>Update:\u00a0</strong>Facebook said it rejects all claims it breached data protection and competition laws.</p> <p>In a statement attributed to UK public policy manager, Karim Palant, the company told us:</p> <p>We share the Committee\u2019s concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months, answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence.</p> <p>We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee\u2019s recommendation for electoral law reform. But we\u2019re not waiting. We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised, state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for 7 years. No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do.</p> <p>We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.</p> <p>While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago. We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.</p> <p>Last fall Facebook was issued the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/uk-watchdog-hands-facebook-500k-fine/\">maximum possible fine</a>\u00a0under relevant UK data protection law for failing to safeguard user data from Cambridge Analytica saga. Although it is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/21/facebook-appeals-uk-data-watchdogs-500k-cambridge-analytica-fine/\">appealing the ICO\u2019s penalty</a>, claiming there\u2019s no evidence UK users\u2019 data got misused.</p> <p>During the course of a multi-month enquiry last year\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/fake-news-17-19/\">investigating disinformation and fake news</a>, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee heard from 73 witnesses in 23 oral evidence sessions, as well as taking in 170 written submissions. In all the committee says it posed more than 4,350 questions.</p> <p>Its wide-ranging, 110-page report makes detailed observations on a number of technologies and business practices across the social media, adtech and strategic communications space, and culminates in a long list of recommendations for policymakers and regulators \u2014 reiterating its call for tech platforms to be made legally liable for content.</p> <p>Among the report\u2019s main recommendations are:</p> <p>Among the areas the committee\u2019s report covers off with detailed commentary are data use and targeting; advertising and political campaigning \u2014 including foreign influence; and digital literacy.</p> <p>It\u00a0argues that regulation is urgently needed to restore democratic accountability and \u201cmake sure the people stay in charge of the machines\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cProtecting our data helps us secure the past, but protecting inferences and uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is what we will need to protect our future,\u201d the committee warns.</p> <p>Ministers are due to produce a White Paper on social media safety regulation this winter and the committee writes that it hopes its recommendations will inform government thinking.</p> <p>\u201cMuch has been said about the coarsening of public debate, but when these factors are brought to bear directly in election campaigns then the very fabric of our democracy is threatened,\u201d says the committee. \u201cThis situation is unlikely to change. What does need to change is the enforcement of greater transparency in the digital sphere, to ensure that we know the source of what we are reading, who has paid for it and why the information has been sent to us. We need to understand how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data.\u201d</p> <p>The report calls for tech companies to be regulated as a new category, \u201cnot necessarily either a \u2018platform\u2019 or a \u2018publisher\u201d, but which legally tightens their liability for harmful content published on their platforms.</p> <p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/social-media-should-have-duty-of-care-towards-kids-uk-mps-urge/\">Last month</a> another UK parliamentary committee also urged the government to place a legal \u2018duty of care\u2019 on platforms to protect users under the age of 18. The government said then that it has not ruled out doing so.</p> <p>We\u2019ve reached out to the DCMS for a response to the latest committee report.\u00a0<strong>Update:\u00a0</strong>A department spokesperson told us:</p> <p>The Government\u2019s forthcoming White Paper on Online Harms will set out a new framework for ensuring disinformation is tackled effectively, while respecting freedom of expression and promoting innovation.</p> <p>This week the Culture Secretary will travel to the United States to meet with tech giants including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple to discuss many of these issues.</p> <p>We welcome this report\u2019s contribution towards our work to tackle the increasing threat of disinformation and to make the UK the safest place to be online. We will respond in due course.</p> <p>Competition concerns are also raised several times by the committee.</p> <p>\u201cCompanies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like \u2018digital gangsters\u2019 in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,\u201d the DCMS committee writes, going on to urge the government to<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0investigate whether Facebook specifically has been involved in\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">any anti-competitive practices and conduct a review of its business practices\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">towards other developers \u201cto decide whether Facebook is unfairly using its dominant\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">market position in social media to decide which businesses should succeed or fail\u201d.\u00a0</span></p> <p>\u201cThe big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,\u201d it adds.</p> <p>The committee suggests existing legal tools are up to the task of reining in platform power, citing privacy laws, data protection legislation, antitrust and competition law \u2014 and calling for a \u201ccomprehensive audit\u201d of the social media advertising market by the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, and a specific antitrust probe of Facebook\u2019s business practices.</p> <p>\u201cIf companies become monopolies they can be broken up, in whatever sector,\u201d the committee points out. \u201cFacebook\u2019s handling of personal data, and its use for political campaigns, are prime and legitimate areas for inspection by regulators, and it should not be able to evade all editorial responsibility for the content shared by its users across its platforms.\u201d</p> <p>The social networking giant was the recipient of many awkward queries during the course of the committee\u2019s enquiry but it refused repeated requests for its founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify \u2014 sending a number of lesser staffers in his stead.</p> <p>That decision continues to be seized upon by the committee as evidence of a lack of democratic accountability. It also accuses Facebook of having an intentionally \u201copaque management structure\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBy choosing not to appear before the Committee and by choosing not to respond personally to any of our invitations, Mark Zuckerberg has shown contempt towards both the UK Parliament and the \u2018International Grand Committee\u2019, involving members from nine legislatures from around the world,\u201d the committee writes.</p> <p>It doubles down on the accusation that Facebook sought to deliberately mislead its enquiry \u2014 pointing to incorrect and/or inadequate responses from staffers who did testify.</p> <p>\u201cWe are left with the impression that either [policy VP] Simon Milner and [CTO] <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/what-we-learned-from-facebooks-latest-data-misuse-grilling/\">Mike Schroepfer</a> deliberately misled the Committee or they were deliberately not briefed by senior executives at Facebook about the extent of Russian interference in foreign elections,\u201d it suggests.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/25/uk-parliament-seizes-cache-of-internal-facebook-documents-to-further-privacy-probe/\">unusual move late last year</a> the committee used rare parliamentary powers to seize a cache of documents related to an active US lawsuit against Facebook filed by an app developer called Six4Three.</p> <p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/seized-cache-of-facebook-docs-raise-competition-and-consent-questions/\">Seized cache of Facebook docs raise competition and consent questions</a></p> <p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nv8ypSXjMS\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/seized-cache-of-facebook-docs-raise-competition-and-consent-questions/embed/#?secret=nv8ypSXjMS\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"\u201cSeized cache of Facebook docs raise competition and consent questions\u201d \u2014 TechCrunch\" width=\"800\"></iframe></p> <p>The cache of documents is referenced extensively in the final report, and appears to have fuelled antitrust concerns, with the committee arguing that the evidence obtained from the internal company documents \u201cindicates that Facebook was willing to override its users\u2019 privacy settings in order to transfer data to some app developers, to charge high prices in advertising to some developers, for the exchange of that data, and to starve some developers\u2026 of that data, thereby causing them to lose their business\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems clear that Facebook was, at the very least, in violation of its Federal Trade Commission [privacy] settlement,\u201d the committee also argues, citing evidence from the former chief technologist of the FTC,\u00a0<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"ashkan-soltani\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/ashkan-soltani\" target=\"_blank\">Ashkan Soltani <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.</p> <p>On Soltani\u2019s evidence, it writes:</p> <p>Ashkan Soltani rejected [Facebook\u2019s] claim, saying that up until 2012, platform controls did not exist, and privacy controls did not apply to apps. So even if a user set their profile to private, installed apps would still be able to access information. After 2012, Facebook added platform controls and made privacy controls applicable to apps. However, there were \u2018whitelisted\u2019 apps that could still access user data without permission and which, according to Ashkan Soltani, could access friends\u2019 data for nearly a decade before that time. Apps were able to circumvent users\u2019 privacy of platform settings and access friends\u2019 information, even when the user disabled the Platform. This was an example of Facebook\u2019s business model driving privacy violations.</p> <p>While Facebook is singled out for the most eviscerating criticism in the report (and targeted for specific investigations), the committee\u2019s long list of recommendations are addressed at social media businesses and online advertisers generally.</p> <p>It also calls for far more transparency from platforms, writing that: \u201cSocial media companies need to be more transparent about their own sites, and how they work. Rather than hiding behind complex agreements, they should be informing users of how their sites work, including curation functions and the way in which algorithms are used to prioritise certain stories, news and videos, depending on each user\u2019s profile. The more people know how the sites work, and how the sites use individuals\u2019 data, the more informed we shall all be, which in turn will make choices about the use and privacy of sites easier to make.\u201d</p> <p>The committee also urges a raft of updates to UK election law \u2014 branding it \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d in the digital era.</p> <p>Its interim report, published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/30/fake-news-inquiry-calls-for-social-media-levy-to-defend-democracy/\">last summer</a>, made many of the same recommendations.</p> <p>But despite pressing the government for urgent action there was only a cool response from ministers then, with the government remaining tied up trying to shape a response to the 2016 Brexit referendum vote which split the country (with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/its-official-brexit-campaign-broke-the-law-with-social-medias-help/\">social media\u2019s election-law-deforming help</a>). Instead it opted for a \u2018<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/fake-news-threat-to-democracy-gets-back-burner-response-from-uk-govt/\">wait and see</a>\u2018 approach.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The government accepted just three of the preliminary report\u2019s forty-two recommendations outright, and fully rejected four. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Nonetheless, the committee has doubled down on its preliminary conclusions, reiterating earlier recommendations and pushing the government once again to act. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">It cites fresh evidence, including from additional testimony, as well as pointing to other reports (such as the recently published\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-cairncross-review-a-sustainable-future-for-journalism\">Cairncross Review</a>) which it argues back up some of the conclusions reached.\u00a0</span></p> <p><u></u>\u201cOur inquiry over the last year has identified three big threats to our society. The challenge for the year ahead is to start to fix them; we cannot delay any longer,\u201d writes Damian Collins MP and chair of the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">DCMS</span>\u00a0Committee, in a statement. \u201cDemocracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised \u2018dark adverts\u2019 from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.</p> <p class=\"m_-6925419690342602897Default\"><u></u><u></u><u></u>\u201cThe big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.\u00a0<u></u><u></u><u></u>Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.\u201d</p> <p class=\"m_-6925419690342602897Default\"><u></u><u></u><u></u>\u201cThese are issues that the major tech companies are well aware of, yet continually fail to address. The guiding principle of the \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 culture often seems to be that it is better to apologise than ask permission.\u00a0<u></u><u></u><u></u>We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,\u201d he added.</p> <p class=\"m_-6925419690342602897Default\">\u201cThe age of inadequate self-regulation must come to an end. The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator.\u201d</p> <p>The committee says it expects the government to respond to its recommendations within two months \u2014 noting rather dryly:\u00a0\u201cWe hope that this will be much more comprehensive, practical, and constructive than their response to the Interim Report, published in October 2018. Several of our recommendations were not substantively answered and there is now an urgent need for the Government to respond to them.\u201d</p> <p>It also makes a point of including an analysis of Internet traffic to the government\u2019s own response to its preliminary report last year \u2014 in which it highlights a \u201chigh proportion\u201d of online visitors hailing from Russian cities including Moscow and Saint Petersburg\u2026</p> <p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1784706\" style=\"width: 644px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1784706\" class=\"wp-image-1784706 size-large\" height=\"628\" sizes=\"(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?w=634\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=300,297 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-17-at-19.30.11.png?resize=128,128 128w\" width=\"634\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1784706\">Source: Web and publications unit, House of Commons</p></div></p> <p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1784706\">Source: Web and publications unit, House of Commons</p> <p>\u201cThis itself demonstrates the very clear interest from Russia in what we have had to say\u00a0about their activities in overseas political campaigns,\u201d the committee remarks, criticizing the government response to its preliminary report for claiming there\u2019s no evidence of \u201csuccessful\u201d Russian interference in UK elections and democratic processes.</p> <p>\u201cIt is surely a sufficient matter of concern that the Government has acknowledged that interference has occurred, irrespective of the lack of evidence of impact. The Government should be conducting analysis to understand the extent of Russian targeting of voters during elections,\u201d it adds.</p> <p>Another interesting tidbit from the report is confirmation that the ICO has shared the names of three \u201csenior managers\u201d at Facebook who knew about the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"cambridge-analytica\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge Analytica <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> data breach prior to the first press report in December 2015 \u2014 which is the date Facebook has repeatedly told the committee was when it first learnt of the breach, contradicting what the ICO found via its own investigations.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s report does not disclose the names of the three senior managers \u2014 saying the ICO has asked the names to remain confidential (we\u2019ve reached out to the ICO to ask why it is not making this information public) \u2014 and implies the execs did not relay the information to Zuckerberg.</p> <p>The committee dubs this as an example of \u201ca profound failure\u201d of internal governance, also branding it as evidence of \u201cfundamental weakness\u201d in how Facebook manages its responsibilities to users.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the committee\u2019s account of that detail:</p> <p>We were keen to know when and which people working at Facebook first knew about\u00a0the GSR/Cambridge Analytica breach. The ICO confirmed, in correspondence with the Committee, that three \u201csenior managers\u201d were involved in email exchanges earlier in\u00a02015 concerning the GSR breach before December 2015, when it was first reported by The\u00a0Guardian. At the request of the ICO, we have agreed to keep the names confidential,\u00a0but it would seem that this important information was not shared with the most senior\u00a0executives at Facebook, leading us to ask why this was the case.</p> <p>The scale and importance of the GSR/Cambridge Analytica breach was such that its occurrence should have been referred to Mark Zuckerberg as its CEO immediately. The fact that it was not is evidence that Facebook did not treat the breach with the seriousness it merited. It was a profound failure of governance within Facebook that its CEO did not\u00a0know what was going on, the company now maintains, until the issue became public to us\u00a0all in 2018. The incident displays the fundamental weakness of Facebook in managing its responsibilities to the people whose data is used for its own commercial interests.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responding to the full report in a statement, UK information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said:</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The DCMS inquiry has been vital to understanding the increasingly complex era of digital political campaigning, big data and disinformation online and we have welcomed the opportunity to contribute to it.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re pleased with the committee\u2019s support of our recommendation for a statutory code that will clarify how personal data should be used during political campaigning. The ICO\u2019s investigations into these areas continue and we\u2019ll be reviewing the full report with interest.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also support the report\u2019s references to the growing public debate on internet harms. Personal data, and its use for all forms of micro-targeting, is central to the work of the ICO.

Moral Catastrophes, Should Society Hire Lots of Philosophers?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>In June, I wrote a post arguing that future generations might find our generation <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/will-future-generations-find-us.html\">especially morally loathsome</a>, even if we don't ourselves feel like we are morally that bad.  (By \"we\" I mean typical highly educated, middle-class people in Western democracies.) <b> We might be committing morally grievous wrongs</b> -- atrocities on par with the wrong that we now see in race-based slavery or the Holocaust or bloody wars of conquest -- <b>without (most of us) recognizing how morally terrible we're being.</b><p>\n\nIn <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10214679985105858\">Facebook discussion</a>, Kian MW pointed me to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10677-015-9567-7\">a fascinating article</a> by Evan G. Williams, which makes a similar point and adds the further thought, bound to be attractive to many philosophers, that <b>the proper response to such a concern is to hire lots of philosophers</b>.<p>\n\nOkay, hiring lots of philosophers isn't the <i>only </i>remedy Williams suggests, and he doesn't phrase his recommendation in quite that way.  What he says with that we need to dedicate substantial societal resources to (1) identifying our moral wrongdoing and to (2) creating social structures to implement major changes in light of those moral discoveries.  Identifying our moral wrongdoing will require progress, Williams says, both in moral theory and in related applied fields.  (For example, progress in animal ethics requires progress both in moral theory and in relevant parts of biology.)  Williams' call for dedicating substantial resources toward making progress in moral theory <i>seems </i>like a call for society to hire many more philosophers, though I suppose there are a variety of ways that he could disavow that implication if he cared to do so.<p>\n\nThe annual U.S. military budget is about $700 billion.  Suppose that President Trump and his allies in Congress, inspired by Williams' article, decided to divert 2% of U.S military spending toward identifying our society's moral wrongdoing, with half of that 2% going to ethicists and the other half to other relevant disciplines.  Assuming that the annual cost of employing a philosopher is $150,000 (about half salary, about half benefits and indirect costs), the resulting <b>$7 billion could hire about 50,000 ethicists.</b><p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nat5KmrBiQM/W3R4WJCqE2I/AAAAAAAABAI/ZKxHsUxK9fMNn-du_e2GfinlxGV6EL3GACLcBGAs/s1600/EmptyChairsPhilosophy.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"357\" data-original-width=\"635\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nat5KmrBiQM/W3R4WJCqE2I/AAAAAAAABAI/ZKxHsUxK9fMNn-du_e2GfinlxGV6EL3GACLcBGAs/s320/EmptyChairsPhilosophy.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[With 50,000 more ethicists, <a href=\"http://observer.com/2017/07/why-the-us-doesnt-understand-chinese-thought-and-must-xenophobia-confucius-xo-jinping-higher-education/\">these empty chairs</a> could be filled!]<p>\n\nTwo percent of the military budget seems like a small expenditure to substantially reduce the risk that we unwittingly perpetrate the moral equivalent of institutionalized slavery or the Holocaust, don't you think?   A B2 bomber costs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit\">about $1-$2 billion</a>.  The U.S. government might want to consider a few bomber-for-philosopher swaps.<p>\n\nI write this partly in jest of course, but also partly seriously.  If society invested more in moral philosophy -- and it needn't be a whole lot more, compared to the size of military budgets -- and if society took the results of that investment seriously, giving its philosophers prestige, attention, and policy influence, we might be morally far better off as a people.<p>\n\nWe <i>might</i>.  But I also think about <b>the ancient Athenians, the ancient Chinese, and the early 20th-century Germans.</b>  Despite the flourishing of philosophy in these times and places, the cultures did not appear to avoid moral catastrophe: The ancient Athenians were slave-owners who engaged in military conquest and genocide (perhaps even more than their neighbors, if we're grading on a curve), the flourishing of philosophy in ancient China coincided with the moral catastrophe of the period of the Warring States, and the Germans perpetrated the Holocaust and helped initiate World War II (with some of the greatest philosophers, including Heidegger and Frege, on the nationalistic, anti-Semitic, political right).<p>\n\nNow maybe these societies would have produced even worse moral catastrophes if philosophers had not also been flourishing in them, but I see no particular reason to think so.  <b>If there's a correlation between the flourishing of philosophy and the perpetration of social evil, the relationship appears to be, if anything, <i>positive</i>.</b>  This observation fits with my general concerns about the <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-often-do-ethics-professors-call-their-mothers\">not-very-moral behavior of professional ethicists</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">philosophers' apparent skill at post-hoc rationalization</a>.<p>\n\nI'm not sure how skeptical to be.  I hesitate to suggest that a massive infusion of social capital into philosophical ethics <i>couldn't</i> have a large positive impact on the moral choices we as a society make.  It might be truly awesome and transformative, if done in the right way.

Genocide and civilian-slaughtering aggressive warfare are now widely considered to be among the evilest things people can do, yet they appear to be celebrated in the Bible (especially Deuteronomy and Joshua) and we still name children after Alexander \"the Great\".  Many seemingly careful thinkers, including notoriously Aristotle and Locke, wrote justifications of slavery.  Much of the world has only recently opened its eyes to the historically common oppression of women, homosexuals, low-status workers, people with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.<p>\n\nWe probably haven't reached the end of moral change.  In a few centuries, people might look back on our current norms with the same mix of appreciation and condemnation that we now look back on ethical norms common in Warring States China and Early Modern Europe.<p>\n\nIndeed, future generations might find our generation to be <i>especially vividly</i> loathsome, since we are the first generation creating an extensive video record of our day-to-day activities.<p>\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to know, in the abstract, that Rousseau fathered five children with a lover he regarded as too dull-witted to be worth attempting to formally educate, and that he demanded against her protests that their children be sent to (possibly very <a href=\"http://www.pobronson.com/factbook/pages/204.html\">high mortality</a>) orphanages [see esp. <i>Confessions,</i> Book VII].   It would be quite another if we had baby pictures and video of Rousseau's interactions with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se.  It's one thing to know, in the abstract, that Aristotle had a wife and a life of privilege.  It would be quite another to watch video of him proudly enacting sexist and classist values we now find vile.  Future generations that detest our sexual practices, or our consumerism, or our casual destruction of the environment, or our neglect of the sick and elderly, might be especially horrified to view these practices in vivid detail.<p>\n\nBy \"we\" and \"our\" practices and values, I mean the typical practices and values of highly educated readers from early 21st-century democracies -- the notional readership of this blog.  Maybe climate change proves to be catastrophic: Crops fail, low-lying cities are flooded, a billion desperate people are displaced or malnourished and tossed into war.  Looking back on video of a philosopher of our era proudly stepping out of his shiny, privately-owned minivan, across his beautiful irrigated lawn in the summer heat, into his large chilly air-conditioned house, maybe wearing a leather hat, maybe sharing McDonald's ice-cream cones with his kids -- looking back, that is, on what I (of course this is me) think of as a lovely family moment -- might this seem to some future Bangladeshi philosopher as vividly disgusting as I suspect I would find Aristotle's treatment of Greek slaves?<p>\n\n#<p>\n\nIf we are currently at the moral pinnacle, any change in future values will be a change for the worse.  Future generations might condemn our mixing of the races, for example.  They might be disgusted to see pictures of interracial couples walking together in public and raising their mixed-race children.  Or they might condemn us for clothing customs that they come to view as obscene.  However, I feel comfortable saying that they'd be wrong to condemn us, if those were the reasons why.<p>\n\nBut it seems unlikely that we are at the pinnacle; and thus it seems likely that future generations might have some excellent moral reason to condemn us.  More likely than our being at the moral pinnacle, it seems to me, is that either (a.) there has been a slow trajectory toward better values over the centuries (as <a href=\"https://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature\">argued by Steven Pinker</a>) and that the trajectory will continue, or alternatively that (b.) shifts in value are more or less a random walk up, down, and sideways, in which case it would be unlikely chance if we happened to be at the peak right now.  I am assuming here the same kind of non-relativism that most people assume in condemning Nazism and in thinking that it constitutes genuine moral progress to recognize the equal moral status of women and men.<p>\n\n(To someone who endorses most of the widely-shared values of their group it is almost just analytically the case that they will see their group's values as the peak.  Suppose you endorse the mainstream values in your group -- values A, B, C, D, E, and F.  Elsewhere, the mainstream values might instead be A, not-B, D, E, F and G, or A, C, not-D, not-E, H and I.  Of course it will seem to you that you're the group that got it right -- exactly A, B, C, D, E, and F!  It will seem to you that changes from past values have been good, and the likely future rejection of your values will be mistaken.  This is basically the old man's \"kids these days!\" complaint, writ large.)<p>\n\nI worry then, that we might be in a situation similar to Aristotle's: horribly wrong (most of us) on some really important moral issues, though it doesn't <i>feel </i>like we're wrong, and although we think we are applying our excellent minds excellently to the matter, with wisdom and good sense.  I worry that we, or I, might be using philosophy to justify the 21st-century college-educated North American's moral equivalent of keeping slaves, oppressing women, and launching genocidal war.<p>\n\nIs there some way of gaining insight into this possibility?  Some way to get a temperature reading, so to speak, on our unrecognized evil?<p>\n\nHere's one thing I don't think will work: Rely on the ethical reasoning of the highest status philosophers in our society.  If you've read any of my work on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html\">Kant's applied ethics</a>, German <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/12/nazi-philosophers.html\">philosophers' failure to reject Nazism</a>, and <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-often-do-ethics-professors-call-their-mothers\">the morality of ethics professors</a>, you'll know why I say this.<p>\n\n#<p>\n\nI'd suggest, or at least I'd hope, that if future generations rightly condemn us, it won't be for something we'd find incomprehensible.  It won't be because we sometimes chose blue shirts over red ones or because we like to smile at children.  It will be for things that we already have an inkling might be wrong, and which some people do already condemn as wrong.  As Michele Moody-Adams emphasizes in her discussion of slavery and cultural relativism (<a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674007949\">Moody-Adams 1997</a>, ch. 2), in every slave culture there were always <i>some </i>voices condemning the injustice of slavery -- among them, typically, the slaves themselves -- and it required a kind of affected ignorance to disregard those voices.  As a clue to our own evil, we might look to minority moral opinions in our own culture.<p>\n\nI tend to disagree with those minority opinions.  I tend to think that the behavior of my social group is more or less fine, or at least <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">forgivably mediocre</a>.  If someone advances a minority ethical view I disagree with, I'm philosopher enough to concoct some superficially plausible defenses.  What I worry is that a properly situated observer might recognize those defenses to be no better than <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-1935-preface-to-kant-studien.html\">Hans Heyse's defense of Nazism</a> or <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html\">Kant's critique of masturbation</a>.<p>\n\nMoody-Adams suggests that we can begin to transcend our cultural and historical moral boundaries though moral reflection and moral imagination.  In the epilogue of her 1997 book, she finds hope in the kind of moral reflection that involves self-scrutiny, vivid imagination, a wide-ranging contact with other disciplines and traditions, a recognition of minority voices, and serious engagement with the concrete details of everyday moral inquiry.<p>\n\nHey, that sounds pretty good!  I'll put, or try to put, my hopes there too.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/will-future-generations-find-us.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-06-29T07:06:00-07:00\">7:06 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7274983487992563100\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, June 01, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6688053486474536756\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/does-it-harm-philosophy-as-discipline.html\">Does It Harm Philosophy as a Discipline to Discuss the Apparently Meager Practical Effects of Studying Ethics?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I've done a lot of empirical work on the apparently meager practical effects of studying philosophical ethics.  Although most philosophers seem to view my work either neutrally or positively, or have concerns about the empirical details of this or that study, others react quite negatively to the whole project, more or less in principle.<p>\n\nAbout a month ago on Facebook, <a href=\"http://samrickless.com/\">Samuel Rickless</a> did such a nice job articulating some general concerns (see his comment on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10214223222607081\">this public post</a>) that I thought I'd quote his comments here and share some of my reactions.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qoHvKKHU3g/WxFX5nlo1KI/AAAAAAAAA1k/Mz41tMXygJsV7PTMLjuwcydr2sEfcI9MQCLcBGAs/s1600/Boethius_initial_consolation_philosophy.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"599\" data-original-width=\"785\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qoHvKKHU3g/WxFX5nlo1KI/AAAAAAAAA1k/Mz41tMXygJsV7PTMLjuwcydr2sEfcI9MQCLcBGAs/s320/Boethius_initial_consolation_philosophy.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n<i>First, My Research:<p></p></i>\n\n* In a series of studies published from 2009 to 2014, mostly in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.stetson.edu/other/faculty/profiles/joshua-rust.php\">Joshua Rust</a> (and summarized <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">here</a>), I've empirically explored the moral behavior of ethics professors.  As far as I know, no one else had ever systematically examined this question.  <b>Across 17 measures of (arguably) moral behavior,</b> ranging from rates of charitable donation to staying in contact with one's mother to vegetarianism to littering to responding to student emails to peer ratings of overall moral behavior, <b>I have found not a single main measure on which ethicists appeared to act morally better than comparison groups of other professors</b>; nor do they appear to behave better overall when the data are merged meta-analytically.  (Caveat: on some secondary measures we found ethicists to behave better.  However, on other measures we found them to behave worse, with no clearly interpretable overall pattern.)<p>\n\n* In a pair of studies with <a href=\"https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/fiery-cushman\">Fiery Cushman</a>, published in <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">2015</a>, I've found that <b>philosophers, including professional ethicists, seem to be no less susceptible than non-philosophers to apparently irrational order effects and framing effects in their evaluation of moral dilemmas</b>.<p>\n\n* More recently, I've turned my attention to philosophical pedagogy.  In an <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsClasses.htm\">unpublished critical review from 2013</a>, I found <b>little good empirical evidence that business ethics or medical ethics instruction has any practical effect on student behavior</b>.  I have been following up with some empirical research of my own with several different collaborators.  None of it is complete yet, but preliminary results tend to confirm the lack of practical effect, except perhaps when there's the right kind of narrative or emotional engagement.  On grounds of armchair plausibility, I tend to favor multi-causal, canceling explanations over the view that philosophical reflection is simply inert (<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.643.9791\">contra </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777\">Jon Haidt</a>); thus I'm inclined to explore how backfire effects might on average tend to cancel positive effects.  It was a post on the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/04/three-ways-your-ethics-class-might.html\">possible backfire effects of teaching ethics</a> that prompted Rickless's comment.<p>\n<i>Rickless's Objection:</i></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n(shared with permission, adding lineation and emphasis for clarity)<p>\n\nRickless: And I\u2019ll be honest, Eric, all this stuff about how unethical ethicists are, and how counterproductive their courses might be, really bothers me. It\u2019s not that I think that ethics courses can\u2019t be improved or that all ethicists are wonderful people. But please understand that the takeaway from this kind of research and speculation, as it will likely be processed by journalists and others who may well pick up and run with it, will be that philosophers are shits whose courses turn their students into shits. And this may lead to the defunding of philosophy, the removal of ethics courses from business school, and, to my mind, a host of other consequences that are almost certainly far worse than the ills that you are looking to prevent.<p>\n\nSchwitzgebel: Samuel, I understand that concern. You might be right about the effects. However, I also think that if it is correct that ethics classes as standardly taught have little of the positive effect that some administrators and students hope for from them, we as a society should know that. It should be explored in a rigorous way. On the possibly bright side, a new dimension of my research is starting to examine conditions under which teaching does have a positive measurable effect on real-world behavior. I am hopeful that understanding that better will lead us to teach better.<p>\n\nRickless: In theory, what you say about knowing that courses have little or no positive effect makes sense. But in practice, I have the following concerns.<p>\n\nFirst, <b>no set of studies could possibly measure all the positive and negative effects</b> of teaching ethics this way or that way. You just can\u2019t control all the potentially relevant variables, in part because you don\u2019t know what all the potentially relevant variables are, in part because you can\u2019t fix all the parameters with only one parameter allowed to vary.<p>\n\nSecond, you need to be thinking very seriously about whether your own motives (particularly motives related to bursting bubbles and countering conventional wisdom) are playing a role in your research, because those motives can have unseen effects on the way that research is conducted, as well as the conclusions drawn from it. I am not imputing bad motives to you. Far from it, and quite the opposite. But I think that <b>all researchers, myself included, want their research to be striking and interesting, sometimes surprising</b>.<p>\n\nThird, <b>the tendency of researchers is to draw conclusions that go beyond the actual evidence</b>.<p>\n\nFourth, the combination of all these factors leads to <b>conclusions that have a significant likelihood of being mistaken</b>.<p>\n\nFifth, <b>those conclusions will likely be taken much more seriously by the powers-that-be</b> than by the researchers themselves. All the qualifiers inserted by researchers are usually removed by journalists and administrators.<p>\n\nSixth, <b>the consequences on the profession if negative results are taken seriously by persons in positions of power will be dire</b>.<p>\n\nUnder the circumstances, <b>it seems to me that research that is designed to reveal negative facts about the way things are taught had better be airtight before being publicized</b>. The problem is that there is no such research. This doesn\u2019t mean that there is no answer to problems of ineffective teaching. But that is an issue for another day.<p>\n<i>My Reply:</i><p>\n<i>On the issue of motives:</i> Of course it is fun to have striking research!  Given my <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/SelfUcs.htm\">general skepticism about self-knowledge</a>, including of motives, I won't attempt self-diagnosis.  However, I will say that except for recent studies that are not yet complete, I have published every empirical study I've done on this topic, with no file-drawered results.  I am not selecting only the striking material for publication.  Also, in my recent pedagogy research I am collaborating with other researchers who very much hope for positive results.<p>\n<b>On the likelihood of being mistaken:</b> I acknowledge that any one study is likely to be mistaken.  However, my results are pretty consistent across a wide variety of methods and behavior types, including some issues specifically chosen with the thought that they might show ethicists in a good light (the charity and vegetarianism measures in <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2012.727135\">Schwitzgebel and Rust 2014</a>).  I think this adds to credibility, though it would be better if other researchers with different methods and theoretical perspectives attempted to confirm or disconfirm our findings.  There is currently <a href=\"https://osf.io/35r48/\">one replication attempt</a> ongoing among German-language philosophers, so we will see how that plays out!<p>\n<b>On whether the powers-that-be will take the conclusions more seriously than the researchers:</b> I interpret Rickless here as meaning that they will tend to remove the caveats and go for the sexy headline.  I do think that is possible.  One potentially alarming fact from this point of view is that my most-cited and seemingly best-known study is the only study where I found ethicists seeming to behave worse than the comparison groups: the <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsBooks.htm\">study of missing library books</a>.  However, it was also my first published study on the topic, so I don't know to what extent the extra attention is a primacy effect.<p>\n<b>On possibly dire consequences:</b> The most likely path for dire consequences seems to me to be this: Part of the administrative justification for requiring ethics classes might be the implicit expectation that university-level ethics instruction positively influences moral behavior.  If this expectation is removed, so too is part of the administrative justification for ethics instruction.<p>\n\nRickless's conclusion appears to be that no empirical research on this topic, with negative or null results, should be published unless it is \"airtight\", and that it is practically impossible for such research to be airtight.  From this I infer that <b>Rickless thinks either that (a.) only positive results should be published</b>, while negative or null results remain unpublished because inevitably not airtight, <b>or that (b.) no studies of this sort should be published at all, whether positive, negative, or null</b>.<p>\n\nRickless's argument has merit, and I see the path to this conclusion.  Certainly there is a risk to the discipline in publishing negative or null results, and one ought to be careful.<p>\n\nHowever, both (a) and (b) seem to be bad policy.<p>\n<b>On (a): To think that only positive results should be published</b> (or more moderately that we should have a much higher bar for negative or null results than for positive ones) <b>runs contrary to the standards of open science</b> that have recently received so much attention in the social psychology <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis\">replication crisis</a>.  In the long run it is probably contrary to the interests of science, philosophy, and society as a whole for us to pursue a policy that will create an illusory disproportion of positive research.<p>\n\nThat said, there is a much more moderate strand of (a) that I could endorse: Being cautious and sober about one's research, rather than yielding to the temptation to inflate dubious, sexy results for the sake of publicity.  I hope that in my own work I generally meet this standard, and I would recommend that same standard for both positive <i>and </i>negative or null research.<p>\n<b>\nOn (b): It seems at least as undesirable to discourage all empirical research on these topics.</b>  Don't we want to know the relationship between philosophical moral reflection and real-world moral behavior?  Even if you think that studying the behavior of professional ethicists in particular is unilluminating, surely studying the effects of philosophical pedagogy is worthwhile.  We should want to know what sorts of effects our courses have on the students who take them and under what conditions -- <i>especially </i>if part of the administrative justification for requiring ethics courses is the assumption that they do have a practical effect.  To reject the whole enterprise of empirically researching the effects of studying philosophy because there's a risk that some studies will show that studying philosophy has little practical impact on real-world choices -- that seems radically antiscientific.<p>\n\nRickless raises legitimate worries.  I think the best practical response is more research, by more research groups, with open sharing of results, and open discussions of the issue by people working from a wide variety of perspectives.  In the long run, I hope that some of my null results can lay the groundwork for a fuller understanding of the moral psychology of philosophy.  Understanding the range of conditions under which philosophical moral reflection does and does not have practical effects on real-world behavior should ultimately empower rather than disempower philosophy as a discipline.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Boethius_initial_consolation_philosophy.jpg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/does-it-harm-philosophy-as-discipline.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-06-01T08:05:00-07:00\">8:05 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6688053486474536756\" onclick=\"\">13\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, May 24, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6688353768388452914\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/05/an-argument-against-every-single.html\">An Argument Against Every General Theory of Consciousness</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>As a philosophical expert on theories of consciousness, I try to keep abreast of the most promising recent theories.  I also sometimes receive unsolicited emails from scholars who have developed a theory that they believe deserves attention.  It's fun to see the latest cleverness, and it's my job to do so, but I always know in advance that I won't be convinced.<p>\n\nI'd like to hope that it's not just that I'm a dogmatic skeptic about general theories of consciousness.  In \"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">The Crazyist Metaphysics of Mind</a>\", I argue that our epistemic tools for evaluating general theories of consciousness are, for the foreseeable future, too flimsy for the task, since all evaluations of such theories must be grounded in some combination of dubious (typically question-begging) scientific theory, dubious commonsense judgment (shaped by our limited social and evolutionary history), and broad criteria of general theoretical virtue like simplicity or elegance (typically indecisive among theories that are live competitors).<p>\n\nToday, let me try another angle.  Ultimately, it's a version of my question-beggingness complaint, but more specific.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eA5dFICqkOY/Wv9ZRqxBxII/AAAAAAAAB_Q/a23kK-8sIDIbWmue2UXXZw7pm-XYLJdQACLcBGAs/s1600/800px-Mandelbrot_Islands_of_Consciousness.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"600\" data-original-width=\"800\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eA5dFICqkOY/Wv9ZRqxBxII/AAAAAAAAB_Q/a23kK-8sIDIbWmue2UXXZw7pm-XYLJdQACLcBGAs/s200/800px-Mandelbrot_Islands_of_Consciousness.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n<b>Premise 1: There is no currently available decisive argument against panpsychism,</b> the view that <i>everything </i>is conscious, even very simple things, like solitary hydrogen ions in deep space.  Panpsychism is, of course, bizarrely contrary to common sense, but (as I also argue in The Crazyist Metaphysics of Mind) all well-developed general theories of consciousness will have some features that are bizarrely contrary to common sense, so although violation of common sense is a cost that creates an explanatory burden, it is not an insurmountable theory-defeater.  Among prominent researchers who defend panpsychism or at least treat seriously a view in the neighborhood of panpsychism are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23165867\">Giulio Tononi</a>, <a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/panpsychism.pdf\">David Chalmers</a>, <a href=\"https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/consciousness-and-its-place-in-nature-does-physicalism-entail-panpsychism/\">Galen Strawson</a>, and <a href=\"https://aeon.co/ideas/panpsychism-is-crazy-but-its-also-most-probably-true\">Philip Goff</a>.<p>\n\nThere are at least three reasons to take panpsychism seriously.  (1.) If, as some have argued, consciousness is a fundamental feature of the world, or a property not reducible to other properties, it would be unsurprising if such a feature were approximately as widespread as other fundamental features such as mass and charge.  (2.) Considering the complexity of our experience (e.g., our visual experience) and the plausibly similar complexity of the experience of other organisms with sophisticated sensory systems, one might find oneself on a slippery slope toward thinking that the least complex experience would be possessed by very simple entities indeed (see Chalmers 1996, p 293-7, for a nice exposition of this argument).  (3.) Despite my <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/07/tononis-exclusion-postulate-would-make.html\">qualms about Integrated Information Theory</a>, there's an attractive theoretical elegance to the idea that consciousness arises from the integration of information, and thus that very simple systems that integrate just a tiny bit of information will correspondingly have just a tiny bit of consciousness.<p>\n<b>Premise 2: There is no currently available decisive argument against theories of consciousness that require sophisticated self-representation of the sort that is likely to be absent from entities that lack theories of mind.</b>  On extreme versions of this view, even dogs and infants might not have conscious experience.  (Again, highly contrary to common sense, but!)  Among prominent researchers who have taken such a view seriously are <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Kinds_Of_Minds.html?id=nrtchsJKQeAC\">Daniel Dennett</a> and <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Phenomenal_Consciousness.html?id=AdfsTPNZjeEC\">Peter Carruthers</a> (though <a href=\"http://faculty.philosophy.umd.edu/pcarruthers/Comp%20psych%20without%20consciousness.pdf\">recently</a> Carruthers has suggested that there might be no fact of the matter about the phenomenal consciousness, or not, of non-human animals).<p>\n\nThere are at least three reasons to take seriously such a restrictive view of consciousness: (1.) If one wants to exit the slippery slope to panpsychism, one possibly attractive place to do so is at the gap between creatures who are capable of explicitly representing their own mental states and those that cannot do so.  (2.) Consciousness, as was noted by <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brentano/\">Franz Brentano</a> (and recently emphasized by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Mind-David-Rosenthal/dp/0198236964\">David Rosenthal</a>, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/subjective-consciousness-9780199570355?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Uriah Kriegel</a>, and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-higher/\">others</a>), might plausibly always involve some sort of self-awareness of the fact that one is conscious -- apparently a moderately sophisticated self-representational capacity of some sort.  (3.) There's a theoretical elegance to self-representational theories of consciousness.  If consciousness doesn't just always arise when information is integrated in a system, an attractive explanation of what else is needed is some sort of sophisticated ability of a system to represent its own representational states.<p>\n\nNow you might understandably think that either panpsychism or a human-only views of consciousness is so extreme that we can be epistemically justified in confidently rejecting one or the other.  If so, <b>we can run the argument with weaker versions of Premise 1 and/or Premise 2:</b><p>\n<b>Premise 1a (weaker): There is no currently available decisive argument against theories of consciousness that treat consciousness as very widespread</b>, including perhaps in organisms with fairly small and simple brains, or in some near-future AI systems.<p>\n<b>Premise 2a (weaker): There is no currently available decisive argument against theories of consciousness that treat consciousness as narrowly restricted to a class of fairly sophisticated entities,</b> perhaps only mammals and birds and similar organisms capable of complex, flexible learning, and no AI systems in the foreseeable future.<p>\n<b>Premise 3: All general theories of consciousness commit to the falsity of either Premise 1, Premise 2, or both</b> (alternatively Premise 1a, Premise 2a, or both).  If they do not so commit, then they aren't <i>general </i>theories of consciousness, though they may of course be perfectly fine narrow theories of consciousness, e.g., theories of consciousness as it happens to arise in human beings.  (I've got a parallel argument against general theories of consciousness even as they apply just to human beings, based on considerations from <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh6.htm\">Schwitzgebel 2011, ch. 6</a>, but not today.)<p>\n<b>Therefore, all general theories of consciousness commit to the falsity of some view against which there is no currently available decisive argument.</b>  They thereby commit beyond the evidence.  They must either assume, or accept on only indecisive evidence, either the falsity of panpsychism, or the falsity of sophisticated self-representational views of consciousness, or both.  In other words, they inevitably beg the question against, or at best indecisively argue against, some views we cannot yet justifiably reject.<p>\n\nStill, go ahead and build your theory of consciousness.  You might even succeed in building the <i>true </i>theory of consciousness, if it isn't yet out there!  Science and philosophy needs bold theoretical adventurers.  But if a skeptic on the sidelines remains unconvinced, thinking that you have not convincingly dispatched some possible alternative approaches, the skeptic will probably be right.<p>\n\nETA: In order to constitute an argument against a candidate theory, as opposed to merely an objection to such theories, perhaps I need to put some weight on the positive arguments in favor of views of consciousness that conflict with the theory being defended.  Thanks to David Chalmers and Francois Kammerer on Facebook for pushing me on this point.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mandelbrot_Islands_of_Consciousness.jpg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/05/an-argument-against-every-single.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-05-24T06:17:00-07:00\">6:17 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6688353768388452914\" onclick=\"\">26\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, May 01, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3583391191092944421\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/05/please-rate-my-blog-posts-for-inclusion.html\">Please Rate My Blog Posts for Inclusion in My Next Book</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I'm working away on selecting and revising blog posts and op-eds for my next book.

Ellis</a>; originally appeared at the <a href=\"http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\">Imperfect Cognitions blog</a>)<p>\n\nLast week we <a href=\"http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence_13.html\">argued</a> that your intelligence, vigilance, and academic expertise very likely doesn't do much to protect you from the normal human tendency towards rationalization \u2013 that is, from the tendency to engage in biased patterns of reasoning aimed at justifying conclusions to which you are attracted for selfish or other epistemically irrelevant reasons \u2013 and that, in fact, you may be more susceptible to rationalization than the rest of the population. This week we\u2019ll argue that moral and philosophical topics are especially fertile grounds for rationalization.<p>\n\nHere\u2019s one way of thinking about it: Rationalization, like crime, requires a motive and an opportunity. Ethics and philosophy provide plenty of both.<p>\n\nRegarding motive: Not everyone cares about every moral and philosophical issue of course. But we all have some moral and philosophical issues that are near to our hearts \u2013 for reasons of cultural or religious identity, or personal self-conception, or for self-serving reasons, or because it\u2019s comfortable, exciting, or otherwise appealing to see the world in a certain way.<p>\n\nOn day one of their philosophy classes, students are often already attracted to certain types of views and repulsed by others. They like the traditional and conservative, or they prefer the rebellious and exploratory; they like confirmations of certainty and order, or they prefer the chaotic and skeptical; they like moderation and common sense, or they prefer the excitement of the radical and unintuitive. Some positions fit with their pre-existing cultural and political identities better than others. Some positions are favored by their teachers and elders \u2013 and that\u2019s attractive to some, and provokes rebellious contrarianism in others. Some moral conclusions may be attractively convenient, while others might require unpleasant contrition or behavior change. <p>\n\nThe motive is there. So is the opportunity. Philosophical and moral questions rarely admit of straightforward proof or refutation, or a clear standard of correctness. Instead, they open into a complexity of considerations, which themselves do not admit of straightforward proof and which offer many loci for rationalization.<p>\n\nThese loci are so plentiful and diverse! Moral and philosophical arguments, for instance, often turn crucially on a \u201csense of plausibility\u201d (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-4975.00010\">Kornblith, 1999</a>); or on one\u2019s judgment of the force of a particular reason, or the significance of a consideration. Methodological judgments are likewise fundamental in philosophical and moral thinking: What argumentative tacks should you first explore? How much critical attention should you pay to your pre-theoretic beliefs, and their sources, and which ones, in which respects? How much should you trust your intuitive judgments versus more explicitly reasoned responses? Which other philosophers, and which scientists (if any), should you regard as authorities whose judgments carry weight with you, and on which topics, and how much?<p>\n\nThese questions are usually answered only implicitly, revealed in your choices about what to believe and what to doubt, what to read, what to take seriously and what to set aside. Even where they are answered explicitly, they lack a clear set of criteria by which to answer them definitively. And so, if people\u2019s preferences can influence their perceptual judgments (including possibly of size, color, and distance: Balcetis and Dunning <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014288\">2006</a>, <a href=\"https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/cognitive-dissonance-and-the-perception-of-natural-environments\">2007</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20424036\">2010</a>) what is remembered (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2270237\">Kunda 1990</a>; <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6983.html\">Mele 2001</a>), what hypotheses are envisioned (<a href=\"https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/social-hypothesis-testing-cognitive-and-motivational-mechanisms\">Trope and Liberman 1997</a>), what one attends to and for how long (<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.1743&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Lord et al. 1979</a>; <a href=\"http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/nickersonConfirmationBias.pdf\">Nickerson 1998</a>) . . . it is no leap to assume that they can influence the myriad implicit judgments, intuitions, and choices involved in moral and philosophical reasoning.<p>\n\nFurthermore, patterns of bias can compound across several questions, so that with many loci for bias to enter, the person who is only slightly biased in each of a variety of junctures in a line of reasoning can ultimately come to a very different conclusion than would someone who was not biased in the same way. Rationalization can operate by way of a series or network of \u201cmicro-instances\u201d of motivated reasoning that together have a major amplificatory effect (synchronically, diachronically, or both), or by influencing you mightily at a crucial step (Ellis, manuscript). <p>\n\nWe believe that these considerations, taken together with the considerations we advanced last week about the likely inability of intelligence, vigilance, and expertise to effectively protect us against rationalization, support the following conclusion: Few if any of us should confidently maintain that our moral and philosophical reasoning is not substantially tainted by significant, epistemically troubling degrees of rationalization. This is of course one possible explanation of the seeming intractability of philosophical disagreement.<p>\n\nOr perhaps we the authors of the post are the ones rationalizing; perhaps we are, for some reason, drawn toward a certain type of pessimism about the rationality of philosophers, and we have sought and evaluated evidence and arguments toward this conclusion in a badly biased manner? Um\u2026. No way. We have reviewed our reasoning and are sure that we were not affected by our preferences....<p>\n\nFor our full-length paper on this topic, see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-02-22T08:00:00-08:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=364696833183407405\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/epistemology\" rel=\"tag\">epistemology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, January 30, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5249383903914778016\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-philosophical-overton-window.html\">The Philosophical Overton Window?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ysa6sGj78TU/Wm_E1L4vh9I/AAAAAAAAApM/NqFCk_BJ0D8mZNzHa5NqwY2dM4buDs4yACLcBGAs/s1600/Overton.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"676\" data-original-width=\"390\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ysa6sGj78TU/Wm_E1L4vh9I/AAAAAAAAApM/NqFCk_BJ0D8mZNzHa5NqwY2dM4buDs4yACLcBGAs/s200/Overton.jpg\" width=\"115\"/></a></div><p>\n\nIt seems like I've been <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/298417-the-overton-window-and-how-trump-won-the-nomination\">hearing</a> a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/12/21/16806676/strikethrough-how-trump-overton-window-extreme-normal\">lot</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/therachelmaddowshow/videos/10153296546394067\">recently</a> about the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window\">Overton Window</a>\" in politics.  The idea is that there's a range of normal policy positions (within the window), which a politician can be adopt without being regarded as radical or extreme; and then there are radical or extreme positions, outside of the window.  Over time, what is within the window can change.  Gay marriage, for example, was outside of the window in U.S. politics in the 1980s, then entered the window in the 1990s or early 2000s.<p>\n<b>A common thought is that one way to move the window is to prominently voice a position so extreme that a somewhat less extreme position seems moderate in comparison, and perhaps enters the window</b>.  After Bernie Sanders starts saying \"free college education for everyone!\", maybe \"only\" offering $10,000 toward every student's tuition no longer seems extreme.<p>\n\nBefore going further, a big heaping caveat.

(See also <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/138003/flaws-overton-window-theory\">Laura Marsh</a>'s discussion.)<p>\n\nStill, the idea has some theoretical appeal.  Might it capture some of the dynamics in philosophy?<p>\n\nFor it to work, first we'd need some sense of what positions qualify as extreme and what positions qualify as moderate in a philosophical cultural context.  Then we'd need some way of measuring (through citations?) the increasing visibility of an extreme position and see if that opens up \"moderate\" philosophers to positions that they might previously have regarded as too extreme.<p>\n\nHere's one possibility: <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/\">Panpsychism</a> is the view that everything in the universe is conscious, even elementary particles.  Generally, it's regarded as an extreme position.  However, it has recently been <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Its-Place-Nature-Physicalism/dp/1845400593/\">gaining</a> <a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/panpsychism.pdf\">visibility</a>.  If the Overton Window idea is correct, then we might expect some formerly \"extreme\" positions in that direction, but not as extreme as panpsychism, to come to seem less extreme or maybe even moderate.<p>\n\nHmmmmm.  I'm not sure it's so.  A couple of obvious candidates are <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">group consciousness</a> and <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/plant-thinking/9780231161251\">plant cognition</a>.  These would seem to be less extreme positions in the same direction as panpsychism, since instead of ascribing mind or consciousness to <i>everything</i>, they extend it to a only limited range of things that aren't usually regarded as having mental lives.  If the Overton Window idea is right, then, given the increasing visibility of radical panpsychism, group consciousness and plant cognition will come to seem less extreme than they previously were.<p>\n\nHard to tell if that's true.  Both positions are probably more popular now than they were 15 years ago (in academic Anglophone philosophy), but they'd still probably be considered extreme.<p>\n\nEh.  You know what?  My heart isn't in it.  I'm too bummed about the Glenn Beck thing.  I wanted this to be an idea with a more solid scholarly foundation.<p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37831314\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-philosophical-overton-window.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-01-30T07:55:00-08:00\">7:55 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5249383903914778016\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">psychology of philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/skepticism\" rel=\"tag\">skepticism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, October 12, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8885703485699254055\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/truth-dare-and-wonder.html\">Truth, Dare, and Wonder</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>According to Nomy Arpaly and Zach Barnett, <a href=\"https://theviewfromtheowlsroost.com/2017/09/28/philosophy-truth-or-dare\">some philosophers prefer Truth and others prefer Dare</a>.  I love the distinction.  It helps us see an important dynamic in the field.  But it's not exhaustive.  I think there are also Wonder philosophers.<p>\n\nAs I see the distinction, Truth philosophers sincerely aim to present the philosophical truth as they see it.  They tend to prefer modest, moderate, and commonsensical positions.  They tend to recognize the substantial truth in multiple different perspectives (at least once they've been around long enough to see the flaws in their youthful enthusiasms), and thus tend to prefer multidimensionality and nuance.  <b>Truth philosophers would rather be boring and right than interesting and wrong.</b><p>\n<b>Dare philosophers reach instead for the bold and unusual.</b>  They want to explore the boundaries of what can be defended.  They're happy for the sake of argument to champion unusual positions that they might not fully believe, if those positions are elegant, novel, fun, contrarian, or if they think the positions have more going for them than is generally recognized.  Dare philosophers sometimes treat philosophy like a game in which the ideal achievement is the breathtakingly clever defense of a position that others would have thought to be patently absurd.<p>\n\nThere's a familiar dynamic that arises from their interaction.  The Dare philosopher ventures a bold thesis, cleverly defended.  (\"Possible worlds really exist!\", \"All matter is conscious!\", \"We're morally obliged to let humanity go extinct!\")  If the defense is clever enough, so that a substantial number of readers are tempted to think \"Wait, could that really be true?  What <i>exactly </i>is wrong with the argument?\" then the Truth philosopher steps in.  The Truth philosopher finds the holes and presuppositions in the argument, or at least tries to, and defends a more seemingly sensible view.<p>\n\nThis Dare-and-Truth dynamic is central to the field and good for its development.  Sometimes there's more truth in the Dare positions than one would have thought, and without the Dare philosophers out there pushing the limits, seeing what can be said in defense of the seemingly absurd, then as a field we wouldn't appreciate those positions as vividly as we might.  Also, I think, there's something intrinsically valuable about exploring the boundaries of philosophical defensibility, even if the positions explored turn out to be flatly false.  It's part of the magnificent glory of life on Earth that we have fiendishly clever panpsychists and modal realists in our midst.<p>\n\nNow consider Wonder.<p>\n\nWhy study philosophy?  I mean at a personal level.  Personally, what do you find cool, interesting, or rewarding about philosophy?  One answer is Truth: Through philosophy, you discover answers to some of the profoundest and most difficult questions that people can pose.  Another answer is Dare: It's fun to match wits, push arguments, defend surprising theses, win the argumentative game (or at least play to a draw) despite starting from a seemingly indefensible position.  Both of those motivations speak to me somewhat.  But I think what really delights me more than anything else in philosophy is its capacity to upend what I think I know, its capacity to call into question what I previously took for granted, its capacity to cast me into doubt, confusion, and wonder.<p>\n<b>Unlike the Dare philosopher, the Wonder philosopher is guided by a norm of sincerity and truth.  It's not primarily about matching wits and finding clever arguments.  Unlike the Truth philosopher, the Wonder philosopher has an affection for the strange and seemingly wrong</b> -- and is willing to push wild theses to the extent they suspect that those theses, wonderfully, surprisingly, <i>might </i>be true.<p>\n\nBut in the Dare-and-Truth dynamic of the field, the Wonder philosopher can struggle to find a place.  Bold Dare articles and sensible Truth articles both have a natural home in the journals.  But \"whoa, I wonder if this weird thing might be true?\" is a little harder to publish.<p>\n\nProbably no one is pure Truth, pure Dare, or pure Wonder.  We're all a mix of the three, I suspect.  Thus, one approach is to leave Wonder out of your research profile: Find the Truth, where you can, publish that, and leave Wonder for your classroom teaching and private reading.  Defend the existence of moderate naturalistically-grounded moral truths in your published papers; read Zhuangzi on the side.<p>\n\nStill, there are a few publishing strategies for Wonder philosophers.  Here are four:<p>\n\n(1.) Find a Dare-like position that you really do sincerely endorse on reflection, and defend that -- optionally with some explicit qualifications indicating that you are exploring it only as a possibility.<p>\n\n(2.) Explicitly argue that we should invest a small but non-trivial credence in some Dare-like position -- for example, because the Truth-type arguments against it aren't fully compelling.<p>\n\n(3.) Find a Truth-like view that generates Wonder if it's true.  For example, defend some form of doubt about philosophical method or about the extent of our self-knowledge.  Defend the position on sensible, widely acceptable grounds; and then sensibly argue that one possible consequence is that we don't know some of the things that we normally take for granted that we do know.<p>\n\n(4.) Write about historical philosophers with weird and wonderful views.  This gives you a chance to explore the Wonderful without committing to it.<p>\n\nIn retrospect, I think one unifying theme in my disparate work is that it fits under one of these four heads.  Much of my recent metaphysics fits under (1) or (2) (e.g., <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/1sk.htm\">here</a>).  My work on belief and introspection mostly fits under (3) (with some (1) in my bolder moments): We can't take for granted that we have the handsome beliefs (e.g., \"the sexes are intellectually equal\") that we think we do, or that we have the moral character or types of experience that we think we do.  And my interest in Zhuangzi and some of the stranger corners of early introspective psychology fits under (4).</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/truth-dare-and-wonder.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-10-12T10:12:00-07:00\">10:12 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=8885703485699254055\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, April 21, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8142079485966570006\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/04/common-sense-science-fiction-and-weird.html\">Common Sense, Science Fiction, and Weird, Uncharitable History of Philosophy</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Philosophers have three broad methods for settling disputes: appeal to \"common sense\" or culturally common presuppositions, appeal to scientific evidence, and appeal to theoretical virtues like simplicity, coherence, fruitfulness, and pragmatic value.  Some of the most interesting disputes are disputes in which all three of these broad methods are problematic and seemingly indecisive.<p>\n\nOne of my aims as a philosopher is to intervene on common sense.  <b>\"Common sense\" is inherently conservative.</b>  Common sense used to tell us that the Earth didn't move, that humans didn't descend from ape-like ancestors, that certain races were superior to others, that the world was created by a god or gods of one sort or another.  Common sense is a product of biological and cultural evolution, plus the cognitive and social development of people in a limited range of environments. <b> Common sense only has to get things right enough, for practical purposes, to help us manage the range of environments to which we are accustomed.</b>  Common sense is under no obligation to get it right about the early universe, the microstructure of matter, the history of the species, future technologies, or the consciousness of weird hypothetical systems we have never encountered.<p>\n\nThe conservativism and limited vision of common sense leads us to dismiss as \"crazy\" some philosophical and scientific views that might in fact be true.  I've argued that this is especially so regarding theories of consciousness, about which <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">something crazy must be true</a>.  For example: <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">literal group consciousness</a>, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/\">panpsychism</a>, and/or <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/TyrantsHeadache.htm\">the failure of pain to supervene locally</a>. Although I don't believe that existing arguments <i>decisively</i> favor any of those possibilities, I do think that we ought to restrain our impulse to dismiss such views out of hand.  Fit with common sense is <i>one</i> important factor in evaluating philosophical claims, especially when direct scientific evidence and considerations of general theoretical virtue are indecisive, but it is only one factor.  We ought to be ready to accept that in some philosophical domains, our commonsense intuitions cannot be entirely preserved.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wQScn1A_VmQ/WPpAgC9VTSI/AAAAAAAAAII/YMyfnDxkDSk-7kOd1RnDBJU-yby6t__hQCLcB/s1600/MadScience.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wQScn1A_VmQ/WPpAgC9VTSI/AAAAAAAAAII/YMyfnDxkDSk-7kOd1RnDBJU-yby6t__hQCLcB/s200/MadScience.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\nToward this end, <b>I want to <i>broaden our intuitive sense of the possible</i>.  The two best techniques I know are science fiction and cross-cultural philosophy.</b><p>\n\nThe philosophical value of science fiction consists not only in the potential of science fictional speculations to describe possible futures that we might actually encounter.  Historically, science fiction has not been a great predictor of the future.  <b>The primary philosophical value of science fiction might rather consist in its ability to flex our minds and disrupt commonsense conservatism.</b>  After reading far-out stories about weird utopias, uploading into simulated realities, bizarrely constructed intelligent aliens, body switching, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain\">Matrioshka Brains</a>, and alternative universes, philosophical speculations about panpsychism and group consciousness no longer seem quite so intolerably weird.  At least that's my (empirically falsifiable) conjecture.<p>\n\nSimilarly, brain-flexing is an important part of the value of reading the history of philosophy -- especially work from traditions other than those with which you are already familiar.   Here it's especially <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/against-charity-in-history-of-philosophy.html\">important not to be too \"charitable\"</a> (i.e. assimilative). <b>Relish the weirdness -- \"weird\" from your perspective! -- of radical Buddhist metaphysics, of medieval Chinese neo-Confucianism,</b> of neo-Platonism in late antiquity, of 19th century Hegelianism and neo-Hegelianism.<p>\n\nIf something that seems crazy must be true about the metaphysics of consciousness, or about the nature of objects and causes, or about the nature of moral value -- as extended philosophical discussions of these topics suggest probably is the case -- then to evaluate the possibilities without excess conservatism, we need to get used to bending our minds out of their usual ruts.<p>\n\nThis is my new favorite excuse for reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang\">Ted Chiang</a>, cyberpunk, and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/\">Zhuangzi</a>.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/81/45/32/814532579a6e428b679f279825525968.jpg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/04/common-sense-science-fiction-and-weird.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-04-21T10:59:00-07:00\">10:59 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=8142079485966570006\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">psychology of philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, April 14, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3962201113115628793\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/04/we-who-write-blogs-recommend-blogs.html\">We Who Write Blogs Recommend...

In reflective equilibrium, one considers one's judgments, beliefs, or intuitions about particular individual cases (e.g., in such-and-such an emergency would it be bad to push someone in front of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">oncoming trolley</a>?).  One then compares these judgments about cases with one's judgments about general principles (e.g., act to maximize total human happiness) and one's judgments about other related cases (e.g., in such-and-such a slightly different emergency, should one push the person?).  Balance them all together, revising the general principles when that seems best in light of what you regard as secure judgments about the cases, and revising one's judgments about specific cases when that seems best in light of one's judgments about general principles and related cases.  Repeat the process, <b>tweaking your judgments about cases and principles until you reach an \"equilibrium\" in which your judgments about principles and a broad range of cases all fit together neatly.</b> <b> In \"wide\" equilibrium, you get to toss all other sources of knowledge into the process too</b> -- scientific knowledge, reports of other people's judgments, knowledge about history, etc.<p>\n\nHow could anything be more sensible than that?<p>\n\nI am inclined to agree that no approach <i>is </i>more sensible.  <b>It's the best way to do ethics.</b>  But, still, our best way of doing ethics might be irredeemably flawed.<p>\n\nThe crucial problem is this: <b>The process won't bust you out of a bad enough starting point if you're deeply enough committed to that starting point.</b>  And we might have bad starting points to which we are deeply committed.<p>\n\nConsider the <b>Knobheads</b>.  This is a species of linguistic, rational, intelligent beings much like us, who live on a planet around a distant star.  Babies are born without knobs on their foreheads, but knobs slowly grow starting at age five, and adults are very proud of their knobs.  The knobs are simply bony structures, with no function other than what the Knobheads give them in virtue of their prizing of them.  Sadly, 5% of children fail to start growing the knobs on their foreheads, despite being otherwise normal.  Knobheads are so committed to the importance of the knobs, and the knobs are so central to their social structures, that they euthanize those children.  Some Knobhead philosophers ask: Is it right to kill these knobless five-year-olds?  They are aware of various ethical principles that suggest that they should not kill those children.  And let's suppose that those ethical principles are in fact correct.  The Knobheads <i>should</i>, really, ethically, let the knobless children live.  But Knobheads are deeply enough committed to the judgment that killing those children is morally required that they are willing to tweak their judgments about general principles and other related cases.  \"It's just the essence of life as a Knobhead that one has a knob,\" some say.  \"It's too disruptive of our social practices to let them live.  And if they live, they will consume resources and parental energy that could instead be given to proper Knobhead children.\"  Etc.<p>\n\nAlso consider the <b>Hedons</b>.  The Hedons also are much like us and live on a far-away planet.  When they think about \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine\">experience machine</a>\" cases or \"<a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orgasmium\">hedonium</a>\" cases -- cases in which one sacrifices \"higher goods\" such as knowledge, social interaction, accomplishment, and art for the sake of maximizing pleasure -- they initially react somewhat like most Earthly humans do.  That is, their first reaction is that it's better for people to live real, rich lives with risk and suffering than to zap their brains into a constant state of dumb orgasmic pleasure.  But unlike most of us, the Hedons give up that judgment after engaging in reflective equilibrium.  After considerable reflection, they are captured by the theoretical elegance of simple hedonistic <a href=\"http://www.iep.utm.edu/util-a-r/\">act utilitarianism</a>.  As a society, they arrive at the consensus that the best ethical goal would be to destroy themselves as a species in order to transform their planet into a paradise of happy cows.  Let's assume that, like the Knobheads, they are in fact ethically wrong to reach this conclusion.  (Yes, I am assuming moral realism.)<p>\n<b>It seems possible that wide reflective equilibrium, even ideally practiced, could fail the Knobheads and Hedons.</b>  All that needs to be the case is that they are too implacably committed to some judgments that really ought to change (the Knobheads) or that they are insufficiently committed to judgments that ought <i>not </i>to change (the Hedons).  <b>To succeed as a method, reflective equilibrium requires that our reflective starting points be approximately well-ordered in the sense that our <i>stronger </i>commitments are normally our <i>better </i>commitments.</b>  Otherwise, reflective tweaking might tend to move practitioners <i>away from</i>rather than <i>toward</i> the moral truth.<p>\n\nBiological and cultural evolution, it seems, could easily give rise to groups of intelligent beings whose starting points are not well-ordered in that way and for whom, therefore, reflective equilibrium fails.<p>\n\nOf course, the crucial question is whether <i>we</i> are such beings.  I worry that we might be.<p>\n\n**********************************<p>\n<i>Related:</i><p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-robots-and-monsters-might-break.html\">How Robots and Monsters Might Break Human Moral Systems</a> (Feb 3, 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/08/weird-minds-might-destabilize-human.html\">How Weird Minds Might Destabilize Human Ethics</a> (Aug 15, 2015)<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pokerjuice.com/groups/pokerjuice-public/forum/topic/nash-equilibrium/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/03/why-wide-reflective-equilibrium-in.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-03-01T10:43:00-08:00\">10:43 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=152754848695726126\" onclick=\"\">9\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, January 24, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1221632049551376856\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-philosophers-rationalization-o-meter.html\">The Philosopher's Rationalization-O-Meter</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CCWq8Y_mJjE/WIfHt_wO8lI/AAAAAAAABvQ/EQc27rR9jtAIUpLwwFm9C4WrZFuupQJsQCLcB/s1600/rationalization-o-meter2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CCWq8Y_mJjE/WIfHt_wO8lI/AAAAAAAABvQ/EQc27rR9jtAIUpLwwFm9C4WrZFuupQJsQCLcB/s200/rationalization-o-meter2.jpg\" width=\"191\"/></a></div><p>\nUsually when someone disagrees with me about a philosophical issue, I think they're about 20% correct.  Once in a while, I think a comment is just straightforwardly wrong.  Very rarely, I find myself convinced that the person who disagrees is correct and my original view was mistaken.  But for the most part, <b>it's a remarkable consistency: The critic has a piece of the truth, but I have more of it.</b><p>\n\nMy inner skeptic finds this to be a highly suspicious state of affairs.<p>\n\nLet me clarify what I mean by \"about 20% correct\".  I mean this: There's some merit in what the disagreeing person says, but on the whole my view is still closer to correct.  Maybe there's some nuance that they're noticing, which I elided, but which doesn't undermine the big picture.  Or maybe I wasn't careful or clear about some subsidiary point.  Or maybe there's a plausible argument on the other side which isn't decisively refutable but which also isn't the best conclusion to draw from the full range of evidence holistically considered.  Or maybe they've made a nice counterpoint which I hadn't previously considered but to which I have an excellent rejoinder available.<p>\n\nIn contrast, for me to think that someone who disagrees with me is \"mostly correct\", I would have to be convinced that my initial view was probably mistaken.  For example, if I argued that <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/12/is-most-of-intelligence-in-universe-non.html\">we ought to expect superintelligent AI to be phenomenally conscious</a>, the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/ai-consciousness-reply-to-schwitzgebel.html\">critic</a> ought to convince me that I was probably mistaken to assert that.  Or if I argue that <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/11/three-ways-to-be-not-quite-free-of.html\">indifference is a type of racism</a>, the critic ought to convince me that it's probably better to restrict the idea of \"racism\" to more active forms of prejudice.<p>\n\nFrom an abstract point of view, how often ought I expect to be convinced by those who object to my arguments, if I were admirably open-minded and rational?<p>\n\nFor two reasons, the number should be below 50%:<p>\n\n1. For most of the issues I write about, I have given the matter more thought than most (not all!) of those who disagree with me.  Mostly I write about issues that I have been considering for a long time or that are closely related to issues I've been considering for a long time.<p>\n\n2. Some (most?) philosophical disputes are such that even ideally good reasoners, fully informed of the relevant evidence, might persistently disagree without thereby being irrational.  People might reasonably have different starting points or foundational assumptions that justify persisting disagreement.<p>\n\nStill, even taking 1 and 2 together, it seems that <b>it should not be a rarity for a critic to raise an interesting, novel objection that I hadn't previously considered and which ought to persuade me</b>.  This is clear when I consider <i>other</i> philosophers: Often they get objections (sometimes from me) which, in my judgment, nicely illuminate what is incorrect in their views, and which should rationally lead them to change their views -- if only they weren't so defensively set upon rebutting all critiques!  I doubt I am a much better philosopher than they are, wise enough to have wholly excellent opinions; so I must sometimes hear criticisms that <i>ought </i>to cause me to relinquish my views.<p>\n\nLet me venture to put some numbers on this.<p>\n\nLet's begin by excluding positions on which I have published at least one full-length paper.  For those positions, considerations 1 and 2 plausibly suggest rational steadfastness in the large majority of cases.<p>\n\nA more revealing target is <b>half-baked or three-quarters-baked positions on contentious issues</b>: anything from a position I have expressed verbally, after a bit of thought, in a seminar or informal discussion, up to approximately a blog post, if the issue is fairly new to me.<p>\n\nSuppose that about 20% of the time what I say is off-base in a way that should be discoverable to me if I gave it more thought, in an reasonably open-minded, even-handed way.  Now if I'm defending that off-base position in dialogue with someone substantially more expert than I, or with a couple of peers, or with a somewhat larger group of people who are less expert than I but still thoughtful and informed, maybe I should expect that about half to 3/4 of the time I'll hear an objection that ought to move me.  <b>Multiplying and rounding, let's say that about 1/8 of the time, when I put forward a half- or three-quarters-baked idea to some interlocutors, I ought to hear an objection that makes me think, whoops, I guess I'm probably mistaken!</b><p>\n\nI hope this isn't too horrible an estimate, at least for a mature philosopher.  For someone still maturing as a philosopher, the estimate should presumably be higher -- maybe 1/4.  The estimate should similarly be higher if the half- or three-quarters-baked idea is a critique of someone more expert than you, concerning the topic of their philosophical expertise (e.g., pushing back against a Kant expert's interpretation of a passage of Kant that you're interested in).<p>\n<b>Here then are two opposed epistemic vices: being too deferential or being too stubborn.</b>  The cartoon of excessive deferentiality would be the person who instantly withdraws in the face of criticism, too quickly allowing that they are probably mistaken.  Students are sometimes like this, but it's hard for a really deferential person to make it far as a professional philosopher in U.S. academic culture.  The cartoon of excessive stubbornness is the person who is always ready to cook up some post-hoc rationalization of whatever half-baked position happens to come out of their mouth, always fighting back, never yielding, never seeing any merit in any criticisms of their views, however wrong their views plainly are.  This is perhaps the more common vice in professional philosophy in the U.S., though of course no one is quite as bad as the cartoon.<p>\n<b>Here's a third, more subtle epistemic vice: always giving the same amount of deference.</b>  Cartoon version: For any criticism you hear, you think there's 20% truth in it (so you're partly deferential) but you never think there's more than 20% truth in it (so you're mostly stubborn).  This is what my inner skeptic was worried about at the beginning of this post.  I might be too close to this cartoon, always a little deferential but mostly stubborn, without sufficient sensitivity to the quality of the particular criticism being directed at me.<p>\n<b>We can now construct a rationalization-o-meter.</b>  Stubborn rationalization, in a mature philosopher, is revealed by not thinking your critics are right, and you are wrong, at least 1/8 of the time, when you're putting forward half- to three-quarters-baked ideas.  If you stand firm in 15 out of 16 cases, then you're either unusually wise in your half-baked thoughts, or you're at .5 on the rationalization-o-meter (50% of the time that you should yield you offer post-hoc rationalizations instead).  If you're still maturing or if you're critiquing an expert on their own turf, the meter should read correspondingly higher, e.g., with a normative target of thinking you were demonstrably off-base 1/4 or even half the time.<p>\n\nInsensitivity is revealed by having too little variation in how much truth you find in critics' remarks.  I'd try to build an insensitivity-o-meter, but I'm sure you all will raise somewhat legitimate but non-decisive concerns against it.<p>\n\n[image modified from <a href=\"https://big-meter-pro.en.softonic.com/\">source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-philosophers-rationalization-o-meter.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-01-24T14:03:00-08:00\">2:03 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1221632049551376856\" onclick=\"\">9\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">psychology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Sunday, January 08, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2246505127476107775\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/against-charity-in-history-of-philosophy.html\">Against Charity in the History of Philosophy</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Peter Adamson, host of <a href=\"http://historyofphilosophy.net/\">History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps</a>, recently posted twenty \"<a href=\"http://historyofphilosophy.net/rules-history-philosophy\">Rules for the History of Philosophy</a>\".  Mostly, they are terrific rules.  I want to quibble with one.<p>\n\nLike almost every historian of philosophy I know, Adamson recommends that we be \"charitable\" to the text.  Here's how he puts it in \"Rule 2: Respect the text\":<p>\n<blockquote>\nThis is my version of what is sometimes called the \"principle of charity.\" A minimal version of this rule is that we should assume, in the absence of fairly strong reasons for doubt, that the philosophical texts we are reading make sense.... [It] seems obvious (to me at least) that useful history of philosophy doesn't involve looking for inconsistencies and mistakes, but rather trying one's best to get a coherent and interesting line of argument out of the text. This is, of course, not to say that historical figures never contradicted themselves, made errors, and the like, but our interpretations should seek to avoid imputing such slips to them unless we have tried hard and failed to find a way of resolving the apparent slip.</blockquote><p>\n\nAt first pass, it seems a good idea to avoid imputing contradictions and errors, and to seek a coherent, sensible interpretation of historical texts \"unless we we have tried hard and failed to find a way of resolving the apparent slip\".  This is how, it seems, to best \"respect the text\".<p>\n\nTo see why I think charity isn't as good an idea as it seems, let me first reveal <b>my main reason for reading history of philosophy: It's to gain a perspective, through the lens of distance, on my own philosophical views and presuppositions,</b> and on the philosophical attitudes and presuppositions of 21st century Anglophone philosophy generally.  Twenty-first century Anglophone philosophy tends to assume that the world is wholly material (with the exception of religious dualists and near cousins of materialists, like <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#ProDua\">property dualists</a>).  I'm inclined to accept the majority's materialism.  Reading the history of philosophy helpfully reminds me that a wide range of other views have been taken seriously over time.  Similarly, 21st century Anglophone philosophy tends to favor a certain sort of liberal ethics, with an emphasis on individual rights and comparatively little deference to traditional rules and social roles -- and I tend to favor such an ethics too.  But it's good to be vividly aware that wonderful thinkers have often had very different moral opinions.  <b>Reading culturally distant texts reminds me that I am a creature of my era, with views that have been shaped by contingent social factors</b>.<p>\n\nOf course, others might read history of philosophy with very different aims, which is fine.<p>\n<b>Question:</b> If this is my aim in reading history of philosophy, what is the most counterproductive thing I could do when confronting a historical text?<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uPp4VTCMB2w/WHLJueIb8MI/AAAAAAAABuY/TRJcYbQ3DgM9m7EGYWEFbSg_W2jzDJxfgCLcB/s1600/butterfly.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uPp4VTCMB2w/WHLJueIb8MI/AAAAAAAABuY/TRJcYbQ3DgM9m7EGYWEFbSg_W2jzDJxfgCLcB/s320/butterfly.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n<b>Answer:</b> Interpret the author as endorsing a view that is familiar, \"sensible\", and similar to my own and my colleagues'.<p>\n\nHistorical texts, like all philosophical texts -- but more so, given our linguistic and cultural distance -- tend to be difficult and ambiguous.  Therefore, they will admit of multiple interpretations.  Suppose, then, that there's a text admitting of four possible interpretations: A, B, C, and D, where Interpretation A is the least challenging, least weird, and most sensible, and Interpretation D is the most challenging, weirdest, and least sensible.  <b>A simple application of the principle of charity seems to recommend that we favor the sensible, pedestrian Interpretation A.  In fact, however, weird and wild Interpretation D would challenge our presuppositions more deeply and give us a more helpfully distant perspective.</b>  This is one reason to favor Interpretation D.  Call this the Principle of Anti-Charity.<p>\n\nAdmittedly, this way of defending of Anti-Charity might seem noxiously instrumentalist.  What about historical accuracy?  Don't we want the interpretation that's most likely to be <i>true?</i><p>\n\nBracketing post-modern views that reject truth in textual interpretation, I have four responses to that concern:<p>\n<b>1. Being Anti-Charitable doesn't mean that anything goes.  You still want to respect the surface of the text.</b>  If the author says \"P\", you don't want to attribute the view not-P.  In fact, it is the more \"charitable\" views that are likely to  take the author's claims other than at face value: \"The author says P, but really a charitable, sensible interpretation is that the author really meant P-prime\".  In one way, it is actually more respectful to the texts <i>not </i>to be too charitable, and to interpret the text superficially at face value.  After all, P is what the author literally said.<p>\n<b>2. What seems \"coherent\" and \"sensible\" is culturally variable.</b>  You might reject excessive charitableness, while still wanting to limit allowable interpretations to one among several sensible and coherent ones.  But this might already be too limiting.  It might not seem \"coherent\" to us to embrace a contradiction, but some philosophers in some traditions seem happy to accept bald contradictions.  It might not seem \"sensible\" to think that the world is nothing but a flux of ideas, such that the existence of rocks depends entirely upon the states of immaterial spirits.  So if there's any ambiguity, you might hope to tame views that seem metaphysically idealist, thereby giving those authors a more sensible, reasonable seeming view.  But this might be leading you away from rather than toward interpretative accuracy.<p>\n<b>3. Philosophy is hard and philosophers are stupid.</b>  The human mind is not well-designed for figuring out philosophical truths.  Timeless philosophical puzzles tend to kick our collective asses.  Sadly, this is going to be true of your favorite philosopher too.  The odds are good that this philosopher, being a flawed human like you and me, made mistakes, fell into contradictions, changed opinions, and failed to see what seem to be obvious consequences and counterexamples.  Respecting the text and respecting the person means, in part, not trying too hard to smooth this stuff away.  The warts are part of the loveliness.  They are also a tonic against excessive hero worship and a reminder of your own likely warts and failings.<p>\n<b>4. Some authors might not even <i>want </i>to be interpreted as having a coherent, stable view.</b>  I have <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DeathSelfZZ.htm\">recently argued</a> that this is the case for the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi.  Let's not fetishize stable coherence.  There are lots of reasons to write philosophy.  Some philosophers might not care if it all fits together.  Here, attempting \"charitably\" to stitch together a coherent picture might be a failure to respect the aims and intentions implicit in the text.<p>\n\nThree cheers for the weird and \"crazy\", the naked text, not dressed in sensible 21st century garb!<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated post: <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/08/in-defense-of-uncharitable-and.html\">In Defense of Uncharitable and Superficial History of Philosophy</a> (Aug 17, 2012)<p>\n\n(HT: <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.northwestern.edu/people/continuing-faculty/goldberg-sanford.html\">Sandy Goldberg</a> for discussion and suggestion to turn it into a blog post)<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://meli-lewis.github.io/h230/illustratedzhuangzi.html\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/01/against-charity-in-history-of-philosophy.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-01-08T15:59:00-08:00\">3:59 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2246505127476107775\" onclick=\"\">24\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/chinese%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">chinese philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">psychology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, October 21, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6439298227310179116\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/storytelling-in-philosophy-class.html\">Storytelling in Philosophy Class</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ifxpWRlqAGQ/WAj2nF1WLaI/AAAAAAAABmM/rE_92s0mTG05mxU4mCOM1f9zNHhsmNP4QCLcB/s1600/storytime.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ifxpWRlqAGQ/WAj2nF1WLaI/AAAAAAAABmM/rE_92s0mTG05mxU4mCOM1f9zNHhsmNP4QCLcB/s1600/storytime.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nOne of my regular TAs, <a href=\"http://philosophy.ucr.edu/chris-mcvey/\">Chris McVey</a>, uses a lot of storytelling in his teaching.  About once a week, he'll spend ten minutes sharing a personal story from his life, relevant to the class material.  He'll talk about a family crisis or about his time in the U.S. Navy, connecting it back to the readings from the class.<p>\n\nAt last weekend's meeting of the <a href=\"https://uchv.princeton.edu/events/minorities-and-philosophy-conference-implicit-biasesstereotype-threat-and-pedagogy\">Minorities And Philosophy group at Princeton</a>, I was thinking about what teaching techniques philosophers might use to appeal to a broader diversity of students, and \"storytime with Chris\" came to mind.  The more I think about it, the more I find to like about it.<p>\n\nHere are some thoughts.<p>\n\n* <b>Students are hungry for stories, and rightly so</b>.  Philosophy class is usually abstract and impersonal, or when not abstract focused on toy examples or remote issues of public policy.  A good story, especially one that is <b>personally meaningful to the teacher</b>, leaps out and captures attention.  People in general love stories and are especially ready for them after long dry abstractions and policy discussions.  So why not harness that?  But furthermore, storytelling gives shape and flesh to the stick figures of philosophical abstraction.  <b>Most abstract principles only get their full meaning when we see how they play out in real cases</b>.  Kant might say \"act on that maxim that you can will to be a universal law\" or Mengzi might say \"human nature is good\" -- but what do such claims really amount to?  Students rightly feel at sea unless they are pulled away from toy examples and into the complexity of real life.  Although it's tempting to think that the real philosophical force is in the abstract principles and that storytelling is just needless frill and packaging, I think that the reverse might be closer to the truth: The heart of philosophy is in how we engage our minds when given real, messy examples, and the abstractions we derive from cases always partly miss the point.<p>\n\n* <b>Personal stories vividly display the relevance of philosophy.</b>  Many -- maybe most -- students are understandably turned off by philosophy because it seems so remote from anything of practical value.  What's the point, they wonder, in discussing <a href=\"http://homepages.wmich.edu/~baldner/qualities.htm\">Locke's view of primary and secondary qualities</a>, or semi-comical far-fetched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">problems about runaway trolleys</a>, or under what conditions you \"know\" something is a barn in <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/#FakBarCas\">Fake Barn Country</a>?  It takes a certain kind of beautiful, nerdy, impractical mind to love these questions for their own sake.  Too much focus on such issues can mislead students into thinking that philosophy is irrelevant to their lives.  However (I hope you'll agree), nothing is more relevant to our lives than philosophy.  Every choice we make expresses our values.  Every controversial opinion we form depends upon our general worldview and our implicit or explicit sense of what people or institutions or methods deserve our trust.  <b>Most students will understandably fail to see the connection between academic philosophy and the philosophy they personally live through their choices and opinions unless we vividly show how these are connected.</b>  Through storytelling, you model your struggle with Kant's hard line against lying, or with how far to trust purported scientific experts, or with your fading faith in an immaterial soul -- and students can see that philosophy is not just a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game\">Glass Bead Game</a>.<p>\n\n* <b>Personal stories shift the locus of academic capital.</b>  We might think of <b>\"academic capital\" as the resources students bring to class</b> which help them succeed.  In philosophy class, important capital includes skill at reading and evaluating abstract arguments and, in class discussion, skill at working up passable pro and con arguments on the spot.  Academic capital of this sort also includes knowledge of the philosophical tradition, comfort in a classroom environment, confidence that one knows how this game is played.  These are terrific skills to have of course; and some students have more of them than others, or at least believe they do.  Those students tend to dominate class discussion.  If you tell a personally meaningful story, however, you can make a different set of skills and experiences suddenly important.  Students who might have had similar stories from their own lives now have something unique to contribute.  <b>Students who are good at storytelling, students who have the social and emotional intelligence to evaluate what might have really happened in your family fight, students with cultural knowledge of the kind of situation you describe -- they now have some of the capital</b>.  And they might be a very different group from the ones who are so good at the argumentative pro-and-con.  In my experience, good philosophical storytelling engages and draws out discussion from a larger and more diverse group of students than does abstract argument and toy example.<p>\n\nIf philosophers were more serious about engaged, personal storytelling in class, we would I think have a different and broader range of students who loved our courses and appreciated the importance and interest of our discipline.<p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://auglaize.oplin.org/content/its-story-time-your-library-0\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/10/storytelling-in-philosophy-class.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-10-21T08:27:00-07:00\">8:27 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6439298227310179116\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, September 28, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3869924146899106561\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/09/new-essay-in-draft-pragmatic.html\">New Essay in Draft: The Pragmatic Metaphysics of Belief</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Available <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PragBel.htm\">here</a>.<p>\n\nAs always, comments and criticisms welcome, either by email to my address or in the comments section on this post.<p>\n\nAbstract:<p>\n\nSuppose someone intellectually assents to a proposition but fails to act and react generally as though that proposition is true.  Does she believe the proposition?  <i>Intellectualist </i>approaches will say she does believe it.  They align belief with sincere, reflective judgment, downplaying the importance of habitual, spontaneous reaction and unreflective assumption.  <i>Broad-based</i> approaches, which do not privilege the intellectual and reflective over the spontaneous and habitual in matters of belief, will refrain from ascribing belief or treat it as an intermediate case.  Both views are viable, so it is open to us to choose which view to prefer on pragmatic grounds.  I argue that since \u201cbelief\u201d is a term of central importance in philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and epistemology, we should use it to label most important phenomenon in the vicinity that can plausibly answer to it.  The most important phenomenon in the vicinity is not our patterns of intellectual endorsement but rather our overall lived patterns of action and reaction.  Too intellectualist a view risks hiding the importance of lived behavior, especially when that behavior does not match our ideals and self-conception, inviting us to noxiously comfortable views of ourselves.<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PragBel.htm\">The Pragmatic Metaphysics of Belief</a> (in draft)\n<p>\n\n(I'll be giving a version of this paper as talk at USC on Friday, by the way.)<p>\n<i>Related Posts:<p></p></i>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/03/on-being-blameworthy-for-unwelcome.html\">On Being Blameworthy for Unwelcome Thoughts, Reactions, and Biases </a>(Mar 19, 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/07/against-intellectualism-about-belief.html\">Against Intellectualism about Belief</a> (Jul 31, 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/02/pragmatic-metaphysics.html\">Pragmatic Metaphysics</a> (Feb 11, 2016)\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/09/new-essay-in-draft-pragmatic.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-09-28T14:47:00-07:00\">2:47 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3869924146899106561\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, March 17, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"9037778161797915633\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/03/crash-spaces-for-ancestral-ways-of.html\">\"Crash Spaces\" for Ancestral Ways of Meaning-Making</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hDfZ5EJdCbY/VunNYqaaWKI/AAAAAAAABTc/FHIknIFxftEbBUqIXLkd3EggZvrcezRdg/s1600/crashspace.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hDfZ5EJdCbY/VunNYqaaWKI/AAAAAAAABTc/FHIknIFxftEbBUqIXLkd3EggZvrcezRdg/s320/crashspace.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nR. Scott Bakker's story \"<a href=\"https://rsbakker.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/crash-space-tpb.pdf\">Crash Space</a>\", which I solicited for a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/misp.2015.39.issue-1/issuetoc\">special issue of <i>Midwest Studies in Philosophy</i></a> last year, is stuck in my head.<p>\n\nWithout giving away too much of Bakker's story, here's the guiding thought: A world in which you have almost complete voluntary control over your emotions is a world in which your emotions won't effectively do their job in regulating your behavior.  <b>It's crucial to the operation of an emotion like guilt or ecstatically forgetful bliss that it be at least partly outside your direct control</b>.  Otherwise, why not just turn off the guilt and amp up bliss and go wild?<p>\n<b>In fact, once you even <i>start</i> to dampen down your moral emotions or long-term thinking, that might create a situation in which you'll then dampen those emotions farther</b> -- since there will be less guilt, shame, etc., to prevent you from continuing to downregulate.  It's easy to see how a vicious cycle could start and be hard to escape.  If you could, in a moment of recklessness, say to yourself \"let's crank up the carpe diem and forget tomorrow!\" and then (through emotion-regulating technology) actually <i>do</i> that, then it might be hard to find your way back to moderation.  A bit of normal short-term thinking might lead you to temporarily dampen your concern for the future, but once concern for the future is dampened your new short-term-thinking self might naturally be inclined to say, \"what the heck, let's dampen it even more!\"<p>\n\nIn a postscript to his story, Bakker defines a <b>crash space</b> as \"a problem solving domain where our tools seem to fit the description, but cannot seem to get the job done\" (p. 203).  Bakker argues, plausibly, that <b>the cognitive and emotional structures that give meaning to our lives and constrain us ethically can be expected to work only in a limited range of environments</b> -- roughly, environments similar in their basic structure to those in our evolutionary and cultural history.  Break far enough away, and our ancestrally familiar approaches will cease to function effectively.<p>\n\nFor a very different set of cases in the same vein, consider <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-robots-and-monsters-might-break.html\">utility monster and fission-fusion monster cases</a> that might well become possible if we can someday create human-like consciousness in computers or robots.  (Utility monsters are capable of vastly superhuman amounts of pleasure.  Fission-fusion monsters are individuals who can merge and subdivide at will.)  The human notion of individual rights, for example, only makes sense in a context in which targets of moral concern are individuals who remain discrete from each other for long periods of time -- who don't merge and divide and blend into each other.  Break this assumption, and much of our ordinary moral thinking seems to break along with it.  (See also <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/BRIUMF\">Briggs and Nolan 2015</a>.)  What becomes of \"one person, one vote\", for example, when people can divide into a million individuals the day before the election and then merge back together again -- or not -- the day after, or when you have a huge entity with many semi-independent subparts?<p>\n<b>Part of the potential philosophical power of science fiction, I think, is in imagining possible crash spaces for our ancestral, historical, or socially familiar ways of finding personal and moral meaning in the world.</b>  Pushing imaginatively against existing boundaries, we can begin to see possible risks in the future.  But discovering our crash spaces is also of intrinsic philosophical interest, potentially revealing previously unnoticed implicit background assumptions behind our ordinary patterns of evaluation.<p>\n\nSome other interesting science fiction on the hazards of external self-control of emotions include <a href=\"http://www.larryniven.net/\">Larry Niven</a>'s pleasure-center-simulating <a href=\"http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=59\">tasps</a> and ecstasy plugs (turn on and forget even to eat!), and <a href=\"http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/\">Greg Egan</a>'s exoselves in <i>Permutation City</i> and <i>Diaspora</i> (shell programs that regulate one's personality and preferences).<p>\n\nOne flip side of Bakker's \"Crash Space\" is Egan's short story \"Reasons to Be Cheerful\", about the challenge of choosing a new set of desires and preferences from scratch, in a self-conscious, hyper-rational way.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://infospacejunk.weebly.com/uploads/6/7/1/0/6710170/1846635.jpg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/03/crash-spaces-for-ancestral-ways-of.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-03-17T09:57:00-07:00\">9:57 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=9037778161797915633\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/crazyism\" rel=\"tag\">crazyism</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy?updated-max=2016-03-17T09:57:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=16&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

Photo courtesy the Portable Antiquities Scheme.\" width=\"200\"/></a>A hoard of 1,608 coins Roman coins discovered by metal detectorists in a field it Boldre, in the New Forest near Lymington, Hampshire, in 2014, has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-40768334\" target=\"_blank\">gone on public display for the first time</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.stbarbe-museum.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">St Barbe Museum and Art Gallery</a> in Lymington. The hoard dates to the 3rd century A.D. and contains bronze radiates from the second half of the 3rd century. The earliest coin in the group was minted under the reign of Trebonianus Gallus (249-51 A.D.). The most recent is barely 25 years older, struck in 276 in the waning days of the emperor Tacitus (275-6 A.D.). The bulk of the coins were found in the remains of a round vessel, 15 sherds from the bottom of the earthenware pot.</p>\n<p>After slumbering underground for more than 1,700 years since its owner buried his savings, disturbed only by the farm equipment that likely broke the pot, the hoard has seen quite a bit of drama <a href=\"http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/14127466.Row_over_1_600_Roman_coin_find_ends_metal_detectorists__friendship/\" target=\"_blank\">starting with the moment of its discovery</a>. There were several metal detectorists scanning that field in Boldre on May 4th, 2014, among them two old friends Andy Aartsen and James Petts. Aartsen made the first discovery: 25-30 coins on their own.

According to the rules of the metal detecting club, if you walk away from a signal it counts as abandonment and the next guy gets to pick up where you left off, but Aartsen apparently thought his earlier signal granted him perpetual rights because he told Petts \u201cEff off, it\u2019s mine.\u201d That\u2019s a quote from James Petts\u2019 testimony at the coroner\u2019s inquest that determined whether the coin hoard was official treasure by the standards of the Treasure Act of 1996, which is downright spicy compared to the usual testimony from British Museum and Portable Antiquities Scheme experts one encounters at treasure inquests.</p>\n<p>The conflict caused a permanent rift between the former friends, and it really wasn\u2019t about the money because bronze radiates aren\u2019t big ticket items. The amount of the valuation that would be paid by the museum that acquired the hoard was around \u00a38,000 to be split 50/50 by the finder and landowner. This fight was all about credit, who gets to be the official finder of the Boldre Hoard. Andy Aartsen wanted to be declared the sole finder; Petts wanted it declared a joint find of both men, which seems more than fair given that he found the vast majority of the hoard and the container. At the time of the inquest, the dispute was still ongoing and Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short suggested the two ex-friends might have to duke it out in court if they couldn\u2019t come to an agreement. I couldn\u2019t discover what the disposition their dispute was, but the articles about the new exhibition refer only to James Petts as the finder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Boldre-Layer-5-Marius-with-Victory-reverse.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48261\" height=\"102\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Boldre-Layer-5-Marius-with-Victory-reverse.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-200x102.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Boldre-Layer-5-Marius-with-Victory-reverse.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-200x102.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Boldre-Layer-5-Marius-with-Victory-reverse.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Boldre-Layer-5-Marius-with-Victory-reverse.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-768x391.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Boldre-Layer-5-Marius-with-Victory-reverse.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-430x219.jpg 430w\" title=\"Radiate of Marius with Victory reverse.

It was to be spent on conservation of the hoard, necessary restoration of the space and to build a secure display case which will preserve the coins and pot in controlled conditions. The hoard\u2019s needs fit seemlessly with the museum\u2019s. A month before the fundraiser was launched, the St Barbe Museum and Art Gallery began an extensive refurbishment paid for by a \u00a31.78 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The galleries were enlarged, the entrance improved and a new cafe was built. All together, this was a major upgrade for the small local museum, making it a fitting home for the Boldre Hoard and the extra eyeballs it is sure to draw. (Everybody loves a hoard, especially when it\u2019s a local kid made good.)</p>\n<p>The refurbished museum had its grand reopening on Saturday with the Boldre Hoard as its centerpiece and signature treasure.

The monastery was damaged by flooding in 2015 and experts from the Ministry of Antiquities have been working since then to restore it. The frescoes were discovered under a layer of modern mortar. They were painted between the 9th and 13th centuries and depict saints and angels. Some of the frescoes have Coptic inscriptions underneath them. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe most distinguished paintings are those on the western and eastern walls of the church,\u201d [Ministry of Antiquities scientist Ahmed El-Nemr] said, describing the painting on the western wall as showing a woman named as Refka and her five sons, who were martyred during the persecution of Christians by the Roman empire.</p>\n<p>The painting on the eastern wall depicts three saints and an archangel, and features Coptic writings below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-ambon.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48249\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 78px) 100vw, 78px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-ambon-78x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-ambon-78x150.jpg 78w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-ambon-157x300.jpg 157w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-ambon-768x1472.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-ambon-417x800.jpg 417w\" title=\"The ambon discovered at Saint Bishoy Monastery.

Historical and religious records document extensive changes to the architecture and decoration of Saint Bishoy\u2019s in 840 AD, during the Abbasid era, and in 1069 AD, during the Fatimid caliphate. Archaeologists hope the newly discovered features may elucidate some the church\u2019s original design and fill in some of the blanks in the timeline of its construction phases from antiquity into the modern era.</p>\n<p>The monastery was founded in the 4th century by Saint Bishoy (320 \u2013 417 A.D.), a deeply devout monk who, like many of his time, emulated the ascetics and lived in the desert wilderness. His humility, dedication to prayer, hard work and the poor earned him a following of thousands who flocked to live in mountain caves surrounding his cave in what is now Deir el-Surian, about a third of a mile from the Monastery of Saint Bishoy. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fresco-with-Coptic-inscription.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48252\" height=\"219\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fresco-with-Coptic-inscription-200x219.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fresco-with-Coptic-inscription-200x219.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fresco-with-Coptic-inscription-137x150.jpg 137w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fresco-with-Coptic-inscription-768x842.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fresco-with-Coptic-inscription-430x471.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fresco with Coptic inscription found at Saint Bishoy Monastery. Photo courtesy the Ministry of Antiquities.\" width=\"200\"/></a>According to Coptic hagiographies, Bishoy\u2019s humbleness netted him at least two personal meetings with the risen Christ. The first time he was washing the feet of passing strangers, as was his wont, when he spotted crucifixion scars on the feet of one of them and realized he\u2019d just washed Jesus\u2019 feet. Another time he offered to carry an old ailing monk up the mountain on his back only to find the ailing old man was Jesus in disguise (again). Jesus told him then that because he had kept his body pure through his asceticism and used it only to serve the poor, lowly and God, including carrying God on its back up a mountain, Bishoy\u2019s body would never decay. </p>\n<p>Jesus kept his promise. When Bishoy\u2019s body was moved to the Wadi El Natrun monastery in 841 A.D. by order of Saint Joseph I of Alexandria, 52nd Pope of Alexandria, it was indeed found to be incorrupt. The saint\u2019s body lies in the monastery church to this day, and according to witnesses is still incorrupt.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Coptic murals found in Egyptian monastery\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48248\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48248#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48231\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48231\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Entirely non-alien child with cranial deformation found in Crimea\">Entirely non-alien child with cranial deformation found in Crimea</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, July 29th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Excavation-of-KyzAul-necropolis.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48232\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Excavation-of-KyzAul-necropolis-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Excavation-of-KyzAul-necropolis-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Excavation-of-KyzAul-necropolis-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Excavation-of-KyzAul-necropolis-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Excavation-of-KyzAul-necropolis-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Excavation of Kyz-Aul necropolis.

The team from the Institute of Archeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Archeology Foundation have been excavating the ancient necropolis of Kyz-Aul for three weeks. Several graves dating from the 1st century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. have already been unearthed during this field season. They\u2019ve found the remains of Sarmatian soldiers in monumental stone crypts and horse burials, but the child\u2019s grave is the only one to feature the elongated skull characteristic of intentional cranial deformation.</p>\n<p>Researchers have confirmed from osteological analysis that the remains are those of a boy. Because his fontanelle was not fully closed, scientists were able to determine that he was around 18 months old at time of death. His remains were radiocarbon dated to the 2nd century A.D. when the peninsula was part of the Bosporan Kingdom, a Hellenistic kingdom that became a client state of the Roman Empire in 1st century. The bones are in an excellent state of preservation. Buried with the child were a clay vessel near his head and a few small beads of colored glass. The boy was wearing a copper alloy bracelet on his right wrist. He was interred directly in the ground. No remains of a coffin, gravestone or marker were found.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-unearthed.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48233\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-unearthed-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-unearthed-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-unearthed-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-unearthed-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-unearthed-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skeleton of child with intentional cranial deformation unearthed.

Examples of it have been found in every inhabited continent, and the inhabitants of the Black Sea coast, most notably the Sarmatians, had been altering their children\u2019s\u2019 skull shapes for centuries by the time this little boy was born. </p>\n<p>The cranial modification process began in infancy when the bones of the skull are malleable. In the Black Sea region, people wrapped plaits around babies\u2019 heads and over time the pressure of the wrapping changed the shape of the skull. The elongated egg shape was considered more aesthetically pleasing than the regular old boring skulls they were born with, and had important cultural and social significance because it was an attribute of the Sarmatian military nobility who were increasingly powerful in the Bosporan Kingdom. It was primarily boys destined to be elite fighters who had their skulls modified, so it\u2019s likely this child was slated to be a Sarmatian warrior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48234\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skeleton-of-Sarmation-child-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Closer view of elongated cranium. Photo courtesy the Archeology Foundation.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The date of the child burial is a meaningful one within this context because the Sarmatian warrior elite, who mainly fought as heavy cavalry for the Bosporan Kingdom, had grown in power and influence to such a degree that by the 2nd century A.D., the formerly Hellenistic kingdom was increasingly Sarmatized. It was in the 2nd century that the last of the Greek ruling dynasties died out and was replaced by a new Sarmatian dynasty. This takeover had far-reaching cultural implications. Artisan crafts were decorated with Sarmatian motifs instead of Greek ones. Even the way people dressed changed, with trousers and long-sleeved shirts replacing the Greek tunics and gowns. </p>\n<p>At the same time, Sarmatians made peace with the Romans, who had been fighting them since the 1st century B.C., and in 175 A.D. negotiated a treaty with Emperor Marcus Aurelius. By the terms of the treaty, the Sarmatians agreed to send Rome 8,000 of their famed heavy cavalry. More than half of them were sent very far from home to guard Hadrian\u2019s Wall. Sarmatian artifacts \u2014 weapons, beads \u2014 have been found at the wall, and there are surviving documents that record Sarmatian squadrons manning several of the forts.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Entirely non-alien child with cranial deformation found in Crimea\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48231\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48231#comments\">9 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48236\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48236\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Longest funerary inscription found on Pompeiian tomb\">Longest funerary inscription found on Pompeiian tomb</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, July 28th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Overhead-view-of-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48239\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Overhead-view-of-tomb-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Overhead-view-of-tomb-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Overhead-view-of-tomb-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Overhead-view-of-tomb-768x573.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Overhead-view-of-tomb-430x321.jpg 430w\" title=\"Overhead view of monumental tomb.

The tomb was found by accident during maintenance and restoration work on buildings in the San Paolino area as part of the EU-funded <a href=\"http://www.pompeiisites.org/Sezione.jsp?titolo=The+EU+Pompei+project&amp;idSezione=1385\" target=\"_blank\">Great Pompeii Project</a>. A crew restoring a 19th century palazzo slated to become the new library and offices of the archaeological superintendency came across a fragment of marble while doing depth tests on the foundations. Marble is very rarely used in Pompeiian funerary monuments, so archaeologists realized immediately that this could be something special. Because a new excavation was outside the parameters of the EU funding, they had to scrounge up 200,000 euros from the regular budget to dig the find site in anticipation of discovering something of significance. They were not disappointed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tomb-and-inscription.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48238\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tomb-and-inscription-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tomb-and-inscription-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tomb-and-inscription-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tomb-and-inscription-768x573.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tomb-and-inscription-430x321.jpg 430w\" title=\"The longest funerary inscription ever discovered in Pompeii.

The inscription carved into the marble facade is more than four meters (13 feet) long and has seven lines eulogizing the deceased\u2019s life and successes. He was grand even as a teenager, we are assured, when he hosted a great banquet to celerate his donning of the <em>toga virilis</em> (\u201ctoga of manhood\u201d) when he was 15-17 years old. He set up no fewer than 456 triclinia (formal dining rooms) to accomodate thousands of members of the public. Not content with merely feeding everyone, he treated them to games fielding 416 gladiators. We know from inscriptions and contemporary sources that no more than 30 pairs of gladiators fought in the regular games in Pompeii, so this figure is miles out of the ordinary, the kind of spectacle you\u2019d see in Rome, not in a modest southern Italian colony.</p>\n<p>Largess is a recurring theme in the <em>res gestae</em> of this prominet citizen. Other subjects covered in the inscription are his wedding and its extra fancy banquet, the political and religious offices he held, the many gladiatorial games and <em>venationes</em> (beast hunts) he sponsored, his generous gifts of silver coin to the people and moneys in support of magistrates and guilds. He was one of the <em>duoviri quinquennales</em> (the two heads of the city administration elected every five years with additional powers to update the census) and was acclaimed by the people as <em>patronus</em> of the city, which he humbly declines in the last line of the inscription because he is unworthy of so great an hour.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Inscription-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Inscription detail.

He\u2019s all but certain of the identity of the tomb\u2019s occupant. The details in the biographical inscription, the luxuriousness of the monument and its location near the tombs of the Alleius family strongly suggest this was the final resting place of Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius, <em>duoviri quinquennales</em> for 55-56 A.D. and an immensely rich and well-connected games impresario. No Pompeiian is better documented in the archaeological record. His name appears in 17 inscriptions, graffiti and edicts painted on the walls on the city. </p>\n<p>One of the edicts painted on the facade of the house of A. Trebus Valens on the Via dell\u2019Abbondanza advertises Maius\u2019 latest gift to the people: \u201cTwenty pairs of gladiators and their substitutes of the quinquennialis Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius will fight at Pompeii. No public monies will be used.\u201d Illustrating that any excuse will do to throw a party, another edict on the Via dell\u2019Abbondanza announces: \u201cFor the inauguration of the paintings on wood of Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius, on June 13th, there will be a parade, a hunt of wild beasts, fighters, and the velarium.\u201d Maius died a year before the cataclysmic eruption of Vesuvius that buried Pompeii in 79 A.D. </p>\n<p>He was very much a new man, a symbol of a society that was becoming increasingly mobile under the emperors of the 1st century. His father was a freedman who had made a fortune and had no bones about spending it on massively oversized celebrations to get his son started on a political career that would be largely based on throwing the biggest and best games in town. His humble beginnings were no deterrent to Maius\u2019 ascent. He was a personal friend to the emperor Nero, and indeed, may have been involved in the resolution of one of Pompeii\u2019s most explosive events before the literally explosive event that stopped the city in its tracks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Mural-of-Battle-at-the-Amphitheater-of-Pompeii.-Museo-Archeologico-Nazionale-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48244\" height=\"171\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Mural-of-Battle-at-the-Amphitheater-of-Pompeii.-Museo-Archeologico-Nazionale--200x171.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Mural-of-Battle-at-the-Amphitheater-of-Pompeii.-Museo-Archeologico-Nazionale--200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Mural-of-Battle-at-the-Amphitheater-of-Pompeii.-Museo-Archeologico-Nazionale--150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Mural-of-Battle-at-the-Amphitheater-of-Pompeii.-Museo-Archeologico-Nazionale--768x656.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Mural-of-Battle-at-the-Amphitheater-of-Pompeii.-Museo-Archeologico-Nazionale--430x367.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail from fresco in the house of Actius Anicetus depicting the amphitheater riot of 59 A.D. at Pompeii. Museo Archeologico Nazionale.\" width=\"200\"/></a>In 59 A.D., there was a giant and deadly brawl in the amphitheater between the local Pompeiians and the residents of nearby Nuceria, which had been a rival since Sulla\u2019s conquest of Pompeii in 80 B.C. Old resentments were stirred up afresh when Nero gave some Pompeiian territories to Nuceria two years before the fight at the amphitheater. This likely played a part in things coming to blows that day, although it\u2019s unknown exactly what sparked the conflict.</p>\n<p>Tacitus described this riot in <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.10.xiv.html\" target=\"_blank\">Book XIV of his <em>Annals</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>About the same time a trifling beginning led to frightful bloodshed between the inhabitants of Nuceria and Pompeii, at a gladiatorial show exhibited by Livineius Regulus, who had been, as I have related, expelled from the Senate. With the unruly spirit of townsfolk, they began with abusive language of each other; then they took up stones and at last weapons, the advantage resting with the populace of Pompeii, where the show was being exhibited. And so there were brought to Rome a number of the people of Nuceria, with their bodies mutilated by wounds, and many lamented the deaths of children or of parents. The emperor entrusted the trial of the case to the Senate, and the Senate to the consuls, and then again the matter being referred back to the Senators, the inhabitants of Pompeii were forbidden to have any such public gathering for ten years, and all associations they had formed in defiance of the laws were dissolved. Livineius and the others who had excited the disturbance, were punished with exile. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Before now, the Tacitus passage, a fresco in the house of Actius Anicetus and three graffiti found on walls at Pompeii were the only explicit references to the amphitheater riot of 59. The funerary inscription adds a key piece of information about this event. Thanks to the deceased\u2019s personal relationship with Nero, he was able to persuade him to allow the two duoviri exiled as punishment for the brawl to return to Pompeii. This is the only reference to the duoviri having been exiled as well as the only reference to the intercessionary role Maius played. It opens up the possibility that he was involved in the softening and lifting of the 10-year ban on public events at the amphitheater. It\u2019s known that some combat spectacles like animal hunts took place during the first three years of the ban, and it was lifted entirely in 62 A.D. to celebrate the restoration of the amphitheater after an earthquake.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tomb-excavated.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Excavation of the tomb.

It was probably in a larger font on a higher panel on the tomb facade which is now lost.

Round and about eight inches in diameter, the unusual box was made of three different kinds of wood: pine for the floor, willow for the curved side and spliced larch boughs for the seams joining floor to side. Radiocarbon testing found the box dates to the early Bronze Age, about 4,000 years ago.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bronze-Age-box-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48225\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bronze-Age-box-in-situ-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bronze-Age-box-in-situ-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bronze-Age-box-in-situ-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bronze-Age-box-in-situ-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bronze-Age-box-in-situ-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bronze-Age-box-in-situ.jpg 1500w\" title=\"Bronze Age box in situ.

An international team of <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2017/research/box-alps-wheat/\" target=\"_blank\">researchers analyzed the residue</a> expecting to find milk remnants, perhaps all that was left of a porridge type food. Samples of the residue were subjected to lipid and protein analysis. Researchers examined the samples using microscopic and molecular analysis to identify any lipids and gas chromatography mass spectrometry for the proteins, a combination of techniques commonly used to identify residue in ancient and prehistoric ceramic vessels which survive in far greater numbers than wooden ones. </p>\n<p>The results were surprising. Instead of milk remnants, the team found alkylresorcinols, indicators of the presence of whole grains. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Andr\u00e9 Colonese, from BioArCh, Department of Archaeology, University of York, said : \u201cWe didn\u2019t find any evidence of milk, but we found these phenolic lipids, which have never been reported before in an archaeological artefact, but are abundant in the bran of wheat and rye cereals and considered biomarkers of wholegrain intake in nutritional studies\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an extraordinary discovery if you consider that of all domesticated plants, wheat is the most widely grown crop in the world and the most important food grain source for humans, lying at the core of many contemporary culinary traditions.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the greatest challenges of lipid analysis in archaeology has been finding biomarkers for plants, there are only a few and they do not preserve very well in ancient artefacts. You can imagine the relevance of this study as we have now a new tool for tracking early culinary use of cereal grains, it really is very exciting. The next step is to look for them in ceramic artefacts,\u201d Dr Colonese added. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wheat-traces-on-the-bottom-of-box.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48213\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wheat-traces-on-the-bottom-of-box-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wheat-traces-on-the-bottom-of-box-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wheat-traces-on-the-bottom-of-box-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wheat-traces-on-the-bottom-of-box-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wheat-traces-on-the-bottom-of-box-430x323.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wheat-traces-on-the-bottom-of-box.jpg 800w\" title=\"Wheat traces (the dark spot in the middle) on the floor of the box.

Some of the valleys in the area are known to have been inhabited during the Bronze Age, and grave goods have been discovered in burials in the neighboring canton of Valais that were imports from north and south of the mountains. The L\u00f6tschenpass may have been part of a trade route linking the Bernese Highlands to the Valais. Or it may not have anything to do with trade, just a box lunch packed by a lone hiker on a hunt or a drover pasturing cattle at higher altitudes than archaeologists realized were being used for grazing during this period.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Francesco Carrer, from Newcastle University, said: \u201cThis evidence sheds new light on life in prehistoric alpine communities, and on their relationship with the extreme high altitudes.

Between 6th and 9th centuries, the promontory fort at the site of the modern town of Burghead dominated the region. It was the largest of its time, three times larger than any other fort in Scotland. It is also the oldest known Pictish fort.</p>\n<p>Its true origin and great historical significance wasn\u2019t understood in the early 19th century. The fort was believed to be Roman, \u201cthe Ultima Ptoroton of Richard of Cirencester and Alta Castra of Ptolemy,\u201d as Major-General William Roy <a href=\"https://canmore.org.uk/collection/1216190\" target=\"_blank\">labelled it in his drawing</a> of the floor plan and sections of what was left of the fort in 1793. You might think that its purported Roman origin and association with the 2nd century writer Ptolemy who was believed to have described it in his <em>Geography</em> would be sufficient to ensure some degree of preservation, but you would be wrong. More than half of the fort\u2019s surviving remains were destroyed when the town of Burghead was built between 1805 and 1809. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Burghead-Bull-British-Museum.-Photo-by-Ealdgyth.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Burghead Bull, British Museum.

Now known to be rare Pictish stones, most of them were casually reused as construction materials in the quay wall of the new harbour and are considered lost. Today only six of the Burghead Bulls survive, two in the Burghead visitor centre, the rest in the Elgin Museum, the National Museum of Scotland and <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=63864&amp;partId=1\" target=\"_blank\">the British Museum</a>. All that\u2019s left of the Pictish fort above ground are some lengths of the earth and rubble inner ramparts and a snippet of one of the outer ramparts on the southern side. A subterranean ritual well in a rock-cut chamber discovered during utilities work in 1809 is the most intact remnant of the fort. </p>\n<p>Archaeological digs at Burghead began in the late 19th century (less than a hundred years from \u201cwho cares?\u201d obliteration to desperately seeking antiquity). They usually focused on the perimeter of the structure \u2014 the inner and outer ramparts, the defensive wall \u2014 and while the occasional artifact was found, the fort was generally considered to have been gutted beyond recovery by the construction of the town and harbour. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Burghead-Fort-excavation.-University-of-Aberdeen..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48216\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Burghead-Fort-excavation.-University-of-Aberdeen.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Burghead-Fort-excavation.-University-of-Aberdeen.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Burghead-Fort-excavation.-University-of-Aberdeen.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Burghead-Fort-excavation.-University-of-Aberdeen.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Burghead-Fort-excavation.-University-of-Aberdeen.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Burghead Fort archaeological dig. Photo courtesy the University of Aberdeen.\" width=\"200\"/></a>University of Aberdeen archaeologists have been excavating the site since 2015 and <a href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/10979/\" target=\"_blank\">this season has seen remarkable discoveries</a>: evidence of a Pictish longhouse and a late 9th century Anglo-Saxon coin of Alfred the Great. Pictish architectural remains are rare and there are major lacunae in our understanding of Pictish buildings. The longhouse gives archaeologists a unique opportunity to study the Picts\u2019 living spaces within a great fort. The coin not only helped establish the dates for the occupation of the longhouse, but it is from a key transitional period when Viking raiders began savaging Pictish territories and would ultimately bring about the demise of Pictish kingdoms.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Gordon Noble, Head of Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen, said: \u201cThe assumption has always been that there was nothing left at Burghead; that it was all trashed in the 19th century but nobody\u2019s really looked at the interior to see if there\u2019s anything that survives inside the fort.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut beneath the 19th century debris, we have started to find significant Pictish remains. We appear to have found a Pictish longhouse. This is important because Burghead is likely to have been one of the key royal centres of Northern Pictland and understanding the nature of settlement within the fort is key to understanding how power was materialised within these important fortified sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anglo-Saxon-coin-of-Alfred-the-Great.-University-of-Aberdeen..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48217\" height=\"159\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anglo-Saxon-coin-of-Alfred-the-Great.-University-of-Aberdeen.-200x159.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anglo-Saxon-coin-of-Alfred-the-Great.-University-of-Aberdeen.-200x159.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anglo-Saxon-coin-of-Alfred-the-Great.-University-of-Aberdeen.-150x119.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anglo-Saxon-coin-of-Alfred-the-Great.-University-of-Aberdeen.-768x610.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anglo-Saxon-coin-of-Alfred-the-Great.-University-of-Aberdeen.-430x342.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Anglo-Saxon-coin-of-Alfred-the-Great.-University-of-Aberdeen..jpg 1511w\" title=\"Anglo-Saxon coin of Alfred the Great.

The coin is also interesting as it shows that the fort occupants were able to tap into long-distance trade networks. The coin is also pierced, perhaps for wearing; it shows that the occupants of the fort in this non-monetary economy literally wore their wealth.</p>\n<p>\u201cOverall these findings suggest that there is still valuable information that can be recovered from Burghead which would tell us more about this society at a significant time for northern Scotland \u2013 just as Norse settlers were consolidating their power in Shetland and Orkney and launching attacks on mainland Scotland.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Longhouse, Anglo-Saxon coin found at destroyed Pictish fort\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48215\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48215#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48201\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48201\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to New imaging approach reveals hidden text from two eras\">New imaging approach reveals hidden text from two eras</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, July 25th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Book-examined-with-different-imaging-techniques.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48208\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Book-examined-with-different-imaging-techniques-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Book-examined-with-different-imaging-techniques-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Book-examined-with-different-imaging-techniques-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Book-examined-with-different-imaging-techniques-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Book-examined-with-different-imaging-techniques-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"16th century copy of Hesiod examined with different imaging techniques by Northwestern researchers.

The writing was washed or scrubbed off and the leaves filling with new content. Because so many ancient works have been lost, scholars have for centuries attempted to <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/41391\" target=\"_blank\">recover the original texts</a> from these medieval palimpsests, often using caustic materials that damaged the pages in the long term. Nowadays researchers have much better options thanks largely to a panoply of imaging technologies that have been a godsend to the study of palimpsests, revealing erased and overwritten text that cannot be seen with the naked eye. Synchrotron imaging is better than Superman because it can <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/39264\" target=\"_blank\">see through lead boxes</a>. </p>\n<p>Some of the recycled parchments pose greater challenges than others. With the introduction of the printing press to Europe in the 15th century, the demand for bookmaking materials soared. Not only were medieval manuscripts cannibalized for their pages, but the bindings were reused to bind newly printed books. This was a common practice well into the 18th century, so there are a lot of old printed books out there with fragments of medieval and ancient texts hidden in the binding. Scholars knew there might be literary treasures in there, but were stumped by the difficulty of accessing and reading binding materials.</p>\n<p>Now researchers at Northwestern University <a href=\"http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2017/07/fused-imaging-reveals-sixth-century-writing-hidden-inside-bookbinding.html\" target=\"_blank\">have made a breakthrough</a>. It was a book from the university library\u2019s collection that inspired the new approach. It\u2019s an edition of the <em>Works and Days</em> by the Greek poet Hesiod that was printed in Venice in 1537. Northwestern acquired it in 1870 and out of the 30 known surviving copies of the edition, this is the only one that still has its original slotted parchment binding, a widely used technique in Venice from 1490 to 1670 in which slots were cut into the binding parchment to match the shape of the book spine. </p>\n<p>Slotted parchment bindings often used recycled parchments. The ink was usually removed for aesthetic purposes, to make the outside surface of the parchment a uniform color. In this particular book, the ink on the interior parchment surface was not removed. Iron gall ink is acidic and over time, speeds up the oxidation and decay of the parchment. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Text-is-hard-to-read-with-the-naked-eye.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48202\" height=\"226\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Text-is-hard-to-read-with-the-naked-eye.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-200x226.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Text-is-hard-to-read-with-the-naked-eye.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-200x226.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Text-is-hard-to-read-with-the-naked-eye.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-133x150.jpg 133w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Text-is-hard-to-read-with-the-naked-eye.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-768x869.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Text-is-hard-to-read-with-the-naked-eye.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-430x487.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Text-is-hard-to-read-with-the-naked-eye.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet..jpg 1237w\" title=\"Two columns of ancient text emerge from binding of 16th century edition of Hesiod. Photo by Emeline Pouyet.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Northwestern librarians noticed the slotted parchment binding in the Hesiod and realized its significance. They also saw the faintest hint of text on the book board. Researchers from the Northwestern University-Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies (NU-ACCESS) examined the binding in greater detail and found evidence that the writing on the book board had been removed, likely by the bookbinder, by washing or scraping. His efforts weren\u2019t entirely effective, much to our advantage. Over time the gall ink that wasn\u2019t removed had degraded the parchment and the writing began to re-emerge. NU-ACCESS researchers found two columns of text plus marginalia were very dimly visible through the parchment on the front and back covers of the book.</p>\n<p>The writing wasn\u2019t legible with the naked eye, so scientists Marc Walton and Emeline Pouyet turned to imaging, starting with visible light hyperspectral imaging. The writing became a little clearer, but it still couldn\u2019t be read. X-ray fluorescence imaging gave the team new information about the chemical composition of the ink, but again, it wasn\u2019t able to bring the ancient text out of hiding. They were going to need a bigger boat, to paraphrase <em>Jaws</em>, and the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) was that boat. </p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]he bright x-ray source and fast detection system allowed for a full imaging of the main text and marginalia comments in the entire bookbinding. When the researchers sent the more clearly imaged writing to [Northwestern history and religion professor Richard] Kieckhefer, he immediately recognized it as sixth-century Roman Law code [the <em>Institutes Justinian</em>], with interpretive notes referring to the Canon Law written in the margins. </p>\n<p>Walton and Pouyet hypothesize that the parchment originally might have been used in a university setting where Roman Law was studied as a basis for understanding Canon Law, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages. The legal writing was then possibly covered and recycled because it was outdated as society had already struck down the Roman laws to implement church code.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cornell-High-Energy-Synchrotron-Source-imaging-reveals-entire-text.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48203\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cornell-High-Energy-Synchrotron-Source-imaging-reveals-entire-text.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-200x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cornell-High-Energy-Synchrotron-Source-imaging-reveals-entire-text.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-200x128.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cornell-High-Energy-Synchrotron-Source-imaging-reveals-entire-text.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cornell-High-Energy-Synchrotron-Source-imaging-reveals-entire-text.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-768x490.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cornell-High-Energy-Synchrotron-Source-imaging-reveals-entire-text.-Photo-by-Emeline-Pouyet.-430x274.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source imaging reveals entire text. Photo by Emeline Pouyet.\" width=\"200\"/></a>It was an exciting find, but the NU-ACCESS team had greater ambitions. Synchrotrons aren\u2019t exactly a dime a dozen, and most researchers don\u2019t have access to the powerful (and expensive) equipment. Even if they do, rare old books in delicate condition can\u2019t always be shipped to a synchrotron facility. For conservation reasons, they often can\u2019t be shipped anywhere at all. Walton and Pouyet turned to Northwestern\u2019s computer scientists to seek a cheaper, more readily available technology that would be able to read challenging palimpsest texts trapped in bookbindings.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThere is a vast number of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, and each wavelength has its advantages and disadvantages,\u201d said [Aggelos] Katsaggelos, the Joseph Cummings Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. \u201cSome of them can penetrate deeper into the specimen, some of them have better resolution, and so on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Using a machine-learning algorithm developed by his team, Katsaggelos discovered that not one imaging technique but a fusion of two would yield the best results. His team combined visible hyperspectral imaging, which includes wavelengths within the visible light spectrum to provide high spatial resolution, with x-ray fluorescence imaging, which provides high intensity resolution. The algorithm informed the researchers of the relative contribution of each modality to produce the best image.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy combining the two modalities, we had the advantages of each,\u201d Katsaggelos said. \u201cWe were able to read successfully what was inside the cover of the book.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsaggelos\u2019 data fusion image was so clear that it rivaled an image of the main text produced by the powerful x-ray beams at CHESS.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Walton and Pouyet plan to take this show on the road. They want to examine books in museums and other institutions using the combination of hyperspectral imaging and x-ray fluorescence to read hidden texts on pages and bindings.

About two kilometers (1.2 miles) long, the canal was meant to link the Swabian Rezat river in Treuchtlingen to the Altm\u00fchl river in Weissenburg, Bavaria. The Rezat is in the Rhine basin and the Altm\u00fchl is a tributary of the Danube, so the ultimate idea behind the canal was creating a navigable water route that would allow easy boat travel between the Rhine and the Danube. </p>\n<p>Whether it was a practicable solution in real life was a whole other ball of wax. According to the Revised Royal Frankish Annals, Charlemagne was \u201cpersuaded by self-styled experts that one could travel most conveniently from the Danube into the Rhine if a navigable canal was built between the rivers Rezat and Altm\u00fchl.\u201d Reliable canal-linked fluvial transport was immensely important to Charlemagne in 793. He had been forced to end his 791 campaign against the Avars south of the Danube when his cavalry was stricken by the Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus. The deadly mosquito-borne illness killed 90% of Charlemagne\u2019s horses and other equines \u2014 war steeds, travel mounts, pack animals \u2014 in a matter of days. The few equines that survived a bout of EEE would have been severely disabled, suffering from brain damage and neurological symptoms that made it impossible for them to perform their usual duties of combat and transportation.</p>\n<p>This was a logistical headache of brain-shattering proportions. Without horses and mules, the army\u2019s supplies, weapons, armour and assorted gear had to be carried by people, at least some of it by horseless cavalrymen, to the Danube where it was loaded on boats. Charlemagne\u2019s forces were so hobbled by the mass death of its equines that he wasn\u2019t able to go on campaign for two years, and Charlemagne fought every year of his kingship, missing only four in total.</p>\n<p>If the canal worked as planned, fluvial transportation \u2014 faster, cheaper and not subject to epidemics \u2014 would make it possible for Charlemagne to get back to his military campaigns against the Avars and rebellious Saxons, a war on two fronts that would have been enormously facilitated by a canal linking the Rhine and Danube. He would have been able to use large boats, not pack animals, to move equipment and supplies down the Danube in a new campaign against the Avars the next year. In addition, the actual digging of the canal required few horses, a big plus in a time of such equine scarcity.</p>\n<p>It was such an important project that Charlemagne took up residence in Weissenburg in the fall of 793 to oversee construction of the canal. He personally saw to the hiring of a large team of builders. Under his direct supervision, the crew dug a moat 2,000 feet long and 300 feet wide. Again according to the Annals, canal constructed ended abortively, defeated by the marshy ground and constant rainfall which caused \u201cwhat the workmen dug during the day, fell back in at night.\u201d Other chroniclers claim the canal was in fact completed. Either way, Charlemagne\u2019s attention was diverted to more pressing matters: fresh revolts in Saxony and attacks on Narbonne and Carcassonne by Umayyad Emir Hisham I of C\u00f3rdoba. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Eastern-end-of-channel-block-with-wood-pilings-discovered-in-2013.-University-of-Jena.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48191\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Eastern-end-of-channel-block-with-wood-pilings-discovered-in-2013.-University-of-Jena-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Eastern-end-of-channel-block-with-wood-pilings-discovered-in-2013.-University-of-Jena-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Eastern-end-of-channel-block-with-wood-pilings-discovered-in-2013.-University-of-Jena-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Eastern-end-of-channel-block-with-wood-pilings-discovered-in-2013.-University-of-Jena-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Eastern-end-of-channel-block-with-wood-pilings-discovered-in-2013.-University-of-Jena-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Eastern end of channel block with wood pilings discovered in 2013.

There\u2019s a water-filled moat about 350 meters (1148 feet) long in Treuchtlingen. Earthen embankments almost 4,000 feet long and more than 30 feet high also survive, created by the soil dug out of ground during the early construction of the canal. Over the past five years or so, archaeologists have discovered the northernmost section of the structure which is not visible above ground.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Interlaced-wood.-Photo-L.-Werther..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48194\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Interlaced-wood.-Photo-L.-Werther.-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Interlaced-wood.-Photo-L.-Werther.-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Interlaced-wood.-Photo-L.-Werther.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Interlaced-wood.-Photo-L.-Werther.-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Interlaced-wood.-Photo-L.-Werther.-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Interlaced wood used to shore up the structure during construction, found in 2016 excavation.

A team of researchers from German universities and the Bavarian State Office for the Protection of Monuments have discovered that <a href=\"http://www.uni-jena.de/Forschungsmeldungen/FM170703_Karlsgraben.html\" target=\"_blank\">the canal is older than the Royal Annals recorded</a>. The question of when construction of the Fossa Carolina began has been a fraught one among historians for a century. The Alemannic Annals claim that canal construction began in 792, which would mean that Charlemagne\u2019s stay in Weissenburg was a visit to an ongoing building site, not a new one he was personally supervising. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Southern-trench-with-pilings.-Photo-L.-Werther..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48193\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Southern-trench-with-pilings.-Photo-L.-Werther.-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Southern-trench-with-pilings.-Photo-L.-Werther.-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Southern-trench-with-pilings.-Photo-L.-Werther.-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Southern-trench-with-pilings.-Photo-L.-Werther.-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Southern-trench-with-pilings.-Photo-L.-Werther.-430x574.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Southern-trench-with-pilings.-Photo-L.-Werther..jpg 1594w\" title=\"Wood pilings in the southern-most of the two trenches, unearthed in 2016 excavation.

A follow-up excavation in 2016 went even further, digging two trenches across two of the northern canal sections. The team unearthed numerous structural elements, including large oak pilings lining the canal walls that were in an excellent state of preservation thanks to the high groundwater level and a deposit of sediments immediately after construction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Karlsgraben-oak-pilings.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48190\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Karlsgraben-oak-pilings-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Karlsgraben-oak-pilings-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Karlsgraben-oak-pilings-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Karlsgraben-oak-pilings-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Karlsgraben-oak-pilings-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Oak pilings found in 2016 excavation. Photo by Lukas Werther / FSU.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The team was able to date more than two dozen timbers using dendrochronological analysis, an incredible bounty for high precision absolute dating. Tree ring analysis can pinpoint dates down to the year, sometimes even the month, and the youngest of the canal timbers tested date to the late spring or early summer (probably May) of 793. This was freshly cut wood. It hadn\u2019t been stored for a few months before use in the canal. </p>\n<blockquote><p>This shows that the construction work at the Karlsgraben started several months earlier than was previously known. The description in the sources that the command for the construction of the canal has already taken place in 792 is thus significantly more likely. For the first time, the historical and political framework conditions of the decision to build the canal can now be clarified. The new dating also shows that Charlemagne visited a construction site, which had already begun several months earlier in the late summer/autumn of 793, and was by no means the \u201cfirst spade\u201d. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>In the coming months, the new dates will be analyzed in detail and combined with numerous other results from the interdisciplinary research group. Due to the precise and different dates the researchers expect for the first time indications for the construction direction of individual channel sections and organizational details of the large construction site. New results are also to be expected regarding the completion or non-completion of individual construction sections.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Oldest part of Charlemagne\u2019s canal is even older, dig finds\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48189\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48189#comments\">11 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-48030\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48030\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Quilts made by men at war to go on display\">Quilts made by men at war to go on display</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, July 23rd, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Three years ago, St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London restored and displayed a hand-made altar frontal that had been by intricately embroidered by 133 convalescing soldiers during World War I.

It was a longstanding tradition that during lulls in fighting, while prisoners of war or over extended hospital visits, they would hand-stitch quilts, <a href=\"http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=311\" target=\"_blank\">wool work seascapes</a> and embroider their own uniforms. Sailors maintained ships\u2019 sails as part of their duties and therefore had basic sewing skills. Soldiers didn\u2019t have the same job requirement, so if they knew how to sew it was either fortuitous or professional; i.e., they had been tailors in civilian life and were often employed as regimental tailors in the military. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9.soldier_musician-copy.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48129\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9.soldier_musician-copy-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9.soldier_musician-copy-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9.soldier_musician-copy-200x249.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9.soldier_musician-copy-768x958.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9.soldier_musician-copy-430x536.jpg 430w\" title='Intarsia Quilt with Soldiers and Musicians Artist unidentified; initialed \u201cJ.S.J.\u201d Prussia c. 1760\u20131780 Wool, with embroidery thread; intarsia, hand-appliqu\u00e9d and hand-embroidered 55 x 43\" The Annette Gero Collection Photo by Tim Connolly, Shoot Studios.' width=\"120\"/></a>Some of the earliest surviving examples were made in the 18th century using the intarsia technique in which fabric pieces are cut in precise shapes and sewn together so that no seams show. These types of quilts are so difficult to produce that it\u2019s likely they were created by professionals. The imagery is often related to the wars being fought and national identity \u2014 comrades, the fatherland, traditional folk tales, etc. The quilts produced in wartime by military men of all levels of stitchcraft experience often used uniform pieces, blankets and random snippets of whatever other textiles they could get their hands on to create geometric designs of dazzling intricacy. </p>\n<p>The American Folk Art Museum in New York is <a href=\"http://www.artfixdaily.com/artwire/release/8701-quilts-made-by-men-in-wartime-coming-to-american-folk-art-museum\" target=\"_blank\">putting on the first US exhibition</a> of quilts made by fighting men in wartime from uniform fabric.

Quilts pieced in simple geometric patterns may indeed have been made in such circumstances, but it is now recognized that the most elaborate quilts were most probably stitched by tailors and soldiers to pass the time and stay out of mischief, to give as gifts to loved ones at home, or were made upon a soldier\u2019s return.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33.chessboard.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48130\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 124px) 100vw, 124px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33.chessboard-124x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33.chessboard-124x150.jpg 124w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33.chessboard-200x242.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33.chessboard-768x930.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33.chessboard-430x521.jpg 430w\" title='Quilt with Inlaid Chessboard, Artist unidentified, Silesia, Mid-nineteenth century, Wool from military uniforms, 74 x 61\".

Found in a burial chamber, it was used for a sweet sherbet-like drink, and dates back to 1,700 BC. </p>\n<p>Archaeologists only realised the smile was there when the pot was taken to a lab for restoration work, Turkish news agency Anadolou reported. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Occupied from the 6th millennium B.C. until it was abandoned in the late Middle Ages, the remains of Karkemish were first discovered and excavated in the late 19th century. Some illustrious figures \u2014 T.E. Lawrence, Leonard Woolley, Gertrude Bell \u2014 participated in later digs before and after World I. Even with this long history of archaeological exploration, the site still had much to reveal. The <a href=\"http://www.orientlab.net/karkemish/web/\" target=\"_blank\">joint Turkey and Italian team</a> has been excavating Karkemish every year since 2011. The smiley pitcher was found this season, which began on May 2nd, and it was not the only important discovery.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Clay-bullae.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48174\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Clay-bullae-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Clay-bullae-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Clay-bullae-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Clay-bullae-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Clay-bullae-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Clay-bullae.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Some of the 250 clay bullae found this dig season. Photo courtesy the Turco-Italian Archaeological Expedition at Karkemish.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The team also unearthed 250 <em>bullae</em>, clay tokens impressed with seals that would be attached to legal and commercial documents as proof identity and authenticity. The seals were found in the late Bronze Age layer and date to the Hittite Empire in the 13th century B.C. when Karkemish was the seat of the Hittite viceroy who controlled the entire region. Among the 250 <em>bullae</em> are the seals of some of the highest ranking individuals in the Hittite administration of the city, most notably that of Taya or Tahe, prince and \u201ccharioteer of the goddess Kubaba.\u201d Researchers are excited by the great number of <em>bullae</em> recovered because they hope the seals will reveal new information about the people, trade and administrative systems of Karkemish during its most prosperous period.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Griffons-relief.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-48176\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Griffons-relief-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Griffons-relief-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Griffons-relief-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Griffons-relief-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Griffons-relief-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Griffons-relief.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Basalt relief with two rampant griffons, ca. 10th century B.C.

It was carved at the end of the 10th century B.C. during the reign of the Neo-Hittite king Katuwa who was better known for his construction and sculptural endeavors than his prowess on the battlefield. The griffon relief is believed to be one of a pair with a relief of a winged bull discovered during last year\u2019s excavation. Archaeologists found significant architectural remains as well, including the remains of a massive fortress and a grain silo, both dating to the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, around 1100 B.C. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Grain-silo-from-fall-of-Hittite-Empire-ca.-1100-BC.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48175\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Grain-silo-from-fall-of-Hittite-Empire-ca.-1100-BC-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Grain-silo-from-fall-of-Hittite-Empire-ca.-1100-BC-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Grain-silo-from-fall-of-Hittite-Empire-ca.-1100-BC-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Grain-silo-from-fall-of-Hittite-Empire-ca.-1100-BC-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Grain-silo-from-fall-of-Hittite-Empire-ca.-1100-BC-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Grain-silo-from-fall-of-Hittite-Empire-ca.-1100-BC.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Grain silo from fall of Hittite Empire, ca. 1100 B.C.

Karkemish is in a militarily sensitive area and access has long been restricted. The Turkish Minister of Culture and Tourism announced earlier this month that on May 12th, 2018, the site will open its doors as the Karkemish Ancient City Archaeological Park. The smiley jug will go on display at the nearby Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology. </p>\n<p>There is a whole new sense of urgency and meaning behind the excavations and the upcoming archaeological park. On the Syrian side of the border, the civil war has taken an unbearably onerous toll on its rich ancient history. While some of the most precious and beautiful archaeological remains in the world have been brutalized by ISIS and other belligerents in this quagmire from hell, excavation and conservation of ancient material culture has continued undeterred just over the border in Turkey.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Smiley found painted on 3,700-year-old pitcher\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48171\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/48171#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2017/07/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

excavated in a lab in Boldre. Photo courtesy the Portable Antiquities Scheme.\" width=\"200\"/></a>A hoard of 1,608 coins Roman coins discovered by metal detectorists in a field it Boldre, in the New Forest near Lymington, Hampshire, in 2014, has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-40768334\" target=\"_blank\">gone on public display for the first time</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.stbarbe-museum.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">St Barbe Museum and Art Gallery</a> in Lymington. The hoard dates to the 3rd century A.D. and contains bronze radiates from the second half of the 3rd century. The earliest coin in the group was minted under the reign of Trebonianus Gallus (249-51 A.D.). The most recent is barely 25 years older, struck in 276 in the waning days of the emperor Tacitus (275-6 A.D.). The bulk of the coins were found in the remains of a round vessel, 15 sherds from the bottom of the earthenware pot.</p>\n<p>After slumbering underground for more than 1,700 years since its owner buried his savings, disturbed only by the farm equipment that likely broke the pot, the hoard has seen quite a bit of drama <a href=\"http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/14127466.Row_over_1_600_Roman_coin_find_ends_metal_detectorists__friendship/\" target=\"_blank\">starting with the moment of its discovery</a>. There were several metal detectorists scanning that field in Boldre on May 4th, 2014, among them two old friends Andy Aartsen and James Petts. Aartsen made the first discovery: 25-30 coins on their own. Then Petts hit the motherlode, finding the remains of the pot and its coin hoard of more than 1,500 pieces.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Coin-of-Postumus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-48260\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Coin-of-Postumus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-200x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Coin-of-Postumus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Coin-of-Postumus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Coin-of-Postumus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-768x382.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Coin-of-Postumus.-Photo-courtesy-the-Portable-Antiquities-Scheme.-430x214.jpg 430w\" title=\"Radiate of Postumus (260-9 A.D.) from Boldre Hoard. Photo courtesy the Portable Antiquities Scheme.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Aartsen had scanned that area earlier and gotten a signal but had moved on. According to the rules of the metal detecting club, if you walk away from a signal it counts as abandonment and the next guy gets to pick up where you left off, but Aartsen apparently thought his earlier signal granted him perpetual rights because he told Petts \u201cEff off, it\u2019s mine.\u201d That\u2019s a quote from James Petts\u2019 testimony at the coroner\u2019s inquest that determined whether the coin hoard was official treasure by the standards of the Treasure Act of 1996, which is downright spicy compared to the usual testimony from British Museum and Portable Antiquities Scheme experts one encounters at treasure inquests.</p>\n<p>The conflict caused a permanent rift between the former friends, and it really wasn\u2019t about the money because bronze radiates aren\u2019t big ticket items. The amount of the valuation that would be paid by the museum that acquired the hoard was around \u00a38,000 to be split 50/50 by the finder and landowner. This fight was all about credit, who gets to be the official finder of the Boldre Hoard. Andy Aartsen wanted to be declared the sole finder; Petts wanted it declared a joint find of both men, which seems more than fair given that he found the vast majority of the hoard and the container. At the time of the inquest, the dispute was still ongoing and Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short suggested the two ex-friends might have to duke it out in court if they couldn\u2019t come to an agreement.

The hoard dates to the 3rd century A.D. and contains bronze radiates from the second half of the 3rd century. The earliest coin in the group was minted under the reign of Trebonianus Gallus (249-51 A.D.). The most recent is barely 25 years older, struck in 276 in the waning days of the emperor Tacitus (275-6 A.D.). The bulk of the coins were found in the remains of a round vessel, 15 sherds from the bottom of the earthenware pot. After slumbering underground for more than 1,700 years since its owner buried his savings, disturbed only by the farm equipment that likely broke the pot, the hoard has seen quite a bit of drama starting with the moment of its discovery. There were several metal detectorists scanning that field in Boldre on May 4th, 2014, among them two old friends Andy Aartsen and James Petts. Aartsen made the first discovery: 25-30 coins on their own. Then Petts hit the motherlode, finding the remains of the pot and its coin hoard of more than 1,500 pieces. Aartsen had scanned that area earlier and gotten a signal but had moved on. According to the rules of the metal detecting club, if you walk away from a signal it counts as abandonment and the next guy gets to pick up where you left off, but Aartsen apparently thought his earlier signal granted him perpetual rights because he told Petts \u201cEff off, it\u2019s mine.\u201d That\u2019s a quote from James Petts\u2019 testimony at the coroner\u2019s inquest that determined whether the coin hoard was official treasure by the standards of the Treasure Act of 1996, which is downright spicy compared to the usual testimony from British Museum and Portable Antiquities Scheme experts one encounters at treasure inquests. The conflict caused a permanent rift between the former friends, and it really wasn\u2019t about the money because bronze radiates aren\u2019t big ticket items. The amount of the valuation that would be paid by the museum that acquired the hoard was around \u00a38,000 to be split 50/50 by the finder and landowner. This fight was all about credit, who gets to be the official finder of the Boldre Hoard. Andy Aartsen wanted to be declared the sole finder; Petts wanted it declared a joint find of both men, which seems more than fair given that he found the vast majority of the hoard and the container. At the time of the inquest, the dispute was still ongoing and Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short suggested the two ex-friends might have to duke it out in court if they couldn\u2019t come to an agreement. I couldn\u2019t discover what the disposition their dispute was, but the articles about the new exhibition refer only to James Petts as the finder.

The St Barbe Museum and Art Gallery wanted to keep every coin and the pot together and put them on display a few miles away from where they were discovered and that was going to require some fast fundraising. Rosalyn Goulding, of the museum, said the coins were an \u201cexciting\u201d find for the town. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had too much evidence of Roman activity here but this find helps us to build up a picture of settlement and agriculture,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the coins is really interesting because it has an unrecorded reverse. \u201cThe emperors would strike a series of coins and they each had a pattern to them \u2013 they would have similar things on the front and on the reverse \u2013 but this one had an altar on the back which has never before been seen on a Divus Victorious coin, or any coins issued by Victorious.\u201d Historian and television presenter Dan Snow who lives in the area launched the fundraising campaign last fall with a target of \u00a330,000 ($40,000).

If you\u2019ve ever found yourself following the intricate interlacing lines and curves of an Anglo-Saxon design, trying to identify a highly stylized animal or face mask, then you\u2019ve doubtless wished for a labeled map. British Museum curator Rosie Weetch and illustrator Craig Williams have made that wish come true.</p>\n<p>They select three pieces from different periods to decode. The first is a silver-gilt square-headed brooch that was unearthed from the grave of a woman on the Isle of Wight in 1855. It was cast in silver and gilded on the front surface, a technique influenced by southern Scandinavian metalwork. Created in the early 6th century A.D., the brooch is a beautiful example of Style I art, characterized by a jumble of interwoven figures art historians amusingly call \u201canimal salad.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>Its surface is covered with at least 24 different beasts: a mix of birds\u2019 heads, human masks, animals and hybrids. Some of them are quite clear, like the faces in the circular lobes projecting from the bottom of the brooch. Others are harder to spot, such as the faces in profile that only emerge when the brooch is turned upside-down. Some of the images can be read in multiple ways, and this ambiguity is central to Style I art.</p>\n<p>Once we have identified the creatures on the brooch, we can begin to decode its meaning. In the lozenge-shaped field at the foot of the brooch is a bearded face with a helmet underneath two birds that may represent the Germanic god Woden/Odin with his two companion ravens. The image of a god alongside other powerful animals may have offered symbolic protection to the wearer like a talisman or amulet.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Brooch-decoded.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Silver-gilt square-headed brooch, early 6th c.

It\u2019s a Style II piece, characterized by more fluid intertwined animal figures. There are 13 animals on the buckle surface: snakes and four-legged creatures on the plate and tongue shield, snakes biting themselves on the loop, two animals biting a smaller animal on the top of the buckle, and two bird heads on the shoulders of the buckle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Such designs reveal the importance of the natural world, and it is likely that different animals were thought to hold different properties and characteristics that could be transferred to the objects they decorated. The fearsome snakes, with their shape-shifting qualities, demand respect and confer authority, and were suitable symbols for a buckle that adorned a high-status man, or even an Anglo-Saxon king.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/great-gold-buckle-from-Sutton-Hoo-decoded.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Great buckle from Sutton Hoo and interpretive map\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-30722\" height=\"387\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/great-gold-buckle-from-Sutton-Hoo-decoded-430x387.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/great-gold-buckle-from-Sutton-Hoo-decoded-430x387.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/great-gold-buckle-from-Sutton-Hoo-decoded-150x135.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/great-gold-buckle-from-Sutton-Hoo-decoded-200x180.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/great-gold-buckle-from-Sutton-Hoo-decoded.jpg 960w\" title=\"Great buckle from Sutton Hoo and interpretive map\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The last piece skips ahead to the 9th century Trewhiddle Style, named after the town in Cornwall where a hoard of Anglo-Saxon coins and decorated artifacts were discovered in a tin mine in 1774. The style is distinguished by enlaced animals, birds and humans, leafy scrollwork and a particular emphasis on using silver rather than gold and brass. The Fuller Brooch features the classic Trewhiddle humans, animals and plants along the border, but the central iconography is unique.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the centre is a man with staring eyes holding two plants. Around him are four other men striking poses: one, with his hands behind his back, sniffs a leaf; another rubs his two hands together; the third holds his hand up to his ear; and the final one has his whole hand inserted into his mouth. Together these strange poses form the earliest personification of the five senses: Sight, Smell, Touch, Hearing, and Taste. Surrounding these central motifs are roundels depicting animals, humans, and plants that perhaps represent God\u2019s Creation.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/five-senses-on-the-Fuller-Brooch.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Fuller Brooch and map of the five senses\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-30721\" height=\"191\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/five-senses-on-the-Fuller-Brooch-430x191.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/five-senses-on-the-Fuller-Brooch-430x191.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/five-senses-on-the-Fuller-Brooch-150x66.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/five-senses-on-the-Fuller-Brooch-200x89.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/five-senses-on-the-Fuller-Brooch.jpg 960w\" title=\"Fuller Brooch and map of the five senses\" width=\"430\"/></a></p>\n<p>The metaphoric significance of these figures, its best-in-class quality and the unique vision of the piece may suggest a connection to the court of King Alfred the Great, who was not only a successful military leader but also had a deep and abiding passion for learning and education. The long period of Viking raids had decimated centers of learning. Alfred made it a mission to reinvigorate Latin education and, for the first time, to advocate learning in the English vernacular. He put his money where his mouth was, personally translating four major works from Latin into Old English: <em>Pastoral Care</em> by Gregory the Great, <em>The Consolation of Philosophy</em> by Boethius, St. Augustine\u2019s <em>Soliloquies</em>, and the first fifty psalms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=vO5IAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=GBS.PA53\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter XXXIV of his translation of Boethius</a> uses the senses as a metaphor for enlightenment and understanding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But gold and silver stones and every kind of gem and all this present weal enlighten not at all the eyes of the mind nor at all whet their sharpness for beholding true happiness but they rather blind the eyes of the mind than sharpen them For all the things which please us here in this present life are earthly and are therefore fleeting But the wonderful Brightness which enlighteneth all things and ruleth all things willeth not that souls should perish but willeth to enlighten them If then any man can see the brightness of the heavenly light with the clear eyes of his mind then will he say that the brightness of the shining of the sun is darkness beside the eternal brightness of God.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since the motif is unique, the work of the highest caliber and the dating consistent with Alfred the Great\u2019s reign (which ended in 899 A.D.), it\u2019s entirely possible that the Fuller Brooch was crafted by artisans at Alfred\u2019s court, likely for someone of great wealth and rank.</p>\n<p>Sadly the article stops at just these three pieces, only whetting my appetite for more mapping of Anglo-Saxon designs. Weetch and Williams should go through the entire collection of the British Museum and decode every artifact in this way. Then they should animate the creatures untangling themselves from each other and make it interactive so we can select to follow one line at a time. Make it so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Decoding Anglo-Saxon art\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30719\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30719#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-30699\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30699\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Richard III\u2019s spine recreated by 3D printer\">Richard III\u2019s spine recreated by 3D printer</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, May 30th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Richard-III-spine.gif\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"3D printed recreation of Richard III's spine; pictures used to create the animation copyright the University of Leicester\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-30705\" height=\"495\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Richard-III-spine-sm.gif\" title=\"3D printed recreation of Richard III's spine; pictures used to create the animation copyright the University of Leicester\" width=\"200\"/></a>For those of you who are over all this Richard III malarkey (hi anja!), I hope you understand why this post has to be. There\u2019s a rotating spine gif here, people. How can I be expected to resist that? I\u2019m only human. Besides, the question of Richard\u2019s spinal deformity, its existence, nature and extent, has been the subject of many histories and even more theatrical performances for more than five centuries.</p>\n<p>Now we have some real answers courtesy of the University of Leicester team which has <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)60762-5/fulltext?_eventId=login\" target=\"_blank\">published a brief paper on Richard\u2019s spine in <em>The Lancet</em></a>. You can read it free of charge if you register on the site.</p>\n<p>When a body decomposes, different parts break down at different rates. Ligaments that hold the spine together are some of the last ones to decompose, so usually the way the spine is found in the grave is how it was in life. The curvature in Richard\u2019s spine could not have been a function of how he was placed. This was confirmed by examination of the bones, which found that the vertebrae of the curve are slightly different shapes and sizes. The only way those bones would fit together in life was in a spine with scoliosis.</p>\n<p>The skeleton laid out on a flat surface, however, only shows the sideways curvature of the spine. It takes a 3D model to see the full picture of the condition. The bones were scanned on a multi-detector CT scanner which takes high resolution images from every side, allowing them to be viewed as a whole 3D structure or in slices across any plane. The bones obviously were not joined, since the soft tissue is all gone and there is no software that will take the disconnected bones and put them back together the way they were in life. Usually that work is done by creating models.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-curved-spine.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Richard III's skeleton laid out in the lab\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-27557\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-curved-spine-200x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-curved-spine-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-curved-spine-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Richard-III-curved-spine-430x216.jpg 430w\" title=\"Richard III's skeleton laid out in the lab\" width=\"200\"/></a>The team was able to use the imaging data to generate a model which was printed out in a polymer using the advanced 3D printing equipment of the Wolfson School of Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering at Loughborough University in Leicestershire. This produces a near identical copy of the bones, only the model is durable, light weight and easily passed around, giving scientists the opportunity to study the skeletal structure without having to handle fragile human remains. Even after the king has been reburied, therefore, experts will still be able to examine his bones.</p>\n<p>The bones of the spine join at three places: the gap between two vertebrae where there\u2019s a disc and two facet joints at the back. With the plastic model, experts drilled a small hole in the center of each vertebra and ran a wire through them, separating each bone with a felt pad standing in for the disc. They then joined the facet joints using a similar technique. They saw that while the lumbar vertebrae in the lower spine appeared quite normal and fit together in a standard way, as they rose in the spine the osteoarthritic degeneration in the facet joints that was caused by the scoliosis increased markedly, deforming the joints. That deformity meant the bones fit together in a very specific way, an enforced thoracic curve that is the s-shaped bend in the spine we saw in the photographs of the skeleton in situ and in the lab. The measurement of the extent of the spinal curvature, called a Cobb angle, is 65-85 degrees. In today\u2019s scoliosis patients that would be considered a large curvature to be corrected by the surgical implantation of metal rods. Once they reached the upper thoracic vertebrae, the facet joints returned to normal and the spine straightened out.</p>\n<p>In addition to the sideways s-curve, the 3D model illuminates the spiral twist of the spine that you can only see when the spine is rotated. (You could see it even more clearly if the ribs were attached, but they haven\u2019t 3D printed any ribs yet and probably won\u2019t because many of them were broken when unearthed.) The model shows that the ribs on Richard\u2019s back would have stuck out significantly on the right side, while they were sunken on the left. When he leaned forward, the prominent ribs on the right side of his back would have formed a hump. This would not have been visible, however, when he was clothed and in most any other position than leaning over, so all those pillows stuffed under costumes are way off.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The physical disfigurement from Richard\u2019s scoliosis was probably slight since he had a well balanced curve. His trunk would have been short relative to the length of his limbs, and his right shoulder a little higher than the left. However, a good tailor and custom-made armour could have minimised the visual impact of this. A curve of 70\u201490\u00b0 would not have caused impaired exercise tolerance from reduced lung capacity, and we identified no evidence that Richard would have walked with an overt limp, because the leg bones are symmetric and well formed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He may or may not have had back pain. If his spinal curvature had been magically straightened, he\u2019d have been 5'8\" tall, about average for a man of the period. With the scoliosis he was two to three inches shorter.</p>\n<p>The polymer model was photographed from 19 angles and the images used to <a href=\"http://www.le.ac.uk/plone-iframes/spine/\" target=\"_blank\">create an interactive 3D model</a>.

Sixty of them were put on display, including the most important and valuable single coin in the collection: an 1866 $20 Double Eagle that is missing the motto \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on the back. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1886-coin.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"1886 coin from Saddle Ridge Hoard\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30688\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 84px) 100vw, 84px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1886-coin-84x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1886-coin-84x150.jpg 84w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1886-coin-168x300.jpg 168w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1886-coin-430x764.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1886-coin.jpg 1152w\" title=\"1886 coin from Saddle Ridge Hoard\" width=\"84\"/></a>It\u2019s an extremely rare piece, as Congress had passed a law in March of 1865 authorizing the placement of the motto on all gold coins that \u201cshall admit the inscription thereon.\u201d The San Francisco mint apparently lacked the proper equipment to include the motto at that time. That little oversight makes the coin valued at $1.2 million.</p>\n<p>An hour after the exhibition, one coin went up for auction at the Old Mint: an 1874 $20 Double Eagle. It sold for $15,000, with all the proceeds going to restore the National Historic Landmark and converting it into the <a href=\"http://www.sfhistory.org/\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Museum at the Mint</a>. The buyer was Ray Lent with Placer Partners, which is heavily involved in the cause. The mint museum will be the first museum dedicated to the history of the city, believe it or not. You\u2019d think a place like San Francisco would be lousy with them. Here\u2019s a video of the culmination of the auction and an interview with Ray Lent explaining why they secured the coin for the museum. There are some great shots of the space and the exhibition.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/sA1qP5_LtSE&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>With the non-profit part done, commerce began. Coin dealer Kagin\u2019s Inc. put up hundreds of coins for sale Tuesday night. By midnight, 225 coins offered for sale on the website were bought for a total of $2.4 million. Even more coins were listed on Amazon Tuesday night. Within an hour, 346 of them had sold for more than $1 million. At this rate, the initial estimate of the hoard\u2019s value at $10 million will be surpassed by at least a million.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Two-of-14-finest.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Two of the 14 finest offered for sale in one lot on Amazon\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30691\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Two-of-14-finest-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Two-of-14-finest-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Two-of-14-finest-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Two-of-14-finest-430x430.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Two-of-14-finest.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Two of the 14 finest offered for sale in one lot on Amazon\" width=\"150\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Original-can.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Original can, part of the 14-coin lot\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30692\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Original-can-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Original-can-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Original-can-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Original-can-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Original-can.jpg 768w\" title=\"Original can, part of the 14-coin lot\" width=\"112\"/></a>The 14 finest coins are being sold in a single lot along with the original can that was their home for near a century and a half.

The gold coins are nearly all in mint condition, with coins struck between 1847 and 1894 and barely circulated. They were buried in eight metal cans in the Gold Country of the Sierra Nevada mountain until their rediscovery by the property owners last year.</p>\n<p>Eventually almost all of the coins will be sold. The owners, known only as John and Mary, will keep a few coins for sentimental reasons. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Half of Saddle Ridge Hoard coins sold in 72 hours\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30686\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30686#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-30670\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30670\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Remains of massive 2nd c. building found in France\">Remains of massive 2nd c. building found in France</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, May 28th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Remains-of-sanctuary-facade.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Remains of 2nd c.

The structure was an estimated 90 meters (295 feet) wide and 9.5 meters (31 feet) high, but only one meter (three feet) thick. That bold architectural choice of building so high a wall without bracing doubtless played a major role in its untimely demise, along with the sandy soil on which it was built. The facade had a series of 13-17 arches in the center, the building blocks<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Reconstruction-of-facade.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Reconstruction of facade with central arches\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-30675\" height=\"29\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Reconstruction-of-facade-200x29.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Reconstruction-of-facade-200x29.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Reconstruction-of-facade-150x22.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Reconstruction-of-facade-430x63.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Reconstruction-of-facade.jpg 954w\" title=\"Reconstruction of facade with central arches\" width=\"200\"/></a> of which are lying horizontally where they fell.

Almost the entire Greco-Roman pantheon is represented in the high quality bas-relief carvings of the frieze. They were carved in a Hellenistic style entirely unlike anything else found in the north of Gaul. The work is so exquisite that it\u2019s not likely to have been carved locally. It\u2019s the kind of statuary you\u2019d expect to find in Rome or Greece, not in distant northern Gallic provinces, even at the height of imperial prosperity in the 2nd century. Somebody paid an enormous amount of money to build this monumental structure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Old-lady-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Detail of petrified old lady\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-30677\" height=\"138\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Old-lady-det-200x138.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Old-lady-det-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Old-lady-det-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Old-lady-det-430x297.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of petrified old lady\" width=\"200\"/></a>There are realistic depictions of Jupiter as the horned ram Ammon, horses, griffins, floral and geometric reliefs, and a figure of Venus next to the head and hand of an old woman poised as if she\u2019s whispering, a representation of the myth of Venus turning an old woman to stone after she betrayed the location of Venus and Mars\u2019 adulterous tryst, causing them to be found <em>in flagrante delicto</em> by her husband Vulcan. There\u2019s Juno\u2019s peacock, Diana\u2019s quiver and bow, and a face that could be the Medusa, although her snakes are missing so it\u2019s hard to say. Traces of the original color paint that made ancient Roman statuary and architecture so deliciously garish have survived, an exceptionally rare discovery since the paint was often the first to go. Sections of red cinnabar, light green and yellow are clearly visible to the naked eye.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fragments-with-paint.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Traces of surviving paint\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-30673\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fragments-with-paint-200x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fragments-with-paint-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fragments-with-paint-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fragments-with-paint-430x215.jpg 430w\" title=\"Traces of surviving paint\" width=\"200\"/></a>Not only is this huge building unrecorded in surviving sources, but there is no known Gallo-Roman settlement in the area. Ancient docks have been found elsewhere in Pont-Sainte-Maxence, so something was certainly going on at that locale. We just don\u2019t know what. Even after it collapsed people still found things to do there. Coins from the fourth century have been found among the ruins.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately archaeologists won\u2019t have the chance to study the site thoroughly. Excavations began two months ago and will continue through the end of June. Then the team has to clear out to make way for the construction crews that will build a shopping center on the site. The fact that there\u2019s an archaeological treasure there that is literally without precedent apparently won\u2019t even cause a delay. All INRAP can do is move the limestone blocks to temporary storage while they find a permanent location to study and document the stones uninterrupted. How they\u2019re going to move all those blocks without damaging them in the very short window of time they have is not yet clear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Remains of massive 2nd c. building found in France\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30670\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30670#comments\">8 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-30659\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30659\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to WWI memorial plaques found on dirt floor basement\">WWI memorial plaques found on dirt floor basement</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, May 27th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-on-basement-floor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"World War I memorial plaques in a pile on basement floor\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-30664\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-on-basement-floor-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-on-basement-floor-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-on-basement-floor-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-on-basement-floor-430x321.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-on-basement-floor.jpg 960w\" title=\"World War I memorial plaques in a pile on basement floor\" width=\"150\"/></a>Karen O\u2019Maxfield was in the Ice House, a public works outbuilding at Colt Park in Hartford, Connecticut, last year when she <a href=\"http://articles.courant.com/2013-11-10/news/hc-world-war-i-colt-park-20131110_1_greater-hartford-colt-park-hartford-history\" target=\"_blank\">stumbled on a large number of cast iron plaques</a>. They were in a pile on the dirt floor of the basement, topped and surrounded with junk like an old plastic milk jug and random bits of tubing. O\u2019Maxfield took some pictures and shared them on Facebook where they were spotted by Hartford history buffs Greg Secord and Lynn Ferrari. The three got together and began researching and inventorying the plaques.</p>\n<p>They discovered in the archives of the Hartford <em>Courant</em> that the plaques had once been part of a memorial to the 207 Hartford men who died in World War I. The memorial began in 1920 with the planting of 189 elm trees along the pathways encircling the track, dance floor (cool park!) and baseball diamonds in Colt Park. Mayor Newton C. Brainard, himself a history lover who decades later would become president of the Connecticut Historical Society, presided over the ceremony. Each tree was adorned with a small name marker. It was called the Trees of Honor memorial.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-trees-in-Colt-Park.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Undated picture of Trees of Honor memorial in Colt Park\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30661\" height=\"70\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-trees-in-Colt-Park-150x70.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-trees-in-Colt-Park-150x70.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-trees-in-Colt-Park-200x93.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-trees-in-Colt-Park-430x201.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plaques-trees-in-Colt-Park.jpg 960w\" title=\"Undated picture of Trees of Honor memorial in Colt Park\" width=\"150\"/></a>Six years later, the Rau-Locke American Legion Post 8 replaced the four-inch name markers with substantial cast iron ones on poles beside the trees, now a complete set of 207. Each plaque was approximately 12-by-10 inches and embossed with the name of a deceased soldier, his rank, the location where he fell and the date. For years the city commemorated their sacrifice at the memorial every Armistice Day (renamed to Veterans Day in 1954) on November 11th.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear when exactly the plaques were removed, but it was in the 1960s that almost all of the trees were killed by Dutch elm disease, a fungus spread by bark beetles that first arrived in New England in 1928. The trees were destroyed and the plaques put into storage. The basement of the Ice House was not a great place for them. The dirt floor was prone to flooding and over time the plaques were damaged. Some were cracked; all were tarnished. Others were lost altogether.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/World-War-I-plaques.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Rusted plaques in need of restoration\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-30662\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/World-War-I-plaques-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/World-War-I-plaques-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/World-War-I-plaques-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/World-War-I-plaques-430x281.jpg 430w\" title=\"Rusted plaques in need of restoration\" width=\"150\"/></a>When they were rediscovered, there were only 179 plaques out of the original 207. We know the names of the men whose plaques are missing, thanks to a list published in the 1920s by the Hartford <em>Courant</em>. (You can see the <a href=\"http://foxct.com/2014/04/17/list-world-war-i-veterans-originally-honored-by-memorial/\" target=\"_blank\">complete list here</a>.) Secord, Ferrari and O\u2019Maxfield are working to replace the 30 missing and broken plaques. They\u2019ve started a Facebook group, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/549728551747832/\" target=\"_blank\">Hartford Heroes</a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.gofundme.com/7zzogk\" target=\"_blank\">GoFundMe project</a> to raise money for the replacements. Each one costs $325 for a total of $9,750.</p>\n<p>Thankfully Competitive Edge Coatings, a South Windsor powder coating company, stepped up to the plate and offered to restore the existing plaques free of charge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cTo know that these plaques in memory of people who lived in Hartford were put down in this building and left unnoticed, I feel that they should be out where people can see them,\u201d said Damon Schuster, who co-owns the shop with Chris Scutnik. They cut the tarnish with a blast of glass beads, which brought out the original metal and redefined the details. They then applied a number of powder coatings to some plaques.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Map-trees-plaques-Colt-Park.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Cast iron map of the plaques in Colt Park\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30665\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Map-trees-plaques-Colt-Park-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Map-trees-plaques-Colt-Park-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Map-trees-plaques-Colt-Park-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Map-trees-plaques-Colt-Park-430x321.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cast iron map of the plaques in Colt Park\" width=\"150\"/></a>The American Legion post that originally funded the plaques in 1926 is still in existence today.

Aspects of the comb tradition go back hundreds of years, but the accessory as we know it today took root in the 18th century and came to its full fulgor in the early 19th century. It crossed the Atlantic, establishing itself in Spanish Latin America where <a href=\"http://blog.americanhistory.si.edu/osaycanyousee/2014/05/peinetones-high-combs-high-fashion.html\" target=\"_blank\">it soon took on a unique character</a>.</p>\n<p>This was a turbulent time for Spain\u2019s old colonies. Napoleon invaded Spain in 1808 and while the motherland poured money and might into the fight for the next six years, the colonies struggled for their own independence and the Empire splintered under the pressure. As independence movements grew, Latin American fashions followed, branching off into their own distinctive development.</p>\n<p>They had the raw materials for it: the shells of Caribbean sea turtles. They were widely traded in South America, used by artisans to craft jewelry and decorative items like hair combs. With an embarrassment of riches purloined from what seemed like an inexhaustible supply of marine turtles (not coincidentally, they\u2019re endangered now), artists could expand the boundaries of the traditional design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-in-the-National-Museum-of-Fine-Arts-in-Buenos-Aires.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Peinetones in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-30651\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-in-the-National-Museum-of-Fine-Arts-in-Buenos-Aires-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-in-the-National-Museum-of-Fine-Arts-in-Buenos-Aires-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-in-the-National-Museum-of-Fine-Arts-in-Buenos-Aires-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-in-the-National-Museum-of-Fine-Arts-in-Buenos-Aires-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-in-the-National-Museum-of-Fine-Arts-in-Buenos-Aires.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Peinetones in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires\" width=\"112\"/></a>In 1823, Spanish machinist Manuel Mateo Masculino started a business in Buenos Aires making combs and comb-making machines. He advertised that his gear and employees could produce more than a thousand combs a day. His business took off. Soon he had 106 employees making his designs using three different kinds of turtle shells (including a very expensive Indian import), ivory and mother of pearl. The material was cut, punctured, carved, polished, stamped, embossed, heat fused and polished. Masculino\u2019s machines and the templates he designed brought a whole new complexity to the <em>peineta</em>, creating elaborate openwork filigree in place of the more solid edged Spanish pieces.</p>\n<p>He also went big, not home, expanding the Spanish originals into combs one foot square. Every year his designs got bigger and fancier. The original wedge shape morphed into crescents, crowns, bell shapes, baskets. By the early 1830s, the average width was three feet. No longer were they <em>peinetas</em>. Now they were <em>peinetones</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-en-case-Extravagancias-de-1834-Cesar-Hipolito-Bacle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='Peinetones in the home, lithograph in \"Extravagancias de 1834\" by C\u00e9sar Hip\u00f3lito Bacle' class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30647\" height=\"117\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-en-case-Extravagancias-de-1834-Cesar-Hipolito-Bacle-150x117.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-en-case-Extravagancias-de-1834-Cesar-Hipolito-Bacle-150x117.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-en-case-Extravagancias-de-1834-Cesar-Hipolito-Bacle-200x156.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-en-case-Extravagancias-de-1834-Cesar-Hipolito-Bacle-430x336.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peinetones-en-case-Extravagancias-de-1834-Cesar-Hipolito-Bacle.jpg 1600w\" title='Peinetones in the home, lithograph in \"Extravagancias de 1834\" by C\u00e9sar Hip\u00f3lito Bacle' width=\"150\"/></a>The massive combs and the ladies who wore them were cause for much comment in the media. They became socio-political footballs, representing the evils of female vanity and wastefulness and the rejection of the ideal of the modest virtues of the household.

A series of lithographs by French artist C\u00e9sar Hip\u00f3lito Bacle published in a magazine called <em>Extravagancias de 1834</em> caricatured the giant hair combs as literal homewreckers, knocking down walls on their way out, assaulting men on the street and ruining their view at the theater.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/three-foot-peineton.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Peineton just shy of three feet wide\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30644\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/three-foot-peineton-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/three-foot-peineton-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/three-foot-peineton-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/three-foot-peineton-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Peineton just shy of three feet wide\" width=\"150\"/></a>The National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires has two exceptional examples from its collection online which prove the satires had a kernel of truth. <a href=\"http://mnba.gob.ar/coleccion/obra/5048\" target=\"_blank\">This piece</a> is a fraction of an inch under three feet wide and just over one foot high.

The oval is surrounded by oak leaves, a nod to the high Roman military decoration the <em>corona civica</em>, and topped with a Phrygian cap, a symbol of liberty. Underneath the oak wreath is carved the slogan \u201cFederation or Death,\u201d which helps date the hairpiece to 1832 at the earliest, the year de Rosas decreed that that phrase be used in all federal badges.

Once symbols of Argentine patriotism, a way for women to display their support for Argentine independence in the public sphere, the huge combs were now dangerously subversive, as far as the government was concerned. Bacle ran the official government press, so he wasn\u2019t just printing a fashion magazine. He was actively working on Rosas\u2019 behalf to associate the <em>peineton</em> with women of questionable virtue and even more questionable politics.</p>\n<p>It worked. The trend toward giantism reversed, and even though <em>peinetones</em> remained in fashion through the 1850s, the day of the four-footer was over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"When Argentinian women wore hair combs four feet wide\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30640\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30640#comments\">8 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-30628\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30628\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rare footage shows FDR walking at All-Star game\">Rare footage shows FDR walking at All-Star game</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, May 25th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FDR-at-Warm-Springs-late-1930s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-30636\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FDR-at-Warm-Springs-late-1930s-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FDR-at-Warm-Springs-late-1930s-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FDR-at-Warm-Springs-late-1930s-200x265.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FDR-at-Warm-Springs-late-1930s-430x570.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FDR-at-Warm-Springs-late-1930s.jpg 640w\" title=\"FDR bathing at Warm Springs late 1930s\" width=\"113\"/></a>A home movie filmed at the July 7, 1937, All-Star Game at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., <a href=\"http://www.pa.gov/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?agency=PHMC&amp;item=15621#.U4KzOnJdUrU\" target=\"_blank\">captures incredible rare footage of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt walking</a> in his braces. This is only the second known film recording the painful walk Roosevelt taught himself after he was paralyzed from the waist down by polio in 1921. The other clip is four seconds long; this one is eight seconds long.</p>\n<p>Determined to have a political career despite his paralysis, FDR had himself fitted with heavy leather and steel leg braces that locked at the knees and learned to approximate a walk by twisting his torso while using a cane for balance. With his other hand he leaned on aide or his son for support. This was an incredibly arduous and painful process and he couldn\u2019t sustain the motion for very long. It\u2019s a testament to his tremendous will power and upper body strength that he could do it at all.</p>\n<p>The footage was shot by Jimmie DeShong, who, as a pitcher for the Washington Senators, had close-up access to the field and bullpen even though he wasn\u2019t actually on the American League team for the All-Star game, a team that included seven future Hall-of-Famers \u2014 Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Earl Averill, Joe Cronin, Bill Dickey, Charlie Gehringer, Lefty Gomez \u2014 and was managed by another \u2014 legendary Yankees manager Joe McCarthy.

Jimmie DeShong died in 1993. It\u2019s his daughter Judith Savastio who donated the film to the Pennsylvania State Archives so their experts could conserve it, transfer it to HD and make this important document available to the public. Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns is the first to benefit from this generous gift. His latest series <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/films/the-roosevelts\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Roosevelts: An Intimate History</em></a> was already complete when he heard about the newly-discovered footage. He found it so compelling that he asked PBS to let them re-edit an episode to include the clip.</p>\n<p>From Ken Burns\u2019 statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Any film of [FDR] struggling to get from one place to another is extremely rare, as the Secret Service either prohibited or confiscated cameras whenever FDR was making an attempt to propel himself from his car to anywhere else. The President wanted to minimize the public\u2019s knowledge of the devastating effects polio had had on him \u2013 he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and he could not walk without the aid of a cane and braces on both legs. The press in those days complied with his request not to be filmed. </p>\n<p>We thought we had found and used all the rare bits and pieces that existed. But this remarkable 8 seconds provided to us by the Pennsylvania State Archives is one of the very best pieces of film that so clearly shows what a brave struggle it was for FDR to move. The fact that he is on an incline and that it is very windy makes his walking even more arduous. The wind even presses his pants against his withered legs and you can clearly see the braces underneath.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The series will air on PBS starting September 14, 2014. Here\u2019s the DeShong film, with Roosevelt\u2019s appearance starting at the 40 second mark when his car is driven onto the field.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/QZQ3k-nVrAc&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in President Roosevelt\u2019s life after polio, make your way to <a href=\"http://www.warmspringsga.com/warmsprings.htm#springs\" target=\"_blank\">Warm Springs, Georgia</a>, where FDR did hydrotherapy from 1924 until his death in 1945. He bought an extensive property there and donated it to the Warm Springs Foundation, the non-profit organization he founded that would become the March of Dimes. For years the hospital in Warm Springs was the only one dedicated solely to the treatment of polio victims. The historic springs have been restored and although the waters no longer the fill the pools, the on-site museum bears witness to an illness that terrified a nation for decades until Salk\u2019s vaccination was released in 1955. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/presidents/roosevelts_little_white_house.html\" target=\"_blank\">Little White House</a>, a lovely cottage he built next to the therapeutic warm water baths, is where he died. It\u2019s a National Historic Site with a small but captivating museum in beautiful, peaceful surroundings.

Some prints have been published in exhibition catalogs, but other than that, to view these innovative and influential works you had to go the Morgan in New York City where a few selections were on display. As of May 22nd, however, the entire Morgan collection of Rembrandt prints has been digitized and <a href=\"http://www.themorgan.org/rembrandt/images.asp\" target=\"_blank\">uploaded to the museum\u2019s website</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sheet-of-Studies-with-a-Woman-Lying-Ill-in-Bed-1639.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30602\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 135px) 100vw, 135px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sheet-of-Studies-with-a-Woman-Lying-Ill-in-Bed-1639-135x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sheet-of-Studies-with-a-Woman-Lying-Ill-in-Bed-1639-135x150.jpg 135w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sheet-of-Studies-with-a-Woman-Lying-Ill-in-Bed-1639-200x222.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sheet-of-Studies-with-a-Woman-Lying-Ill-in-Bed-1639-430x477.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sheet of Studies with a Woman Lying Ill in Bed, 1639\" width=\"135\"/></a>Rembrandt began experimenting with etching in 1626 when he was a youth of 20 in Leiden. Other painters like Peter Paul Rubens made prints of his work, but he hired printmakers to do all the etching. Rembrandt did all the work himself, seeing it not as a means to mass-produce and publicize his pricier pieces, but as an exciting artistic medium in its own right with its own strengths. They were made by scratching lines on a resin-coated copper plate using a fine needle or the thicker drypoint needle and then dipping the plate in acid. The acid would \u201cbite\u201d the plate wherever the resin had been scratched away, leaving an impression. His early etchings had a relatively straight-forward drawing style. Over time he developed a more painterly style as he used dense thickets of lines and overlays of ink wiped off only in highlighted areas to create dramatic chiaroscuro. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Monk-in-the-Cornfield-1646.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-30610\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Monk-in-the-Cornfield-1646-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Monk-in-the-Cornfield-1646-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Monk-in-the-Cornfield-1646-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Monk-in-the-Cornfield-1646-430x319.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Monk-in-the-Cornfield-1646.jpg 1562w\" title=\"The Monk in the Cornfield,1646\" width=\"150\"/></a>His subjects ranged from self-portraits, often studies of posture and expression rather than formal representations, portraits of family (his mother, his first wife Saskia) and patrons, Biblical scenes, landscapes of the Dutch countryside and even some erotica which has no equivalent in his painted works.

Once they had the license, the ULAS team excavated the bones fully and found two skeletons, one of which had the tell-tale curved spine and sharp force injuries of Richard III. Then came the DNA analysis and other tests that confirmed they had indeed discovered the remains of the last Plantagenet king of England. The announcement of the discovery was made on February 4th, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/23196\" target=\"_blank\">an unforgettable day here on the blog</a>.</p>\n<p>On May 3rd, 2013, The Plantagenet Alliance filed for a judicial review of the exhumation license. Their legal argument was that the Ministry of Justice should have consulted more widely with other interested parties (ie, the descendants) and the public once they realized that the \u201cpersons unknown\u201d cited in the license included a king of England. The Secretary of State would seek the consent of relatives of an identified exhumed person in other circumstances, so they should have in this case as well.</p>\n<p>The High Court ultimately disagreed. They ruled the MoJ had no duty to consult, that there is no established practice that would require the Justice Secretary to consult with collateral relatives of someone who died 500 years ago. The uniqueness of the circumstances \u2014 the excavation of a king of England \u2014 is no basis for expanding the law since there could be all kinds of exceptional circumstances that don\u2019t involve kings. The people and institutions who needed to be considered were.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This case undoubtedly has unique and exceptional features which arguably call for special consideration. It is why the claim has reached this Court. The archaeological discovery of the mortal remains of a King of England after 500 years may fairly be described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. The discovery touches on Sovereign, State and the Church. To the extent that these unique features call for special consideration, it may well be that the decision-maker is required by law to ascertain at least the views of Sovereign, State and the Church. In our view, however, at all material times in this case the Secretary of State was sufficiently aware of the views of Sovereign, State and the Church to be able to make an informed decision.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Richard-tomb-design.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26214\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Richard-tomb-design-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Richard-tomb-design-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Richard-tomb-design-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Richard-tomb-design-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Richard III proposed tomb design\" width=\"150\"/></a>You can <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/richard-3rd-judgment-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">read the entire decision here (pdf)</a>, and it\u2019s very much worth it. The court lays out the whole history, from Richard\u2019s life and death at the Battle of Bosworth to how the excavation came together to the discovery, the reburial politics from Council to Parliament and of course the legal challenge. Fun fact: Philippa Langley was talking to the Ministry of Justice about what to do in case Richard\u2019s remains were found starting in January of 2011, believe it or not. She even touched base with the Private Secretary of Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, grandson of King George V, first cousin to Queen Elizabeth II and patron of the Richard III Society to see where the Royal Household stood on the question. They supported the excavation in a distant sort of way, with the only locus of concern being that the remains were handled with respect. </p>\n<p>The Plantagenet Alliance has not commented on the decision yet but they do have a three week window in which to lodge an appeal. Richard Buckley and the University of Leicester spokesperson are delighted, as is the Dean of Leicester who said at a press conference that they\u2019re aiming for a burial ceremony in spring of 2015. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Court rules Richard III to be buried in Leicester\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30586\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30586#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-30568\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/30568\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Continental Currency coin sold for $1,410,000\">Continental Currency coin sold for $1,410,000</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, May 22nd, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-reverse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30570\" height=\"125\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-reverse-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-reverse-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-reverse-200x199.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-reverse-430x429.jpg 430w\" title=\"1776 Continental Currency silver coin, reverse\" width=\"125\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-obverse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-30571\" height=\"125\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-obverse-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-obverse-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-obverse-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1776-Continental-Dollar-obverse-430x430.jpg 430w\" title=\"1776 Continental Currency silver coin, obverse\" width=\"125\"/></a>When it was minted in 1776, the Continental Currency coin didn\u2019t have a denomination.

The name came from the Spanish dollars, whose reliable silver weight and purity had <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14157\" target=\"_blank\">made them a global currency</a> since they were first minted in 1497, used to back the notes. The design of the Continentals, as the notes became known, was the work of Benjamin Franklin, <a href=\"http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/brock/webdoc6.html\" target=\"_blank\">a long-time advocate for paper money</a> who as early as 1736 had printed paper currency for New Jersey. The obverse of the Continental fractional dollars has the Latin \u201cFUGIO\u201d (I fly) written over a sundial and the charmingly Old Richard-esque legend \u201cMIND YOUR BUSINESS\u201d written underneath it. (It\u2019s not really sure what he meant by that legend, but it probably wasn\u2019t \u201cmind your own business\u201d in the way we think of it today. It\u2019s more likely to have been a literal meaning of business as in see to your money-making.

The reverse has 13 linked rings, each labeled with the name of one of the colonies, surrounding a sun containing the legends \u201cAMERICAN CONGRESS\u201d and \u201cWE ARE ONE.\u201d </p>\n<p>The borders and devices for the Continentals were the work of engraver and artist Elisha Gallaudet who had engraved New York State notes in 1771 and New York City notes, the first currency issued by an American city, in 1774. Elisha Gallaudet also engraved the dies of the Continental Currency coin that just sold. He left his mark \u2014 EG FECIT (EG made it) \u2014 on the silver coin making it one of very few coins from the colonial period to bear its maker\u2019s signature. Experts believe that the Continental Congress intended the coins to replace the one dollar paper note.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The four resolutions from May 10, 1775 to May 9, 1776 provided for the issue of paper money in various denominations, including the one dollar bill. The six resolutions of July 22, 1776 through September 26, 1778 omitted the one dollar denomination. Thus, it is logical to conclude the pewter pieces were intended as a substitute for the paper dollars in those issues. The coins had minimal intrinsic value, and like the paper bills they replaced, were valued according to the public\u2019s confidence in Congress, who guaranteed their value at one dollar each.</p>\n<p>The mintage figures are unknown, but the pewter coins appear with enough frequency to suggest they were produced in substantial numbers. Many of the coins were undoubtedly melted during this period, because Benjamin Franklin observed that pewter was sorely needed for the canteens used by soldiers in the Continental Army. The most reasonable explanation for the brass examples is that they represent dies trials. The silver coins are of full weight and value, suggesting that a precious-metal coinage was contemplated, but the Continental Congress was chronically short of funds and had no reliable supply of silver, so this idea must have been abandoned quickly.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fugio-cent-1787-obv.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-30575\" height=\"124\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fugio-cent-1787-obv-150x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fugio-cent-1787-obv-150x148.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fugio-cent-1787-obv-200x198.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fugio-cent-1787-obv-430x427.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fugio-cent-1787-obv.jpg 591w\" title=\"1787 Fugio Cent, obverse\" width=\"125\"/></a>Instead they stuck with the paper notes which were cheap to produce but depreciated at an alarming rate. There were too many of them in circulation, and the British took advantage of their weakness to distribute huge amounts of counterfeit notes, devaluing them even further.

Museum\u2019s consistently fascinating blog has an entry <a href=\"http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/05/28/decoding-anglo-saxon-art/\" target=\"_blank\">decoding the complex iconography of Anglo-Saxon art</a>. If you\u2019ve ever found yourself following the intricate interlacing lines and curves of an Anglo-Saxon design, trying to identify a highly stylized animal or face mask, then you\u2019ve doubtless wished for a labeled map. British Museum curator Rosie Weetch and illustrator Craig Williams have made that wish come true.</p>\n<p>They select three pieces from different periods to decode. The first is a silver-gilt square-headed brooch that was unearthed from the grave of a woman on the Isle of Wight in 1855. It was cast in silver and gilded on the front surface, a technique influenced by southern Scandinavian metalwork. Created in the early 6th century A.D., the brooch is a beautiful example of Style I art, characterized by a jumble of interwoven figures art historians amusingly call \u201canimal salad.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>Its surface is covered with at least 24 different beasts: a mix of birds\u2019 heads, human masks, animals and hybrids. Some of them are quite clear, like the faces in the circular lobes projecting from the bottom of the brooch. Others are harder to spot, such as the faces in profile that only emerge when the brooch is turned upside-down. Some of the images can be read in multiple ways, and this ambiguity is central to Style I art.</p>\n<p>Once we have identified the creatures on the brooch, we can begin to decode its meaning.

If you\u2019ve ever found yourself following the intricate interlacing lines and curves of an Anglo-Saxon design, trying to identify a highly stylized animal or face mask, then you\u2019ve doubtless wished for a labeled map. British Museum curator Rosie Weetch and illustrator Craig Williams have made that wish come true. They select three pieces from different periods to decode. The first is a silver-gilt square-headed brooch that was unearthed from the grave of a woman on the Isle of Wight in 1855. It was cast in silver and gilded on the front surface, a technique influenced by southern Scandinavian metalwork. Created in the early 6th century A.D., the brooch is a beautiful example of Style I art, characterized by a jumble of interwoven figures art historians amusingly call \u201canimal salad.\u201d Its surface is covered with at least 24 different beasts: a mix of birds\u2019 heads, human masks, animals and hybrids. Some of them are quite clear, like the faces in the circular lobes projecting from the bottom of the brooch. Others are harder to spot, such as the faces in profile that only emerge when the brooch is turned upside-down. Some of the images can be read in multiple ways, and this ambiguity is central to Style I art. Once we have identified the creatures on the brooch, we can begin to decode its meaning. In the lozenge-shaped field at the foot of the brooch is a bearded face with a helmet underneath two birds that may represent the Germanic god Woden/Odin with his two companion ravens. The image of a god alongside other powerful animals may have offered symbolic protection to the wearer like a talisman or amulet. The next example is from a century later, the great gold buckle from the early 7th century Sutton Hoo ship burial. It\u2019s a Style II piece, characterized by more fluid intertwined animal figures. There are 13 animals on the buckle surface: snakes and four-legged creatures on the plate and tongue shield, snakes biting themselves on the loop, two animals biting a smaller animal on the top of the buckle, and two bird heads on the shoulders of the buckle. Such designs reveal the importance of the natural world, and it is likely that different animals were thought to hold different properties and characteristics that could be transferred to the objects they decorated. The fearsome snakes, with their shape-shifting qualities, demand respect and confer authority, and were suitable symbols for a buckle that adorned a high-status man, or even an Anglo-Saxon king. The last piece skips ahead to the 9th century Trewhiddle Style, named after the town in Cornwall where a hoard of Anglo-Saxon coins and decorated artifacts were discovered in a tin mine in 1774. The style is distinguished by enlaced animals, birds and humans, leafy scrollwork and a particular emphasis on using silver rather than gold and brass. The Fuller Brooch features the classic Trewhiddle humans, animals and plants along the border, but the central iconography is unique. At the centre is a man with staring eyes holding two plants. Around him are four other men striking poses: one, with his hands behind his back, sniffs a leaf; another rubs his two hands together; the third holds his hand up to his ear; and the final one has his whole hand inserted into his mouth. Together these strange poses form the earliest personification of the five senses: Sight, Smell, Touch, Hearing, and Taste. Surrounding these central motifs are roundels depicting animals, humans, and plants that perhaps represent God\u2019s Creation. The metaphoric significance of these figures, its best-in-class quality and the unique vision of the piece may suggest a connection to the court of King Alfred the Great, who was not only a successful military leader but also had a deep and abiding passion for learning and education. The long period of Viking raids had decimated centers of learning. Alfred made it a mission to reinvigorate Latin education and, for the first time, to advocate learning in the English vernacular. He put his money where his mouth was, personally translating four major works from Latin into Old English: Pastoral Care by Gregory the Great, The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius, St. Augustine\u2019s Soliloquies, and the first fifty psalms. Chapter XXXIV of his translation of Boethius uses the senses as a metaphor for enlightenment and understanding: But gold and silver stones and every kind of gem and all this present weal enlighten not at all the eyes of the mind nor at all whet their sharpness for beholding true happiness but they rather blind the eyes of the mind than sharpen them For all the things which please us here in this present life are earthly and are therefore fleeting But the wonderful Brightness which enlighteneth all things and ruleth all things willeth not that souls should perish but willeth to enlighten them If then any man can see the brightness of the heavenly light with the clear eyes of his mind then will he say that the brightness of the shining of the sun is darkness beside the eternal brightness of God. Since the motif is unique, the work of the highest caliber and the dating consistent with Alfred the Great\u2019s reign (which ended in 899 A.D.), it\u2019s entirely possible that the Fuller Brooch was crafted by artisans at Alfred\u2019s court, likely for someone of great wealth and rank.

The experts had assumed that the boxwood, those scions of the classic English garden, were original to Washington\u2019s time, and even the roses were if not fully original, at least close to it.

The roses were removed and replaced with smaller plots of ornamental flowers. The boxwoods, however, remained, kept in place by their own mythology and the mythology they supported of Washington as American royalty. The boxwoods couldn\u2019t live forever, though, and as they began to perish and get removed six years ago, Esther White, Mount Vernon\u2019s director of archaeology, finally had the opportunity to excavate the garden.

No more mannered hedges and small groupings of pretty flowers.

The experts had assumed that the boxwood, those scions of the classic English garden, were original to Washington\u2019s time, and even the roses were if not fully original, at least close to it. In the 1980s, new research showed that the hybrid tea roses didn\u2019t even exist until 1860; later tree-ring counts performed on deceased boxwoods proved they had been planted around the same time as the roses.</p>\n<p>In 1985, the garden was redesigned to bring it closer into line with the authentic garden Washington enjoyed. The roses were removed and replaced with smaller plots of ornamental flowers. The boxwoods, however, remained, kept in place by their own mythology and the mythology they supported of Washington as American royalty. The boxwoods couldn\u2019t live forever, though, and as they began to perish and get removed six years ago, Esther White, Mount Vernon\u2019s director of archaeology, finally had the opportunity to excavate the garden. She discovered evidence of Washington\u2019s first plantings: fruit trees in the 1760s. </p>\n<p>Excavations continued over the next few years, the team finding multiple versions of the garden from different periods until they were able to pinpoint the layout of the 1780s garden. It was walled and bullet-shaped walled, with wide paths and fewer large, long beds instead of the small crescent beds that had characterized the garden for so many years.</p>\n<p>Starting in August of last year, Dean Norton, Mount Vernon\u2019s director of horticulture, and his team began a complete redesign of the Upper Garden to return it to as close to its 1780s landscaping as possible. No more mannered hedges and small groupings of pretty flowers. They used the layout they had discovered, originally designed by Samuel Vaughan, and turned to Washington\u2019s own weekly gardener\u2019s reports to see what he had planted. It wasn\u2019t roses; it was crops.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Which raises the question: Why weren\u2019t these detailed reports used earlier to fashion the Upper Garden? The answer, of course, is that while the new garden speaks to Washington the man, the previous, embroidered versions told of Washington the myth. (The Upper Garden\u2019s twin, the Lower Garden, remains an idealized Colonial Revival fruit and vegetable garden.)</p>\n<p>\u201cThe [Upper] Garden became a reflection of everything we in the 19th and 20th century think about Washington, this romanticized view of the 18th-century man, strolling his pleasure garden, taking in the colors, the fragrances,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s our projection. One of the things the project did was to make people wipe clean their idea of what the garden should be. We all started again.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Washington-in-the-Garden-at-Mount-Vernon-by-Howard-Pyle-1896.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11366\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 143px) 100vw, 143px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Washington-in-the-Garden-at-Mount-Vernon-by-Howard-Pyle-1896-214x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Washington-in-the-Garden-at-Mount-Vernon-by-Howard-Pyle-1896-214x300.jpg 214w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Washington-in-the-Garden-at-Mount-Vernon-by-Howard-Pyle-1896-107x150.jpg 107w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Washington-in-the-Garden-at-Mount-Vernon-by-Howard-Pyle-1896.jpg 500w\" title=\"'Washington in the Garden at Mount Vernon' by Howard Pyle, 1896\" width=\"143\"/></a>There\u2019s an excellent example of that mythologizing at work in <a href=\"http://howardpyle.blogspot.com/2011/03/washington-in-garden-at-mount-vernon.html\" target=\"blank\">this fascinating blog entry</a> about artist Howard Pyle. In 1896 he wrote a letter to future President Woodrow Wilson in which he describes a painting he wanted to make of Washington the gentleman farmer, the Cincinnatus figure who served his nation when called upon, only to return to his noble bucolic life as man of the earth as soon as possible. \u201cI am informed that the box-walk at Mount Vernon is now very much as it was in Washington\u2019s day. It is very picturesque, and it would be interesting to place Washington in it as a setting,\u201d says Pyle.</p>\n<p>The thing is the rows of vegetables rimmed with flowers and clusters of fruit trees would have been, if less picturesque, certainly impressive showings of wealth in Washington\u2019s time. Just because it was practical doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t also indicative of the landowner\u2019s wealth, available leisure time and large, in this case enslaved, labor force. </p>\n<p>The restoration is now almost complete, and it sounds dreamy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In rebuilding the garden \u2014 the construction took place between August and November \u2014 crews brought in 350 cubic yards of soil and compost.

The estimated price range was between \u20ac800 (about $1,140) and \u20ac1,200 (about $1700), but as the news of the sale <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13522546\" target=\"blank\">spread in the media</a>  \u2014 the words \u201cpatron saint of genital disease\u201d have a lot of headline-making appeal \u2014 interest was piqued early. Auctioneer Damien Matthews received 100 bids before the sale even started, so the bidding opened well ahead of the top estimate at \u20ac2,400 (about $3,500).

The history of this macabre artifact is nebulous, but the story is that ancestors of the sellers acquired it on a Grand Tour of Europe during the 19th century and proudly set it in the entrance hall of Annesbrook House for all to see. Once they had children, however, they moved the head into an outbuilding where it gathered dust for decades. That\u2019s where it was when Matthews found it while appraising articles for the upcoming sale.</p>\n<p>As for the head itself, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to confirm that it belonged to Saint Vitalis of Assisi, and in fact I think it\u2019s more likely that it does not. The case is labeled \u201cS. Vitalis M.\u201d The \u201cM\u201d stands for martyr, and although there are several Saint Vitalises who died martyrs, the Assisi monk is not one of them. </p>\n<p>He was a wayward youth, prone to brigandage and sins of the flesh, who saw the error of his ways and undertook to expiate his naughtiness by going on pilgrimages to the most important Christian sites in Italy, France and Spain. When he returned to his home in central Italy, Saint Benedict appeared to him in a dream and told him to follow his rule. Saint Benedict also got more specific and told him exactly which hermitage he should serve in.</p>\n<p>He did as the dream told him and became a Benedictine monk assigned to the hermitage of Santa Maria of Viole, near the Benedictine monastery on the slopes of Mount Subasio, on the outskirts of Assisi. Vitalis lived there for 20 years in seclusion and poverty until his death. He wore rags and lived off the land. His sole possession was said to be a basket he used to carry water from a nearby spring. After his death on May 31, 1370 at 75 years of age, his body was buried on the spot. His reputation for saintliness drew many visitors who attributed miraculous cures to him. When he was canonized, May 31st was declared his saint day and he was made patron of genital and urinary diseases, perhaps because he had been more than passingly familiar with them in his youth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Deposition-Dono-Doni-San-Rufino-1562.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The 'Deposition' by Dono Doni over the altar of St. Vitalis, in the Cathedral of San Rufino\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11348\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Deposition-Dono-Doni-San-Rufino-1562-205x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Deposition-Dono-Doni-San-Rufino-1562-205x300.jpg 205w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Deposition-Dono-Doni-San-Rufino-1562-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Deposition-Dono-Doni-San-Rufino-1562-701x1024.jpg 701w\" title=\"The 'Deposition' by Dono Doni over the altar of St. Vitalis, in the Cathedral of San Rufino\" width=\"137\"/></a>A church was built in Viole over his burial. His body remained in that church\u2019s crypt until 1586 when the bishop of Assisi had it moved to the Cathedral of San Rufino in Assisi. There an altar was dedicated to him in the right transept of the church, decorated with a painting of the <em>Deposition from the Cross</em> by Dono Doni (1562-3). The left transept has an altar dedicated to St. Rufino, decorated with Dono Doni\u2019s <em>Crucifixion</em>. I suppose the bishop wanted to double up on local saint power. These chapels are on either side of the central altar of the cathedral, under which the remains of St. Rufino are interred. Saint Rufino brought Christianity to Assisi, was its first bishop and patron saint, and was martyred in 238 by having a stone tied to his neck and being thrown in the Chiascio river. </p>\n<p>In 2001, the remains of Saint Vitalis were moved one more time, in a solemn procession from San Rufino back to the Cathedral of Viole where they were re-interred under the major altar. At no point in any of these moves was there any recorded comment on a missing head. That\u2019s not to say it couldn\u2019t have been snatched and sold to Anglo-Irish grand tourists, but as far as the locals are concerned, their saint is intact. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"$5000 for the head of patron saint of genital diseases\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11303\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11303#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-11305\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11305\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to British art dealer breaks law to SAVE looted artifact\">British art dealer breaks law to SAVE looted artifact</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, May 29th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Gandharan-Buddha-2nd-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Gandharan Buddha statue, 2nd c.\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11310\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 148px) 100vw, 148px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Gandharan-Buddha-2nd-c-148x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Gandharan-Buddha-2nd-c-148x300.jpg 148w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Gandharan-Buddha-2nd-c-74x150.jpg 74w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Gandharan-Buddha-2nd-c.jpg 460w\" title=\"Gandharan Buddha statue, 2nd c.\" width=\"148\"/></a>In a break from the usual pattern, an art dealer who has chosen to remain anonymous put his freedom and career on the line to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/may/29/buddha-kabul-museum-looted#\" target=\"blank\">rescue an ancient Buddha statue looted from the National Museum of Afghanistan</a> in Kabul during the 1990s.</p>\n<p>The rare 4-foot statue of Gandharan Buddha with flames coming off his shoulders and water flowing from his feet dates to the 2nd century A.D. It was stolen at some time during the civil wars after the fall of the Soviet-backed Najibullah regime in 1992 and had traveled the dark halls of the black market in antiquities until it was recently purchased by a Japanese private collector.  A Japanese dealer sent our hero a picture of the statue and he immediately recognized it from his years of travel in Afghanistan. He even remembered exactly where it had been displayed in the National Museum.</p>\n<p>He contacted the collector and told him that the piece had been stolen, begging him to return it to the museum. Appeals to giving a damn about the cultural heritage of a war-torn nation fell on deaf ears. The collector refused to give it up. Under Japanese law, owners cannot be prosecuted for purchasing a stolen artifact even if there\u2019s concrete proof that the item was looted.</p>\n<p>The UK, on the other hand, has laws against buying stolen goods, but faced with the prospect of this precious piece of Afghan heritage disappearing into a private collection forever, the British art dealer (heretofore known as BAD, like in BADASS) decided he had to take the risk of being arrested to save the Buddha and return it to Kabul where it belonged. He offered to buy the statue from the Japanese collector.</p>\n<p>He told two people of his plan: Neil MacGregor, the director of the British Museum and St John Simpson, a curator. They sought legal counsel only to receive confirmation that there was nothing they could do to protect themselves. Getting mixed up in this deal was illegal and they could get in big trouble, despite their best intentions. They decided the public good was more important than holding to the letter of the law, so they supported BAD\u2019s attempt to buy the statue. He spent a year negotiating with the collector, and finally he was able to secure the sale using only his own money.</p>\n<p>There are no details in the article about how the artifact was imported, possibly because said import was technically smuggling, but whatever they did worked.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Taller_Buddha_of_Bamiyan_before_and_after_destruction.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The taller (180 ft) Buddha of Bamiyan before (1963) and after (2008) destruction by the Taliban\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-11309\" height=\"123\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Taller_Buddha_of_Bamiyan_before_and_after_destruction-150x123.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Taller_Buddha_of_Bamiyan_before_and_after_destruction-150x123.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Taller_Buddha_of_Bamiyan_before_and_after_destruction-300x247.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Taller_Buddha_of_Bamiyan_before_and_after_destruction.jpg 987w\" title=\"The taller (180 ft) Buddha of Bamiyan before (1963) and after (2008) destruction by the Taliban\" width=\"150\"/></a>Simpson described the rescue as \u201cterribly appropriate\u201d, coming as it did on the 10th anniversary of the Taliban\u2019s destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan: \u201cThey\u2019re gone forever.

They didn\u2019t botch it, exactly. It\u2019s just that the technique they employed, considered a best practice at the time, to keep the paint from flaking and make it less susceptible to variations in ambient temperature and humidity ends up sucking the life out of it instead. Using a wax resin, conservators affixed a second canvas to the back of the original one. Over time, that wax penetrated the canvas, collected in the brushwork crevasses and then turned from clear to milky white. That white resin coating is like a veil obscuring the bright color and textures of the painting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Per-Knutas-restores-Van-Goghs-Undergrowth-with-Two-Figures-at-Cincinati-Art-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Per Knutas restores 'Undergrowth with Two Figures' at Cincinnati Art Museum\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11297\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 131px) 100vw, 131px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Per-Knutas-restores-Van-Goghs-Undergrowth-with-Two-Figures-at-Cincinati-Art-Museum-196x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Per-Knutas-restores-Van-Goghs-Undergrowth-with-Two-Figures-at-Cincinati-Art-Museum-196x300.jpg 196w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Per-Knutas-restores-Van-Goghs-Undergrowth-with-Two-Figures-at-Cincinati-Art-Museum-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Per-Knutas-restores-Van-Goghs-Undergrowth-with-Two-Figures-at-Cincinati-Art-Museum.jpg 393w\" title=\"Per Knutas restores 'Undergrowth with Two Figures' at Cincinnati Art Museum\" width=\"131\"/></a>\u201cUndergrowth with Two Figures\u201d will be going on loan to the Philadelphia Museum of Art next year, so to stabilize it for the trip and ensure its long-term health, the Cincinnati Art Museum\u2019s chief conservator, Per Knutas, is undertaking an in-depth restoration to remove the well-intentioned disasters of past conservators. He views the painting through a high powered microscope, and although past restorations have been done in public, this is the first time the microscope is being connected to a 42\u2033 HDTV so that visitors to the museum can see what he sees instead of just watching a guy make tiny movements on a painting on a table.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Knutas uses a soft brush dipped in solvent to soften the wax, then a soft bamboo stick to scrape off the wax without harming the paint.</p>\n<p>He also will be removing varnish, a clear protective top coat, which past conservators had applied to the painting. While varnish can protect a painting, it also can alter its composition, hardening once-soft transitions and deepening colors. Research has shown that van Gogh did not varnish his paintings, Knutas said.</p>\n<p>Watching Knutas work last week, museum director Aaron Betsky compared the painting\u2019s amorphous, magnified forms appearing on the TV screen to contemporary video art and said it was a revelation to watch the conservation process happen.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to make the quality of the painting come alive so much more,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the joys to me is when we clean our great works of art, and so much comes out that has remained hidden. It\u2019s quite often as if you\u2019re seeing them for the first time.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Knutas will also take questions from museum visitors as he works. What a magnificent opportunity to see Van Gogh\u2019s work in the minutest of detail and to learn about the art and science of conservation. For those of us outside of Cincinnati range, we must be content to see him at work in this video:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJFlpMrY0Nw&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Detailed van Gogh restoration performed in public\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11285\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11285#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-11274\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11274\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Another Blackbeard anchor retrieved from wreck\">Another Blackbeard anchor retrieved from wreck</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, May 27th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/3000-pound-anchor-from-QAR-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Third largest anchor retrieved from Queen Anne's Revenge\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11277\" height=\"190\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/3000-pound-anchor-from-QAR-2-300x200.jpg\" title=\"Third largest anchor retrieved from Queen Anne's Revenge\" width=\"270\"/></a>Crews from the Cape Fear Community College and the University of North Carolina Wilmington recovered a 2,500- to 3,000-pound anchor from the wreckage of Blackbeard\u2019s flagship the <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge</em> Friday. It\u2019s 11 feet, 4 inches long with arms that are 7 feet, 7 inches wide, but believe it or not, that\u2019s only the third largest anchor on the site. The ship had multiple anchors ranging from wee 160-pound grapnels like <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/3739\" target=\"blank\">the one retrieved in October 2009</a> to emergency behemoths deployed during storms. This one was probably the ship\u2019s everyday anchor.</p>\n<p>The team originally planned to recover the second largest, which is 13 feet long with arms that are 8 feet across and weighs at least 3,000 pounds, on Thursday, only to encounter adverse weather that forced them to postpone the attempt for a day. They figured the larger one would be the easiest to retrieve since it\u2019s on top of the ballast pile, but it was too deeply embedded in the objects used for ballast so they decided to go for the number three which was perched on the side. Given the configuration of the remaining parts of the ship, it\u2019s likely that future dives will recover artifacts from the side of the ballast pile as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The only remaining parts of the ship \u2014 the wooden hull structure, ribs and a plank \u2014 are at the bottom of the pile, protected by ballast that kept the ship upright. Six cannon and three other anchors are also in the pile.</p>\n<p>Wendy Welsh, field conservator and QAR lab manager, and archaeologist Chris Southerly dived in the Atlantic to hook up the anchor for its lift to the ocean surface. \u201cIt lifted great,\u201d said Welsh, who has worked with the project for nine years. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see this day so soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Southerly compared the retrieval to the child\u2019s game of Pick-Up-Sticks, where players toss plastic sticks on a hard surface and then remove them one at a time without disturbing the ones underneath. \u201cIt\u2019s really satisfying that I\u2019ve had privilege of seeing it,\u201d he said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The anchor is now in the North Carolina Maritime Museum artifact repository where it will undergo years of conservation. The small grapnel is two years into conservation and is still not display-ready. This much larger anchor with far more extensive concretion (the hardened concrete-like coating of ocean debris that forms around the leaching wrought iron) will require an estimated four years of painstaking attention before it\u2019s stabilized.</p>\n<p>The N.C. Maritime Museum in Beaufort is the official repository for all artifacts recovered from the <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge</em>. They\u2019ve had a small exhibit dedicated to Blackbeard\u2019s flagship, but on June 11th <a href=\"http://www.ncmaritimemuseums.com/beaufort/support-the-museum/friends-of-the-museum/250-life-aboard-blackbeards-qqueen-annes-revengeq.html\" target=\"blank\">a new permanent exhibit opens to the public</a> featuring a newly renovated 1200-square-foot space, a third of the space in the entire museum, to showcase as many of the 250,000 artifacts recovered from the wreck site as they can.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Engraving-of-BB-with-fuses-woven-in-his-hair.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Engraving of Blackbeard, hair woven with flaming fuses, ca. 1715\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11281\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Engraving-of-BB-with-fuses-woven-in-his-hair-249x300.jpg\" title=\"Engraving of Blackbeard, hair woven with flaming fuses, ca. 1715\" width=\"249\"/></a>The <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge</em> ran aground off the coast of North Carolina in June 1718. The 300-ton British man-of-war was built in 1710. It was captured by the French in 1711, and they used it as a slaving vessel. It was captured again only by pirates this time in 1717. Pirate captain Benjamin Hornigold gave the ship to one of his crewmen, a certain Edward Teach or Thatch who would become famous under his nom-de-guerre, Blackbeard. He renamed it from <em>La Concorde de Nantes</em> to <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge</em>, packed it with cannon instead of slaves, and with it laid waste to British, Dutch, French and Portuguese shipping from west Africa to the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s some speculation that Blackbeard intentionally grounded the ship so he could thin out his crew and keep the lion\u2019s share of booty once he accepted the pardon of North Carolina governor Charles Eden. Not that it would do him much good. Five months later, he had already gone back to piracy and was defeated and decapitated by Lieutenant Robert Maynard of the Royal Navy.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to read more about the challenges and delights of the <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge</em> wreck, there\u2019s an excellent article from a couple of months ago on the <em>QAR</em> salvage operations on the <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Did-Archaeologists-Uncover-Blackbeards-Treasure.html#ixzz1N1HOQQE3\" target=\"blank\">Smithsonian Magazine site</a>.

Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky</a>. The Speed purchased it unwittingly from Newhouse Galleries, an Upper East Side New York art gallery, in 1973 for $38,000 and have agreed to return it to Italy.</p>\n<p>Since then, it has gone on display at the museum off and on, most recently off. It hadn\u2019t been exhibited in at least a decade when Homeland Security agents were alerted to its location by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage in Rome a few months ago. The feds aren\u2019t saying how exactly the painting was traced to the museum or how it got from Goito to New York in the first place, but once the authorities contacted the Speed they immediately cooperated with the investigation and helped confirm that their triptych was in fact the one stolen in 1971. Specialists compared the work to pictures of it in the Goito home and identified it based on unique markings.</p>\n<p>The small (1.6 feet by 1.9 feet) tempera-on-wood altarpiece depicts the Virgin Mary with Christ child in the center panel, Saints John the Baptist and Catherine of Alexandria on the left panel, and the crucifixion of Christ and the annunciation on the right panel.  It has been attributed to Florentine artist Jacopo del Casentino (b. 1297?, d. 1358), but there is still debate among art experts. Some people think it\u2019s a 19th century work made in the style of a 14th century piece. Speed director Charles Venable isn\u2019t convinced it\u2019s Casentino\u2019s, but the Italian authorities and the U.S. Attorney appear to be. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jacopo-del-casentino-madonna-enthroned-with-angels-and-saints.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Madonna Enthroned with Angels and Saints, Jacopo del Casentino, ca. 1330\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-11268\" height=\"183\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jacopo-del-casentino-madonna-enthroned-with-angels-and-saints-300x275.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jacopo-del-casentino-madonna-enthroned-with-angels-and-saints-300x275.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jacopo-del-casentino-madonna-enthroned-with-angels-and-saints-150x137.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jacopo-del-casentino-madonna-enthroned-with-angels-and-saints.jpg 994w\" title=\"Madonna Enthroned with Angels and Saints, Jacopo del Casentino, ca. 1330\" width=\"200\"/></a>If it is Casentino\u2019s work that\u2019s a very big deal because right now the only other work known to exist by that artist is in the <a href=\"http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/english/musei/uffizi/\" target=\"blank\">Uffizi Gallery</a> of Florence. It\u2019s another triptych of the Virgin Mary, in fact, called <em>Madonna Enthroned with Angels and Saints</em>.</p>\n<p>The triptych was stolen from Lidia Bianchi Perdomini\u2019s felicitously named home Villa La Giraffa (yes, that does mean Giraffe Villa) on October 2, 1971. Burglars cut through metal bars and a glass window, absconding with the triptych, paintings from the Venetian school and oils by realist painters Giovanni Fattori and Silvestro Lega, among others. The collective value of the stolen pieces was assessed at $33 million, and that was 40 years ago.</p>\n<p>When the Speed bought it the piece was attributed to an unknown 14th century artist and given the small original sale price, the museum never bothered to insure the piece, not even for the $38,000 they spent on it, never mind for the millions it would be worth as a confirmed Casentino. They\u2019re taking the hit, such that it is, with good cheer, though. Before they return the piece they will put it on display one more time in an exhibition called <a href=\"http://www.speedmuseum.org/exhibitions/upcoming/The_Case_of_the_Italian_Altarpiece\" target=\"blank\">The Case of the Italian Altarpiece</a>. The exhibit focuses on putting the painting in the context of the international art trade and will provide visitors with details on how the piece was researched and the history of ownership determined. It\u2019s a neat idea that more museums who get busted with loot should emulate. The exhibit will be open from June 9th to sometime this summer (probably early July).</p>\n<p>The Speed is a member of the Blue Star Museums program, a program that allows active duty military personnel and their immediate family members free admission to more than 1,300 participating museums in all 50 states between Memorial Day through Labor Day. If you\u2019re a military family and in the area, take advantage of the opportunity. You can find other Blue Star Museums near you <a href=\"http://www.arts.gov/national/bluestarmuseums/index2011.php\" target=\"blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>After the final exhibit, as per the settlement drawn up between the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the Speed, the triptych will be returned to the Cultural Heritage Office of Mantova, Italy. Since the original owner is deceased, the Italian authorities will determine what happens next, if it will be returned to any of Perdomini\u2019s heirs or put on public display.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Triptych stolen in Italy in 1971 found in Kentucky\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11260\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11260#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-11242\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11242\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to US Archaeologist finds 17 pyramids via satellite\">US Archaeologist finds 17 pyramids via satellite</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, May 25th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>University of Alabama at Birmingham Egyptologist Sarah Parcak, Ph.D <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13522957\" target=\"blank\">has discovered 17 still-buried pyramids using infra-red satellite imagery</a>. Funded by a BBC grant, Parcak\u2019s team spent over a year capturing images of Egyptian sites from both NASA and commercial satellites. The images revealed more than 1,000 tombs and 3,100 ancient settlements as well as the undiscovered pyramids. French archaeologists on the ground were then able to confirm two of the pyramids in Saqqara, the burial ground for the ancient capital of Memphis and the site where the oldest pyramids (from 2,600 B.C.) were found, and a home in Tanis which exactly matched the structures revealed by the satellite imagery.</p>\n<p>Considering that there are only 140 confirmed pyramids in Egypt, finding 17 more is of major significance, and this is only the first pass covering areas that are just under the surface. Parcak and Zahi Hawass have plans to collaborate to train young Egyptians to capture images of ancient sites using satellite technology creating a whole new field of Egyptological study and revealing new sites that have been well buried by millennia of Nile silt deposits and shifting sands.</p>\n<p>The infra-red imaging technology is so accurate it can capture objects less than 40 inches in diameter from satellites 430 miles (700 km) above the earth. It identifies differences in density, thus distinguishing dense mud brick walls, for instance, and the soil around them. That\u2019s how the imagery can reveal not just large structures but also the road map of entire cities. Having such a map will be of immense help to archaeologists in planning where to excavate, and the satellites will train an unblinking eye on sites that are particularly vulnerable to looting because they are famous and/or because they are unexcavated and unguarded.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Naked-eye-Tanis.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Aerial view of modern San El Hagar\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-11249\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Naked-eye-Tanis-300x225.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Naked-eye-Tanis-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Naked-eye-Tanis-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Naked-eye-Tanis.jpg 634w\" title=\"Aerial view of modern San El Hagar\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IR-Tanis.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Infra-red aerial view of ancient Tanis\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-11250\" height=\"175\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IR-Tanis-300x262.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IR-Tanis-300x262.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IR-Tanis-150x131.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IR-Tanis.jpg 634w\" title=\"Infra-red aerial view of ancient Tanis\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<blockquote><p>The Egyptian authorities plan to use the technology to help \u2013 among other things \u2013 protect the country\u2019s antiquities in the future.</p>\n<p>During the recent revolution, looters accessed some well-known archaeological sites.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can tell from the imagery a tomb was looted from a particular period of time and we can alert Interpol to watch out for antiquities from that time that may be offered for sale.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Parcak\u2019s work will be covered in detail in the BBC documentary <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011pwms\" target=\"blank\"><em>Egypt\u2019s Lost Cities</em></a> airing Monday, May 30th.

It includes a picture of a crawling children\u2019s doll patented in 1871. It\u2019s strikingly scary looking but the story provides no information beyond the bare bones caption (\u201cModel for a creep baby doll, which was patented in 1871\u201d), and it\u2019s not even in the video, so of course I had to search high and low to find out more about this AI Chucky.</p>\n<p>First of all, creeping is what they called crawling back then, and as recently as the early 19th century the question of whether babies should be allowed to crawl was still hotly debated. Crawling was what crazy people and animals did and as such was morally suspect, even \u201cunnatural\u201d for a sane human. By the mid-1800s, however, crawling was seen as a natural stage of childhood and the popularity of devices such as the <a href=\"http://www.hamptonhistoricalsociety.org/sstool.htm\" target=\"blank\">standing stool</a> began to wane. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as industrial mass production took over from individual toy makers and technology itself became a source of convenience and fascination, dolls with clockwork elements became increasingly popular toys. Instead of the rag doll with a change of clothes, wood, ceramic, and metal automata put on a show of blinking eyes, moving limbs and mouths, or two faces that would turn with a flip of a switch. Dollmaking was <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Creeping-Baby-Doll-March-1871-patent-application-R.J.-Clay.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36043\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 102px) 100vw, 102px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Creeping-Baby-Doll-March-1871-patent-application-R.J.-Clay-102x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Creeping-Baby-Doll-March-1871-patent-application-R.J.-Clay-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Creeping-Baby-Doll-March-1871-patent-application-R.J.-Clay-200x293.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Creeping-Baby-Doll-March-1871-patent-application-R.J.-Clay-430x631.jpg 430w\" title=\"Creeping Baby Doll, March 1871 patent application, R.J.

After the Civil War, American dollmakers tried to get a piece of the action by upping the mechanization ante. The baby doll with a wax head and a crawling motion powered by an internal clockwork mechanism was an attempt to tap into this trend.</p>\n<p>Now a correction: although it\u2019s certainly a creep, it\u2019s actually called a \u201cCreeping Baby Doll\u201d and was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/patents/US112550\" target=\"blank\">first patented by Robert J. Clay on March 14, 1871</a>. In the application, he describes his creepy baby as \u201ca very amusing toy\u2026produced at small cost.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Clarkes-Creeping-Baby-Doll-patent-drawing.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33133\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Clarkes-Creeping-Baby-Doll-patent-drawing-106x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Clarkes-Creeping-Baby-Doll-patent-drawing-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Clarkes-Creeping-Baby-Doll-patent-drawing-200x281.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Clarkes-Creeping-Baby-Doll-patent-drawing-430x604.jpg 430w\" title=\"Clarke's Creeping Baby Doll patent drawing\" width=\"106\"/></a>The prototype in the Smithsonian, however, is a slightly later iteration.

Clarke and accepted on August 29, 1871. Clay was Clarke\u2019s boss and the later patent was an improvement on Clay\u2019s original model.</p>\n<p>Despite Clay\u2019s belief that his toy would be very amusing, it had limited appeal for its target audience of little girls. It looks scary, weighs a lot and isn\u2019t particularly interactive. It\u2019s more of an exhibition piece than a cuddly toy, and once the mechanism broke (which happened often with the earlier models), its heaviness and hardness made it a dead weight rather than a doll that could be integrated into regular play. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Edison-phonograph-doll.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Edison Phonograph Doll, internal phonograph mechanism shown right\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11230\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Edison-phonograph-doll-e1306299201489-206x300.jpg\" title=\"Edison Phonograph Doll, internal phonograph mechanism shown right\" width=\"134\"/></a>Even Thomas Alva Edison\u2019s foray into mechanized dollmaking was a playtime failure, although interesting as a display piece. He invented the first talking doll in 1877 (sold to the public starting in 1890). It was a tall, 22\u2033 doll with a metal body and a bisque head with a wee phonograph inside that was operated by a key in the back. When the key was turned, the phonograph would play a wax cylinder. This was the first phonograph sold for home use, so it\u2019s an important stepping stone in the history of entertainment technology. The only problem was the child had to turn the key steadily at the proper speed the whole time to hear the doll speak, and since you couldn\u2019t switch out the cylinder, once the needle wore it down, that was the end of Chatty Cathy. Oh, also, Edison himself described the sound produced in less than flattering terms.  He said \u201cthe voices of the little monsters were exceedingly unpleasant to hear\u201d and he wasn\u2019t lying, let me tell you.</p>\n<p>Click, if you dare, on play to hear the Little Jack Horner cylinder: </p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">AudioPlayer.setup(\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-audio-player/player/player.swf\", { width: 290 });</script><p id=\"audioplayer_1978\"><audio controls=\"\"><source src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/EdisonTalkingDoll-LittleJackHorner1890_64kb.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"/></audio></p><p><script type=\"text/javascript\">AudioPlayer.embed(\"audioplayer_1978\", {soundFile: \"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/EdisonTalkingDoll-LittleJackHorner1890_64kb.mp3\",  titles: \"RUN, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE\", autostart: \"no\", loop: \"no\", animation: \"yes\", remaining: \"yes\", noinfo: \"no\", initialvolume: \"70\", buffer: \"5\", encode: \"no\", checkpolicy: \"no\", rtl: \"no\", width: \"100%\", transparentpagebg: \"no\", bg: \"E5E5E5\", leftbg: \"CCCCCC\", lefticon: \"333333\", voltrack: \"F2F2F2\", volslider: \"666666\", rightbg: \"B4B4B4\", rightbghover: \"999999\", righticon: \"333333\", righticonhover: \"FFFFFF\", loader: \"009900\", track: \"FFFFFF\", tracker: \"DDDDDD\", border: \"CCCCCC\", skip: \"666666\", text: \"333333\"});</script></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Creepy Creeping Baby Doll\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11218\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11218#comments\">11 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-11209\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11209\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The first Bronze Age battlefield found?\">The first Bronze Age battlefield found?</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, May 23rd, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Bronze-Age-battle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Skull found at Tollense River site with fatal blunt force trauma\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-11211\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Bronze-Age-battle-144x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Bronze-Age-battle-144x150.jpg 144w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Bronze-Age-battle-288x300.jpg 288w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Bronze-Age-battle.jpg 468w\" title=\"Skull found at Tollense River site with fatal blunt force trauma\" width=\"144\"/></a>Archaeologists excavating on land and divers exploring the riverbed of the River Tollense valley of north-east Germany have uncovered what may be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13469861\" target=\"blank\">the remains of the earliest Bronze Age battlefield</a> ever found. Evidence of human-on-human violence has been discovered as far back as the early Stone Age, but nothing indicating a large-scale battle between opposing factions. The finds on the River Tollense site include the remains of 100 bodies, most of them apparently young men, plus wooden bludgeoning weapons, an arrowhead embedded deep into an upper arm, and horse bones. </p>\n<p>Some of the human skeletal remains show evidence of face-to-face combat \u2014 large unhealed holes in their head, for instance, that could have been inflicted by weapons like the two wooden clubs that were found in pieces on the site. One was a bat made of ash wood; the other looks similar to a croquet mallet and was made of sloe wood. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/croquet-mallet-e1306208524561.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bronze Age mallet weapon found by divers in the riverbed\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11210\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/croquet-mallet-e1306208524561.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/croquet-mallet-e1306208524561.jpg 462w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/croquet-mallet-e1306208524561-150x34.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/croquet-mallet-e1306208524561-300x68.jpg 300w\" title=\"Bronze Age mallet weapon found by divers in the riverbed\" width=\"400\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>There is no evidence of formal burial, no pottery used as grave goods or paved stones used to build burial cysts, so archaeologists think the remains might have been washed downriver from the location of the primary battle. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The researchers suggest the bodies may have been dumped in the river before being washed away and deposited on a sandbar. Alternatively, the dead could have been killed on the spot in \u201cthe swampy valley environment\u201d, the paper concludes.</p>\n<p>[Dr Harald Lubke of the Centre for Baltic and Scandinavian Archaeology in Germany] believes the real conflict may have been fought out further up the river, and that the bodies so far found represent just a fraction of the carnage wrought by the battle.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is only a sample, what we have found up until now \u2013 the modern river bed only cuts across part of the river bed of that time. There are likely to be many more remains.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely necessary to find the place where the bodies came into the water and that will explain if it really was a battle or something else, such as an offering, but we believe that a fight is the best explanation at the moment.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Tollense River valley at the time was the conjunction of several streams of the main tributary. It was settled, fertile, and an appealing territory for a foreign tribe to covet. The remains of a non-local millet diet found at the site could indicate the presence of an invading force. </p>\n<p>The team\u2019s findings thus far have been published in the journal <a href=\"http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/subscriptions/howtoaccess.htm?PageWanted=http://antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/085/0417/ant0850417.pdf\" target=\"blank\">Antiquity (pdf, subscription only)</a>, but the research is ongoing.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"The first Bronze Age battlefield found?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11209\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11209#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-11192\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11192\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to English source: William Wallace wanted to be king\">English source: William Wallace wanted to be king</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, May 22nd, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/William_Wallace_Statue__Aberdeen2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"William Wallace statue in Aberdeen\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-11198\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 171px) 100vw, 171px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/William_Wallace_Statue__Aberdeen2-e1306121253657-257x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/William_Wallace_Statue__Aberdeen2-e1306121253657-257x300.jpg 257w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/William_Wallace_Statue__Aberdeen2-e1306121253657-128x150.jpg 128w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/William_Wallace_Statue__Aberdeen2-e1306121253657-878x1024.jpg 878w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/William_Wallace_Statue__Aberdeen2-e1306121253657.jpg 1529w\" title=\"William Wallace statue in Aberdeen\" width=\"171\"/></a>Researcher Dr. John Reuben Davies of Glasgow University has found a <a href=\"http://www.breakingofbritain.ac.uk/?page_id=202\" target=\"blank\">previously unnoticed reference in the pipe roll</a>, a financial record of King Edward I\u2019s exchequer, for fiscal year 1304-1305 that gives an account of William Wallace\u2019s crimes, death and the disposition of his body parts. Discovered in the National Archives at Kew, the document describes Wallace as \u201ca robber, a public traitor, an outlaw, an enemy and rebel against the king, who in contempt of the king had, throughout Scotland, falsely sought to call himself king of Scotland \u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is the first explicit reference found to Wallace seeking the kingly crown. The Scottish sources take pains to emphasize that Wallace never declared himself king or even aspired to the crown. The extant documents we have that were signed by Wallace himself all specify that he takes action in his role as Guardian of Scotland on behalf of imprisoned King John Balliol. Until now, the English sources didn\u2019t say otherwise. This record being an internal financial document not intended for public viewing makes it more likely to be an honest view of the English powers instead of a propaganda exaggeration used to justify the brutal execution of a Scottish hero.</p>\n<p>Dr. Davies thinks it may have been the result of a misunderstanding. Wallace was declared Guardian of Scotland by nobles including Robert Bruce after his victory in the Battle of Stirling Bridge in September 1297. At first he shared the role with Andrew de Moray, but de Moray died just two months later from wounds incurred at Stirling, leaving Wallace as sole Guardian until shortly after his defeat at the Battle of Falkirk a year later. As Guardian, he issued edicts, commanded the army, and had the right to bear the Scottish National Standard and appoint bishops. The Guardian is basically the acting king, and when the king he acts for is a) imprisoned and b) widely considered a spineless shill (Balliol\u2019s nickname meant \u201cempty shirt\u201d), you can see how the English, unfamiliar with the constitutional role, might have seen Wallace as a pretender for the Scottish crown.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Execution_of_thomas_armstrong_1683.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The quartering of Thomas Armstrong in 1683 for treason\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-11199\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Execution_of_thomas_armstrong_1683-122x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Execution_of_thomas_armstrong_1683-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Execution_of_thomas_armstrong_1683-245x300.jpg 245w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Execution_of_thomas_armstrong_1683.jpg 490w\" title=\"The quartering of Thomas Armstrong in 1683 for treason\" width=\"122\"/></a>The pipe roll\u2019s entry on Wallace is also the earliest description of his execution. Pipe rolls were accounts drawn up by the office of the exchequer which tracked the moneys sheriffs were tasked to pay to the king each year. The sum would be reduced based on expenditures undertaken by the sheriffs on behalf of the crown, like tax deductions, basically. In this case, the accounts deduct the sums the sheriff spent moving William Wallace\u2019s quartered body parts to Scotland to put on display as a gruesome warning against rebellion. Wallace was executed in London on August 23, 1305. The pipe roll covers the accounting period of Michaelmas (the feast of St. Michael, celebrated on September 29th) 1304 to Michaelmas 1305, so it was drawn up within months of Wallace\u2019s death, maybe even a single month after, depending on how promptly they started working on their accounts after the close of the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>The entry describes Wallace as \u201cby sentence of the king\u2019s court at Westminster drawn, hanged, beheaded, his entrails burned, and his body quartered, whose four parts were dispatched to the four principal towns of Scotland. This year, 61 shillings 10 pence.\u201d This level of detail is unique in a dry financial accounting ledger like a pipe roll. Other executions are recorded in earlier rolls, but it\u2019s basic names and dates stuff, not the gory details of the accusations and executions. It underscores that even to accounting clerks William Wallace\u2019s crime and punishment stood out as worth noting, enough so to include a narrative of them in what would otherwise have been the medieval equivalent of a payroll spreadsheet.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"English source: William Wallace wanted to be king\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11192\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11192#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2011/05/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

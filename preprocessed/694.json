He noted in his diary that he had made a drawing of small grouse to Philadelphia engraver Gideon Fairman. Fairman\u2019s company specialized in printing currency for banks (each bank at that time issued their own legal tender), and the grouse drawing was meant to be on a New Jersey banknote. </p>\n<p>This diary entry, however, is all we\u2019ve had to show for what could be the first published drawing by the ornithological master. Scholars have never been able to find the prints of the drawing or the banknotes.</p>\n<p>Robert Peck, curator of art and artifacts at the Academy of Natural Sciences, and Eric Newman, a numismatic historian from St. Louis, decided 10 years ago to work together to find the elusive Audubon grouse. <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20100730_Eureka__Audubon_s_first_engraved_illustration_discovered.html?viewAll=y\" target=\"blank\">Thursday they announced</a> that they had found the Holy Grail of Audubon studies.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On a trip to Chicago, Peck checked another diary, and found an entry from 1826. Audubon was in England, where his landmark book, The Birds of America, with full-size printings of his bird watercolors, was eventually produced, beginning in 1827.</p>\n<p>He noted that he presented a friend \u201cwith a copy of Fairman\u2019s Engraving of [my] Bank Note Plate.\u201d But had the money ever been printed? Or was it a plate that never got used?</p>\n<p>Newman combed through every book written on New Jersey paper money. \u201cThat didn\u2019t help me at all,\u201d he said. Then he checked the 10,000 different banknotes issued in the United States for grouse pictures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find any.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally, he reexamined his own collection of \u201csample sheets,\u201d printed with various images that bank presidents might want on their bills. Mostly, such sheets contain portraits of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, images of draped Lady Liberties, and, above all, eagles.</p>\n<p>But finally, on a sheet issued by Fairman\u2019s firm, likely in 1825 \u2013 there! on the lower right! \u2013 was a grouse.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The drawing had no signature or attribution, but animal artists at that time made static depictions and this grouse is running against a backdrop of its natural habitat, a style that was singularly Audubon\u2019s. </p>\n<p>Peck and Newman think they\u2019ve pieced together what happened. The New Jersey bank was probably the State Bank at Trenton who were major clients of Fairman\u2019s company. The bank failed in 1825 and its banknotes became worthless. Forgers took those worthless notes and counterfeited them up to look like similar notes from another Jersey bank, the State Bank of Camden, that hadn\u2019t gone bankrupt. </p>\n<p>Eventually the Camden bank recalled its currency and burned it along with all the Trenton bills it could find. That would explain why the small grouse seemed to disappear from the historical record.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/John-James-Audubon-first-published-illustration.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"John James Audubon's first published illustration, a small grouse running\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6985\" height=\"288\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/John-James-Audubon-first-published-illustration.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/John-James-Audubon-first-published-illustration.jpg 956w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/John-James-Audubon-first-published-illustration-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/John-James-Audubon-first-published-illustration-300x200.jpg 300w\" title=\"John James Audubon's first published illustration, a small grouse running\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Audubon\u2019s first engraved illustration discovered\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6982\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6982#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6965\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6965\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Sword of Robert the Bruce\u2019s heart sells for $17,000\">Sword of Robert the Bruce\u2019s heart sells for $17,000</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, July 30th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Broadsword commemoriating the voyage of Robert the Bruce's heart\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6976\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-2-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-2-150x100.jpg 70w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-2-300x200.jpg 141w\" title=\"Broadsword commemoriating the voyage of Robert the Bruce's heart\" width=\"70\"/></a>A broadsword made to commemorate the incredible journey of Robert the Bruce\u2019s embalmed heart, carried by famed knight and loyal Bruce supporter Sir James Douglas on a crusade to the Holy Land which stopped fatally short in Moorish Spain, <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/scotland/Robert-the-Bruce-sword-fetches.6448312.jp\" target=\"blank\">sold at auction Wednesday for \u00a310,800</a> (ca $17,000). </p>\n<p>Sir James Douglas, known by the English as Black Douglas and used in songs to scare children, was with Robert the Bruce when he died in 1329. According to 14th century Scottish poet and chronicler John Barbour, Bruce asked Sir James to take his heart with him on a crusade against \u201cChrist\u2019s enemies\u201d because Robert had always wanted to go on a crusade but was never able to. After Bruce died, his heart was cut out and put in a silver enameled casket which Douglas carried on a chain around his neck. </p>\n<p>Heart safely contained close to his own, Douglas headed out to war, eventually joining Alfonso XI of Castile in Grenada where he was besieging the Moorish castle of Teba. Barbour says Douglas acquitted himself with great courage in the battle, but he fell nonetheless. The battle was eventually won by the Castilian-Scottish forces, so Sir James\u2019 body and the heart casket were retrieved by Sir William Keith and sent back to Scotland.</p>\n<p>The heart was buried in Melrose Abbey, as Robert the Bruce had requested in his will. Sir James Douglas\u2019 remains were buried in St Bride\u2019s chapel. From then on, the Douglas family coat of arms would bear a crowned heart in homage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-blade.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Closeup of 14th century engraved blade\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6975\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 111px) 100vw, 111px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-blade-111x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-blade-111x150.jpg 111w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-blade-223x300.jpg 223w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Broadsword-blade.jpg 446w\" title=\"Closeup of 14th century engraved blade\" width=\"111\"/></a>The 14th century blade is thought to have been made shortly after Sir James ill-fated trip and is engraved with Douglas family heraldry, inscriptions referring to the heart and a commemorative date of 1331. The sterling silver hilt was made in 1705 by London swordmaker Thomas Vicaridge and attached to the blade which had been in the Douglas family for 400 years by then.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It carries an Imperial crown and a crowned lion rampant between the inscription \u2018Pro Rege Et Regno Anno 1331\u2019, and on the other with a similar panel enclosing one of the devices of the Douglas family, a wild man (wodewose) with a heart on his left breast between the inscription \u2018For Strength In Stier This [the heart] I Bier\u2019 (for strength in battle this heart I bear). </p></blockquote>\n<p>The seller chose to remain anonymous, but members of the Douglas-Home family say it was sold by a relative. The buyer also chose to remain anonymous saying for the record only \u201cIt has gone to a Douglas.\u201d Small consolation for Scots nationalists who have to accept that such a piece so interwoven with the dawn of independent Scotland and the death of its hero king will now disappear into an anonymous collection somewhere in England.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Sword of Robert the Bruce\u2019s heart sells for $17,000\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6965\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6965#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6954\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6954\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Churchill\u2019s teeth sell for almost $24,000\">Churchill\u2019s teeth sell for almost $24,000</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, July 29th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>A set of Winston Churchill\u2019s upper dentures sold at auction at the Keys\u2019 Salerooms in Aylsham, Norfolk, today for \u00a315,200 ($23,741). The pre-sale estimate was \u00a35,000, but since this set was one of a few custom made for the prime minister whose dentures were an integral component of some of the greatest speeches of all time, a British collector of Churchilliana bought them for 3 times the estimate. (This same collector owns the microphone Churchill used to announce the end of the war in Europe in 1945.)</p>\n<blockquote><p>The set of dentures were designed to be loose-fitting so that Churchill could preserve the diction famous from his radio broadcasts during the second world war, an expert said.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom childhood, Churchill had a very distinctive natural lisp; he had trouble with his S\u2019s,\u201d said Jane Hughes, head of learning at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London. \u201cThese are the teeth that saved the world.\u201d [\u2026]</p>\n<p>\u201cChurchill wanted to maintain [the lisp] because he was already so well known for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dentures wouldn\u2019t quite connect with the top of the mouth, but that was on purpose.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>These dentures and 3 or 4 identical sets were made in the beginning of the war by dental technician Derek Cudlipp. Churchill carried an extra set with him at all times. One of the other sets rests in peace with the great man himself who was buried with them. Another set is on display at the <a href=\"http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/museums\" target=\"blank\">Hunterian Museum</a>, the medical museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in London. Mr. Cudlipp\u2019s son Nigel sold this set. </p>\n<p>Winston Churchill personally destroyed Derek Cudlipp\u2019s draft papers. According to Nigel, Churchill told the technician that he contribute more to the war effort by staying in England and repairing his dentures than by fighting on the front lines. </p>\n<p>He was probably right given how important the prime minister\u2019s speeches were to become, and given Churchill\u2019s habit of throwing his dentures across the room at his staff when he was angry. Nigel says his father could tell how the war was going at any given time based on how much repair work he had to do.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Churchills-dentures.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Churchill's $24,000 dentures\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6957\" height=\"265\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Churchills-dentures.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Churchills-dentures.jpg 840w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Churchills-dentures-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Churchills-dentures-300x188.jpg 300w\" title=\"Churchill's $24,000 dentures\" width=\"420\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Churchill\u2019s teeth sell for almost $24,000\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6954\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6954#comments\">15 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6942\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6942\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Virtually raising the Titanic\">Virtually raising the Titanic</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, July 28th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Titanic-underwater.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bow railing of Titanic, picture taken by submersible\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6949\" height=\"104\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Titanic-underwater-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Titanic-underwater-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Titanic-underwater-300x208.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Titanic-underwater.jpg 600w\" title=\"Bow railing of Titanic, picture taken by submersible\" width=\"150\"/></a>On August 18th, a collaborative team from RMS Titanic Inc., the company that has salvage rights to the wreck of the Titanic, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will be returning to the wreck site not to recover artifacts, but to <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/2010/07/27/2109826/new-titanic-expedition-will-create.html\" target=\"blank\">probe the entire debris field</a> with the eventual goal of creating a 3D virtual rendering of exactly what is left of the ship 2.5 miles under the North Atlantic.</p>\n<p>It\u2019ll be the first time the wreck is recorded like an archaeological site instead of explored for salvage booty (and to make the incredibly crappy intro of an incredibly crappy movie out of the underwater footage). The careful mapping will contribute greatly to our understanding of the historical Titanic and will also pinpoint the wreck\u2019s current state of preservation. The plan is to share the virtual rendering with the public once it\u2019s complete.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The \u201cdream team\u201d of archaeologists, oceanographers and other scientists want to get the best assessment yet on the two main sections of the ship, which have been subjected to fierce deep-ocean currents, salt water and intense pressure.</p>\n<p>Gallo said while the rate of Titanic\u2019s deterioration is not known, the expedition approaches the mission with a sense of urgency.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe see places where it looks like the upper decks are getting thin, the walls are thin, the ceilings may be collapsing a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hear all these anecdotal things about the ship is rusting away, it\u2019s collapsing on itself. No one really knows.\u201d</p>\n<p>The expedition will use imaging technology and sonar devices that never have been used before on the Titanic wreck and to probe nearly a century of sediment in the debris field to seek a full inventory of the ship\u2019s artifacts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re actually treating it like a crime scene,\u201d Gallo said. \u201cWe want to know what\u2019s out there in that debris field, what the stern and the bow are looking like.\u201d</p>\n<p>The expedition will be based on the RV Jean Charcot, a 250-foot research vessel with a crew of 20. Three submersibles and the latest sonar, acoustic and filming technology will also be part of the expedition.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They will also take samples of the iron hull, which they hope will answer some questions about how the ship went down.

They started taking it apart, plank by plank, on Monday and are hoping to finish this week so construction crews can go back to work. </p>\n<p>As the mud is removed, the original color and grain of the wood is revealed. Disassembly also reveals the joining techniques that were used in the ship\u2019s construction. It\u2019s a race against time and climate, though, to keep the wood from degrading. The boat was covered by a canopy to keep it as dark and damp as possible even in the middle of an east coast heat wave.</p>\n<p>Port Authority has authorized double shifts so the archaeologist can keep working day and night to get the speedily-disintegrating wood into a safe environment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On Monday, archaeologists painstakingly tagged and logged each plank of the boat before removing it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re recording everything as if each piece is going to fall apart \u2014 just in case,\u201d said Warren Riess, a professor at the University of Maine who is working on the boat for AKRF. </p>\n<p>Workers wrapped each piece of wood in polyethylene foam and plastic sheeting, to keep the moisture in and the sun out, and then loaded them into a dumpster.</p>\n<p>The hundreds of timbers will go to the Maryland Archaeological Conservation Laboratory, about 50 miles outside of Washington, D.C., where archaeologists will study them further.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The conservation process will take years. First the planks will be soaked in polyethylene glycol, a waxy plastic that will penetrate the wood and provide it a stable structure, for 3 years. Then they\u2019ll be vacuum freeze-dried to drive out every last drop of water. Once that\u2019s done, the ship will be put back together.</p>\n<p>Port Authority hasn\u2019t decided yet what its ultimate fate will be. The Lower Manhattan Development Corp., owners of the site where the boat was found, will ask for public input on what should happen to the ship. Here\u2019s hoping they choose to put it on display. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a great deal of documentation of government boats and warships, but private shipbuilders in the 18th c. didn\u2019t publish any blueprints or design plans (they wanted to preserve their trade secrets), so there\u2019s a lot this find can teach us about how these smaller privateers were built.</p>\n<p>So far we can tell from the heaviness of the planks indicate this ship was used to carry heavy cargo. It was probably 60 feet long (the section found is 30 feet long) which is fairly large for a ship that traveled the Atlantic coast. Ships that crossed the Atlantic, on the other hand, were usually considerably larger. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not likely to have been a dedicated slave ship. Slave ships were built for speed so they were usually lightweight. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Team begins to disassemble World Trade Center ship\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6933\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6933#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6918\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6918\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Tut\u2019s chariot on its way to New York\">Tut\u2019s chariot on its way to New York</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, July 26th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chariots-in-tut-antechamber.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Disembled chariots in King Tut's antechamber, 1922\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6923\" height=\"109\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chariots-in-tut-antechamber-150x109.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chariots-in-tut-antechamber-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chariots-in-tut-antechamber-300x218.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/chariots-in-tut-antechamber.jpg 548w\" title=\"Disembled chariots in King Tut's antechamber, 1922\" width=\"150\"/></a>When Howard Carter opened King Tut\u2019s tomb in 1922, he found 4 chariots in the south-east corner of the antechamber (2 more were found in the treasury room). The chariots had been dismantled at the time of the King\u2019s funeral. One of the chariots stood out not because of any elaborate decoration, but because of its lack thereof. Unlike the others, it was small, lightweight, and entirely undecorated. It also showed signs of regular use, again unlike the other more ornamental chariots.</p>\n<p>Carter deduced from its open design that it was used for hunting and/or quotidian exercise. Since <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/4818\" target=\"blank\">a recent study</a> of the king\u2019s mummy found that he suffered from a severe leg fracture right above the knee from a fall taken shortly before his death.

Vegas at that time was known as the \u201cMississippi of the West\u201d because of its virulent and persistent segregation. Major African-American stars were touted on the Strip marquees, but none of them were allowed to stay in the hotels or play in the casinos where they performed. The Moulin Rouge was integrated at every level \u2014 guest, performer, employee \u2014 and featured top notch stars like Louis Armstrong, Joe Louis, Nat King Cole, Jack Benny, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/moulin-rouge-dangers-1955.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Moulin Rouge dancers on cover of LIFE, June 1955\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6909\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 111px) 100vw, 111px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/moulin-rouge-dangers-1955-111x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/moulin-rouge-dangers-1955-111x150.jpg 111w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/moulin-rouge-dangers-1955-223x300.jpg 223w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/moulin-rouge-dangers-1955-762x1024.jpg 762w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/moulin-rouge-dangers-1955.jpg 953w\" title=\"Moulin Rouge dancers on cover of LIFE, June 1955\" width=\"111\"/></a>Its stylized cursive neon sign was designed by Betty Willis, creator of the iconic \u201cWelcome to Las Vegas\u201d sign. The exterior walls had murals of dancing couples and hot cars, the interior walls murals of Can Can girls and Duesenbergs. Moulin Rouge dancers even made the June 1955 cover of LIFE magazine. </p>\n<p>Despite its auspicious beginnings, the Moulin Rouge didn\u2019t even last a year. By November of 1955, it was closed. By December, its owners filed for bankruptcy. It had one more bright shining moment when in March of 1960 casino owners and state and city officials met at the Moulin Rouge with the president of the NAACP James McMillan to forestall a planned protest march down the Strip. At this meeting the parties struck an agreement to desegregate Las Vegas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Moulin-Rouge-in-1950s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The Moulin Rouge in the 1950s\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6910\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Moulin-Rouge-in-1950s-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Moulin-Rouge-in-1950s-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Moulin-Rouge-in-1950s-300x197.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Moulin-Rouge-in-1950s-1024x672.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Moulin-Rouge-in-1950s.jpg 1026w\" title=\"The Moulin Rouge in the 1950s\" width=\"150\"/></a>So the Moulin Rouge is <em>the</em> Civil Rights icon of the city. That notwithstanding, nobody has ever been able to bring it back to life. The West Vegas neighborhood declined, and although the hotel rooms in the tower were converted to apartments and some crappy renovations were made in the 1970s, all the revitalization plans over the decades (and there have been many) have failed to come to fruition. In 2003, an arsonist set a fire that gutted the structure, leaving only the facade and sign. </p>\n<p>In February of last year, the Moulin Rouge complex was declared a public nuisance and slated for demolition. Just in case that wasn\u2019t definite enough, in May it was hit by yet another fire. Thankfully the Betty Willis sign had been removed just a week before then for storage in Vegas\u2019 famous <a href=\"http://www.neonmuseum.org/\" target=\"blank\">Neon Museum</a> boneyard.</p>\n<p>Now, the final death knell has rung. On Thursday the <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jul/22/historic-moulin-rouge-tower-demolished-in-vegas/\" target=\"blank\">Moulin Rouge tower was demolished</a>.

When Antony had been sated by her, day after day, with the most exquisite banquets, this queenly courtesan, inflated with vanity and disdainful arrogance, affected to treat all this sumptuousness and all these vast preparations with the greatest contempt; upon which Antony enquired what there was that could possibly be added to such extraordinary magnificence. To this she made answer, that on a single entertainment she would expend ten millions of sesterces. Antony was extremely desirous to learn how that could be done, but looked upon it as a thing quite impossible; and a wager was the result. On the following day, upon which the matter was to be decided, in order that she might not lose the wager, she had an entertainment set before Antony, magnificent in every respect, though no better than his usual repast. Upon this, Antony joked her, and enquired what was the amount expended upon it; to which she made answer that the banquet which he then beheld was only a trifling appendage to the real banquet, and that she alone would consume at the meal to the ascertained value of that amount, she herself would swallow the ten millions of sesterces; and so ordered the second course to be served. In obedience to her instructions, the servants placed before her a single vessel, which was filled with vinegar, a liquid, the sharpness and strength of which is able to dis-solve pearls. At this moment she was wearing in her ears those choicest and most rare and unique productions of Nature; and while Antony was waiting to see what she was going to do, taking one of them from out of her ear, she threw it into the vinegar, and directly it was melted, swallowed it. </p></blockquote>\n<p>It hasn\u2019t been taken terribly seriously by historians because as you can see, Pliny deploys the story more as an illustration of Antony and Cleopatra\u2019s dissipated, luxurious wastefulness than a realistic description. Besides, a basic test of the tall tale fails: if you drop pearls in vinegar, even highly acidic vinegar, they don\u2019t melt. At least not right away like they do in Pliny\u2019s story. </p>\n<p>Classicist Prudence Jones of Montclair State University decided to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2010-07-23-cleopatra-pearl-cocktail_N.htm\" target=\"blank\">explore the pearls-in-vinegar possibilities</a>. She didn\u2019t discount the story as fiction off the bat, especially since Cleopatra was said by ancient physician Galen to be well-versed in poison lore. She also wrote a book on cosmetics \u2014 fragments of which still exist \u2014 displaying an extensive knowledge of chemistry.</p>\n<p>Jones began experimenting with calcium tablets, then oyster shells in vinegar. Then in a shocking break, a jeweler gave her two 5 frikkin carat pearls to test. </p>\n<blockquote><p> \u201cExperiments reveal that a reaction between pearls and vinegar is quite possible,\u201d concludes the study. Calcium carbonate plus the vinegar\u2019s acetic acid in water produces calcium acetate water and carbon dioxide, for chemistry fans. Jones finds a 5% solution of acetic acid, sold in supermarkets today and well within concentrations produced naturally by fermentation, takes 24 to 36 hours to dissolve a 5-carat pearl.</p>\n<p>Boiling the vinegar, or crushing the pearl, or both, greatly speeds up the reaction, perhaps to under 10 minutes. Interestingly, stronger solutions of acetic acid greatly slows down dissolving (the water takes part in the reaction), something that may have hindered folks testing Pliny\u2019s veracity in the past. </p></blockquote>\n<p>So the straight from earring to vinegar then down the hatch process either didn\u2019t happen, or Cleopatra fixed the bet by softening the pearl for a day or two before wearing them at dinner, or she had the vinegar boiled before dropping in the pearls. I could totally see her hustling Marc Antony like that.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cleopearls.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Cleopatra drinks pearls from 'Asterix &amp; Cleopatra'\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6880\" height=\"137\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cleopearls-1023x318.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cleopearls-1023x318.jpg 1023w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cleopearls-150x46.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cleopearls-300x93.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cleopearls.jpg 1506w\" title=\"Cleopatra drinks pearls from 'Asterix &amp; Cleopatra'\" width=\"440\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Cleopatra\u2019s pearls dissolved in vinegar\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6868\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6868#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-6858\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6858\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to New henge found half a mile from Stonehenge\">New henge found half a mile from Stonehenge</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, July 22nd, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/magnetometric-image-of-henge-structure.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Magnetometric image of henge structure\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6863\" height=\"102\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/magnetometric-image-of-henge-structure-150x102.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/magnetometric-image-of-henge-structure-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/magnetometric-image-of-henge-structure-300x204.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/magnetometric-image-of-henge-structure.jpg 634w\" title=\"Magnetometric image of henge structure\" width=\"150\"/></a>Okay so it\u2019s not new, and it\u2019s not really even a henge anymore so much as the ditches and postholes therefrom, but archaeologists are still lauding it as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-10718522\" target=\"blank\">the most exciting find on the Salisbury Plain in 50 years</a>. All kinds of smaller finds have been made during that time \u2014 from graves and attendant goods to a smaller wood circle \u2014 but this could be a major ceremonial monument. </p>\n<p>Note of caution: We don\u2019t know yet exactly what it is, though. Right now all we see are images of holes, basically. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Images show it has two entrances on the north-east and south-west sides and inside the circle is a burial mound on top which appeared much later, Professor Gaffney said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem to have a large-ditched feature, but it seems to be made of individual scoops rather than just a straight trench,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we looked a bit more closely, we then realised there was a ring of pits about a metre wide going all the way around the edge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you see that as an archaeologist, you just looked at it and thought, \u2018that\u2019s a henge monument\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a timber equivalent to Stonehenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the general shape, we would guess it dates backs to about the time when Stonehenge was emerging at its most complex.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/henge-comparison.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Stonehenge and possible layout of newly discovered henge\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6864\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 143px) 100vw, 143px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/henge-comparison-143x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/henge-comparison-143x150.jpg 143w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/henge-comparison-286x300.jpg 286w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/henge-comparison.jpg 600w\" title=\"Stonehenge and possible layout of newly discovered henge\" width=\"143\"/></a>Despite the immense fame of the Neolithic standing stones, the surrounding area is surprisingly unexplored. An international team of archaeologists led by the University of Birmingham is surveying the plain to a depth of 3 feet starting with their back to Stonehenge then moving outwards 14 square kilometers (5 square miles). You\u2019d have to deglove the plain and it would take years to do this using traditional pick and shovel methodologies.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why the archaeological team is using new, non-invasive technology to uncover the secrets of the plain, using scanners attached to tractors to cover large amounts of ground in deep detail very quickly. Technologies used include ground penetrating radar, magnetic surveys, resistivity and electromagnetic studies. Ground penetrating radar is usually deployed by one person pushing the detector. The team scaled the detector up 5 times, attached it to a quad bike and were thus able to cover the 14 square kilometers around Stonehenge in just 3 weeks. </p>\n<p>There is some loss of resolution in the data gathered at such speed, but they\u2019ve got time to go back and focus on areas that need further exploration. The project is scheduled to continue for 3 years. By the end they\u2019ll have a 3D map of the area</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"New henge found half a mile from Stonehenge\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6858\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6858#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2010/07/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

The Order of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem has owned the historic building for eight centuries, although their nuns left in 1835 after anti-clerical legislation promulgated by Queen Isabel II\u2019s prime minister Juan \u00c1lvarez Mendiz\u00e1bal privatized monastic properties thus stripping the convent of its revenue. Some nuns filtered back over the years and since 1985, the Order of St. John has allowed the sisters of <a href=\"http://english.bethleem.org/monasteres/sigena.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bethlehem and the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno</a> to carry on the tradition of monastic prayer at Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26902\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-430x296.jpg 430w\" title=\"Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Sijena\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Order of St. John couldn\u2019t just hand over the monastery without getting permission from the Vatican. Finally earlier this year the Vatican granted the Order permission to cede the rights to Aragon, so now the Aragonese government is the proud owner of a 13th century monastery in the Spanish Pyrenees. That gives them the right to take Catalonia to court should they refuse to hand over the frescoes. Since Catalonia only possesses the works because they were sent there in 1936 for conservation, not because their ownership was officially transferred, any legal battle is likely to favor the repatriation. The frescoes were removed by order of government during the Civil War, and are therefore spoils of war just like the Salamanca Papers. The monastery was declared a national monument in 1923, which also puts the frescoes\u2019 removal in contravention of pre-existing Spanish law.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26895\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-200x121.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-430x261.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera.jpg 991w\" title=\"Watercolor of the chapter house by Valentin Carderera, 19th century\" width=\"150\"/></a>Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena was built between 1183 and 1208 by order of Queen Sancha of Castile.

The also-autonomous government of Catalonia has not been receptive. Ferran Mascarell, Catalan Minister for Culture, said on Thursday that the government will do everything in its power to keep the frescoes where they are on the ground that if Catalans hadn\u2019t conserved the frescoes, they would not exist today.</p>\n<p>This is not a solid legal argument, as the Catalan government has good reason to know since it too has campaigned vigorously for the return of historically significant items from places where they were conserved.

The Order of the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem has owned the historic building for eight centuries, although their nuns left in 1835 after anti-clerical legislation promulgated by Queen Isabel II\u2019s prime minister Juan \u00c1lvarez Mendiz\u00e1bal privatized monastic properties thus stripping the convent of its revenue. Some nuns filtered back over the years and since 1985, the Order of St. John has allowed the sisters of <a href=\"http://english.bethleem.org/monasteres/sigena.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bethlehem and the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno</a> to carry on the tradition of monastic prayer at Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26902\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Santa-Mar\u00eda-la-Real-de-Sijena-430x296.jpg 430w\" title=\"Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Sijena\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Order of St. John couldn\u2019t just hand over the monastery without getting permission from the Vatican. Finally earlier this year the Vatican granted the Order permission to cede the rights to Aragon, so now the Aragonese government is the proud owner of a 13th century monastery in the Spanish Pyrenees. That gives them the right to take Catalonia to court should they refuse to hand over the frescoes. Since Catalonia only possesses the works because they were sent there in 1936 for conservation, not because their ownership was officially transferred, any legal battle is likely to favor the repatriation. The frescoes were removed by order of government during the Civil War, and are therefore spoils of war just like the Salamanca Papers. The monastery was declared a national monument in 1923, which also puts the frescoes\u2019 removal in contravention of pre-existing Spanish law.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26895\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-200x121.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera-430x261.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Watercolor-of-chapterhouse-Valentin-Carderera.jpg 991w\" title=\"Watercolor of the chapter house by Valentin Carderera, 19th century\" width=\"150\"/></a>Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena was built between 1183 and 1208 by order of Queen Sancha of Castile. Intended to house nuns from the cream of Spanish aristocracy, the monastery was built in rich Romanesque style and was elaborately decorated. No expense was spared. The frescoes on the arches and vaults of the chapter house \u2014 plant and animal motifs accompanying scenes from the Old and New Testament and 70-80 portraits of the ancestors of Jesus starting with Abraham \u2014 were painted by the best English artists using precious materials like gold and lapis lazuli. This approach was employed nowhere else in Spain at this time. Historians believe the frescoes were painted by English artists who also worked on the Guardian Angels Chapel in Winchester Cathedral, the chapel of St. Anselm in Canterbury Cathedral and on mosaics in Norman-ruled Sicily in the mid-12th century. Queen Sancha was buried in the convent church after her death, as were her daughters Dol\u00e7a and Leonor and her son King Pedro II of Aragon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26906\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Monastery-before-fire.jpg 700w\" title=\"Monastery chapter house right before fire\" width=\"150\"/></a>Its royal burials and architectural and artistic beauties couldn\u2019t save it from a hideous fate during the Civil War. In fact, they probably condemned it. Santa Mar\u00eda de Sigena was burned in 1936 by Republicans forces who were no fans of the monarchy or the Church. The royal tombs were desecrated Vultures followed to pick at the carcass and looters helped themselves to everything they could take, including the art on the walls, the wooden paneling, the devotional objects, the furniture. The chapter house frescoes were horribly damaged by the fire, some destroyed completely, some missing large pieces, all drained of their once-brilliant color.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26898\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-200x142.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting-430x305.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Monastery-after-fire-and-looting.jpg 700w\" title=\"Monastery chapter house after the fire\" width=\"150\"/></a>To save what was left, in 1960 the paintings were removed and sent to the National Museum in Barcelona.

The most complete recipe is for a frozen chocolate product \u2014 a 17th century frapp\u00e9, if you will \u2014 and in an age when freezing was still a subject of extensive scientific study rather than the subject of cookbooks, Sandwich\u2019s frapp\u00e9 may be the earliest English recipe on record for an iced chocolate treat.</p>\n<p>Loveman specializes in 17th century English literature, especially the diarists. She was reading the papers of Samuel Pepys who repeatedly mentions drinking chocolate at London coffee houses which served coffee, chocolate and tea, all recent introductions courtesy of the Age of Exploration that were viewed with suspicion for their dubious medical properties/dangers and enthusiasm for their dubious medical properties/tastiness. On April 24th, 1661, the day after the coronation of King Charles II, <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4131/4131-h/4131-h.htm#2H_4_0018\" target=\"_blank\">Pepys writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Waked in the morning with my head in a sad taking through the last night\u2019s drink, which I am very sorry for; so rose and went out with Mr. Creed to drink our morning draft, which he did give me in chocolate to settle my stomach.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chocolate as a hangover cure, sure, why not? This was less than 10 years after chocolate was first brought to England in 1652 and it was already being presented as an aphrodisiac and fertility aid, a link to sensuality that still dominates chocolate advertising to this day. It was also supposed to aid in digestion and to provide healthy nutrients to make \u201csuch as drink it often, Fat, and Corpulent, faire and Amiable.\u201d (The fat and corpulent bit was seen as a feature not a bug.)</p>\n<p>The Earl of Sandwich was one of Pepys\u2019 patrons. He is often mentioned in the journal, so Loveman decided to follow up by reading the unpublished manuscript of Montagu\u2019s journal. She found a 30-page section dedicated to chocolate written in 1668 after the Earl returned from serving as England\u2019s ambassador to Spain. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/La-Xocolatada-Madrid-1710-Barcelona-Museum-of-Ceramics.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26889\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/La-Xocolatada-Madrid-1710-Barcelona-Museum-of-Ceramics-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/La-Xocolatada-Madrid-1710-Barcelona-Museum-of-Ceramics-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/La-Xocolatada-Madrid-1710-Barcelona-Museum-of-Ceramics-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/La-Xocolatada-Madrid-1710-Barcelona-Museum-of-Ceramics-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of making and drinking chocolate from 'La Xocolatada - Madrid,' 1710, Barcelona Museum of Ceramics\" width=\"150\"/></a>Chocolate had been introduced to Europe through Spain when Spanish ships began to transport cacao from Central and South America in the first half of the 16th century. Initially it did not make a great impression. Cocoa is very bitter indeed without sugar, but the addition of spices like cinnamon and later with cane sugar made it palatable enough for the habit to be acquired. By the early 17th century, chocolate was a popular elite beverage in Spain, served at Court along with sweets, pastries and snow. They also drank it in public, a social custom known as a Xocolatada or Chocolatada. (See <a href=\"http://www.museuceramica.bcn.es/english/colecc/frmcolecc02.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>La Xocolatada</em></a>, a Catalan ceramic tile piece from 1710 illustrating the Spanish custom of chocolate made and consumed as a communal, but still elite, tradition.)</p>\n<p>From Spain, chocolate spread to France where its trade became a state monopoly and only the aristocracy were allowed to indulge. Louis XIII\u2019s wife Queen Anne of Austria, daughter of King Philip III of Spain, was an avowed chocolate lover. When she married Louis in 1615, she ensconced the fashion for chocolate in the highest echelons of French society. </p>\n<p>England came to the chocolate game a few decades later, first through translations of a 1631 book about chocolate written by Spanish doctor Antonio Colmenero de Ledesma which were published in the 1640s and in 1652. The title page of the 1652 translation notes that the chocolate described in the volume could be purchased \u201cat reasonable rates\u201d from bookseller John Dakins in Holborn. Booksellers often sold medicines and nostrums at this time, which is how chocolate got on the menu.</p>\n<p>The first free-standing advertisement for chocolate published in <em>The Publick Adviser</em> in June 1657:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Bishopsgate Street in Queen\u2019s Head Alley, at a Frenchman\u2019s house, is an excellent West Indian drink called chocolate, to be sold, where you may have it ready at any time, and also unmade, at reasonable rates.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cacao-grinder-in-journal-of-first-Earl-of-Sandwich.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26887\" height=\"122\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cacao-grinder-in-journal-of-first-Earl-of-Sandwich-150x122.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cacao-grinder-in-journal-of-first-Earl-of-Sandwich-150x122.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cacao-grinder-in-journal-of-first-Earl-of-Sandwich-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cacao-grinder-in-journal-of-first-Earl-of-Sandwich-430x349.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cacao-grinder in journal of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Earl of Sandwich\u2019s 30 pages leans heavily on Spanish expertise. He includes Colmenero de Ledesma\u2019s instructions on how to prepare chocolate, plus 10 pages from a spy in Madrid who reported on the Spanish manufacturing process. First the nuts were dried and ground, then sugar and spices (chile peppers, cinnamon and aniseed were the favorites) were ground separately and then cooked together. This produced a thick paste that would keep for a long time once hardened. The Spanish would add hot water to the paste and whip it, adding more water and sugar to taste. The result was a thick, sludgy beverage that even with the sugar was still bitter (it takes an enormous amount of sugar to de-bitterize chocolate, as anyone who has tried to make hot chocolate straight from cocoa powder has learned the hard way). </p>\n<p>Montagu collected all this information with a political aim, not just out of personal interest. Cromwell\u2019s Navy had taken Jamaica from the Spanish in 1655, and there were lots of cacao plantations in Jamaica. As ambassador to Spain, Sandwich had signed a new commercial treaty with Spain cementing the status of Britain\u2019s new West Indian territories. Now England had reliable access to the raw materials of chocolate-making, a rich potential market for the restored Crown. Upon his return to England, Montagu was appointed to the Privy Council\u2019s committee for trade and foreign plantations, so his research was relevant to his job as well.</p>\n<p>King Charles II was very much interested personally. He and Sandwich discussed chocolate together and one of the recipes in Montagu\u2019s journal he got directly from the King. From Loveman\u2019s paper, <a href=\"http://jsh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/08/18/jsh.sht050.short\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Introduction of Chocolate into England: Retailers, Researchers, and Consumers, 1640\u20131730</em></a>, published in the <em>Journal of Social History</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sandwich soon obtained a recipe for a chocolate \u201cleaven cake\u201d described as \u201cthe Kings receipt for which he gave 200 libre\u201d \u2014 that is apparently, if barely credibly, \u00a3200. The recipe involved mixing three pounds of cacao nuts with oil of Jamaican pepper, oil of aniseed, oil of cinnamon, cardamom, and Guinea pepper to create tablets that could be stored. \u201cTo make the Chacolatte it selfe\u201d then required adding cacao nuts, sugar, and a vanilla pod to \u201cthe Leaven.\u201d Perfumed sugar, using musk, ambergris, and civet, could be added to taste</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mmm\u2026 Civet musk\u2026 That sounds like something out of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/292\" target=\"_blank\">the Futurist Cookbook</a>. I dearly hope the King didn\u2019t actually pay \u00a3200 for that.</p>\n<p>The recipe for the frozen chocolate is considerably more appetizing, and it utilizes what was then the cutting edge research of Robert Boyle who had experimented with freezing and published <em>New Experiments and Observations Touching Cold</em> in 1665. It was Boyle who found that adding salt to snow was necessary in order to freeze liquids placed inside a vessel which would be in turn placed inside a container of salted snow. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the Earl of Sandwich\u2019s recipe for Curdled Chocolate Ice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Prepare the chocolatti [to make a drink] \u2026 and Then Putt the vessell that hath the Chocolatti in it, into a Jaraffa [i.e. a carafe] of snow stirred together with some salt, &amp; shaike the snow together sometyme &amp; it will putt the Chocolatti into tender Curdled Ice &amp; soe eate ^it with spoons.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ll take that over the musk chocolate any day. The concept of frozen beverages didn\u2019t catch on in England right away. Ices were popular already in Italy, but in England they were considered dangerous to the health. Sandwich made a point of noting of how to counteract this chilling effect: \u201cone is oblidged for better security to Drinke Hott chocolatti in 1/4 of an houre after.\u201d Then wait another hour before going in the water.</p>\n<p>Dr. Loveman made the Curdled Ice herself and she said it was like a very thick frappucino minus the dairy.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"First Earl of Sandwich\u2019s recipe for iced chocolate\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26885\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26885#comments\">11 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-26866\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26866\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Jack the Ripper\u2019s Autumn of Terror on Twitter\">Jack the Ripper\u2019s Autumn of Terror on Twitter</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, August 29th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Illustrated-Police-News-September-8-1888.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-26870\" height=\"142\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Illustrated-Police-News-September-8-1888-200x142.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Illustrated-Police-News-September-8-1888-200x142.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Illustrated-Police-News-September-8-1888-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Illustrated-Police-News-September-8-1888-430x305.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Illustrated-Police-News-September-8-1888.jpg 1237w\" title=\"Illustrated Police News, September 8th, 1888\" width=\"200\"/></a>At 3:40 AM on Friday, August 31st, 1888, the mutilated body of Mary Ann Nichols was discovered on Buck\u2019s Row in the Whitechapel district of London\u2019s East End.

When substances are poured into the wells, they display a range of green to red colors which can be used to identify the substance. It\u2019s exceptionally sensitive, more so than many fully realized sensors in action today, and the color change makes data that could once only be identified with precision spectrometers or fluorescence labeling easily visible to the naked eye or regular color photography.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Model-of-nano-cup-arrays.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26851\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Model-of-nano-cup-arrays-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Model-of-nano-cup-arrays-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Model-of-nano-cup-arrays-430x556.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Model-of-nano-cup-arrays.jpg 850w\" title=\"Model of nanoscale Lycurgus cup arrays\" width=\"115\"/></a>\u201cOur label-free colorimetric sensor eliminates the need of problematic fluorescence tagging of DNA/ protein molecules, and the hybridization of probe and target molecule is detected from the color change of the sensor,\u201d stated Manas Gartia, first author of the article, \u201cColorimetrics: Colorimetric Plasmon Resonance Imaging Using Nano Lycurgus Cup Arrays.\u201d \u201cOur current sensor requires just a light source and a camera to complete the DNA sensing process.

Just over six inches in height and five inches in diameter, the Lycurgus Cup is unique. Not only is it the only complete Roman object made out of dichroic glass to survive, but it\u2019s the only extant dichroic glass to have so extreme a color shift, from opaque jade-like green to a deep translucent ruby red. It\u2019s also the only <em>diatretum</em>, or cage cup \u2014 a cup decorated by grinding away parts of a thick glass blank leaving a decorative relief connected to the new surface of the glass \u2014 existing today that has a figural design rather than a geometric one. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Corning-Glassworks-base-replica.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26850\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Corning-Glassworks-base-replica-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Corning-Glassworks-base-replica-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Corning-Glassworks-base-replica-200x276.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Corning-Glassworks-base-replica-430x595.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Corning-Glassworks-base-replica.jpg 552w\" title=\"Corning Glassworks replica of the base cup made in the 1960s\" width=\"108\"/></a>It\u2019s microscopic particles of gold and silver included in the glass during the molten stage that create the dichroic effect. The glass-maker added 330 parts per million of silver and 40 ppm of gold, but just adding tiny amounts of precious metals to the glass would not create a dichroic effect. The key intermediate step is when the silver and gold form into submicroscopic crystals called colloids which precipitate in the glass forming an alloy. These crystals scatter reflected light fairly evenly. In transmitted light, the crystals scatter blue more effectively than red, thus making the glass look red to the viewer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26727\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Dionysus orders his minions to torment the entrapped Lycurgus, reflective light\" width=\"112\"/></a>The artisanship this required boggles the mind. The glass makers could not have added such minute amounts of gold and silver just to the glass the cup was going to made out of. These particles are 70 nanometers wide. You can\u2019t even see them with an optical microscope, never mind the human eyeball; you need a transmission electron microscope at least. Experts believe the craftsmen added the minimum possible of the metals and then diluted the glass-melt with more and more glass until they had the proportion right.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26730\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Dionysus orders his minions to torment the entrapped Lycurgus, transmitted light\" width=\"112\"/></a>Once the glass makers finished making the base cup, then another set of geniuses stepped in: the glass cutters. They took the thick-walled blanks and cut away at the surface used a series of painfully small (six to 12 millimeters in diameter) rotary wheels topped with an abrasive slurry made by mixing sad, quartz, emery, maybe even diamond, with water or oil. They finished the fine details using files and abrasives. The result of this insane work is a high relief connected to the surface of the cup with slender \u201cbridges.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26835\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-2-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-2-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-2-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-green-2-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Dionysus dispatches Pan\" width=\"112\"/></a>On the Lycurgus cup, these bridges are grape vines and other figural elements. It depicts an unusual mythological scene from the story of King Lycurgus of Thracia. Lycurgus banned the worship of Dionysos in his kingdom. When the wine god and his entourage showed up in Thracia, Lycurgus flew into a range. Driven by his violent temper, the king attacked the maenad Ambrosia. She cried out to Gaia for help and was transformed into a grape vine and wound herself around Lycurgus, trapping him. The cup shows Lycurgus thrashing in the vine while Dionysos dispatches a goat-legged Pan and a full-human satyr to torture the trapped king. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26839\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-2-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-2-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-2-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-side-red-2-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Dionysus dispatches Pan\" width=\"112\"/></a>There are many versions of the Lycurgus story, but this particular one has no exact parallels in Roman art. The cup may have been used in Bacchic rituals which were still in practice in fourth century Rome. In addition to the story the cup tells, the color shift from green to red parallels the maturation of the grape. Historians have also posited that it might be a political reference to Constantine\u2019s defeat of Licinius in 324 A.D. It was certainly a specific commission and a hugely expensive one at that, with everything from glass color to theme to decoration being top of the line and one of a kind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-inside1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26838\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-inside1-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-inside1-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-inside1-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lycurgus-Cup-inside1-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Inside the Lycurgus Cup\" width=\"112\"/></a>Vopiscus described dichroic glass cups in \u201cThe Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus\u201d <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Firmus_et_al*.html#ref26\" target=\"_blank\">from the <em>Historia Augusta</em></a>. He quotes a letter purportedly written by the emperor Hadrian to his brother-in-law Servianus, husband of Hadrian\u2019s elder sister Aelia Domitia Paulina.</p>\n<blockquote><p> I am sending you over some cups, changing colour and variegated, presented to me by the priest of a temple and now dedicated particularly to you and my sister. I should like you to use them at banquets on feast-days.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The letter is probably a fake. Hadrian goes on a rant against Egyptians, accusing them, among many other charges, of saying mean things about his adopted son Lucius Verus as soon as he left the country, but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130 A.D. and he only adopted Verus in 136 A.D. It does, however, indicate that Vopiscus was aware of cups made of dichroic glass and that they were the kind of thing emperors would send to their family members to use in religious rituals.</p>\n<p>Now there are a billion of them on an inch of plastic that might diagnose illnesses around the world for a negligible sum.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Lycurgus Cup inspires cool new sensor technology\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26724\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26724#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-26816\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26816\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Pilot\u2019s ring lost in WWII POW camp returned to son\">Pilot\u2019s ring lost in WWII POW camp returned to son</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, August 27th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Engraved-original.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26817\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Engraved-original-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Engraved-original-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Engraved-original-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Engraved-original-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Engraved-original.jpg 1120w\" title=\"David C.

He was imprisoned there for a year and a half before he and a few thousand other Allied officers were forced to march three days in the January snow and take a train for three more days until they reached Stalag VII-A, Germany\u2019s largest POW camp near Moosburg, southern Bavaria.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2nd-Lt.-David-C.-Cox-center-with-surviving-crew-from-May-17-1943-mission-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26825\" height=\"108\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2nd-Lt.-David-C.-Cox-center-with-surviving-crew-from-May-17-1943-mission--150x108.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2nd-Lt.-David-C.-Cox-center-with-surviving-crew-from-May-17-1943-mission--150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2nd-Lt.-David-C.-Cox-center-with-surviving-crew-from-May-17-1943-mission--200x144.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2nd-Lt.-David-C.-Cox-center-with-surviving-crew-from-May-17-1943-mission--430x311.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2nd-Lt.-David-C.-Cox-center-with-surviving-crew-from-May-17-1943-mission-.jpg 1200w\" title=\"2nd Lt.

Allied prisoners from other POW camps under threat from the Soviets were also sent to Stalag VII-A. It had been built in 1939 to hold 10,000 Polish prisoners. By January of 1945 when David Cox arrived, there were 80,000 Allied prisoners. Conditions, needless to say, were atrocious. Barracks were painfully overcrowded and the Red Cross rations that had sustained the POWs had dwindled to nothing. The prisoners made do with insect-infested bread and thin soup. Starving, they would trade anything they had for a morsel of food. Cox, who had kept the gold ring through so much hardship, finally traded it for two chocolate bars an Italian POW had managed to scrounge up. </p>\n<p>On April 29th, 1945, by Combat Command A of the 14th Armored Division liberated Stalag VII-A. They didn\u2019t even know the camp was there until a few hours before the battle began when a delegation of one SS officer, one Red Cross representative and two Allied officer POWs approached the command post offering surrender terms. The army\u2019s tactical goal of capturing a bridge across the Isar river could not be achieved if they accepted the surrender, so instead the 14th Armored Division forewent an artillery assault to avoid harming the POWs. The Germans destroyed the bridge before the Americans could capture it, so technically they failed in their mission, but they defeated the German defenders at Moosburg anyway and liberated the camp.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Stalag-VII-A-aerial-view.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26828\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Stalag-VII-A-aerial-view-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Stalag-VII-A-aerial-view-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Stalag-VII-A-aerial-view-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Stalag-VII-A-aerial-view-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Aerial view of Stalag VII-A \" width=\"150\"/></a>They were shocked to find 110,000 prisoners in Stalag VII-A, 30,000 of them Americans. The liberation of so many POWs at once quickly overshadowed the issue of the bridge, and Moosburg became a point of pride. General George S. Patton, commander of Third Army, visited the camp in person.</p>\n<p>Once liberated, David Cox was promoted to 1st lieutenant and sent home to North Carolina where his wife Hilda, his parents and siblings were waiting for him. He and Hilda would go on to have three children. David didn\u2019t talk much about his war experience, but one story he told often was how he had had to give up his beloved ring. He had an exact duplicate made shortly after his return and he wore it religiously until shortly before his death in 1994. He bequeathed the replica ring to his son David C. Cox, Jr., who wore it until the band snapped.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-holds-pic-of-grandparent.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26818\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-holds-pic-of-grandparent-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-holds-pic-of-grandparent-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-holds-pic-of-grandparent-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-holds-pic-of-grandparent-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Martin Kiss holds a photo of his grandparents\" width=\"150\"/></a>Last year, Americans Mark and Mindy Turner moved to the Bavarian village of Hohenberg where Mark got a job as an air traffic controller at the US Army garrison in nearby Ansbach. Earlier this month, the Turners went to dinner at the house of their neighbors Martin and Regina Kiss. After a tour of Martin\u2019s art studio, Martin showed the Turners a special treasure of his: a gold ring with a wee propeller on top and a dedication to a certain David C. Cox engraved on the inside. </p>\n<p>He then told them the story of how he had acquired the ring. The Kiss family hails from an ethnically Hungarian area in what is today northern Serbia. Kiss\u2019 grandparents ran a pub. When a Soviet soldier stopped there on his way home after the war, he traded the gold ring in exchange for food and lodging. Grandmama Kiss gave the ring to Martin in 1971. By then it had become something of a good luck amulet for the family, and Martin was moving to Germany so his grandmother wanted him to have the ring to bring him good fortune in his new life and to give him something to sell if he was ever in extreme need. He wore it as a pinkie ring for a while, but then put it in a corked bottle for safekeeping. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-Mark-Turner-hold-ring-pic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26826\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-Mark-Turner-hold-ring-pic-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-Mark-Turner-hold-ring-pic-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-Mark-Turner-hold-ring-pic-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-Mark-Turner-hold-ring-pic-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Martin-Kiss-Mark-Turner-hold-ring-pic.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Martin Kiss (right) and Mark Turner (left) hold pictures of the ring\" width=\"150\"/></a>Martin Kiss had always been curious about the owner of the ring. He asked the Turners if they could help find him, and thanks to that detailed inscription and the wonders of Google, Mark Turner found a reference to David C. Cox\u2019s war experience and how he had  had to trade his gold ring for two chocolate bars in a thesis written by Norwood McDowell, husband of one of Cox\u2019s granddaughters. Mark emailed McDowell a picture of Martin Kiss\u2019 ring. McDowell forwarded it to David Cox, Jr., and he confirmed that that was his father\u2019s precious long-lost ring. </p>\n<p>Martin Kiss insisted on returning the ring, no questions asked, no remuneration, not even shipping costs, accepted. His grandfather had been a POW in Soviet camps, so he knew what the ring would mean to the family.

Oman was also colonized by the Portuguese for a few decades while they were in the neighborhood in the early 16th century and in the late 17th century Oman conquered the east African coast where Kilwa once reigned. So there were plenty of opportunities for an old Kilwa copper to wind up in Oman. How five of the made their way more than 6000 miles east to the Wessell Islands is a fascinating historical mystery, one with the potential to rewrite the history of when non-indigenous people first stepped foot in Oz. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-6-e1377571157954.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26805\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-6-e1377571157954-144x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-6-e1377571157954-144x150.jpg 144w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-6-e1377571157954-200x207.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-6-e1377571157954-430x445.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-6-e1377571157954.jpg 802w\" title=\"Another side of one of the Kilwa coins found on  Wessels Islands in 1944\" width=\"144\"/></a>Kilwa is a small island off the coast of Tanzania. The sultanate was founded around 900 A.D. by displaced Persian prince Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi and soon became the primary center of commerce and trade on the east African coast. Kilwa territory grew nothing but coconut palms. They built their wealth as middlemen, trading manufactured goods from Arabia and India for food, gold and ivory with the inland Bantu communities, keeping the food and shipping the precious materials to Asia where they bought manufactured goods and started the cycle all over again. The Kilwa traders had sailing ships \u2014 coconut wood dhows sewn together with cocoa coir and sporting braided coconut leaf mat sails \u2014 that could travel as far as India during monsoon season thanks to propitious winds in the summer and then head back home in the winter. As far as we know, however, the Kilwa dhows couldn\u2019t handle the turbulent waters and winds much further south than Inhambane, in today\u2019s Mozambique.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-5-e1377571129950.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26804\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-5-e1377571129950-145x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-5-e1377571129950-145x150.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-5-e1377571129950-200x206.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-5-e1377571129950-430x443.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kilwa-coin-5-e1377571129950.jpg 805w\" title=\"Another side of one of the Kilwa coins found on  Wessels Islands in 1944\" width=\"145\"/></a>Ian McIntosh, an Australian archaeologist who is now an anthropology professor of at Indiana University, explored the island when he was writing his doctorate on the Wessel Islands in the 1990s, but there wasn\u2019t the interest or funding to do a proper archaeological excavation.

It\u2019s also the earliest engraved globe and the oldest post-Columbian globe known to survive. Last but certainly not least, it\u2019s one of only two globes in the world to feature an epic sentence that people think was common in ancient and medieval maps but in fact is only known exist on these two globes: \u201cHIC SVNT DRACONES,\u201d the famous \u201chere be dragons.\u201d </p>\n<p>The ostrich egg globe was purchased by a private institution that has chosen to remain anonymous at last year\u2019s London Map Fair. The dealer who sold it claimed it had been part of \u201can important European collection\u201d since it was acquired after World War II. Dr. Stefaan Missinne, a Belgian real estate developer, map collector and published scholar of articles on ivory and silver globes, spent the past year researching the globe, consulting with more than 100 experts in his investigation of the artifact\u2019s date, origin, sources, materials and construction. In addition to extensive documentary research, Missinne submitted the globe to scientific analyses including computer tomography, radiocarbon dating, regression analysis and x-ray fluorescence analysis. Missinne published the announcement of the globe\u2019s discovery and the results of his research <a href=\"http://www.washmapsociety.org/Earliest-Globe-America.htm\" target=\"_blank\">in the latest issue of <em>The Portolan</em></a>, a cartography journal published by the Washington Map Society.</p>\n<p>The globe is around 11 centimeters (4.33 inches) in diameter, about the size of a grapefruit. Its maker cut the bottom halves of two ostrich eggs to make a proper sphere out of them. The map was carved into the individual eggshells and the lines traced with a blue-black color. X-ray fluorescence analysis found high levels of iron and traces of barium in the colored parts which indicates the engraver did not use paint but rather iron gall ink, perhaps mixed with an indigo blue derived from irises. Once engraved and inked, the two and then the two pieces were joined using the natural polymer <em>gommalacca</em> (shellac).</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-4-Asia-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-26765\" height=\"431\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-4-Asia-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe-430x431.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-4-Asia-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe-430x431.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-4-Asia-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-4-Asia-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe-200x200.jpg 200w\" title=\"Figure 4.

Asia on the ostrich egg globe, showing the large peninsula jutting southward at the right which is evidence of the influence of Henricus Martellus.  Photo: Washington Map Society.</em></small></p>\n<p>The shells themselves are primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), as are all bird eggshells, but CT scans found that they\u2019ve lost 50% of their calcium bone density compared to a new ostrich egg. Loss of moisture over time causes this in eggshells just like it does in human bones. By examining a random selection of ostrich eggs at the Museum of Natural History in Vienna, Missinne found that unmounted ostrich eggs lose about 10% of their density every 100 years until they have no moisture left to lose. Regression analysis on the ostrich egg globe found therefore that the egg was new about 500 years ago, giving it a creation date of ca. 1500. </p>\n<p>This could not be confirmed with radiocarbon dating. The counterweight material in the bottom of the globe was tested and found to be of fossil origin and 49,310 years (+/\u2013 620 years) old. This is probably because the bottom shell was filled with an organic fossil resin, commonly used as varnish in the Renaissance. Missinne decided not sample the eggshell itself because, according to University of Heidelberg professor Dr. Bernd Kromer, \u201cwithout knowing the geographical origin of the ostrich egg material and the specific living area of the mother bird, it is very difficult or even impossible to estimate a C-14 date for the egg because of possible interference resulting from the bird\u2019s eating other sources of carbon.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lenox-globe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-26796\" height=\"209\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lenox-globe-200x209.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lenox-globe-200x209.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lenox-globe-143x150.jpg 143w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lenox-globe-430x449.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lenox-globe.jpg 956w\" title=\"Hunt-Lenox Globe, courtesy of the New York Public Library\" width=\"200\"/></a>Missinne turned to historical research to confirm the date. After all, the egg halves could be 500 years old but the engraving relatively new. A globe expert noted that the ostrich shell globe shares many significant similarities with the New York Public Library\u2019s <a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/treasures/items/show/163\" target=\"_blank\">Hunt-Lenox Globe</a>, a small engraved copper sphere from 1504-1506, that until now has held the title of the oldest globe to include the New World. Not only does the Lenox Globe share the overall design of the countries and continents with the ostrich egg globe, but it is identical in minute details like the waves of the ocean, the outline of islands and the Latin nomenclature and script and, most awesomely, in the presence over southeast Asia of the sentence \u201cHIC SVNT DRACONES.\u201d</p>\n<p>This degree of similarity could not have been created by human hands working on two different pieces. Missinne concludes that the Lenox Globe was not directly engraved but rather was cast from the ostrich egg globe. That means the latter has to predate the former. The major differences between the two globes are the size, shape and the details at the equator. The Lenox Globe is an accurate sphere, whereas the egg has some irregularities. The Lenox is 11.2 centimeters in diameter, so slightly larger than the ostrich egg globe. Lastly, the details along the equator are crisp on the Lenox Globe while they\u2019re obscured by the <em>gommalacca</em> joinery on the ostrich egg.   </p>\n<p>We know the egg has shrunk a little over time which explains the discrepancy in size and the unevenness in the sphere. The Lenox Globe is crisp along the equator because it was made from two half-spheres of copper alloy cast from the two half shells after they were carved but before they were joined. The other small imperfections in the eggshell were corrected on the bronze during the finishing process. Missinne believes the Lenox Globe was cast directly from a plaster of Paris mold made from each of the two pieces of the ostrich eggshell. The size discrepancy supports this hypothesis. Calculating back from the 50% density loss, the ostrich egg globe was about 11.4 centimeters in diameter when it was new. Direct casting typically results in 1.5% of shrinkage from model to cast, which is consistent with the Lenox Globe\u2019s diameter of 11.2 centimeters. </p>\n<p>As for the map itself, Missinne identified several sources for its geographical information. Ptolemy\u2019s <a href=\"http://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Claudius+Ptolemy%22\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Geographia</em></a> was used for the maps and nomenclature of Europe, Africa and Asia. The shape of the southern peninsula of Asia is very similar to those in maps of world by Henricus Martellus, a German cartographer who lived and worked in Florence in the late 15th century. The bestselling memoirs of Marco Polo were the probably source for Japan, called \u201cZIPANCRI\u201d on the ostrich shell map. Information about the New World shows the influence of travel logs by Christopher Columbus, Portuguese explorers Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real, Portuguese navigator Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and the Italian after whom the continent would be named, Amerigo Vespucci.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-6-the-New-World-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-26766\" height=\"420\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-6-the-New-World-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe-430x420.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-6-the-New-World-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe-430x420.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-6-the-New-World-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe-150x146.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fig-6-the-New-World-on-the-ostrich-egg-globe-200x195.jpg 200w\" title=\"Figure 6.

Florence is a likely candidate as it was a center of cartography in the Renaissance and was awash in all that Medici banking money for art patronage, but scholars think the Lenox Globe may have had a Parisian origin and the two globes must have been together in order for the Hunt-Lenox to have been cast from the ostrich egg. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Ostrich egg globe may be oldest with New World\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26763\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26763#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-26768\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26768\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Help Cygan become Leeds\u2019 Robot in Residence\">Help Cygan become Leeds\u2019 Robot in Residence</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, August 24th, 2013</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Leeds-Town-Hall-Cygan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-26769\" height=\"305\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Leeds-Town-Hall-Cygan-430x305.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Leeds-Town-Hall-Cygan-430x305.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Leeds-Town-Hall-Cygan-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Leeds-Town-Hall-Cygan-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Leeds-Town-Hall-Cygan.jpg 999w\" title=\"Cygan looms over Leeds Town Hall \" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Emma Bearman of <a href=\"http://www.playfulleeds.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Playful Leeds</a> has had the brilliant idea to secure <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/26552\" target=\"_blank\">1950s robot playboy Cygan</a> for the great city of Leeds. He lived there for a while in the 60s employed as a mascot for a car dealership, so it would be a sort of homecoming, and this time he would be the robot ambassador for the whole city, not just for a fine stable of Ford automobiles. </p>\n<p>Through <a href=\"http://www.playfulleeds.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Playful Leeds</a> Emma has <a href=\"https://spacehive.com/CyganToLeeds\" target=\"_blank\">started a fundraiser</a> to raise not inconsiderable sum of \u00a315,000 which will cover the high pre-sale estimate and leave a little extra for fees and transportation. The Christie\u2019s auction is on September 5th which means time is running out. They have less than two weeks to reach their goal and right now they have \u00a31,057 in pledges. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s insanely cool to think that someone might buy one of the artifacts they\u2019ve read about here, restore it and display it for the public good. <a href=\"https://spacehive.com/CyganToLeeds\" target=\"_blank\">Go here to pledge</a> and help make the dream a reality.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Wouldn\u2019t it be brilliant to have Cygan welcoming visitors &amp; residents alike to Leeds? As our first Robot in Residence, we\u2019d love to see how he stimulates us to create our own robots and acts as an ambassador, inviting robots from around the world to Leeds.

In addition to returning Cygan to full working order, Playful Leeds aims to involve him in a variety of public events dedicated to celebrating robotic technology throughout this year and the next. Festivities will kick off with the March of the Robots in October. If they win him at auction, Cygan will be its Grand Marshall and he\u2019d do a phenomenal job, no doubt. When Leeds\u2019 year of celebrating robotics and technology ends, Cygan will be found a fitting permanent where he can delight the city until Judgement Day after which the Terminators will destroy him for being on our side.</p>\n<p>The fundraiser is just a few days old and has already <a href=\"http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/bid-to-give-robot-mascot-a-leeds-home-1-5982262\" target=\"_blank\">made regional news</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-23823903\" target=\"_blank\">national news</a>.

She was 32 and at the peak of her professional success when she boarded <em>Titanic</em> at Cherbourg. She booked a first class cabin for herself and the 19 trunks full of glamorous gowns she was bringing across the ocean for her American clients. </p>\n<p>When the iceberg hit, Edith was unconcerned. In <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/titanic-disaster-documentary/query/347801\" target=\"_blank\">British Path\u00e9 interview from 1970</a>, she describes people making snowballs out of the ice shards left on the deck after the collision. When a cabin steward told her it was time to abandon ship, she locked all 19 of her trunks and put all 19 keys in her pocket. One thing she kept with her: her lucky musical pig which she had gotten after a serious car accident the year before in which the driver had died. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26739\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Edith Russell's musical pig\" width=\"150\"/></a>She did not want to leave the ship. The lifeboats weren\u2019t attached to the deck so you could just step into them. There was an intimidating gap between the ship and the boats, and they were in various states of being lowered to the ocean. People had to climb up on the railing and jump into the boats. If they missed, all that awaited them was a 14-storey plunge into freezing water. Edith preferred to stay put. A sailor saw her and intervened. He said: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be saved; well, I\u2019ll save your baby.\u201d He snatched the pig out from under her arm and dropped into Lifeboat 11. In the interview Edit says \u201cwhen they threw that pig, I knew it was my mother calling me.\u201d She jumped in after him, and that\u2019s how the pig saved her life.</p>\n<p>She played the musical pig to soothe the children on the lifeboat. One of those children was Philip Aks, a baby who was just 10 months old. He had been separated from his 18-year-old mother, third-class passengers Leah Aks, during the chaos. He was thrown into Lifeboat 11 while his mother was forced into the next boat even though she tried to push her way onto 11 to be with her son. Edith held little Philip and played the music for him over and over again. In April of 1953, Edit, Leah and Philip met again at a special preview of the movie <em>Titanic</em> starring Barbara Stanwyck. Producers invited a number of survivors who had an emotional reunion at the screening. Edit remarked: \u201cThe baby, amongst other babies, for whom I played my little pig music box to the tune of \u2018Maxixe\u2019 was there.\u201d He is forty-one years old, is a rich steel magnate from Norfolk, Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/edith-russel-teresa-thorne-pig.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26740\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/edith-russel-teresa-thorne-pig-150x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/edith-russel-teresa-thorne-pig-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/edith-russel-teresa-thorne-pig-200x160.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/edith-russel-teresa-thorne-pig-430x344.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/edith-russel-teresa-thorne-pig.jpg 1244w\" title='Edith Russell, her pig and Teresa Thorne who played her in \"A Night to Remember\", 1958' width=\"150\"/></a>Russell was more directly involved in the next Titanic movie, the 1958 classic <em>A Night to Remember</em>. She basically forced herself onto producer William MacQuitty as an informal consultant for the picture. She had already introduced herself to Walter Lord, author of the book on which the movie was based, after his account became a best-seller. Edith had written a memoir of her own, the excellently named <em>A Pig and a Prayer Saved Me from the Titanic</em>, and she was angry that Lord had stolen her thunder with his well-received book. Lord was kind to her \u2014 he had been in contact with survivors in the process of researching the book but had been unable to find her \u2014 and they became friends. After her death in April 1975 at the venerable age of 96, Edith left her pig and other memorabilia to Walter Lord.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26738\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-det-150x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-det-150x148.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-det-200x198.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-det-430x426.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Edith-Russell-lucky-pig-det.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Face detail of musical pig\" width=\"150\"/></a>Lord died in 2002 and, as he was encouraged to do by fellow <em>Titanic</em> obsessive William MacQuitty, he <a href=\"http://www.rmg.co.uk/user-type/press-and-media/national-maritime-museum-receives-historic-titanic-archive-the-lord-macquitty-collection\" target=\"_blank\">bequeathed his vast collection of <em>Titanic</em> artifacts</a>, many of them given to him by survivors, to the <a href=\"http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum/\" target=\"_blank\">National Maritime Museum</a> in Greenwich, London.

That model can then be broken apart, dissected and examined from every conceivable angle. Inside the pig researchers found its curly tail, long thought lost, and the crank-handle that was turned to make the music play. A loose pin was also inside the pig, possibly a relic of an attempt to activate the player after the crank-handle wound up in its rotund belly. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/3D-view-of-pig-mechanism-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-26737\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/3D-view-of-pig-mechanism--150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/3D-view-of-pig-mechanism--150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/3D-view-of-pig-mechanism--200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/3D-view-of-pig-mechanism--430x288.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/3D-view-of-pig-mechanism-.jpg 1000w\" title=\"3D model of music player inside the pig\" width=\"150\"/></a>The 3D models revealed the musical mechanism inside the pig. It\u2019s a small, simple device with a toothed wheel turned by the crank shaft against a comb that reads the teeth as notes. It looks like those cylinders in player pianos except they\u2019re perforated rather than toothy. Using the detailed images from the model, experts spent almost a year studying the mechanism and were able to piece together every note it once played. For the first time in living memory, hear the pig play the song that soothed the children on Lifeboat 11 while they waited in the frigid night for seven hours for the <em>Carpathia</em> to rescue them:</p>\n<!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" id=\"audio-26734-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><source src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pigmusic.mp3?_=1\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"/><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pigmusic.mp3\">http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pigmusic.mp3</a></audio>\n<p>According to Edith, the melody was the <em>Maxixe</em>, a popular Brazilian dance song, but the National Maritime Museum researchers challenged the Internet to <a href=\"http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/collections/2013/08/21/name-that-tune/\" target=\"_blank\">name that tune</a>.

The rudder is eight a half meters (27.9 feet) long, weighs three and a half tons and a has a man\u2019s head sporting a dashing moustache carved out of one end of the beam. The pupils are concave; historians believe they may have once held precious or semi-precious stones, a testament to how extravagantly appointed this ship was.</p>\n<p>The Swash Channel Wreck was discovered in March of 1990 when a Dutch dredging ship struck an obstacle. They pulled up timbers and a cannon, but there was no further investigation at that time. In 2004 the Poole Harbour Commissioners and Poole Borough Council site commissioned Wessex Archaeology to survey the site and English Heritage contracted further exploration in 2005. Wessex Archaeology found a structure 65 feet long that included some the upper deck like the forecastle with its galley and gunports. This is almost unheard of in shipwrecks because the top parts are usually destroyed in the wrecking. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-being-raised.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26715\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-being-raised-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-being-raised-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-being-raised-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-being-raised-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-being-raised.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Rudder being raised to the Poole Harbour quai\" width=\"150\"/></a>Bournemouth University was enlisted in 2006 by English Heritage to monitor the site. They discovered that the wreck site, which was actually twice the size the original survey had found it to be, was in danger from sediment loss in the active shipping lane. As the sand levels lowered, artifacts were being exposed to corrosion, bacteria and shipworm and rapidly degrading. Raising the shipwreck like was done with the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/25098\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mary Rose</em></a> would be prohibitively expensive, so the university kept monitoring the site and experimented with methods of in situ conservation.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Heritage Lottery Fund gave the university a \u00a3141,200 ($220,000) grant for the excavation, documentation and, where possible, recovery of the ship artifacts. For the next three years, Swash Channel saw the largest underwater excavation in the UK since the raising of the <em>Mary Rose</em> in 1982. More than 1200 objects have been lifted from the site, among them timbers, ropes and pulley blocks from the rigging, cannon, cannon balls, barrels that once held salt pork for the crew, lanterns, gun carriages, navigational equipment and personal items like leather shoes, wooden bowls and tankards. No cargo has been found, interestingly enough, suggesting that either it and its containers have been destroyed or that there was a salvage operation after the ship sank.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Merman-carving-from-bow-or-quarterdeck.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-11053\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Merman-carving-from-bow-or-quarterdeck-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Merman-carving-from-bow-or-quarterdeck-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Merman-carving-from-bow-or-quarterdeck-300x198.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Merman-carving-from-bow-or-quarterdeck-1024x679.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Merman-carving-from-bow-or-quarterdeck.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Researcher tends to the Merman carving \" width=\"150\"/></a>No identifying information was discovered so we don\u2019t know what ship this was or even where it came from, but archaeologists believe it was probably a Dutch trading ship carrying luxury goods like high-end fabrics from Europe to Asia and carrying spices on the way back. Dendrochronological analysis found the timbers came from the German-Dutch border and were felled in 1628. Further research suggests that the ship was built in Holland in 1628 or 1629 and that it sank relatively shortly thereafter, sometime between 1630 and 1645. The rudder may provide more information about the ship and its origin.</p>\n<p>The exceptional quality of the carving you see on the rudder was widespread throughout the ship, unmistakable symbols of wealth. Done in early Baroque style, the carvings include mermen on the bow and two cherubs on the gunports. The carved pieces were first photographed by divers in 2005. A <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11049\" target=\"_blank\">bowcastle merman was raised in 2011</a> and 40 feet of the bow were raised in 2012. The rudder is the last and largest piece to be raised. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-watered.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-26720\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-watered-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-watered-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-watered-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Rudder-watered-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Rudder is watered for preservation\" width=\"150\"/></a>Divers spent a week digging the partially buried rudder out of the sand and placing it in a steel frame so it could be raised with a minimum of stress on the wood. On Monday, August 19th, the rudder was lifted out of its watery home of 400 years. It can\u2019t be allowed to dry out or it will shrink, warp and degrade, so it was constantly sprayed with water before being transferred to the York Archaeological Trust. There it will be treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for two years until all the water is replaced with the waxy substance that never evaporates. That will keep the wood supple and allow the rudder to go on permanent display at the <a href=\"http://www.boroughofpoole.com/leisure-and-culture/museums-and-local-history/museum/\" target=\"_blank\">Poole Museum</a>. Some of the smaller artifacts are scheduled to go on display next year; the rudder and the bowcastle will join them in 2015 or 2016.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the wreck \u2014 96% of it \u2014 remains on the seabed. Only the bulky pieces that were sticking up too far to be covered with sand without creating a dangerous bump have been removed. The rest has been covered with sand and sealed to keep it safe from erosion and would-be looters.

{"content": "By Frank Dalesio , as told to Mike Kessler I knew something was wrong the second I heard Willie Beard\u2019s voice. For one thing, he was calling the landline; he\u2019d never done that. For another, I\u2019d gotten to know him over the past several months, and the dude was almost 100 percent night owl, but now he was reaching out on a Sunday afternoon. This was December 2004 in northeast Ohio, up near Cleveland. Beard was a member of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, the country\u2019s most notorious outlaw biker gang. I was a founding member of the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club, the first biker gang ever sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood, the country\u2019s most notorious prison gang. As far as Beard knew, we were associates and friends. He was right only about the first part. The guy had no idea that I was also an undercover agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), let alone that I was running an investigation involving 18 undercovers from four law enforcement agencies in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Or did he know? That\u2019s the question that rattled around my skull. \u201cHey, Junkyard,\u201d Beard said. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d \u201cAbout what?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to show you.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cNot on the phone,\u201d he said. \u201cI had my car swept for bugs. It\u2019s clean.\u201d Beard told me to meet him at the McDonald\u2019s on Interstate 90 and Route 534 and asked if I could be there in 30 minutes\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept he wasn\u2019t asking. I said, \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d hung up, and looked over at my fellow undercover agents, Shorty, Brian, and Bailey. \u201cThis. Cannot. Be good.\u201d They agreed. We slapped together a quick plan: They\u2019d change out of their Nazi-themed biker gear\u200a\u2014\u200anothing\u2019s more conspicuous than guys wearing SS lightning bolts and swastikas\u200a\u2014\u200aand watch us from the lot across from McDonald\u2019s, where they\u2019d act as my cover team. I\u2019d carry a gun, but I wouldn\u2019t wear a wire; for all I knew, Beard would start our little meeting by patting me down. We all agreed that if I got in the car and Beard drove off, then I was getting out whether he stopped the car or not. I found Beard standing inside the main door, sipping coffee. He was a big guy, fit from kickboxing, though you couldn\u2019t see it beneath the winter jacket. I don\u2019t even think we shook hands. He just said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my car,\u201d so I followed him to the parking lot, and we got into his small SUV. How exactly did I become the co-leader of a motorcycle gang sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood? To be honest, it kind of happened by accident. When the doors were closed, Beard reached into his coat pocket. I thought to myself , Is this guy about to off me in a Mickey D\u2019s parking lot? My pistol was tucked into the right-side waistband of my jeans and covered by my old Carhartt work coat. I watched Beard\u2019s hands and leaned toward him a bit in case I needed to draw my gun. But I didn\u2019t. Beard pulled out a small envelope that I noticed was addressed to the Lake East chapter of the Hells Angels\u200a\u2014\u200aBeard\u2019s chapter. He handed it to me and said, \u201cTake a look.\u201d It had photocopies of two pictures. Next to one picture, someone had written, \u201cNazi Jim\u200a\u2014\u200aATF Agent.\u201d Next to the other one: \u201cBailey\u200a\u2014\u200aATF Agent.\u201d I did my best to play it cool. Beard looked at me and said, \u201cAre these dudes in your club? Is that Nazi Jim? Is that Bailey?\u201d I studied the picture like I meant it. That was Nazi Jim alright, and yeah, he was an ATF agent and a member of the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. The guy labeled as Bailey was actually a different ATF agent with a similar look and build; the picture was so grainy that he\u2019d been misidentified. After a few seconds of looking at the pictures, I turned to Beard and shook my head. I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen these guys before.\u201d Then I waited for him to make his next move. H ow exactly did I become the co-leader of a motorcycle gang sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood? To be honest, it kind of happened by accident. The agency never said, \u201cHey, Frank, go out and befriend a bunch of Aryan Brotherhood members and help start their motorcycle gang.\u201d I was never told I\u2019d be palling around with some of the Ohio Aryan Brotherhood\u2019s most notorious members. But things never go as expected when you work undercover. By that point in my career, I\u2019d spent the better part of 18 years working undercover for the ATF. My specialty was outlaw biker-gang infiltrations. I should mention here that they call themselves \u201cmotorcycle clubs.\u201d But these aren\u2019t groups of Sunday cruisers. They have track records as criminal enterprises, which is why law enforcement (and respectable humans) refer to them them as gangs. By 2004, I\u2019d infiltrated the Brothers Motorcycle Club in Columbus, Ohio, and the Vagos club out in Las Vegas. I\u2019d been in a couple armed standoffs and heard a major gang leader order a hit on another undercover ATF agent who happened to be my best friend, Darrin Kozlowski. I\u2019d also played undercover support roles in cases targeting the Outlaws, the Mongols, and the Warlocks. All told, a handful of guys and I, who collectively dedicated hundreds of years on these cases, put hundreds of seriously bad people behind bars for armed violent crimes, attempted murder, weapons sales, and countless other charges. And I picked up a lot of tattoos along the way. In 2001, when I got to the ATF field office in Youngstown, Ohio, I wasn\u2019t supposed to be undercover; I was supposed to be running my group and spending some much-needed time with my wife and our newly adopted daughters. I was still getting adjusted to normal life after an 18-month undercover case. I was happy for the break, but also miserable; even though I was glad to be living without the 24/7 paranoia, something was missing\u200a\u2014\u200athat rush of living the life and catching these bad guys and beating them at their own game. And just like that, I went from being a family man, to being \u201cJunkyard\u201d: a guy who wrestles wild animals in\u00a0public. A year into my time in Youngstown, I got a call from Lieutenant Tom Doyle of the Eastlake Police Department, near Cleveland. He said, \u201cWould you be interested in taking a look at the Hells Angels with us?\u201d Doyle explained that there was a big Hells Angels presence up there; the Lake East and Cleveland chapters ran a lot of drugs and weapons, but law enforcement just couldn\u2019t get the evidence they needed. Doyle said he had a confidential informant\u200a\u2014\u200aa member of the Aryan Brotherhood who\u2019d nearly beat a guy to death in a bar was facing hard time and hoping to knock a few years off his sentence. So ATF formed a task force with the Eastlake police, the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the Ohio State Adult Parole Authority. When we met the confidential information\u2014we call them CIs\u2014he told us about another Aryan Brotherhood member, James \u201cAryan Jim\u201d Blomquist, who went by AJ. AJ knew how to build machine guns. The plan was for our CI to introduce AJ to an undercover agent whose street name was Nazi Jim, have the agent buy some machine guns from him, and shut him down. I\u2019d run things from the field office. But when the meet day came, I asked the CI what he\u2019d told AJ about my undercover guy. The CI looked right at me and said, \u201cI gave him your description.\u201d \u201c My description?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d The CI was a young guy, and I was about 40. He said, \u201cI told AJ that your name was Junkyard and that you know my dad from county jail.\u201d \u201cWhy Junkyard\u2019?\u201d \u201cI dunno.\u201d \u201cWhat else did you tell him about me?\u201d The CI said, \u201cI told him you and my dad used to go to bars and wrestle bears.\u201d He said it like wrestling bears was a normal thing to do. And just like that, I went from being a family man, to being Junkyard, a guy who wrestles wild animals in public. G rowing up Italian-American in a gritty Rust Belt city, I was exposed to a rough crowd. I was comfortable around bad guys and vice versa. At the intro, Nazi Jim and AJ and I spent two or three hours drinking beers and whatnot. I dropped little hints of some of my criminal business\u200a\u2014\u200aenough to let him know I was looking for opportunities. AJ was way more forthright. He told me straight up, \u201cI\u2019m a captain in the Aryan Brotherhood,\u201d and pulled down his shirt collar to show me the tattoo on his chest indicating his rank. Soon enough he told me that if I could get all the parts for machine guns, then he could build them for me. No serial numbers. Totally untraceable. Later, I went online and ordered all the parts, then dropped them with AJ a couple days later. A few days after that, Nazi Jim and I met him in a parking lot outside Cleveland. There were three Sten machine guns with 20-round mags, the same weapons the Brits used in World War II. They looked like they were straight from the manufacturer. A few days later, we asked AJ to make 10 more. We said we\u2019d pay $500 apiece. AJ started calling me every morning just to shoot the shit. I was supposed to be bowing out but I told my boss, \u201cHey, I gotta keep going. He\u2019s expecting me to be involved. He likes me.\u201d (I did not like AJ.) I had to twist some arms at ATF, but soon I was also buying drugs and contraband from AJ. On one of our calls, we got to talking about our love of money and how we wanted to make more. AJ knew I rode motorcycles, and before long he said, \u201cYou know, my Aryan brothers and me, we\u2019ve been trying to get a motorcycle club going for a long time.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s make this happen, Junkyard. I\u2019ll bring five guys, and you bring five guys, and we\u2019ll start a\u00a0club.\u201d AJ wanted to help the Aryan Brotherhood get control of drug and weapons sales in northeast Ohio, which required competing with the Hells Angels and their criminal network. From there, he proposed, they\u2019d take it nationwide. The way AJ saw it, if he was gonna go head-to-head with a motorcycle club, he had to be part of one, and that organization had to have serious power. Up to that point, there hadn\u2019t been an Aryan Brotherhood-sanctioned motorcycle club that I or any of the other ATF agents had heard about. By most accounts, it was founded in the early 1960s in California\u2019s San Quentin State Prison and kept growing on both sides of the bars. Some Aryan Brotherhood members believed in the whole white-power cause; some just rolled with it to stay safe in prison\u2014not that burying your head in the sand makes it okay to be a white supremacist. On the phone, I listened patiently as AJ told me about his visions of criminal greatness, and I told him how brilliant he was. Then he surprised me. AJ said, \u201cLet\u2019s make this happen, Junkyard. I\u2019ll bring five guys, and you bring five guys, and we\u2019ll start a club.\u201d Neither of us had a clue how big this would get. On Saint Patrick\u2019s Day 2004, I brought five guys to a bar in Eastlake, Ohio. Four of them were fellow ATF agents: Ivan, Nazi Jim, JT, and Brian. The fifth, Shorty, was a deputy with the Ashtabula County Sheriff\u2019s Department. AJ brought four guys, including John \u201cJB\u201d Beason, a convicted murderer on parole. JB was covered in prison tats and was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood in Ohio. David Snow was there; he was recognized as the founding Aryan Brotherhood member in the Ohio prison system. A soft-spoken redhead, Snow spent most of his life behind bars. He shot a guy while locked up, and had orchestrated an 11-day prison riot from 23-hour-a-day solitary lockdown in a max-security facility in Youngstown. Legend had it that when he got released, Snow was so accustomed to being in confined spaces that he spent six months living under\u200a\u2014\u200anot in\u2014 his mother\u2019s trailer. Also at the bar was AJ\u2019s other guy, Paul \u201cPaulie\u201d Geiger, who had done 10 years in a federal prison for muling dope in Oklahoma, and his friend Neil Ashley, who went by \u201cMotor.\u201d From left (un-blurred): JB, the author, Ivan, AJ, David\u00a0Snow. We sat around drinking beer and bullshitting until we all felt comfortable enough to talk about starting a motorcycle club and getting a piece of the Hells Angels\u2019 action. The plan was to ease in, not start a war, but eventually take over. Everyone was onboard. Shorty took the opportunity to establish his role as a madman. He put one of those plastic leprechaun hats on his shaved head, jumped on the bar, and shouted, \u201cListen up, you Irish fucks! The Nazis are in charge now, so if you got a problem, fuck off or talk to us!\u201d The fact that AJ brought this foursome of ex-felons was a huge deal. A lot of times, ATF supervisors get bent if the subjects of an undercover operation don\u2019t have felony convictions or a record of violence. Not only did these guys fit the bill, but we were confident that everybody they\u2019d bring us would be violent felons too. That meant they\u2019d likely be in possession of firearms\u200a\u2014\u200aand for the ATF, criminals with guns are a good thing. After all, the bureau\u2019s job isn\u2019t just to go after arms dealers; it\u2019s to take armed felons out of their communities. While other law enforcement agencies would rather stay away from people who carry weapons, ATF seeks them out. For us, a bad guy with a gun is the kind of bad guy we like to prey upon. O ur inaugural club meeting was on April 20\u200a\u2014\u200aHitler\u2019s birthday\u2014and AJ told us he\u2019d already come up with the name: Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. It was based on the f\u00fchrer\u2019s Blood Order, a medal of honor given to certain Nazi soldiers for the work they did in the 1923 uprising of the National Socialist German Workers Party. We moved on to the next order of business: a patch. Every biker gang has a patch that members wear on their vests or jackets. For some reason, AJ and his crew were a little cool on the whole swastika thing, so we settled on the SS lightning bolts. There were some weird interactions, like when some WWII vets stared daggers at me. Those were the hardest times to stay in\u00a0role. My guys and I kept up appearances by renting a house in Saybrook, just outside Geneva-on-the-Lake, about an hour east of Cleveland. I won\u2019t call Geneva-on-the-Lake a resort town, but it\u2019s packed with tourists in summer. I lived there with Shorty, Ivan, Brian, and JT. We also had female agents come around; I can\u2019t name them, because they\u2019re still active. They played the vital role of befriending the wives and girlfriends of the Aryan Brotherhood guys and gathering info. We flew our colors right outside the house. There were always a lot of bikes in the driveway, which is kind of a magnet for other bikers. Next thing we knew, random riders started coming by. It turned into the kind of house that every respectable homeowner on the block must\u2019ve hated. There was an indoor hot tub at the place, so, late at night, when we knew we were alone, we\u2019d unwind and debrief, knowing that the jets muffled our voices in case anyone showed up unannounced. We lived there in shifts and had our stories straight, so if JB and David Snow and AJ or any of their Aryan Brotherhood pals asked, we could say, \u201cShorty\u2019s visiting his baby mama over in Warren,\u201d or what have you. My story was that I had some criminal business in Virginia and a couple kids who lived with their mom down in Florida. A bar in town served as our main hangout. The owner liked us and said, \u201cHey man, I\u2019ve got a vacant lot down the street free of charge if you guys want to sell your stuff.\u201d We\u2019d set up tables and sell Nazi paraphernalia, along with our own T-shirts, to anyone who\u2019d buy them. It\u2019s called \u201csupport gear.\u201d All outlaw motorcycle gangs sell it. For example, if you see a shirt saying \u201cSupport your Local 81,\u201d the \u201c81\u201d means Hells Angels. (H is the eighth letter in the alphabet; A is the first.) To this day, I\u2019m stunned at the people who bought our stuff\u200a\u2014\u200ajust regular folks, tourists basically. It was eye-opening to me, because you know racism exists but not to the extent that Joe Six-Pack strolling by wants to give you money for Nazi gear. No one challenged us; they were probably too afraid. There were some weird interactions, though, like when some old guys in WWII Veteran hats stared daggers at me. Those were the hardest times to stay in role. You\u2019re standing there looking like the most despicable creature on earth, and you wanna tell them, \u201cHey, I have family who got shot fighting the Nazis. I even have my godfather\u2019s Purple Heart.\u201d But you can\u2019t talk. One time, there was a little kid who wanted his dad to buy him one of our support shirts. The father kept saying no, but the kid wouldn\u2019t let up. Finally, the kid said, \u201cCome on, Dad, why not?\u201d And father got irritated and said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re Jewish!\u201d T rying to understand the ecosystem of Northeast Ohio\u2019s outlaw motorcycle clubs was like keeping track of high school gossip. The big national gangs like Hells Angels and Pagans and Outlaws have multiple chapters; some have more influence than others. Sometimes there are rivalries between gangs. Outlaw motorcycle clubs, which have been around since the 1940s, are organized and hierarchical, so there can also be cliques, clashes, and bad blood between members of the same chapter. On top of all that, each chapter has affiliates, or support clubs\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning other motorcycle gangs that they get along with or do business with but have less sway. Because the Aryan Brotherhood sanctioned the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club, we came onto the scene with built-in strength. My guys and I weren\u2019t official Aryan Brotherhood members, but Snow told me he considered us true \u201cbrothers,\u201d and if anyone asked, we were part of the \u201cbrand.\u201d Power has a way of attracting trouble. One day, Aryan Jim, dumbass that he was, went to a Cleveland Hells Angels bar, rode inside, and did a burnout in the middle of the room. The rest of us didn\u2019t know about the incident because AJ had gotten away and kept it to himself. But I got a call from a ticked-off Willie Beard, who told me all about it. A few days later, we had to make an appearance at these drag races the Hells Angels put on at a speedway south of Cleveland. It was an annual event for them to let everyone know who ran the show in the region. We were independent and not under the grip of the Hells Angels, but we had to show up to let everyone know we were for real. \u201cAre we going to have a problem?\u201d That was code for, \u201cAm I going to have to kill you here and\u00a0now?\u201d When we got there, the Hells Angels were posted up around the drag strip, waiting for AJ and the rest of us. We pulled in, made sure AJ was out of sight, and got off our bikes. JB\u200a\u2014\u200athe guy who\u2019d recently done more than two decades for murder\u200a\u2014\u200aand I walked over to Johnny Merchant, the Cleveland Hells Angels\u2019 sergeant-at-arms, and another Cleveland HA everyone called Face, a rough-looking dock worker whose mug was hidden behind a beard and glasses. Merchant said, \u201cHey, Junkyard, where\u2019s AJ? We\u2019re gonna beat his ass.\u201d JB piped up: \u201cYou guys ain\u2019t touching none of our guys.\u201d JB and I walked over to Snow, who, in his man-of-few-words way, told us to walk back over and let the Hells Angels know that if they touched one of our members, we\u2019d \u201cgreen-light everybody in the Ohio prison system who wears the HA patch.\u201d Green-lighting means ordering them killed. Now, as you might have heard, the Hells Angels didn\u2019t get their reputation by taking a lot of shit, especially from the Aryan Brotherhood. But these dudes knew about Snow\u2019s legendary prison riot. If he could pull that off from solitary, he could have a few Hells Angels whacked. We went back over and spent a few minutes hashing things out, and then Merchant reluctantly agreed. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut seriously, you guys have to do something about AJ.\u201d So afterward, Snow walked over to AJ and said, \u201cGimme your patch. You\u2019re out.\u201d AJ tried to argue, but all Snow had to say was, \u201cAre we going to have a problem?\u201d That was code for, \u201cAm I going to have to kill you here and now?\u201d AJ handed over his patch. He was out. The way we handled the incident earned the respect of the Hells Angels. But they tested us again a few hours later, after the other clubs had cleared out. The Hells Angels wanted us to hang back and talk some more. One of their guys took out a shotgun and put it on the bench seat of a parked pickup with an open door so it was pointing in our direction. Then he started putting on black leather gloves. I said to my guys, \u201cIf that son of a bitch picks that thing up and aims at us, we\u2019re killing everybody who doesn\u2019t have our patch.\u201d There were more of us in that area of the speedway than there were Hells Angels. We surrounded three of them to let the would-be shooter know that if one of us got shot, his three guys would die immediately. I guess they respected that maneuver, too, because Face and Merchant called off their goon. What felt like a near-death experience turned out to be a game changer. Right after that event, all of us agreed it was time to grow the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. The Aryan Brotherhood liked the idea because they wanted power and money from the weapons and drug trades. My guys and I were onboard because it\u2019d get us more access to more violent felons who were buying, selling, carrying, and maybe even using firearms and explosives. The plan was to split the club in two. Snow and Paulie would start a new chapter over in Akron; JB would be president, and they\u2019d recruit more Aryan Brotherhood guys. I\u2019d stay at our home chapter near Geneva-on-the-Lake with my guys. We\u2019d also recruit new members\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning other undercovers. And I\u2019d be president. N othing attracts criminals and lowlifes more than other criminals and lowlifes. One of the people who was most drawn to us was Willie Beard, the Lake East Hells Angels member who told me about the stunt that got AJ kicked out of the Order of Blood. Beard\u2019s big thing was poisonous snakes. I\u2019m talking hundreds of snakes. The first time I saw them was when he\u2019d invited Shorty, Nazi Jim, and me to shoot guns on his property. Beard said, \u201cCome to the basement. I wanna show you something.\u201d That\u2019s not what an undercover agent ever wants to hear. We got down there, and no kidding, the floor was covered in plastic. Shorty and I looked at each other like, \u201cI guess this is it.\u201d I never thought I\u2019d be so relieved to see a cobra. Beard seemed as committed to us as he was to his own club. It got to the point where he didn\u2019t just want to befriend us, he wanted us to be to the \u201ccharter\u201d of the Hells Angels\u200a\u2014\u200abasically a chapter in Erie, Pennsylvania. I said, \u201cWhy would we wanna be Hells Angels when there\u2019s nothing better than being an AB?\u201d He just looked at me and smiled. JB provided me a firearm when I told him I needed to \u201cdo some dirt,\u201d and didn\u2019t bat an eye when I told him I may have to get rid of it \u201cbecause it may have body on\u00a0it.\u201d As we built our reputation, we were growing, recruiting new Aryan Brotherhood members, and bringing in even more undercovers from our task force. We were doing criminal business with more and more biker-underworld guys each week. Our main target was the Hells Angels, but over the course of the case, we bought more than 60 firearms, including 13 machine guns, 35 handguns, four shotguns, and eight rifles from various motorcycle gangs and members. We had a female associate of the Aryan Brotherhood make straw purchases for us from a federally licensed firearms dealer who knowingly broke federal law. My guys even bought a gun from David Snow. JB provided me a firearm when I told him I needed to \u201cdo some dirt\u201d and didn\u2019t bat an eye when I told him I may have to get rid of it \u201cbecause it may have body on it.\u201d Besides the weapons, we also bought significant amounts of meth, cocaine, crack, and prescription drugs from a range of outlaw biker gang members. O ur network grew. Word spread among Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania chapters of the Pagans, a major East Coast outlaw club, that we knew how to handle ourselves. Soon enough, Ivan, one of our original undercovers, bought cocaine from a high-ranking member of the their Youngstown chapter. As their relationship solidified, I was befriending the Youngstown chapter president, a dude named Snake. Over in western Pennsylvania, two more ATF agents and two Pennsylvania state troopers had officially started the third chapter of the Order of Blood, in the town of Sharon. We were less than a year into the case, but we now had 18 undercovers in two states. Every now and then, a non-biker would show up on the scene, usually by way of the Aryan Brotherhood. One was a buddy of David Snow\u2019s named William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Millsaps Jr., a violent guy, late thirties or early forties, who\u2019d recently gotten out of the joint. He was a heavy drug user, always armed. The first time I met him was at a strip club in Alliance, Ohio. We were all sitting around, talking about the wonderful world of crime, and Wild Bill asked us the question every undercover wants to hear: \u201cWhat are you guys lookin\u2019 for?\u201d \u201cNo thank you\u2026 Mrs. Wild Bill.\u201d I felt like I was 10 years old. Except that I had a duffel bag full of\u00a0weapons. Two hours later, I was riding shotgun in Wild Bill\u2019s truck, while Shorty, another undercover named Roach, and Ivan were following us in an old Cadillac. We pulled up to a nice house in suburban Akron. I was thinking, There ain\u2019t no motherfucking way Wild Bill lives here . But we walked in, and Wild Bill looked at an older guy on the couch and said, \u201cHey, Dad. These are my brothers.\u201d Bill told us to come upstairs. As we left the living room, his dad said, \u201cYou better hurry up\u200a\u2014\u200ayour mother\u2019s gonna be home soon.\u201d He seemed to know exactly what his son was up to. Up in his bedroom, Wild Bill showed us a big pile of guns\u200a\u2014\u200apistols, rifles. He said, \u201cHow many do you want?\u201d I said, \u201cShit, we\u2019ll take it all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll put them in this duffel bag so you guys can take them out, right?\u201d In the meantime, we heard the door open downstairs. His mom was home. We bumped into her at the bottom of the steps, and she was like June Cleaver. \u201cHey, boys. Can we get you anything to eat or drink?\u201d I didn\u2019t know Wild Bill\u2019s last name, so the only thing I could think of to say was, \u201cNo thank you\u2026 Mrs. Wild Bill.\u201d I felt like I was 10 years old. Except that I had a duffel bag full of weapons. It was one of the weirdest experiences of my life. The next stop was Wild Bill\u2019s house, where he lived, a shithole filled with motorcycle parts. He told us to hang out while he went and scored us some meth. He left his gun on a table; Wild Bill knew if he got caught with it, he\u2019d get serious time. When he pulled away from the house, we took down the serial numbers on the gun, scoured his whole place, then sat back down and hung out till he came back with the dope. Looking back, I don\u2019t think he suspected me at all. I think he was looking out for\u00a0me. A few minutes after he got home and sold us the meth, he said, \u201cHey. Let me show you something in the basement.\u201d I don\u2019t know what it is with these guys about wanting to show us their basements. But Ivan, Shorty, Roach, and I followed him down there. There was this crusty old refrigerator with about 400 pounds of freezer ice on it. He went over and wrestled with the handle. I was thinking, \u201cIs there gonna be a body in there or what?\u201d Wild Bill finally got the door open, but none of us could see inside from where we were standing. Then he looked at Shorty and, no shit, he said, \u201cHey, Shorty, ya like chicken wings?\u201d Shorty said, \u201cUh, yeah, man, I like chicken wings.\u201d Wild Bill pulled out a big bag of frozen wings that was covered in old ice, handed the bag to Shorty, and said, \u201cHere you go, brother. I like you. I want you to have this.\u201d Later, Shorty tossed the bag out the window of the Caddy. I said, \u201cShorty, what are you thinking, man?\u201d \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with a bag of old frozen chicken wings?\u201d \u201cHell if I know, but you can\u2019t toss them on the road he drives down every day. What if he sees them?\u201d So I pulled over and backed up. Shorty went searching in the dark for the wings. I still have no idea how much time passed while I waited for Willie Beard to say something in his SUV that fateful day. When people say \u201cit felt like a lifetime,\u201d they\u2019re not exaggerating. I was still sitting there, holding the photos of my fellow undercover ATF agents in my left hand. A blizzard of thoughts swirled in my head. If he reaches for his gun, can I get to mine in time? Does my cover team have a clear view of us? Am I gonna see my wife and kids again? I was aware of everything\u200a\u2014\u200athe gray November sky, the oblivious people walking in and out of McDonald\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aand at the same time my own response to the pictures echoed through my brain: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen these dudes before.\u201d Willie Beard finally spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s what we thought. We\u2019ve had this picture for a couple weeks, and we had a meeting about it.\u201d Beard told me that one set of copies of the pictures had been sent to the Hells Angels\u2019 Cleveland chapter, and another was sent to the Lake East Hells Angels. I ran some quick logic: If they had the pictures for two weeks and hadn\u2019t killed us yet, and Beard didn\u2019t kill me just now, then the investigation probably wasn\u2019t compromised. He told me to be careful about informants and undercovers. Looking back, I don\u2019t think he suspected me at all. I think he was looking out for me. Thing is, I knew about the photos. After an ATF infiltration a few years earlier\u200a\u2014\u200aa massive case with dozens of arrests and convictions\u200a\u2014\u200athe pictures got circulated to all the outlaw motorcycle clubs around the country. We\u2019d recovered a lot of them from biker clubhouses over time, but some were still circulating. Maybe that\u2019s why I was able to keep my cool. My supervisors decided to shut it down. One of them had been on edge through the whole investigation, so he was able to use the confrontation with Beard to justify ending it. But we couldn\u2019t just stop in our tracks. We needed time to get warrants and affidavits in order, so we kept at it for a couple more months. Bailey and Nazi Jim were instructed to lay low. I used my fictional kids and baby mama down in Florida to get away for a bit. While I was out of town, the other guys started spreading the word about my fictional death: \u201cJunkyard had a brain aneurysm and died on the trip.\u201d When people said they wanted to come to the funeral, my guys told them that it was too late. They said my kids\u2019 mom hadn\u2019t called anyone until after the funeral. RIP, Junkyard. On June 23, 2005, 16 months after I\u2019d assumed my most ridiculous undercover handle, 150 federal and local law enforcement officers in Ohio and Pennsylvania did their first round of raids and searches. All told, charges were brought against 59 individuals, many of them violent felons, on federal and state weapons and drug trafficking charges, identity theft, money laundering, burglary, and felony assault. The case, expertly managed by ATF Special Agents Brian Kolar and Chad Foreman, even led to a murder conviction. My undercover team and I weren\u2019t there for the actual raids or arrests. It would have been way too risky; those guys might have opened fire rather than get arrested by the undercover cops who\u2019d duped them. But we were there to help our two case agents with interviews and evidence. We didn\u2019t see Snow after the arrests; he went to prison and wound up getting killed inside by a fellow member of the Aryan Brotherhood who nearly sawed off his head. JB died of heart failure in county jail. Wild Bill went back to prison. Somehow we missed a gun at Paulie\u2019s place; so he only got probation on a drug charge. The only person we made a point to see after the fact was Aryan Jim, who was about to get a nine-year sentence, during which time he\u2019d probably be kicked out of the Brotherhood for letting so many undercovers into the organization. When we saw him, he was being questioned in a room at Eastlake Police Department shortly after the raids. One of the officers opened the door to let us in. Nazi Jim was with me. So were Ivan and Shorty, three of the guys I\u2019d brought to the bar on St. Paddy\u2019s Day more than a year earlier when we\u2019d first agreed to start the club. When we walked in, AJ was sitting at the end of a big table. He looked at us, gathered his thoughts, shook his head, and said just three words: \u201c All of you?\u201d", "title_html": "<h1 class=\"elevate-h1 u-marginBottom12 u-md-marginBottom8\">How I

graf-after--p\" id=\"baa0\" name=\"baa0\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">I</span> knew something was wrong the second I heard Willie Beard\u2019s voice. For one thing, he was calling the landline; he\u2019d never done that. For another, I\u2019d gotten to know him over the past several months, and the dude was almost 100 percent night owl, but now he was reaching out on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d87\" name=\"4d87\">This was December 2004 in northeast Ohio, up near Cleveland. Beard was a member of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, the country\u2019s most notorious outlaw biker gang. I was a founding member of the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club, the first biker gang ever sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood, the country\u2019s most notorious prison gang. As far as Beard knew, we were associates and friends. He was right only about the first part. The guy had no idea that I was also an undercover agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), let alone that I was running an investigation involving 18 undercovers from four law enforcement agencies in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e989\" name=\"e989\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Or did he know?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eefc\" name=\"eefc\">That\u2019s the question that rattled around my skull.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bb6f\" name=\"bb6f\">\u201cHey, Junkyard,\u201d Beard said. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"18bd\" name=\"18bd\">\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fd01\" name=\"fd01\">\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to show you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5df1\" name=\"5df1\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"165f\" name=\"165f\">\u201cNot on the phone,\u201d he said. \u201cI had my car swept for bugs. It\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"517d\" name=\"517d\">Beard told me to meet him at the McDonald\u2019s on Interstate 90 and Route 534 and asked if I could be there in 30 minutes\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept he wasn\u2019t asking.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2400\" name=\"2400\">I said, \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d hung up, and looked over at my fellow undercover agents, Shorty, Brian, and Bailey. \u201cThis. Cannot. Be good.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd27\" name=\"bd27\">They agreed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"24f4\" name=\"24f4\">We slapped together a quick plan: They\u2019d change out of their Nazi-themed biker gear\u200a\u2014\u200anothing\u2019s more conspicuous than guys wearing SS lightning bolts and swastikas\u200a\u2014\u200aand watch us from the lot across from McDonald\u2019s, where they\u2019d act as my cover team. I\u2019d carry a gun, but I wouldn\u2019t wear a wire; for all I knew, Beard would start our little meeting by patting me down. We all agreed that if I got in the car and Beard drove off, then I was getting out whether he stopped the car or not.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8211\" name=\"8211\">I found Beard standing inside the main door, sipping coffee. He was a big guy, fit from kickboxing, though you couldn\u2019t see it beneath the winter jacket. I don\u2019t even think we shook hands. He just said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my car,\u201d so I followed him to the parking lot, and we got into his small SUV.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"2ca6\" name=\"2ca6\">How exactly did I become the co-leader of a motorcycle gang sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood? To be honest, it kind of happened by accident.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"04f7\" name=\"04f7\">When the doors were closed, Beard reached into his coat pocket. I thought to myself<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">, Is this guy about to off me in a Mickey D\u2019s parking lot?</em> My pistol was tucked into the right-side waistband of my jeans and covered by my old Carhartt work coat. I watched Beard\u2019s hands and leaned toward him a bit in case I needed to draw my gun.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8c86\" name=\"8c86\">But I didn\u2019t. Beard pulled out a small envelope that I noticed was addressed to the Lake East chapter of the Hells Angels\u200a\u2014\u200aBeard\u2019s chapter. He handed it to me and said, \u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd51\" name=\"dd51\">It had photocopies of two pictures. Next to one picture, someone had written, \u201cNazi Jim\u200a\u2014\u200aATF Agent.\u201d Next to the other one: \u201cBailey\u200a\u2014\u200aATF Agent.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad20\" name=\"ad20\">I did my best to play it cool. Beard looked at me and said, \u201cAre these dudes in your club? Is that Nazi Jim? Is that Bailey?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2207\" name=\"2207\">I studied the picture like I meant it. That was Nazi Jim alright, and yeah, he was an ATF agent and a member of the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. The guy labeled as Bailey was actually a different ATF agent with a similar look and build; the picture was so grainy that he\u2019d been misidentified.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ddc\" name=\"9ddc\">After a few seconds of looking at the pictures, I turned to Beard and shook my head. I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen these guys before.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"63a9\" name=\"63a9\">Then I waited for him to make his next move.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"d9a8\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"9763\" name=\"9763\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">H</span>ow exactly did I become the co-leader of a motorcycle gang sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood? To be honest, it kind of happened by accident. The agency never said, \u201cHey, Frank, go out and befriend a bunch of Aryan Brotherhood members and help start their motorcycle gang.\u201d I was never told I\u2019d be palling around with some of the Ohio Aryan Brotherhood\u2019s most notorious members. But things never go as expected when you work undercover.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"754e\" name=\"754e\">By that point in my career, I\u2019d spent the better part of 18 years working undercover for the ATF. My specialty was outlaw biker-gang infiltrations. I should mention here that they call themselves \u201cmotorcycle clubs.\u201d But these aren\u2019t groups of Sunday cruisers. They have track records as criminal enterprises, which is why law enforcement (and respectable humans) refer to them them as gangs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c44\" name=\"0c44\">By 2004, I\u2019d infiltrated the Brothers Motorcycle Club in Columbus, Ohio, and the Vagos club out in Las Vegas. I\u2019d been in a couple armed standoffs and heard a major gang leader order a hit on another undercover ATF agent who happened to be my best friend, Darrin Kozlowski. I\u2019d also played undercover support roles in cases targeting the Outlaws, the Mongols, and the Warlocks. All told, a handful of guys and I, who collectively dedicated hundreds of years on these cases, put hundreds of seriously bad people behind bars for armed violent crimes, attempted murder, weapons sales, and countless other charges. And I picked up a lot of tattoos along the way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5f1\" name=\"f5f1\">In 2001, when I got to the ATF field office in Youngstown, Ohio, I wasn\u2019t supposed to be undercover; I was supposed to be running my group and spending some much-needed time with my wife and our newly adopted daughters. I was still getting adjusted to normal life after an 18-month undercover case. I was happy for the break, but also miserable; even though I was glad to be living without the 24/7 paranoia, something was missing\u200a\u2014\u200athat rush of living the life and catching these bad guys and beating them at their own game.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"5deb\" name=\"5deb\">And just like that, I went from being a family man, to being \u201cJunkyard\u201d: a guy who wrestles wild animals in\u00a0public.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"77a0\" name=\"77a0\">A year into my time in Youngstown, I got a call from Lieutenant Tom Doyle of the Eastlake Police Department, near Cleveland. He said, \u201cWould you be interested in taking a look at the Hells Angels with us?\u201d Doyle explained that there was a big Hells Angels presence up there; the Lake East and Cleveland chapters ran a lot of drugs and weapons, but law enforcement just couldn\u2019t get the evidence they needed. Doyle said he had a confidential informant\u200a\u2014\u200aa member of the Aryan Brotherhood who\u2019d nearly beat a guy to death in a bar was facing hard time and hoping to knock a few years off his sentence. So ATF formed a task force with the Eastlake police, the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the Ohio State Adult Parole Authority.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5be3\" name=\"5be3\">When we met the confidential information\u2014we call them CIs\u2014he told us about another Aryan Brotherhood member, James \u201cAryan Jim\u201d Blomquist, who went by AJ.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ff39\" name=\"ff39\">AJ knew how to build machine guns.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b33d\" name=\"b33d\">The plan was for our CI to introduce AJ to an undercover agent whose street name was Nazi Jim, have the agent buy some machine guns from him, and shut him down. I\u2019d run things from the field office. But when the meet day came, I asked the CI what he\u2019d told AJ about my undercover guy. The CI looked right at me and said, \u201cI gave him <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">your </em>description.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1bc5\" name=\"1bc5\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">My</em> description?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"06bd\" name=\"06bd\">\u201cYeah.\u201d The CI was a young guy, and I was about 40.

I was comfortable around bad guys and vice versa. At the intro, Nazi Jim and AJ and I spent two or three hours drinking beers and whatnot. I dropped little hints of some of my criminal business\u200a\u2014\u200aenough to let him know I was looking for opportunities. AJ was way more forthright. He told me straight up, \u201cI\u2019m a captain in the Aryan Brotherhood,\u201d and pulled down his shirt collar to show me the tattoo on his chest indicating his rank.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f1c\" name=\"2f1c\">Soon enough he told me that if I could get all the parts for machine guns, then he could build them for me. No serial numbers. Totally untraceable. Later, I went online and ordered all the parts, then dropped them with AJ a couple days later. A few days after that, Nazi Jim and I met him in a parking lot outside Cleveland. There were three Sten machine guns with 20-round mags, the same weapons the Brits used in World War II. They looked like they were straight from the manufacturer. A few days later, we asked AJ to make 10 more. We said we\u2019d pay $500 apiece.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a622\" name=\"a622\">AJ started calling me every morning just to shoot the shit. I was supposed to be bowing out but I told my boss, \u201cHey, I gotta keep going. He\u2019s expecting me to be involved. He <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">likes</em> me.\u201d (I did not like AJ.) I had to twist some arms at ATF, but soon I was also buying drugs and contraband from AJ.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6bb\" name=\"b6bb\">On one of our calls, we got to talking about our love of money and how we wanted to make more. AJ knew I rode motorcycles, and before long he said, \u201cYou know, my Aryan brothers and me, we\u2019ve been trying to get a motorcycle club going for a long time.\u201d</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d87c\" name=\"d87c\">\u201cLet\u2019s make this happen, Junkyard. I\u2019ll bring five guys, and you bring five guys, and we\u2019ll start a\u00a0club.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"1181\" name=\"1181\">AJ wanted to help the Aryan Brotherhood get control of drug and weapons sales in northeast Ohio, which required competing with the Hells Angels and their criminal network. From there, he proposed, they\u2019d take it nationwide. The way AJ saw it, if he was gonna go head-to-head with a motorcycle club, he had to be part of one, and that organization had to have serious power.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8376\" name=\"8376\">Up to that point, there hadn\u2019t been an Aryan Brotherhood-sanctioned motorcycle club that I or any of the other ATF agents had heard about. By most accounts, it was founded in the early 1960s in California\u2019s San Quentin State Prison and kept growing on both sides of the bars. Some Aryan Brotherhood members believed in the whole white-power cause; some just rolled with it to stay safe in prison\u2014not that burying your head in the sand makes it okay to be a white supremacist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a0bf\" name=\"a0bf\">On the phone, I listened patiently as AJ told me about his visions of criminal greatness, and I told him how brilliant he was. Then he surprised me. AJ said, \u201cLet\u2019s make this happen, Junkyard. I\u2019ll bring five guys, and you bring five guys, and we\u2019ll start a club.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"6707\" name=\"6707\">Neither of us had a clue how big this would get.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"ea6b\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"1955\" name=\"1955\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> Saint Patrick\u2019s Day 2004, I brought five guys to a bar in Eastlake, Ohio. Four of them were fellow ATF agents: Ivan, Nazi Jim, JT, and Brian. The fifth, Shorty, was a deputy with the Ashtabula County Sheriff\u2019s Department. AJ brought four guys, including John \u201cJB\u201d Beason, a convicted murderer on parole. JB was covered in prison tats and was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood in Ohio. David Snow was there; he was recognized as the founding Aryan Brotherhood member in the Ohio prison system. A soft-spoken redhead, Snow spent most of his life behind bars. He shot a guy while locked up, and had orchestrated an 11-day prison riot from 23-hour-a-day solitary lockdown in a max-security facility in Youngstown. Legend had it that when he got released, Snow was so accustomed to being in confined spaces that he spent six months living under\u200a\u2014\u200anot in\u2014 his mother\u2019s trailer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8ea6\" name=\"8ea6\">Also at the bar was AJ\u2019s other guy, Paul \u201cPaulie\u201d Geiger, who had done 10 years in a federal prison for muling dope in Oklahoma, and his friend Neil Ashley, who went by \u201cMotor.\u201d</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"40cc\" name=\"40cc\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 799px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 77.4%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\" data-height=\"850\" data-image-id=\"1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\" data-width=\"1098\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">From left (un-blurred): JB, the author, Ivan, AJ, David\u00a0Snow.</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"981d\" name=\"981d\">We sat around drinking beer and bullshitting until we all felt comfortable enough to talk about starting a motorcycle club and getting a piece of the Hells Angels\u2019 action. The plan was to ease in, not start a war, but eventually take over. Everyone was onboard. Shorty took the opportunity to establish his role as a madman. He put one of those plastic leprechaun hats on his shaved head, jumped on the bar, and shouted, \u201cListen up, you Irish fucks! The Nazis are in charge now, so if you got a problem, fuck off or talk to us!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"5408\" name=\"5408\">The fact that AJ brought this foursome of ex-felons was a huge deal. A lot of times, ATF supervisors get bent if the subjects of an undercover operation don\u2019t have felony convictions or a record of violence. Not only did these guys fit the bill, but we were confident that everybody they\u2019d bring us would be violent felons too. That meant they\u2019d likely be in possession of firearms\u200a\u2014\u200aand for the ATF, criminals with guns are a good thing. After all, the bureau\u2019s job isn\u2019t just to go after arms dealers; it\u2019s to take armed felons out of their communities. While other law enforcement agencies would rather stay away from people who carry weapons, ATF seeks them out. For us, a bad guy with a gun is the kind of bad guy we like to prey upon.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"c53e\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"e0ce\" name=\"e0ce\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">O</span>ur inaugural club meeting was on April 20\u200a\u2014\u200aHitler\u2019s birthday\u2014and AJ told us he\u2019d already come up with the name: Order of Blood Motorcycle Club.

Every biker gang has a patch that members wear on their vests or jackets. For some reason, AJ and his crew were a little cool on the whole swastika thing, so we settled on the SS lightning bolts.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"0f50\" name=\"0f50\">There were some weird interactions, like when some WWII vets stared daggers at me. Those were the hardest times to stay in\u00a0role.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"8bdb\" name=\"8bdb\">My guys and I kept up appearances by renting a house in Saybrook, just outside Geneva-on-the-Lake, about an hour east of Cleveland. I won\u2019t call Geneva-on-the-Lake a resort town, but it\u2019s packed with tourists in summer. I lived there with Shorty, Ivan, Brian, and JT. We also had female agents come around; I can\u2019t name them, because they\u2019re still active. They played the vital role of befriending the wives and girlfriends of the Aryan Brotherhood guys and gathering info.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f71\" name=\"9f71\">We flew our colors right outside the house. There were always a lot of bikes in the driveway, which is kind of a magnet for other bikers. Next thing we knew, random riders started coming by. It turned into the kind of house that every respectable homeowner on the block must\u2019ve hated. There was an indoor hot tub at the place, so, late at night, when we knew we were alone, we\u2019d unwind and debrief, knowing that the jets muffled our voices in case anyone showed up unannounced. We lived there in shifts and had our stories straight, so if JB and David Snow and AJ or any of their Aryan Brotherhood pals asked, we could say, \u201cShorty\u2019s visiting his baby mama over in Warren,\u201d or what have you. My story was that I had some criminal business in Virginia and a couple kids who lived with their mom down in Florida.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3cf0\" name=\"3cf0\">A bar in town served as our main hangout. The owner liked us and said, \u201cHey man, I\u2019ve got a vacant lot down the street free of charge if you guys want to sell your stuff.\u201d We\u2019d set up tables and sell Nazi paraphernalia, along with our own T-shirts, to anyone who\u2019d buy them. It\u2019s called \u201csupport gear.\u201d All outlaw motorcycle gangs sell it. For example, if you see a shirt saying \u201cSupport your Local 81,\u201d the \u201c81\u201d means Hells Angels. (H is the eighth letter in the alphabet; A is the first.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6a7d\" name=\"6a7d\">To this day, I\u2019m stunned at the people who bought our stuff\u200a\u2014\u200ajust regular folks, tourists basically. It was eye-opening to me, because you know racism exists but not to the extent that Joe Six-Pack strolling by wants to give you money for Nazi gear. No one challenged us; they were probably too afraid.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"3654\" name=\"3654\">There were some weird interactions, though, like when some old guys in WWII Veteran hats stared daggers at me. Those were the hardest times to stay in role. You\u2019re standing there looking like the most despicable creature on earth, and you wanna tell them, \u201cHey, I have family who got shot fighting the Nazis. I even have my godfather\u2019s Purple Heart.\u201d But you can\u2019t talk. One time, there was a little kid who wanted his dad to buy him one of our support shirts. The father kept saying no, but the kid wouldn\u2019t let up. Finally, the kid said, \u201cCome on, Dad, why not?\u201d And father got irritated and said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re Jewish!\u201d</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"8fa9\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"258e\" name=\"258e\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>rying to understand the ecosystem of Northeast Ohio\u2019s outlaw motorcycle clubs was like keeping track of high school gossip. The big national gangs like Hells Angels and Pagans and Outlaws have multiple chapters; some have more influence than others. Sometimes there are rivalries between gangs. Outlaw motorcycle clubs, which have been around since the 1940s, are organized and hierarchical, so there can also be cliques, clashes, and bad blood between members of the same chapter. On top of all that, each chapter has affiliates, or support clubs\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning other motorcycle gangs that they get along with or do business with but have less sway.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dcbe\" name=\"dcbe\">Because the Aryan Brotherhood sanctioned the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club, we came onto the scene with built-in strength. My guys and I weren\u2019t official Aryan Brotherhood members, but Snow told me he considered us true \u201cbrothers,\u201d and if anyone asked, we were part of the \u201cbrand.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4252\" name=\"4252\">Power has a way of attracting trouble. One day, Aryan Jim, dumbass that he was, went to a Cleveland Hells Angels bar, rode inside, and did a burnout in the middle of the room. The rest of us didn\u2019t know about the incident because AJ had gotten away and kept it to himself. But I got a call from a ticked-off Willie Beard, who told me all about it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5e82\" name=\"5e82\">A few days later, we had to make an appearance at these drag races the Hells Angels put on at a speedway south of Cleveland. It was an annual event for them to let everyone know who ran the show in the region. We were independent and not under the grip of the Hells Angels, but we had to show up to let everyone know we were for real.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9728\" name=\"9728\">\u201cAre we going to have a problem?\u201d That was code for, \u201cAm I going to have to kill you here and\u00a0now?\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"51d7\" name=\"51d7\">When we got there, the Hells Angels were posted up around the drag strip, waiting for AJ and the rest of us. We pulled in, made sure AJ was out of sight, and got off our bikes. JB\u200a\u2014\u200athe guy who\u2019d recently done more than two decades for murder\u200a\u2014\u200aand I walked over to Johnny Merchant, the Cleveland Hells Angels\u2019 sergeant-at-arms, and another Cleveland HA everyone called Face, a rough-looking dock worker whose mug was hidden behind a beard and glasses.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22a7\" name=\"22a7\">Merchant said, \u201cHey, Junkyard, where\u2019s AJ? We\u2019re gonna beat his ass.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0b66\" name=\"0b66\">JB piped up: \u201cYou guys ain\u2019t touching none of our guys.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eabe\" name=\"eabe\">JB and I walked over to Snow, who, in his man-of-few-words way, told us to walk back over and let the Hells Angels know that if they touched one of our members, we\u2019d \u201cgreen-light everybody in the Ohio prison system who wears the HA patch.\u201d Green-lighting means ordering them killed. Now, as you might have heard, the Hells Angels didn\u2019t get their reputation by taking a lot of shit, especially from the Aryan Brotherhood. But these dudes knew about Snow\u2019s legendary prison riot. If he could pull that off from solitary, he could have a few Hells Angels whacked. We went back over and spent a few minutes hashing things out, and then Merchant reluctantly agreed. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut seriously, you guys have to do something about AJ.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"406b\" name=\"406b\">So afterward, Snow walked over to AJ and said, \u201cGimme your patch. You\u2019re out.\u201d AJ tried to argue, but all Snow had to say was, \u201cAre we going to have a problem?\u201d That was code for, \u201cAm I going to have to kill you here and now?\u201d AJ handed over his patch. He was out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7825\" name=\"7825\">The way we handled the incident earned the respect of the Hells Angels. But they tested us again a few hours later, after the other clubs had cleared out. The Hells Angels wanted us to hang back and talk some more. One of their guys took out a shotgun and put it on the bench seat of a parked pickup with an open door so it was pointing in our direction. Then he started putting on black leather gloves. I said to my guys, \u201cIf that son of a bitch picks that thing up and aims at us, we\u2019re killing everybody who doesn\u2019t have our patch.\u201d There were more of us in that area of the speedway than there were Hells Angels. We surrounded three of them to let the would-be shooter know that if one of us got shot, his three guys would die immediately. I guess they respected that maneuver, too, because Face and Merchant called off their goon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"59af\" name=\"59af\">What felt like a near-death experience turned out to be a game changer. Right after that event, all of us agreed it was time to grow the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. The Aryan Brotherhood liked the idea because they wanted power and money from the weapons and drug trades. My guys and I were onboard because it\u2019d get us more access to more violent felons who were buying, selling, carrying, and maybe even using firearms and explosives. The plan was to split the club in two. Snow and Paulie would start a new chapter over in Akron; JB would be president, and they\u2019d recruit more Aryan Brotherhood guys. I\u2019d stay at our home chapter near Geneva-on-the-Lake with my guys. We\u2019d also recruit new members\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning other undercovers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"a1bf\" name=\"a1bf\">And I\u2019d be president.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"3ae6\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"24c3\" name=\"24c3\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">N</span>othing attracts criminals and lowlifes more than other criminals and lowlifes. One of the people who was most drawn to us was Willie Beard, the Lake East Hells Angels member who told me about the stunt that got AJ kicked out of the Order of Blood. Beard\u2019s big thing was poisonous snakes. I\u2019m talking hundreds of snakes. The first time I saw them was when he\u2019d invited Shorty, Nazi Jim, and me to shoot guns on his property. Beard said, \u201cCome to the basement. I wanna show you something.\u201d That\u2019s not what an undercover agent ever wants to hear. We got down there, and no kidding, the floor was covered in plastic. Shorty and I looked at each other like, \u201cI guess this is it.\u201d I never thought I\u2019d be so relieved to see a cobra.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aab3\" name=\"aab3\">Beard seemed as committed to us as he was to his own club. It got to the point where he didn\u2019t just want to befriend us, he wanted us to be to the \u201ccharter\u201d of the Hells Angels\u200a\u2014\u200abasically a chapter in Erie, Pennsylvania. I said, \u201cWhy would we wanna be Hells Angels when there\u2019s nothing better than being an AB?\u201d He just looked at me and smiled.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"f61f\" name=\"f61f\">JB provided me a firearm when I told him I needed to \u201cdo some dirt,\u201d and didn\u2019t bat an eye when I told him I may have to get rid of it \u201cbecause it may have body on\u00a0it.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"0362\" name=\"0362\">As we built our reputation, we were growing, recruiting new Aryan Brotherhood members, and bringing in even more undercovers from our task force. We were doing criminal business with more and more biker-underworld guys each week. Our main target was the Hells Angels, but over the course of the case, we bought more than 60 firearms, including 13 machine guns, 35 handguns, four shotguns, and eight rifles from various motorcycle gangs and members. We had a female associate of the Aryan Brotherhood make straw purchases for us from a federally licensed firearms dealer who knowingly broke federal law.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"6696\" name=\"6696\">My guys even bought a gun from David Snow. JB provided me a firearm when I told him I needed to \u201cdo some dirt\u201d and didn\u2019t bat an eye when I told him I may have to get rid of it \u201cbecause it may have body on it.\u201d Besides the weapons, we also bought significant amounts of meth, cocaine, crack, and prescription drugs from a range of outlaw biker gang members.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"3fec\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"82f4\" name=\"82f4\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">O</span>ur network grew.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>Word spread among Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania chapters of the Pagans, a major East Coast outlaw club, that we knew how to handle ourselves. Soon enough, Ivan, one of our original undercovers, bought cocaine from a high-ranking member of the their Youngstown chapter. As their relationship solidified, I was befriending the Youngstown chapter president, a dude named Snake. Over in western Pennsylvania, two more ATF agents and two Pennsylvania state troopers had officially started the third chapter of the Order of Blood, in the town of Sharon. We were less than a year into the case, but we now had 18 undercovers in two states.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd33\" name=\"bd33\">Every now and then, a non-biker would show up on the scene, usually by way of the Aryan Brotherhood. One was a buddy of David Snow\u2019s named William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Millsaps Jr., a violent guy, late thirties or early forties, who\u2019d recently gotten out of the joint. He was a heavy drug user, always armed. The first time I met him was at a strip club in Alliance, Ohio. We were all sitting around, talking about the wonderful world of crime, and Wild Bill asked us the question every undercover wants to hear: \u201cWhat are you guys lookin\u2019 for?\u201d</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"01c6\" name=\"01c6\">\u201cNo thank you\u2026 Mrs. Wild Bill.\u201d I felt like I was 10 years old.

We pulled up to a nice house in suburban Akron. I was thinking, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">There ain\u2019t no motherfucking way Wild Bill lives here</em>. But we walked in, and Wild Bill looked at an older guy on the couch and said, \u201cHey, Dad. These are my brothers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7794\" name=\"7794\">Bill told us to come upstairs. As we left the living room, his dad said, \u201cYou better hurry up\u200a\u2014\u200ayour mother\u2019s gonna be home soon.\u201d He seemed to know exactly what his son was up to.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4c9e\" name=\"4c9e\">Up in his bedroom, Wild Bill showed us a big pile of guns\u200a\u2014\u200apistols, rifles. He said, \u201cHow many do you want?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6d7f\" name=\"6d7f\">I said, \u201cShit, we\u2019ll take it all.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bd2c\" name=\"bd2c\">\u201cI\u2019ll put them in this duffel bag so you guys can take them out, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"183a\" name=\"183a\">In the meantime, we heard the door open downstairs. His mom was home.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dee\" name=\"3dee\">We bumped into her at the bottom of the steps, and she was like June Cleaver. \u201cHey, boys. Can we get you anything to eat or drink?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d447\" name=\"d447\">I didn\u2019t know Wild Bill\u2019s last name, so the only thing I could think of to say was, \u201cNo thank you\u2026 Mrs. Wild Bill.\u201d I felt like I was 10 years old. Except that I had a duffel bag full of weapons. It was one of the weirdest experiences of my life.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6752\" name=\"6752\">The next stop was Wild Bill\u2019s house, where he lived, a shithole filled with motorcycle parts. He told us to hang out while he went and scored us some meth. He left his gun on a table; Wild Bill knew if he got caught with it, he\u2019d get serious time. When he pulled away from the house, we took down the serial numbers on the gun, scoured his whole place, then sat back down and hung out till he came back with the dope.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"ecc8\" name=\"ecc8\">Looking back, I don\u2019t think he suspected me at all. I think he was looking out for\u00a0me.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"f74e\" name=\"f74e\">A few minutes after he got home and sold us the meth, he said, \u201cHey. Let me show you something in the basement.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d852\" name=\"d852\">I don\u2019t know what it is with these guys about wanting to show us their basements. But Ivan, Shorty, Roach, and I followed him down there. There was this crusty old refrigerator with about 400 pounds of freezer ice on it. He went over and wrestled with the handle. I was thinking, \u201cIs there gonna be a body in there or what?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f1b9\" name=\"f1b9\">Wild Bill finally got the door open, but none of us could see inside from where we were standing. Then he looked at Shorty and, no shit, he said, \u201cHey, Shorty, ya like chicken wings?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3057\" name=\"3057\">Shorty said, \u201cUh, yeah, man, I like chicken wings.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4751\" name=\"4751\">Wild Bill pulled out a big bag of frozen wings that was covered in old ice, handed the bag to Shorty, and said, \u201cHere you go, brother. I like you. I want you to have this.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d376\" name=\"d376\">Later, Shorty tossed the bag out the window of the Caddy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"032d\" name=\"032d\">I said, \u201cShorty, what are you thinking, man?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dae6\" name=\"dae6\">\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with a bag of old frozen chicken wings?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ad76\" name=\"ad76\">\u201cHell if I know, but you can\u2019t toss them on the road he drives down every day.

When people say \u201cit felt like a lifetime,\u201d they\u2019re not exaggerating. I was still sitting there, holding the photos of my fellow undercover ATF agents in my left hand. A blizzard of thoughts swirled in my head. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">If he reaches for his gun, can I get to mine in time? Does my cover team have a clear view of us?

We\u2019ve had this picture for a couple weeks, and we had a meeting about it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfe3\" name=\"dfe3\">Beard told me that one set of copies<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>of the pictures had been sent to the Hells Angels\u2019 Cleveland chapter, and another was sent to the Lake East Hells Angels. I ran some quick logic: If they had the pictures for two weeks and hadn\u2019t killed us yet, and Beard didn\u2019t kill me just now, then the investigation probably wasn\u2019t compromised. He told me to be careful about informants and undercovers. Looking back, I don\u2019t think he suspected me at all. I think he was looking out for me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"415e\" name=\"415e\">Thing is, I knew about the photos. After an ATF infiltration a few years earlier\u200a\u2014\u200aa massive case with dozens of arrests and convictions\u200a\u2014\u200athe pictures got circulated to all the outlaw motorcycle clubs around the country. We\u2019d recovered a lot of them from biker clubhouses over time, but some were still circulating. Maybe that\u2019s why I was able to keep my cool.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"75ef\" name=\"75ef\">My supervisors decided to shut it down. One of them had been on edge through the whole investigation, so he was able to use the confrontation with Beard to justify ending it. But we couldn\u2019t just stop in our tracks. We needed time to get warrants and affidavits in order, so we kept at it for a couple more months.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2715\" name=\"2715\">Bailey and Nazi Jim were instructed to lay low.

All told, charges were brought against 59 individuals, many of them violent felons, on federal and state weapons and drug trafficking charges, identity theft, money laundering, burglary, and felony assault. The case, expertly managed by ATF Special Agents Brian Kolar and Chad Foreman, even led to a murder conviction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b7dc\" name=\"b7dc\">My undercover team and I weren\u2019t there for the actual raids or arrests. It would have been way too risky; those guys might have opened fire rather than get arrested by the undercover cops who\u2019d duped them. But we were there to help our two case agents with interviews and evidence. We didn\u2019t see Snow after the arrests; he went to prison and wound up getting killed inside by a fellow member of the Aryan Brotherhood who nearly sawed off his head. JB died of heart failure in county jail. Wild Bill went back to prison. Somehow we missed a gun at Paulie\u2019s place; so he only got probation on a drug charge.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e627\" name=\"e627\">The only person we made a point to see after the fact was Aryan Jim, who was about to get a nine-year sentence, during which time he\u2019d probably be kicked out of the Brotherhood for letting so many undercovers into the organization.

My specialty was outlaw biker-gang infiltrations. I should mention here that they call themselves \u201cmotorcycle clubs.\u201d But these aren\u2019t groups of Sunday cruisers.

I\u2019d been in a couple armed standoffs and heard a major gang leader order a hit on another undercover ATF agent who happened to be my best friend, Darrin Kozlowski. I\u2019d also played undercover support roles in cases targeting the Outlaws, the Mongols, and the Warlocks. All told, a handful of guys and I, who collectively dedicated hundreds of years on these cases, put hundreds of seriously bad people behind bars for armed violent crimes, attempted murder, weapons sales, and countless other charges.

I was happy for the break, but also miserable; even though I was glad to be living without the 24/7 paranoia, something was missing\u200a\u2014\u200athat rush of living the life and catching these bad guys and beating them at their own game.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"5deb\\\" id=\\\"5deb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAnd just like that, I went from being a family man, to being \u201cJunkyard\u201d: a guy who wrestles wild animals in\u00a0public.\\x3c/blockquote\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"77a0\\\" id=\\\"77a0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\\\"\\x3eA year into my time in Youngstown, I got a call from Lieutenant Tom Doyle of the Eastlake Police Department, near Cleveland. He said, \u201cWould you be interested in taking a look at the Hells Angels with us?\u201d Doyle explained that there was a big Hells Angels presence up there; the Lake East and Cleveland chapters ran a lot of drugs and weapons, but law enforcement just couldn\u2019t get the evidence they needed. Doyle said he had a confidential informant\u200a\u2014\u200aa member of the Aryan Brotherhood who\u2019d nearly beat a guy to death in a bar was facing hard time and hoping to knock a few years off his sentence.

I dropped little hints of some of my criminal business\u200a\u2014\u200aenough to let him know I was looking for opportunities. AJ was way more forthright. He told me straight up, \u201cI\u2019m a captain in the Aryan Brotherhood,\u201d and pulled down his shirt collar to show me the tattoo on his chest indicating his rank.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2f1c\\\" id=\\\"2f1c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSoon enough he told me that if I could get all the parts for machine guns, then he could build them for me. No serial numbers. Totally untraceable. Later, I went online and ordered all the parts, then dropped them with AJ a couple days later. A few days after that, Nazi Jim and I met him in a parking lot outside Cleveland. There were three Sten machine guns with 20-round mags, the same weapons the Brits used in World War II. They looked like they were straight from the manufacturer. A few days later, we asked AJ to make 10 more.

Four of them were fellow ATF agents: Ivan, Nazi Jim, JT, and Brian. The fifth, Shorty, was a deputy with the Ashtabula County Sheriff\u2019s Department. AJ brought four guys, including John \u201cJB\u201d Beason, a convicted murderer on parole. JB was covered in prison tats and was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood in Ohio. David Snow was there; he was recognized as the founding Aryan Brotherhood member in the Ohio prison system. A soft-spoken redhead, Snow spent most of his life behind bars. He shot a guy while locked up, and had orchestrated an 11-day prison riot from 23-hour-a-day solitary lockdown in a max-security facility in Youngstown. Legend had it that when he got released, Snow was so accustomed to being in confined spaces that he spent six months living under\u200a\u2014\u200anot in\u2014 his mother\u2019s trailer.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8ea6\\\" id=\\\"8ea6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAlso at the bar was AJ\u2019s other guy, Paul \u201cPaulie\u201d Geiger, who had done 10 years in a federal prison for muling dope in Oklahoma, and his friend Neil Ashley, who went by \u201cMotor.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"40cc\\\" id=\\\"40cc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 799px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 77.4%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\\\" data-width=\\\"1098\\\" data-height=\\\"850\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cfigcaption class=\\\"imageCaption\\\"\\x3eFrom left (un-blurred): JB, the author, Ivan, AJ, David\u00a0Snow.\\x3c/figcaption\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"981d\\\" id=\\\"981d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3eWe sat around drinking beer and bullshitting until we all felt comfortable enough to talk about starting a motorcycle club and getting a piece of the Hells Angels\u2019 action. The plan was to ease in, not start a war, but eventually take over. Everyone was onboard. Shorty took the opportunity to establish his role as a madman. He put one of those plastic leprechaun hats on his shaved head, jumped on the bar, and shouted, \u201cListen up, you Irish fucks!

A lot of times, ATF supervisors get bent if the subjects of an undercover operation don\u2019t have felony convictions or a record of violence. Not only did these guys fit the bill, but we were confident that everybody they\u2019d bring us would be violent felons too. That meant they\u2019d likely be in possession of firearms\u200a\u2014\u200aand for the ATF, criminals with guns are a good thing. After all, the bureau\u2019s job isn\u2019t just to go after arms dealers; it\u2019s to take armed felons out of their communities. While other law enforcement agencies would rather stay away from people who carry weapons, ATF seeks them out. For us, a bad guy with a gun is the kind of bad guy we like to prey upon.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"c53e\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e0ce\\\" id=\\\"e0ce\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eO\\x3c/span\\x3eur inaugural club meeting was on April 20\u200a\u2014\u200aHitler\u2019s birthday\u2014and AJ told us he\u2019d already come up with the name: Order of Blood Motorcycle Club.

I won\u2019t call Geneva-on-the-Lake a resort town, but it\u2019s packed with tourists in summer. I lived there with Shorty, Ivan, Brian, and JT. We also had female agents come around; I can\u2019t name them, because they\u2019re still active. They played the vital role of befriending the wives and girlfriends of the Aryan Brotherhood guys and gathering info.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9f71\\\" id=\\\"9f71\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWe flew our colors right outside the house. There were always a lot of bikes in the driveway, which is kind of a magnet for other bikers. Next thing we knew, random riders started coming by. It turned into the kind of house that every respectable homeowner on the block must\u2019ve hated. There was an indoor hot tub at the place, so, late at night, when we knew we were alone, we\u2019d unwind and debrief, knowing that the jets muffled our voices in case anyone showed up unannounced. We lived there in shifts and had our stories straight, so if JB and David Snow and AJ or any of their Aryan Brotherhood pals asked, we could say, \u201cShorty\u2019s visiting his baby mama over in Warren,\u201d or what have you.

It\u2019s called \u201csupport gear.\u201d All outlaw motorcycle gangs sell it. For example, if you see a shirt saying \u201cSupport your Local 81,\u201d the \u201c81\u201d means Hells Angels.

The big national gangs like Hells Angels and Pagans and Outlaws have multiple chapters; some have more influence than others. Sometimes there are rivalries between gangs. Outlaw motorcycle clubs, which have been around since the 1940s, are organized and hierarchical, so there can also be cliques, clashes, and bad blood between members of the same chapter. On top of all that, each chapter has affiliates, or support clubs\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning other motorcycle gangs that they get along with or do business with but have less sway.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"dcbe\\\" id=\\\"dcbe\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBecause the Aryan Brotherhood sanctioned the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club, we came onto the scene with built-in strength.

JB\u200a\u2014\u200athe guy who\u2019d recently done more than two decades for murder\u200a\u2014\u200aand I walked over to Johnny Merchant, the Cleveland Hells Angels\u2019 sergeant-at-arms, and another Cleveland HA everyone called Face, a rough-looking dock worker whose mug was hidden behind a beard and glasses.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"22a7\\\" id=\\\"22a7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMerchant said, \u201cHey, Junkyard, where\u2019s AJ?

Now, as you might have heard, the Hells Angels didn\u2019t get their reputation by taking a lot of shit, especially from the Aryan Brotherhood. But these dudes knew about Snow\u2019s legendary prison riot. If he could pull that off from solitary, he could have a few Hells Angels whacked. We went back over and spent a few minutes hashing things out, and then Merchant reluctantly agreed. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut seriously, you guys have to do something about AJ.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"406b\\\" id=\\\"406b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo afterward, Snow walked over to AJ and said, \u201cGimme your patch.

He was out.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7825\\\" id=\\\"7825\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe way we handled the incident earned the respect of the Hells Angels. But they tested us again a few hours later, after the other clubs had cleared out. The Hells Angels wanted us to hang back and talk some more. One of their guys took out a shotgun and put it on the bench seat of a parked pickup with an open door so it was pointing in our direction. Then he started putting on black leather gloves. I said to my guys, \u201cIf that son of a bitch picks that thing up and aims at us, we\u2019re killing everybody who doesn\u2019t have our patch.\u201d There were more of us in that area of the speedway than there were Hells Angels. We surrounded three of them to let the would-be shooter know that if one of us got shot, his three guys would die immediately. I guess they respected that maneuver, too, because Face and Merchant called off their goon.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"59af\\\" id=\\\"59af\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhat felt like a near-death experience turned out to be a game changer. Right after that event, all of us agreed it was time to grow the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. The Aryan Brotherhood liked the idea because they wanted power and money from the weapons and drug trades. My guys and I were onboard because it\u2019d get us more access to more violent felons who were buying, selling, carrying, and maybe even using firearms and explosives. The plan was to split the club in two. Snow and Paulie would start a new chapter over in Akron; JB would be president, and they\u2019d recruit more Aryan Brotherhood guys. I\u2019d stay at our home chapter near Geneva-on-the-Lake with my guys.

One of the people who was most drawn to us was Willie Beard, the Lake East Hells Angels member who told me about the stunt that got AJ kicked out of the Order of Blood. Beard\u2019s big thing was poisonous snakes. I\u2019m talking hundreds of snakes. The first time I saw them was when he\u2019d invited Shorty, Nazi Jim, and me to shoot guns on his property. Beard said, \u201cCome to the basement. I wanna show you something.\u201d That\u2019s not what an undercover agent ever wants to hear. We got down there, and no kidding, the floor was covered in plastic. Shorty and I looked at each other like, \u201cI guess this is it.\u201d I never thought I\u2019d be so relieved to see a cobra.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"aab3\\\" id=\\\"aab3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBeard seemed as committed to us as he was to his own club.

I said, \u201cWhy would we wanna be Hells Angels when there\u2019s nothing better than being an AB?\u201d He just looked at me and smiled.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"f61f\\\" id=\\\"f61f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJB provided me a firearm when I told him I needed to \u201cdo some dirt,\u201d and didn\u2019t bat an eye when I told him I may have to get rid of it \u201cbecause it may have body on\u00a0it.\u201d\\x3c/blockquote\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0362\\\" id=\\\"0362\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\\\"\\x3eAs we built our reputation, we were growing, recruiting new Aryan Brotherhood members, and bringing in even more undercovers from our task force. We were doing criminal business with more and more biker-underworld guys each week. Our main target was the Hells Angels, but over the course of the case, we bought more than 60 firearms, including 13 machine guns, 35 handguns, four shotguns, and eight rifles from various motorcycle gangs and members. We had a female associate of the Aryan Brotherhood make straw purchases for us from a federally licensed firearms dealer who knowingly broke federal law.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6696\\\" id=\\\"6696\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eMy guys even bought a gun from David Snow.

Soon enough, Ivan, one of our original undercovers, bought cocaine from a high-ranking member of the their Youngstown chapter. As their relationship solidified, I was befriending the Youngstown chapter president, a dude named Snake. Over in western Pennsylvania, two more ATF agents and two Pennsylvania state troopers had officially started the third chapter of the Order of Blood, in the town of Sharon. We were less than a year into the case, but we now had 18 undercovers in two states.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bd33\\\" id=\\\"bd33\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eEvery now and then, a non-biker would show up on the scene, usually by way of the Aryan Brotherhood. One was a buddy of David Snow\u2019s named William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Millsaps Jr., a violent guy, late thirties or early forties, who\u2019d recently gotten out of the joint. He was a heavy drug user, always armed. The first time I met him was at a strip club in Alliance, Ohio. We were all sitting around, talking about the wonderful world of crime, and Wild Bill asked us the question every undercover wants to hear: \u201cWhat are you guys lookin\u2019 for?\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"01c6\\\" id=\\\"01c6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cNo thank you\u2026 Mrs. Wild Bill.\u201d I felt like I was 10 years old.

We pulled up to a nice house in suburban Akron. I was thinking, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eThere ain\u2019t no motherfucking way Wild Bill lives here\\x3c/em\\x3e.

He told us to hang out while he went and scored us some meth. He left his gun on a table; Wild Bill knew if he got caught with it, he\u2019d get serious time. When he pulled away from the house, we took down the serial numbers on the gun, scoured his whole place, then sat back down and hung out till he came back with the dope.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"ecc8\\\" id=\\\"ecc8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eLooking back, I don\u2019t think he suspected me at all.

But Ivan, Shorty, Roach, and I followed him down there. There was this crusty old refrigerator with about 400 pounds of freezer ice on it. He went over and wrestled with the handle.

When people say \u201cit felt like a lifetime,\u201d they\u2019re not exaggerating. I was still sitting there, holding the photos of my fellow undercover ATF agents in my left hand. A blizzard of thoughts swirled in my head. \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eIf he reaches for his gun, can I get to mine in time? Does my cover team have a clear view of us?

I ran some quick logic: If they had the pictures for two weeks and hadn\u2019t killed us yet, and Beard didn\u2019t kill me just now, then the investigation probably wasn\u2019t compromised. He told me to be careful about informants and undercovers. Looking back, I don\u2019t think he suspected me at all. I think he was looking out for me.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"415e\\\" id=\\\"415e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThing is, I knew about the photos. After an ATF infiltration a few years earlier\u200a\u2014\u200aa massive case with dozens of arrests and convictions\u200a\u2014\u200athe pictures got circulated to all the outlaw motorcycle clubs around the country. We\u2019d recovered a lot of them from biker clubhouses over time, but some were still circulating. Maybe that\u2019s why I was able to keep my cool.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"75ef\\\" id=\\\"75ef\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMy supervisors decided to shut it down. One of them had been on edge through the whole investigation, so he was able to use the confrontation with Beard to justify ending it. But we couldn\u2019t just stop in our tracks. We needed time to get warrants and affidavits in order, so we kept at it for a couple more months.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2715\\\" id=\\\"2715\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBailey and Nazi Jim were instructed to lay low. I used my fictional kids and baby mama down in Florida to get away for a bit. While I was out of town, the other guys started spreading the word about my fictional death: \u201cJunkyard had a brain aneurysm and died on the trip.\u201d When people said they wanted to come to the funeral, my guys told them that it was too late.

All told, charges were brought against 59 individuals, many of them violent felons, on federal and state weapons and drug trafficking charges, identity theft, money laundering, burglary, and felony assault. The case, expertly managed by ATF Special Agents Brian Kolar and Chad Foreman, even led to a murder conviction.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b7dc\\\" id=\\\"b7dc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMy undercover team and I weren\u2019t there for the actual raids or arrests. It would have been way too risky; those guys might have opened fire rather than get arrested by the undercover cops who\u2019d duped them. But we were there to help our two case agents with interviews and evidence. We didn\u2019t see Snow after the arrests; he went to prison and wound up getting killed inside by a fellow member of the Aryan Brotherhood who nearly sawed off his head. JB died of heart failure in county jail. Wild Bill went back to prison. Somehow we missed a gun at Paulie\u2019s place; so he only got probation on a drug charge.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e627\\\" id=\\\"e627\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe only person we made a point to see after the fact was Aryan Jim, who was about to get a nine-year sentence, during which time he\u2019d probably be kicked out of the Brotherhood for letting so many undercovers into the organization.

second I heard Willie Beard\u2019s voice. For one thing, he was calling the landline; he\u2019d never done that. For another, I\u2019d gotten to know him over the past several months, and the dude was almost 100 percent night owl, but now he was reaching out on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d87\" name=\"4d87\">This was December 2004 in northeast Ohio, up near Cleveland. Beard was a member of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, the country\u2019s most notorious outlaw biker gang. I was a founding member of the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club, the first biker gang ever sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood, the country\u2019s most notorious prison gang. As far as Beard knew, we were associates and friends. He was right only about the first part. The guy had no idea that I was also an undercover agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), let alone that I was running an investigation involving 18 undercovers from four law enforcement agencies in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e989\" name=\"e989\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Or did he know?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eefc\" name=\"eefc\">That\u2019s the question that rattled around my skull.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bb6f\" name=\"bb6f\">\u201cHey, Junkyard,\u201d Beard said. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"18bd\" name=\"18bd\">\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fd01\" name=\"fd01\">\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to show you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5df1\" name=\"5df1\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"165f\" name=\"165f\">\u201cNot on the phone,\u201d he said. \u201cI had my car swept for bugs. It\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"517d\" name=\"517d\">Beard told me to meet him at the McDonald\u2019s on Interstate 90 and Route 534 and asked if I could be there in 30 minutes\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept he wasn\u2019t asking.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2400\" name=\"2400\">I said, \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d hung up, and looked over at my fellow undercover agents, Shorty, Brian, and Bailey. \u201cThis. Cannot. Be good.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd27\" name=\"bd27\">They agreed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"24f4\" name=\"24f4\">We slapped together a quick plan: They\u2019d change out of their Nazi-themed biker gear\u200a\u2014\u200anothing\u2019s more conspicuous than guys wearing SS lightning bolts and swastikas\u200a\u2014\u200aand watch us from the lot across from McDonald\u2019s, where they\u2019d act as my cover team. I\u2019d carry a gun, but I wouldn\u2019t wear a wire; for all I knew, Beard would start our little meeting by patting me down. We all agreed that if I got in the car and Beard drove off, then I was getting out whether he stopped the car or not.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8211\" name=\"8211\">I found Beard standing inside the main door, sipping coffee. He was a big guy, fit from kickboxing, though you couldn\u2019t see it beneath the winter jacket. I don\u2019t even think we shook hands. He just said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my car,\u201d so I followed him to the parking lot, and we got into his small SUV.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"2ca6\" name=\"2ca6\">How exactly did I become the co-leader of a motorcycle gang sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood? To be honest, it kind of happened by accident.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"04f7\" name=\"04f7\">When the doors were closed, Beard reached into his coat pocket. I thought to myself<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">, Is this guy about to off me in a Mickey D\u2019s parking lot?</em> My pistol was tucked into the right-side waistband of my jeans and covered by my old Carhartt work coat. I watched Beard\u2019s hands and leaned toward him a bit in case I needed to draw my gun.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8c86\" name=\"8c86\">But I didn\u2019t. Beard pulled out a small envelope that I noticed was addressed to the Lake East chapter of the Hells Angels\u200a\u2014\u200aBeard\u2019s chapter. He handed it to me and said, \u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd51\" name=\"dd51\">It had photocopies of two pictures. Next to one picture, someone had written, \u201cNazi Jim\u200a\u2014\u200aATF Agent.\u201d Next to the other one: \u201cBailey\u200a\u2014\u200aATF Agent.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad20\" name=\"ad20\">I did my best to play it cool. Beard looked at me and said, \u201cAre these dudes in your club? Is that Nazi Jim? Is that Bailey?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2207\" name=\"2207\">I studied the picture like I meant it. That was Nazi Jim alright, and yeah, he was an ATF agent and a member of the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. The guy labeled as Bailey was actually a different ATF agent with a similar look and build; the picture was so grainy that he\u2019d been misidentified.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ddc\" name=\"9ddc\">After a few seconds of looking at the pictures, I turned to Beard and shook my head. I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen these guys before.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"63a9\" name=\"63a9\">Then I waited for him to make his next move.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"9763\" name=\"9763\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">H</span>ow exactly did I become the co-leader of a motorcycle gang sanctioned by the Aryan Brotherhood? To be honest, it kind of happened by accident. The agency never said, \u201cHey, Frank, go out and befriend a bunch of Aryan Brotherhood members and help start their motorcycle gang.\u201d I was never told I\u2019d be palling around with some of the Ohio Aryan Brotherhood\u2019s most notorious members. But things never go as expected when you work undercover.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"754e\" name=\"754e\">By that point in my career, I\u2019d spent the better part of 18 years working undercover for the ATF. My specialty was outlaw biker-gang infiltrations. I should mention here that they call themselves \u201cmotorcycle clubs.\u201d But these aren\u2019t groups of Sunday cruisers. They have track records as criminal enterprises, which is why law enforcement (and respectable humans) refer to them them as gangs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c44\" name=\"0c44\">By 2004, I\u2019d infiltrated the Brothers Motorcycle Club in Columbus, Ohio, and the Vagos club out in Las Vegas. I\u2019d been in a couple armed standoffs and heard a major gang leader order a hit on another undercover ATF agent who happened to be my best friend, Darrin Kozlowski. I\u2019d also played undercover support roles in cases targeting the Outlaws, the Mongols, and the Warlocks. All told, a handful of guys and I, who collectively dedicated hundreds of years on these cases, put hundreds of seriously bad people behind bars for armed violent crimes, attempted murder, weapons sales, and countless other charges. And I picked up a lot of tattoos along the way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5f1\" name=\"f5f1\">In 2001, when I got to the ATF field office in Youngstown, Ohio, I wasn\u2019t supposed to be undercover; I was supposed to be running my group and spending some much-needed time with my wife and our newly adopted daughters. I was still getting adjusted to normal life after an 18-month undercover case. I was happy for the break, but also miserable; even though I was glad to be living without the 24/7 paranoia, something was missing\u200a\u2014\u200athat rush of living the life and catching these bad guys and beating them at their own game.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"5deb\" name=\"5deb\">And just like that, I went from being a family man, to being \u201cJunkyard\u201d: a guy who wrestles wild animals in\u00a0public.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"77a0\" name=\"77a0\">A year into my time in Youngstown, I got a call from Lieutenant Tom Doyle of the Eastlake Police Department, near Cleveland. He said, \u201cWould you be interested in taking a look at the Hells Angels with us?\u201d Doyle explained that there was a big Hells Angels presence up there; the Lake East and Cleveland chapters ran a lot of drugs and weapons, but law enforcement just couldn\u2019t get the evidence they needed. Doyle said he had a confidential informant\u200a\u2014\u200aa member of the Aryan Brotherhood who\u2019d nearly beat a guy to death in a bar was facing hard time and hoping to knock a few years off his sentence. So ATF formed a task force with the Eastlake police, the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the Ohio State Adult Parole Authority.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5be3\" name=\"5be3\">When we met the confidential information\u2014we call them CIs\u2014he told us about another Aryan Brotherhood member, James \u201cAryan Jim\u201d Blomquist, who went by AJ.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ff39\" name=\"ff39\">AJ knew how to build machine guns.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b33d\" name=\"b33d\">The plan was for our CI to introduce AJ to an undercover agent whose street name was Nazi Jim, have the agent buy some machine guns from him, and shut him down. I\u2019d run things from the field office. But when the meet day came, I asked the CI what he\u2019d told AJ about my undercover guy. The CI looked right at me and said, \u201cI gave him <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">your </em>description.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1bc5\" name=\"1bc5\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">My</em> description?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"06bd\" name=\"06bd\">\u201cYeah.\u201d The CI was a young guy, and I was about 40.

I was comfortable around bad guys and vice versa. At the intro, Nazi Jim and AJ and I spent two or three hours drinking beers and whatnot. I dropped little hints of some of my criminal business\u200a\u2014\u200aenough to let him know I was looking for opportunities. AJ was way more forthright. He told me straight up, \u201cI\u2019m a captain in the Aryan Brotherhood,\u201d and pulled down his shirt collar to show me the tattoo on his chest indicating his rank.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f1c\" name=\"2f1c\">Soon enough he told me that if I could get all the parts for machine guns, then he could build them for me. No serial numbers. Totally untraceable. Later, I went online and ordered all the parts, then dropped them with AJ a couple days later. A few days after that, Nazi Jim and I met him in a parking lot outside Cleveland. There were three Sten machine guns with 20-round mags, the same weapons the Brits used in World War II. They looked like they were straight from the manufacturer. A few days later, we asked AJ to make 10 more. We said we\u2019d pay $500 apiece.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a622\" name=\"a622\">AJ started calling me every morning just to shoot the shit.

He <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">likes</em> me.\u201d (I did not like AJ.) I had to twist some arms at ATF, but soon I was also buying drugs and contraband from AJ.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6bb\" name=\"b6bb\">On one of our calls, we got to talking about our love of money and how we wanted to make more. AJ knew I rode motorcycles, and before long he said, \u201cYou know, my Aryan brothers and me, we\u2019ve been trying to get a motorcycle club going for a long time.\u201d</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d87c\" name=\"d87c\">\u201cLet\u2019s make this happen, Junkyard.

From there, he proposed, they\u2019d take it nationwide. The way AJ saw it, if he was gonna go head-to-head with a motorcycle club, he had to be part of one, and that organization had to have serious power.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8376\" name=\"8376\">Up to that point, there hadn\u2019t been an Aryan Brotherhood-sanctioned motorcycle club that I or any of the other ATF agents had heard about. By most accounts, it was founded in the early 1960s in California\u2019s San Quentin State Prison and kept growing on both sides of the bars. Some Aryan Brotherhood members believed in the whole white-power cause; some just rolled with it to stay safe in prison\u2014not that burying your head in the sand makes it okay to be a white supremacist.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a0bf\" name=\"a0bf\">On the phone, I listened patiently as AJ told me about his visions of criminal greatness, and I told him how brilliant he was. Then he surprised me. AJ said, \u201cLet\u2019s make this happen, Junkyard.

Four of them were fellow ATF agents: Ivan, Nazi Jim, JT, and Brian. The fifth, Shorty, was a deputy with the Ashtabula County Sheriff\u2019s Department. AJ brought four guys, including John \u201cJB\u201d Beason, a convicted murderer on parole. JB was covered in prison tats and was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood in Ohio. David Snow was there; he was recognized as the founding Aryan Brotherhood member in the Ohio prison system. A soft-spoken redhead, Snow spent most of his life behind bars. He shot a guy while locked up, and had orchestrated an 11-day prison riot from 23-hour-a-day solitary lockdown in a max-security facility in Youngstown. Legend had it that when he got released, Snow was so accustomed to being in confined spaces that he spent six months living under\u200a\u2014\u200anot in\u2014 his mother\u2019s trailer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8ea6\" name=\"8ea6\">Also at the bar was AJ\u2019s other guy, Paul \u201cPaulie\u201d Geiger, who had done 10 years in a federal prison for muling dope in Oklahoma, and his friend Neil Ashley, who went by \u201cMotor.\u201d</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"40cc\" name=\"40cc\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 799px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 77.4%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\" data-height=\"850\" data-image-id=\"1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\" data-width=\"1098\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*ESgXDRHPY4fdRHlyLyUq6Q.png\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">From left (un-blurred): JB, the author, Ivan, AJ, David\u00a0Snow.</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"981d\" name=\"981d\">We sat around drinking beer and bullshitting until we all felt comfortable enough to talk about starting a motorcycle club and getting a piece of the Hells Angels\u2019 action. The plan was to ease in, not start a war, but eventually take over. Everyone was onboard. Shorty took the opportunity to establish his role as a madman. He put one of those plastic leprechaun hats on his shaved head, jumped on the bar, and shouted, \u201cListen up, you Irish fucks! The Nazis are in charge now, so if you got a problem, fuck off or talk to us!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"5408\" name=\"5408\">The fact that AJ brought this foursome of ex-felons was a huge deal. A lot of times, ATF supervisors get bent if the subjects of an undercover operation don\u2019t have felony convictions or a record of violence. Not only did these guys fit the bill, but we were confident that everybody they\u2019d bring us would be violent felons too. That meant they\u2019d likely be in possession of firearms\u200a\u2014\u200aand for the ATF, criminals with guns are a good thing. After all, the bureau\u2019s job isn\u2019t just to go after arms dealers; it\u2019s to take armed felons out of their communities. While other law enforcement agencies would rather stay away from people who carry weapons, ATF seeks them out. For us, a bad guy with a gun is the kind of bad guy we like to prey upon.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"e0ce\" name=\"e0ce\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">O</span>ur inaugural club meeting was on April 20\u200a\u2014\u200aHitler\u2019s birthday\u2014and AJ told us he\u2019d already come up with the name: Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. It was based on the f\u00fchrer\u2019s Blood Order, a medal of honor given to certain Nazi soldiers for the work they did in the 1923 uprising of the National Socialist German Workers Party.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"27b0\" name=\"27b0\">We moved on to the next order of business: a patch. Every biker gang has a patch that members wear on their vests or jackets. For some reason, AJ and his crew were a little cool on the whole swastika thing, so we settled on the SS lightning bolts.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"0f50\" name=\"0f50\">There were some weird interactions, like when some WWII vets stared daggers at me. Those were the hardest times to stay in\u00a0role.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"8bdb\" name=\"8bdb\">My guys and I kept up appearances by renting a house in Saybrook, just outside Geneva-on-the-Lake, about an hour east of Cleveland. I won\u2019t call Geneva-on-the-Lake a resort town, but it\u2019s packed with tourists in summer. I lived there with Shorty, Ivan, Brian, and JT. We also had female agents come around; I can\u2019t name them, because they\u2019re still active. They played the vital role of befriending the wives and girlfriends of the Aryan Brotherhood guys and gathering info.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f71\" name=\"9f71\">We flew our colors right outside the house. There were always a lot of bikes in the driveway, which is kind of a magnet for other bikers. Next thing we knew, random riders started coming by. It turned into the kind of house that every respectable homeowner on the block must\u2019ve hated. There was an indoor hot tub at the place, so, late at night, when we knew we were alone, we\u2019d unwind and debrief, knowing that the jets muffled our voices in case anyone showed up unannounced. We lived there in shifts and had our stories straight, so if JB and David Snow and AJ or any of their Aryan Brotherhood pals asked, we could say, \u201cShorty\u2019s visiting his baby mama over in Warren,\u201d or what have you. My story was that I had some criminal business in Virginia and a couple kids who lived with their mom down in Florida.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3cf0\" name=\"3cf0\">A bar in town served as our main hangout. The owner liked us and said, \u201cHey man, I\u2019ve got a vacant lot down the street free of charge if you guys want to sell your stuff.\u201d We\u2019d set up tables and sell Nazi paraphernalia, along with our own T-shirts, to anyone who\u2019d buy them. It\u2019s called \u201csupport gear.\u201d All outlaw motorcycle gangs sell it. For example, if you see a shirt saying \u201cSupport your Local 81,\u201d the \u201c81\u201d means Hells Angels. (H is the eighth letter in the alphabet; A is the first.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6a7d\" name=\"6a7d\">To this day, I\u2019m stunned at the people who bought our stuff\u200a\u2014\u200ajust regular folks, tourists basically. It was eye-opening to me, because you know racism exists but not to the extent that Joe Six-Pack strolling by wants to give you money for Nazi gear. No one challenged us; they were probably too afraid.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"3654\" name=\"3654\">There were some weird interactions, though, like when some old guys in WWII Veteran hats stared daggers at me. Those were the hardest times to stay in role. You\u2019re standing there looking like the most despicable creature on earth, and you wanna tell them, \u201cHey, I have family who got shot fighting the Nazis. I even have my godfather\u2019s Purple Heart.\u201d But you can\u2019t talk. One time, there was a little kid who wanted his dad to buy him one of our support shirts. The father kept saying no, but the kid wouldn\u2019t let up. Finally, the kid said, \u201cCome on, Dad, why not?\u201d And father got irritated and said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re Jewish!\u201d</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"258e\" name=\"258e\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>rying to understand the ecosystem of Northeast Ohio\u2019s outlaw motorcycle clubs was like keeping track of high school gossip. The big national gangs like Hells Angels and Pagans and Outlaws have multiple chapters; some have more influence than others. Sometimes there are rivalries between gangs. Outlaw motorcycle clubs, which have been around since the 1940s, are organized and hierarchical, so there can also be cliques, clashes, and bad blood between members of the same chapter. On top of all that, each chapter has affiliates, or support clubs\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning other motorcycle gangs that they get along with or do business with but have less sway.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dcbe\" name=\"dcbe\">Because the Aryan Brotherhood sanctioned the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club, we came onto the scene with built-in strength. My guys and I weren\u2019t official Aryan Brotherhood members, but Snow told me he considered us true \u201cbrothers,\u201d and if anyone asked, we were part of the \u201cbrand.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4252\" name=\"4252\">Power has a way of attracting trouble. One day, Aryan Jim, dumbass that he was, went to a Cleveland Hells Angels bar, rode inside, and did a burnout in the middle of the room. The rest of us didn\u2019t know about the incident because AJ had gotten away and kept it to himself. But I got a call from a ticked-off Willie Beard, who told me all about it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5e82\" name=\"5e82\">A few days later, we had to make an appearance at these drag races the Hells Angels put on at a speedway south of Cleveland. It was an annual event for them to let everyone know who ran the show in the region. We were independent and not under the grip of the Hells Angels, but we had to show up to let everyone know we were for real.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9728\" name=\"9728\">\u201cAre we going to have a problem?\u201d That was code for, \u201cAm I going to have to kill you here and\u00a0now?\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"51d7\" name=\"51d7\">When we got there, the Hells Angels were posted up around the drag strip, waiting for AJ and the rest of us. We pulled in, made sure AJ was out of sight, and got off our bikes. JB\u200a\u2014\u200athe guy who\u2019d recently done more than two decades for murder\u200a\u2014\u200aand I walked over to Johnny Merchant, the Cleveland Hells Angels\u2019 sergeant-at-arms, and another Cleveland HA everyone called Face, a rough-looking dock worker whose mug was hidden behind a beard and glasses.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"22a7\" name=\"22a7\">Merchant said, \u201cHey, Junkyard, where\u2019s AJ? We\u2019re gonna beat his ass.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0b66\" name=\"0b66\">JB piped up: \u201cYou guys ain\u2019t touching none of our guys.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eabe\" name=\"eabe\">JB and I walked over to Snow, who, in his man-of-few-words way, told us to walk back over and let the Hells Angels know that if they touched one of our members, we\u2019d \u201cgreen-light everybody in the Ohio prison system who wears the HA patch.\u201d Green-lighting means ordering them killed. Now, as you might have heard, the Hells Angels didn\u2019t get their reputation by taking a lot of shit, especially from the Aryan Brotherhood. But these dudes knew about Snow\u2019s legendary prison riot. If he could pull that off from solitary, he could have a few Hells Angels whacked. We went back over and spent a few minutes hashing things out, and then Merchant reluctantly agreed. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut seriously, you guys have to do something about AJ.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"406b\" name=\"406b\">So afterward, Snow walked over to AJ and said, \u201cGimme your patch. You\u2019re out.\u201d AJ tried to argue, but all Snow had to say was, \u201cAre we going to have a problem?\u201d That was code for, \u201cAm I going to have to kill you here and now?\u201d AJ handed over his patch. He was out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7825\" name=\"7825\">The way we handled the incident earned the respect of the Hells Angels. But they tested us again a few hours later, after the other clubs had cleared out. The Hells Angels wanted us to hang back and talk some more. One of their guys took out a shotgun and put it on the bench seat of a parked pickup with an open door so it was pointing in our direction. Then he started putting on black leather gloves. I said to my guys, \u201cIf that son of a bitch picks that thing up and aims at us, we\u2019re killing everybody who doesn\u2019t have our patch.\u201d There were more of us in that area of the speedway than there were Hells Angels. We surrounded three of them to let the would-be shooter know that if one of us got shot, his three guys would die immediately. I guess they respected that maneuver, too, because Face and Merchant called off their goon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"59af\" name=\"59af\">What felt like a near-death experience turned out to be a game changer. Right after that event, all of us agreed it was time to grow the Order of Blood Motorcycle Club. The Aryan Brotherhood liked the idea because they wanted power and money from the weapons and drug trades. My guys and I were onboard because it\u2019d get us more access to more violent felons who were buying, selling, carrying, and maybe even using firearms and explosives. The plan was to split the club in two. Snow and Paulie would start a new chapter over in Akron; JB would be president, and they\u2019d recruit more Aryan Brotherhood guys. I\u2019d stay at our home chapter near Geneva-on-the-Lake with my guys. We\u2019d also recruit new members\u200a\u2014\u200ameaning other undercovers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"a1bf\" name=\"a1bf\">And I\u2019d be president.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"24c3\" name=\"24c3\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">N</span>othing attracts criminals and lowlifes more than other criminals and lowlifes. One of the people who was most drawn to us was Willie Beard, the Lake East Hells Angels member who told me about the stunt that got AJ kicked out of the Order of Blood. Beard\u2019s big thing was poisonous snakes. I\u2019m talking hundreds of snakes. The first time I saw them was when he\u2019d invited Shorty, Nazi Jim, and me to shoot guns on his property. Beard said, \u201cCome to the basement. I wanna show you something.\u201d That\u2019s not what an undercover agent ever wants to hear. We got down there, and no kidding, the floor was covered in plastic. Shorty and I looked at each other like, \u201cI guess this is it.\u201d I never thought I\u2019d be so relieved to see a cobra.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aab3\" name=\"aab3\">Beard seemed as committed to us as he was to his own club. It got to the point where he didn\u2019t just want to befriend us, he wanted us to be to the \u201ccharter\u201d of the Hells Angels\u200a\u2014\u200abasically a chapter in Erie, Pennsylvania. I said, \u201cWhy would we wanna be Hells Angels when there\u2019s nothing better than being an AB?\u201d He just looked at me and smiled.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"f61f\" name=\"f61f\">JB provided me a firearm when I told him I needed to \u201cdo some dirt,\u201d and didn\u2019t bat an eye when I told him I may have to get rid of it \u201cbecause it may have body on\u00a0it.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"0362\" name=\"0362\">As we built our reputation, we were growing, recruiting new Aryan Brotherhood members, and bringing in even more undercovers from our task force.

Our main target was the Hells Angels, but over the course of the case, we bought more than 60 firearms, including 13 machine guns, 35 handguns, four shotguns, and eight rifles from various motorcycle gangs and members. We had a female associate of the Aryan Brotherhood make straw purchases for us from a federally licensed firearms dealer who knowingly broke federal law.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"6696\" name=\"6696\">My guys even bought a gun from David Snow. JB provided me a firearm when I told him I needed to \u201cdo some dirt\u201d and didn\u2019t bat an eye when I told him I may have to get rid of it \u201cbecause it may have body on it.\u201d Besides the weapons, we also bought significant amounts of meth, cocaine, crack, and prescription drugs from a range of outlaw biker gang members.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"82f4\" name=\"82f4\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">O</span>ur network grew.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>Word spread among Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania chapters of the Pagans, a major East Coast outlaw club, that we knew how to handle ourselves.

Over in western Pennsylvania, two more ATF agents and two Pennsylvania state troopers had officially started the third chapter of the Order of Blood, in the town of Sharon. We were less than a year into the case, but we now had 18 undercovers in two states.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd33\" name=\"bd33\">Every now and then, a non-biker would show up on the scene, usually by way of the Aryan Brotherhood. One was a buddy of David Snow\u2019s named William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Millsaps Jr., a violent guy, late thirties or early forties, who\u2019d recently gotten out of the joint. He was a heavy drug user, always armed. The first time I met him was at a strip club in Alliance, Ohio. We were all sitting around, talking about the wonderful world of crime, and Wild Bill asked us the question every undercover wants to hear: \u201cWhat are you guys lookin\u2019 for?\u201d</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"01c6\" name=\"01c6\">\u201cNo thank you\u2026 Mrs. Wild Bill.\u201d I felt like I was 10 years old. Except that I had a duffel bag full of\u00a0weapons.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"f40e\" name=\"f40e\">Two hours later, I was riding shotgun in Wild Bill\u2019s truck, while Shorty, another undercover named Roach, and Ivan were following us in an old Cadillac. We pulled up to a nice house in suburban Akron. I was thinking, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">There ain\u2019t no motherfucking way Wild Bill lives here</em>. But we walked in, and Wild Bill looked at an older guy on the couch and said, \u201cHey, Dad. These are my brothers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7794\" name=\"7794\">Bill told us to come upstairs. As we left the living room, his dad said, \u201cYou better hurry up\u200a\u2014\u200ayour mother\u2019s gonna be home soon.\u201d He seemed to know exactly what his son was up to.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4c9e\" name=\"4c9e\">Up in his bedroom, Wild Bill showed us a big pile of guns\u200a\u2014\u200apistols, rifles. He said, \u201cHow many do you want?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6d7f\" name=\"6d7f\">I said, \u201cShit, we\u2019ll take it all.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bd2c\" name=\"bd2c\">\u201cI\u2019ll put them in this duffel bag so you guys can take them out, right?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"183a\" name=\"183a\">In the meantime, we heard the door open downstairs. His mom was home.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dee\" name=\"3dee\">We bumped into her at the bottom of the steps, and she was like June Cleaver. \u201cHey, boys. Can we get you anything to eat or drink?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d447\" name=\"d447\">I didn\u2019t know Wild Bill\u2019s last name, so the only thing I could think of to say was, \u201cNo thank you\u2026 Mrs. Wild Bill.\u201d I felt like I was 10 years old. Except that I had a duffel bag full of weapons. It was one of the weirdest experiences of my life.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6752\" name=\"6752\">The next stop was Wild Bill\u2019s house, where he lived, a shithole filled with motorcycle parts. He told us to hang out while he went and scored us some meth. He left his gun on a table; Wild Bill knew if he got caught with it, he\u2019d get serious time. When he pulled away from the house, we took down the serial numbers on the gun, scoured his whole place, then sat back down and hung out till he came back with the dope.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"ecc8\" name=\"ecc8\">Looking back, I don\u2019t think he suspected me at all. I think he was looking out for\u00a0me.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"f74e\" name=\"f74e\">A few minutes after he got home and sold us the meth, he said, \u201cHey. Let me show you something in the basement.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d852\" name=\"d852\">I don\u2019t know what it is with these guys about wanting to show us their basements. But Ivan, Shorty, Roach, and I followed him down there. There was this crusty old refrigerator with about 400 pounds of freezer ice on it. He went over and wrestled with the handle. I was thinking, \u201cIs there gonna be a body in there or what?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f1b9\" name=\"f1b9\">Wild Bill finally got the door open, but none of us could see inside from where we were standing. Then he looked at Shorty and, no shit, he said, \u201cHey, Shorty, ya like chicken wings?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3057\" name=\"3057\">Shorty said, \u201cUh, yeah, man, I like chicken wings.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4751\" name=\"4751\">Wild Bill pulled out a big bag of frozen wings that was covered in old ice, handed the bag to Shorty, and said, \u201cHere you go, brother. I like you. I want you to have this.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d376\" name=\"d376\">Later, Shorty tossed the bag out the window of the Caddy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"032d\" name=\"032d\">I said, \u201cShorty, what are you thinking, man?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dae6\" name=\"dae6\">\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with a bag of old frozen chicken wings?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ad76\" name=\"ad76\">\u201cHell if I know, but you can\u2019t toss them on the road he drives down every day. What if he sees them?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"122f\" name=\"122f\">So I pulled over and backed up. Shorty went searching in the dark for the wings.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"24e0\" name=\"24e0\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">I</span> still have no idea how much time passed while I waited for Willie Beard to say something in his SUV that fateful day. When people say \u201cit felt like a lifetime,\u201d they\u2019re not exaggerating. I was still sitting there, holding the photos of my fellow undercover ATF agents in my left hand. A blizzard of thoughts swirled in my head. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">If he reaches for his gun, can I get to mine in time? Does my cover team have a clear view of us? Am I gonna see my wife and kids again? </em>I was aware of everything\u200a\u2014\u200athe gray November sky, the oblivious people walking in and out of McDonald\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aand at the same time my own response to the pictures echoed through my brain: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen these dudes before.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1d85\" name=\"1d85\">Willie Beard finally spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s what we thought. We\u2019ve had this picture for a couple weeks, and we had a meeting about it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfe3\" name=\"dfe3\">Beard told me that one set of copies<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>of the pictures had been sent to the Hells Angels\u2019 Cleveland chapter, and another was sent to the Lake East Hells Angels. I ran some quick logic: If they had the pictures for two weeks and hadn\u2019t killed us yet, and Beard didn\u2019t kill me just now, then the investigation probably wasn\u2019t compromised. He told me to be careful about informants and undercovers. Looking back, I don\u2019t think he suspected me at all. I think he was looking out for me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"415e\" name=\"415e\">Thing is, I knew about the photos. After an ATF infiltration a few years earlier\u200a\u2014\u200aa massive case with dozens of arrests and convictions\u200a\u2014\u200athe pictures got circulated to all the outlaw motorcycle clubs around the country. We\u2019d recovered a lot of them from biker clubhouses over time, but some were still circulating. Maybe that\u2019s why I was able to keep my cool.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"75ef\" name=\"75ef\">My supervisors decided to shut it down. One of them had been on edge through the whole investigation, so he was able to use the confrontation with Beard to justify ending it. But we couldn\u2019t just stop in our tracks. We needed time to get warrants and affidavits in order, so we kept at it for a couple more months.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2715\" name=\"2715\">Bailey and Nazi Jim were instructed to lay low. I used my fictional kids and baby mama down in Florida to get away for a bit. While I was out of town, the other guys started spreading the word about my fictional death: \u201cJunkyard had a brain aneurysm and died on the trip.\u201d When people said they wanted to come to the funeral, my guys told them that it was too late. They said my kids\u2019 mom hadn\u2019t called anyone until after the funeral.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"973a\" name=\"973a\">RIP, Junkyard.</p></div></div> <div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\" id=\"46b5\" name=\"46b5\">On June 23, 2005, 16 months after I\u2019d assumed my most ridiculous undercover handle, 150 federal and local law enforcement officers in Ohio and Pennsylvania did their first round of raids and searches. All told, charges were brought against 59 individuals, many of them violent felons, on federal and state weapons and drug trafficking charges, identity theft, money laundering, burglary, and felony assault. The case, expertly managed by ATF Special Agents Brian Kolar and Chad Foreman, even led to a murder conviction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b7dc\" name=\"b7dc\">My undercover team and I weren\u2019t there for the actual raids or arrests. It would have been way too risky; those guys might have opened fire rather than get arrested by the undercover cops who\u2019d duped them. But we were there to help our two case agents with interviews and evidence. We didn\u2019t see Snow after the arrests; he went to prison and wound up getting killed inside by a fellow member of the Aryan Brotherhood who nearly sawed off his head. JB died of heart failure in county jail. Wild Bill went back to prison. Somehow we missed a gun at Paulie\u2019s place; so he only got probation on a drug charge.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e627\" name=\"e627\">The only person we made a point to see after the fact was Aryan Jim, who was about to get a nine-year sentence, during which time he\u2019d probably be kicked out of the Brotherhood for letting so many undercovers into the organization. When we saw him, he was being questioned in a room<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> </strong>at Eastlake Police Department shortly after the raids. One of the officers opened the door to let us in. Nazi Jim was with me. So were Ivan and Shorty, three of the guys I\u2019d brought to the bar on St. Paddy\u2019s Day more than a year earlier when we\u2019d first agreed to start the club.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"91bb\" name=\"91bb\">When we walked in, AJ was sitting at the end of a big table. He looked at us, gathered his thoughts, shook his head, and said just three words:</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"9813\" name=\"9813\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">All</em> of you?\u201d</p></div></div> ", "website": "medium"}

The great spire of St. Salvator\u2019s is original to the 15th century structure, but the rest of the quad today bears little resemblance to what it looked like when it opened in 1450. It was altered irrevocably starting with the great upheavals of the Reformation in Scotland, and indeed, a pivotal event in that history took place in the quad: the burning at the state of Patrick Hamilton, a 24-year-old scholar and advocate of the ideas of Martin Luther. He who was the first person condemned to die and executed for espousing Protestantism in Scotland. That was 1528.</p>\n<p>With the 500the anniversary of the Luther\u2019s nailing of the 95 theses to the door of Wittenberg castle, University of St Andrews researchers collaborated with Smart History to set the scene virtually so we could get an idea of what St. Salvator\u2019s looked like in its medieval heyday. </p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/240629953\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/240629953\">St Salvators  \u2013 St Andrews 1559</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user40599170\">Smart History</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Happy New Year\u2019s Eve!\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50052\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ex-cathedra\" rel=\"category tag\">Ex Cathedra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50052#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-50042\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50042\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Who wants to live forever?

The living incarnations of the gods, Egypt\u2019s pharaohs were mummified to extend their physical bodies into the immortal realm. Alexander the Great was said to have sought out a yogi in India so he could discover the secret to eternal life (which he would turn out to need far sooner than he realized). Mithridates of Pontus was reputed to have ingested tiny amounts of every poison known to make himself unkillable (iocane powder was not reportedly among them) after his father was assassinated by poison, and Roman emperors deified their (less reviled) predecessors and were deified themselves posthumously as a matter of rote.</p>\n<p>Qin Shi Huang, first emperor of a united China (reined 220\u2013210 B.C.) and founder of the Qin dynasty which barely survived him by three years, had much in common with his fellow monarchs. He\u2019d fought bloody wars his whole life, taking the throne of the Qin kingdom when he was 13 years old and fighting his way to becoming the ultimate victor of China\u2019s Warring States Period 25 years later. Previous dynasts used the word for \u201cking.\u201d Qin Shi Huang literally coined the word for \u201cemperor\u201d which has been used by Chinese monarchs ever since. </p>\n<p>As unrelenting as he was in battle he was equally driven to find the secret of eternal life. He covered several bases there, creating the wonder-of-the-world greatness of the Terracotta Army for his huge mausoleum complete with rivers of mercury (believe to be a boon to preservation of tissues). That was the failsafe, as it happens. Plan A was not to die at all, and just like his counterparts out west, he had good reason for his pathological fear of the reaper. He survived at least three foiled assassination attempts and several coups during his lifetime. In a twist that would make an ancient Greek tragedian weep tears of bitter jealousy and regret, the First Emperor died in a palace in the far east of his realm where he had gone to score an elixir of life from some Taoist wizards who said they knew of one hidden on a remote island under the watchful eye of a guardian sea monster. He never did make it to the sea monster. Something else killed him first: the mercury-filled \u201cmedicinal\u201d poison pills given him by his physicians to give him eternal life. It was 210 B.C. and he was 49 years old.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Archaeologist-examines-Quin-wood-slip.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50046\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Archaeologist-examines-Quin-wood-slip-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Archaeologist-examines-Quin-wood-slip-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Archaeologist-examines-Quin-wood-slip-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Archaeologist-examines-Quin-wood-slip-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Archaeologist-examines-Quin-wood-slip-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Archaeologist examines Quin wood slip.

As soon as he claimed the title, the Emperor issued an order to all regional authorities that they seek out the secret to immortality and relay it to him. The poor local guys did the best they could and the Qin Emperor got numerous replies written on wooden slips, thousands of which were discovered at the bottom of a well in Hunan province in 2002.</p>\n<p>Archaeologists have been studying the slips since then and the Qin tombs found at the site ever since and have collected remarkable evidence of how wide-ranging the search was, a personally committed and involved the emperor was in search for the elixir.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Zhang Chunlong, a researcher at the provincial institute of archaeology, said the emperor\u2019s decree reached frontier regions and remote villages.</p>\n<p>According to the calligraphic script on the narrow wooden slips, a village called \u201cDuxiang\u201d reported that no miraculous potion had been found yet and implied that the search would continue. Another place, \u201cLangya,\u201d in today\u2019s eastern Shandong Province near the sea, presented a herb collected from an auspicious local mountain.</p>\n<p>The discovery demonstrated the emperor\u2019s centralization of authority.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt required a highly efficient administration and strong executive force to pass down a government decree in ancient times when transportation and communication facilities were undeveloped,\u201d Zhang said.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Archaeologists-examine-Quin-wood-slips.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Archaeologists examine Quin wood slips.

There are over 36,000 slips written using 200,000 ancient Chinese characters from 222-208 B.C covering subjects from politics to military plans to legal provisions and more. Archaeologists found 48 slips that directly reference medical questions, mostly the elixir but not solely. These document treatments that were popular then and are still part of traditional Chinese medicine today. They also revealed what a thoroughly well-developed health services system the Qin Dynasty had put together in such a short time. It was highly regulated. Doctors could only take patients under their care when told to do so by the government and all treatments had to be assiduously recorded for inspection. The patients were overwhelmingly wealthy members of the elite who could afford all theis doctorin\u2019.</p>\n<p>This is a remarkable collection of official archival records from a very short-lived (nyuk) dynasty that has other left very few written records behind. The slips aren\u2019t just a fascinating combination of nostra, legends and alchemy from the period; they are also a thick slice of government administration preserved for more than 2,000 years, which is the kind of immortality I can 100% get behind. For many archaeologists and historians, this assemblage is as important as the terracotta warriors and mausoleum because every word lends new insight into how the First Emperor went about the business of governing his newly unified domain.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Who wants to live forever?

They\u2019re the heads of figurines. One is a soapstone cylindrical piece about two inches long with finely carved facial features. The striking eyes and long eyelashes or brows may suggest a female face. The other is the head of an animal of undetermined type (horse? dragon? dog? seahorse?) carved out of horn or antler. No remains of the figurines\u2019 bodies, likely made from an organic material or materials, have survived. </p>\n<p>Each were discovered in a child\u2019s grave. The burial itself was a simple commoner\u2019s grave, so these were not elite grave goods. (The elite were buried in large, well-appointed tumuli, a distinctly fancier setting than these inhumations.) The lack of symbols, carvings or any other indications of a ritual or religious significance suggests the carvings weren\u2019t talismans or charms to accompany the dead, but the beloved toys of an all too brief childhood. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Okunev culture is seen as having links to Native Americans \u2013 and this is not the first time their toys have been found. </p>\n<p>Indeed, the latest finds add to an intriguing collection. A figurine of a pagan god pulled out of a Siberian river by an angler was likely a child\u2019s toy or rattle to ward off evil spirits. It has almond-shaped eyes, a large mouth with full lips,  and a ferocious facial expression. On the back is \u2018plaited hair with wave like lines. Below the plait there are lines looking like fish scales.\u2019 </p>\n<p>Fisherman Nikolay Tarasov made \u2018the catch of a lifetime\u2019, said museum staff.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the time of its discovery archaeologists were less definitive about which culture may have created the rattle or idol. The Okunev weren\u2019t the only people in the area about 4,000 years ago. It also wasn\u2019t certain that it actually was a toy, even though the press ran with the idea that it was a child\u2019s rattle made to look fearsome. Many \u201coldest toy in the world looks like scary old fishgod!1\u201d headlines ensued. At least these two pieces were found in undisturbed children\u2019s graves in <a href=\"http://www.archeo.ru/polevye-raboty-1/copy2_of_annotacii-polevyh-otchetov-2017-goda/polyakov-a.v.-itkol-ii-2016/otchet-o-provedenii-v-2014-g.-raskopok-kurgana-no-22-mogilnika-itkol-ii-v-shirinskom-raione-i-kurgana-no-10-mogilnika-numahyr-v-ust-abakanskom-raione-respubliki-hakasiya\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an extensively explored</a> Okunev burial ground used by people of various social levels for centuries, so the speculation is a tad more grounded in archaeological context. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/soapstone-doll.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Soapstone dolly, ca. 4,500 years old.

An international team of archaeologists led by Dr. Engelbert Winter of the University of M\u00fcnster has <a href=\"http://www.sci-news.com/archaeology/doliche-clay-seals-05574.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unearthed more than 1,000 bullae or clay seal impressions</a> from Doliche\u2019s municipal archive.</p>\n<p>Doliche was renown throughout the Greek and Roman world for its shrine to Jupiter. Jupiter Dolichenus was a syncretic iteration, a composite of the original Hittite sky/storm god Tesub-Hadad with the Greco-Roman god of lightning Zeus/Jupiter, but the mystery religion spread widely after the Romans conquered the city in 64 B.C. and had adherents all over the empire, including the most desirable adherents a sanctuary might want, i.e., emperors. </p>\n<p>Dr. Winter and his team discovered evidence found more than 600 seals in the excavation of 2013. They were votive offerings made to the temple long before the Roman conquest \u2014 between the 7th and 4th centuries B.C.) which gave historians a rare chance to study the religious culture and imagery of the ancient city before the deity was absorbed into the Greco-Roman pantheon. The cache discovered this season is later in date (2nd-3rd centuries A.D.) and many pieces of it appear to be official administrative seals from the city archives. Their large size, their discovery in the city rather than the temple precinct and some inscriptions attest to their origin.</p>\n<p>Engelbert Winter on the significance of this major distinction:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Freshly-unearthed-seal-depicting-Jupiter-Dolichenus-shaking-hands-with-a-Roman-emperor.-Photo-by-Peter-J\u00fclich..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50031\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Freshly-unearthed-seal-depicting-Jupiter-Dolichenus-shaking-hands-with-a-Roman-emperor.-Photo-by-Peter-J\u00fclich.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Freshly-unearthed-seal-depicting-Jupiter-Dolichenus-shaking-hands-with-a-Roman-emperor.-Photo-by-Peter-J\u00fclich.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Freshly-unearthed-seal-depicting-Jupiter-Dolichenus-shaking-hands-with-a-Roman-emperor.-Photo-by-Peter-J\u00fclich.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Freshly-unearthed-seal-depicting-Jupiter-Dolichenus-shaking-hands-with-a-Roman-emperor.-Photo-by-Peter-J\u00fclich.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Freshly-unearthed-seal-depicting-Jupiter-Dolichenus-shaking-hands-with-a-Roman-emperor.-Photo-by-Peter-J\u00fclich.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Freshly unearthed seal depicting Jupiter Dolichenus shaking hands with a Roman emperor.

In the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, his cult spread into large parts of the Mediterranean world, extending as far as Britain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTherefore, it is not surprising that hundreds of documents were sealed with images showing a handshake between this deity and an emperor. It was a sign of the god\u2019s affinity to the Roman state.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mosaic-floor-of-late-antiquity-church-in-Doliche.-Photo-by-Research-Center-Asia-Minor..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50032\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mosaic-floor-of-late-antiquity-church-in-Doliche.-Photo-by-Research-Center-Asia-Minor.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mosaic-floor-of-late-antiquity-church-in-Doliche.-Photo-by-Research-Center-Asia-Minor.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mosaic-floor-of-late-antiquity-church-in-Doliche.-Photo-by-Research-Center-Asia-Minor.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mosaic-floor-of-late-antiquity-church-in-Doliche.-Photo-by-Research-Center-Asia-Minor.-768x510.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mosaic-floor-of-late-antiquity-church-in-Doliche.-Photo-by-Research-Center-Asia-Minor.-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mosaic-floor-of-late-antiquity-church-in-Doliche.-Photo-by-Research-Center-Asia-Minor..jpg 1500w\" title=\"Mosaic floor of late antiquity church in Doliche.

It\u2019s named after Richard de Billingford, who was the 5th Master of Corpus Christi College (founded in 1352), mastering it for an impressively long stint from 1398 until 1432. In 1420, he started the college\u2019s loan program, donating what was then the princely sum of \u00a320 as seed money to loan to scholars chronically low on cash. They could withdraw funds up to 40 shillings (ca. \u00a32) using their valuables (manuscripts, mainly) as collateral. The \u00a320 was kept in a locked chest under the vigilant eye of three custodians until a withdrawal was made. The books or other valuables the debtor was using as collateral were then placed in the chest until the establish repayment deadline. If the debtor did not manage to pay back the loan on time, his stuff was sold immediately and the sum owed returned to the chest. If the items sold for more the amount owed, that went into the chest too. The debtor got none of it.</p>\n<p>The university loan chest system was widely practiced in institutes of higher learning at that time. Billingford didn\u2019t invent it; he was the first to implement it at Corpus Christi is all. Other colleges at Cambridge had chests of their own, but most of the chest themselves are long lost. Corpus Christi still has their iron and oak ACME safe, and even more rarely, it has retained the registers that recorded the cash and collateral flow for more than three centuries. It\u2019s because of those registers that we know how frequently the loan chest was used and by whom. Every fellow and master at the college is listed as having borrowed from it, and while as you might expect manuscripts do dominate, what with them being academics and all, they also used precious religious objects, silver spoons and salt cellars.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Billingford-Hutch-lock-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50021\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Billingford-Hutch-lock-det-200x200.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Billingford-Hutch-lock-det-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Billingford-Hutch-lock-det-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Billingford-Hutch-lock-det-768x767.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Billingford-Hutch-lock-det-430x430.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of leaf decoration on the lock of the Billingford Hutch. Photo courtesy the Parker Library, Corpus Christi College.\" width=\"180\"/></a>The chest itself likely predates 1420, but we don\u2019t know its exact age. Nobody knew why the locks were decorated with images of an undetermined leaf either. <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/the-billingford-hutch-and-the-moonwort-fern-a-medieval-mystery-solved\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">That changed in September of this year</a> when the chest was moved to Parker Library and fell under the unblinking Sauron-like eye of one particular visitor. Check out this wonderfully nerdy chain of events:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jeremy Purseglove, environmentalist and Cambridge resident, visited the Library during Open Cambridge in September 2017. \u201cIt was a wonderful chance to get a glimpse of some of the Library\u2019s medieval manuscripts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were given a fascinating talk by Alexander Devine, one of the librarians. He showed us a massive chest that had recently been moved to the Library from elsewhere in the College. My eye was drawn to the leaf shapes in the metal work.\u201d</p>\n<p>The chest is made from oak planks and measures approximately 1.8m x 0.5m x 0.4m. It is reinforced by numerous iron bands and five iron hasps, secured in three locks, all operated by different keys. Each of the lock plates (the metal plates containing the locks, hasps and keyholes) is decorated with the outline of a plant punched into the metal.</p>\n<p>No-one knew the significance of this decorative detail. Purseglove, who is passionate about plants, suspected the distinctive shape was likely to be that of moonwort, a fern much mentioned by 16th-century herbalists. He said: \u201cI rushed home and looked it up. I found that it had been associated with the opening of locks and guarding of silver.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was such a strong association that herbalist Nicholas Culpepper wrote about it in his seminal 1653 volume <a href=\"http://www.bibliomania.com/2/1/66/113/21119/1/frameset.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Complete Herbal</em></a>. His description of the plant is as artfully rendered as the motif on the chest\u2019s iron fittings:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/illustrations-of-the-lunaria-plant-from-15th-century-Catalan-compilation-of-alchemical-tracts.-Photo-courtesy-Corpus-Christi-College.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50022\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 98px) 100vw, 98px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/illustrations-of-the-lunaria-plant-from-15th-century-Catalan-compilation-of-alchemical-tracts.-Photo-courtesy-Corpus-Christi-College-98x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/illustrations-of-the-lunaria-plant-from-15th-century-Catalan-compilation-of-alchemical-tracts.-Photo-courtesy-Corpus-Christi-College-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/illustrations-of-the-lunaria-plant-from-15th-century-Catalan-compilation-of-alchemical-tracts.-Photo-courtesy-Corpus-Christi-College-196x300.jpg 196w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/illustrations-of-the-lunaria-plant-from-15th-century-Catalan-compilation-of-alchemical-tracts.-Photo-courtesy-Corpus-Christi-College-768x1174.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/illustrations-of-the-lunaria-plant-from-15th-century-Catalan-compilation-of-alchemical-tracts.-Photo-courtesy-Corpus-Christi-College-430x657.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/illustrations-of-the-lunaria-plant-from-15th-century-Catalan-compilation-of-alchemical-tracts.-Photo-courtesy-Corpus-Christi-College.jpg 1340w\" title=\"Illustrations of the moonwort or lunaria plant from 15th-century Catalan compilation of alchemical tracts.

The stalks rise above this leaf two or three inches, bearing many branches of small long tongues, every one like the spiky head of the adder\u2019s tongue, of a brownish colour, (which, whether I shall call them flowers, or the seed, I well know not) which, after they have continued awhile, resolve into a mealy dust. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Governed by the celestial power of our satellite, moonwort leaves were reputedly an excellent tonic against menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge (if you\u2019ve ever read old medical books, and I have, you\u2019ll know that how to combat the scourge of \u201cthe whites\u201d was a huge subject of discussion for centuries), and another other unwanted emission of body fluid. Culpepper thought it was most effective in combination with other herbs to help heal wounds. He concludes his description with a reference to its vaunted lock-picking powers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Moonwort is an herb which (they say) will open locks, and unshoe such horses as tread upon it. This some laugh to scorn, and those no small fools neither; but country people, that I know, call it Unshoe the Horse. Besides I have heard commanders say, that on White Down in Devonshire, near Tiverton, there were found thirty horse shoes, pulled off from the feet of the Earl of Essex\u2019s horses, being there drawn up in a body, many of them being but newly shod, and no reason known, which caused much admiration: the herb described usually grows upon heaths.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hmmm\u2026Seems like it would be the opposite of something you\u2019d want guarding the locks on your cash and saleable goods. Oh well, can\u2019t argue with results, I suppose. The Billingford Hutch kept its secrets close for 500 years, first money and valuables, then information. </p>\n<blockquote><p>[Librarian Alexander] Devine said: \u201cThe Billingford Hutch is probably the best surviving example of its kind in Europe. To have a possible answer to the puzzle of its decorative motif is fantastic. We\u2019re immensely grateful to Jeremy for enriching our understanding of its history. His wonderful discovery is further proof that sharing your collections with the public is the key to unlocking their secrets.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Visitor identifies plant decorating medieval chest\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50019\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50019#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-50006\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50006\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Cremains of Roman soldiers found in cooking pots\">Cremains of Roman soldiers found in cooking pots</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, December 26th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1245619610.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-50010\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1245619610-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1245619610-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1245619610-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1245619610-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1245619610-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Monumental gate of Principia from the Roman legionary base at Legio.

The monumental base (it was around 330 yards by 550 in area) is the only permanent, full-scale legionary camp discovered in the eastern Roman Empire. There are several in mainland Europe and we know there were major bases elsewhere in the Levant and east \u2014 Jerusalem, or rather, Aelia Capitolina, built on the ruins of Jerusalem after Titus\u2019 razing of it in 70 A.D., had a large base \u2014 but they have yet to be found.</p>\n<p>The site is known as Legio (later Arabicized to Lajjun) after the camp built in the first half of the 2nd century A.D. and for more than a century was home to the formidable Legio VI Ferrata, meaning the Sixth Ironclad Legion. In the wake of the Bar Kochba Revolt (132-135 A.D.), the emperor Hadrian kept them in the Legio camp to guard the strategically important supply, transport and communication lines between the coast and Jezreel Valley.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-Legio-stamp.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-50015\" height=\"88\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-Legio-stamp-200x88.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-Legio-stamp-200x88.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-Legio-stamp-150x66.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-Legio-stamp-768x337.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-Legio-stamp-430x189.jpg 430w\" title=\"Roof tile bearing the stamp of the Sixth Legion Ferrata.

They were with Julius Caesar when he spanked Vercingetorix in Gaul, then with Marc Anthony and after his defeat in the Battle of Actium, they served under Octavian. The Ironclads were transferred from Syria to Judea just before the Bar Kochba Revolt and would remain there through most of the 3rd century. They were sent to the eastern frontier and Legio was dismantled by command of Diocletian at the end of the 3rd century. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-caligae-prints.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-50011\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-caligae-prints-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-caligae-prints-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-caligae-prints-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-caligae-prints-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tile-with-caligae-prints-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"A Roman tile from Legio, bearing the footprints from caligae, legionary sandals.

In 2013 and 2015, archaeologists unearthed numerous ceramic tiles stamped with the mark of the Legio VI Ferrata, and even stamped with the imprints of the hobnails from their caligae, the legionary\u2019s sandal that earned Caligula his nickname because he charmed the legions fighting under his father Germanicus when he wore a miniature pair as a little boy. They also found individual hobnails from those sandals, scales from Roman armour and the remains of infrastructure like clay pipes, sewer channels and buildings.</p>\n<p>This season\u2019s excavation was even more dramatic: they discovered the remains of a monumental gate that led to the base\u2019s the <em>principia</em>, the religious and military headquarters.  </p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Remains-of-monumental-gate-at-the-principia-entrance.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-50009\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Remains-of-monumental-gate-at-the-principia-entrance-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Remains-of-monumental-gate-at-the-principia-entrance-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Remains-of-monumental-gate-at-the-principia-entrance-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Remains-of-monumental-gate-at-the-principia-entrance-768x1023.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Remains-of-monumental-gate-at-the-principia-entrance-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Monumental gate of the Principia at the Roman legionary base at Legio.

As it has been a tad busy, I\u2019m going to keep it short with a little gift post in the form of pretty pictures. You might recall <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49700\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my recent article</a> about <em>The Portrait of Achille Deban de Laborde</em> (1817). As I was in the neighborhood visiting family, I popped into the Clark Art Institute to enjoy its exceptional collection of Winslow Homers, George Inneses, Renoirs, Monets, Sisleys, Alma-Tademas, Sargents, Renaissance Old Masters and about a thousand other art historical gems. </p>\n<p>I also made a special pilgrimage to the 18th century French portraiture room to see the youth in a replica of his father\u2019s Napoleonic uniform. He is just as sweet and soft-eyed as he looked in the official release pictures. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-frame.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49995\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-frame-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-frame-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-frame-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-frame-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-frame-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait of Achille Deban de Laborde with frame and information plaque.\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Medal-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49997\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Medal-det-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Medal-det-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Medal-det-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Medal-det-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Medal-det-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Medal detail.\" width=\"200\"/></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-left.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49998\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-left-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-left-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-left-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-left-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-left-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait of Achille from the left to reduce glare.\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-right.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-49996\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-right-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-right-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-right-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-right-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Portrait-of-Achille-right-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Portrait of Achille from the right.\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>In that same gallery is a painting by Louis-L\u00e9opold Boiully, a portraitist and genre artist who was highly celebrated in his time and managed to thrive from the ancien regime all the way through to the July Monarchy, although he did have a little less than pleasant moment with the Committee of Public Safety over the erotic undertone of his paintings which would have cost him his life had it not been for the discovery of a properly propagandistic <em>Le triomphe de Marat</em> (1794) in his studio. The genre paintings capture scenes of French society, street life and current events. Most of his portraits were of middle class people and celebrities, including Robespierre. </p>\n<p>The painting in the Clark, however, is not a portrait, even though it\u2019s in the portrait gallery. It is a trompe l\u2019oeil from 1785 called, appropriately, <em>Various Objects</em>. It depicts what looks like a pinboard with letters, a nosegay of pansies, a black and white drawing, a glass bottle hanging from a string, a leather pouch, scissors, a switchblade and a drawing compass. I think it\u2019s pretty great, and appreciate it all the more because it was Boiully who coined the phrase \u201ctrompe l\u2019oeil.\u201d</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Various-objects.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-49999\" height=\"573\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Various-objects-430x573.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Various-objects-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Various-objects-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Various-objects-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Various-objects-768x1024.jpg 768w\" title=\"Various objects by Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly, ca. 1785.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Happy holidays, everyone!</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"A little gift\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49991\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49991#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-49982\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/49982\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Roman coin hoard, lead coffin found by veteran\u2019s group\">Roman coin hoard, lead coffin found by veteran\u2019s group</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, December 24th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bronze-coin-hoard.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49988\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bronze-coin-hoard-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bronze-coin-hoard-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bronze-coin-hoard-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bronze-coin-hoard-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bronze-coin-hoard-430x242.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bronze-coin-hoard.jpg 976w\" title=\"Bronze coin hoard.

Detecting for Veterans assembled in an Ilminster field (the exact location is not being disclosed for its protection) this year for its annual Christmas charity dig in aid of <a href=\"http://www.veteranscharity.org.uk/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Veterans Charity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.talking2minds.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Talking2Minds</a>. Member Kevin Minto made the first modest finds \u2014 a button, a fragment of lead \u2014 and then hit the jackpot when he found a Roman coin. </p>\n<p>Being a responsible and conscientious metal detecting enthusiast, the group founder, former 1st Battalion Light Infantry Veteran, Jason Massey immediately called the county Finds Liaison Officer to determine how to proceed without harming the archaeological context. He was told an archaeological team would be on the way, but to continue to detect and dig, but to be cautious and document everything he found.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Edge-of-coffin.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-49987\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Edge-of-coffin-169x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Edge-of-coffin-169x300.jpg 169w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Edge-of-coffin-84x150.jpg 84w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Edge-of-coffin-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Edge-of-coffin-430x765.jpg 430w\" title=\"Lead coffin emerges.

They were then joined by the Somerset County archaeologist Bob Croft and discovered the Roman grave site. The lead coffin dates to around 400 A.D. and archaeologists believe it a young woman\u2019s coffin. This is an extremely rare find; just six lead-lined Roman coffins have been discovered in Somerset.

The building, a grand historical treasure in its own right, is in dire need of upgrades, especially systems. Most urgent is the air conditioning system which doesn\u2019t need upgrading because it doesn\u2019t actually exist. The museum gets hot in the summer and the body heat and moisture from visitors exacerbates the problem, putting the delicate objects on display at risk. </p>\n<p>The three-phase renovation will create a new exhibition space with state-of-the art climate control technology and 6,000 square feet in which to showcase the Penn Museum\u2019s stellar Near East collection. A pioneer in the field of Middle Eastern archaeology, the Penn Museum was the first in the country to send a team to explore Mesopotamian sites in 1887. They\u2019ve been back hundreds of times since and collected more than 100,000 objects, making the Penn Museum\u2019s Near East collection one of the greatest in the world. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Puabi-headdress.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-49974\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Puabi-headdress-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Puabi-headdress-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Puabi-headdress-198x300.jpg 198w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Puabi-headdress-768x1165.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Puabi-headdress-430x653.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Puabi-headdress.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Queen Puabi headdress.

The breadth of the collection allows the Penn Museum to tell the story of how Mesopotamia moved from villages to large cities with massive populations and an unparalleled collection of wealth. Front and center in the new Middle East Galleries will be one of the museum\u2019s most unusual Sumerian objects: a footprint left in a piece of wet mud brick in Ur 4,000 years ago. One of the world\u2019s oldest wine vessels will be on display (a Neolithic pot discovered at Hajji Firuz Tepe, Iran, that dates to around 5400 B.C.), a baby rattle, a writing primer for children and many more objects that will give visitors a view into daily life from writing and record-keeping to agriculture, labour, meal preparation and burial practices over 10,000 years of Mesopotamian history.</p>\n<p>The Middle East Galleries will take pride of place in the renovated museum, right next to the entrance hall.

It\u2019s not rare that some random object would be attributed to a hero of Troy \u2014 that kind of faux relic was venerated in temples for hundreds of years \u2014 but very few of them have survived in any recognizable form. </p>\n<p>This archaeological bonanza was the hard-won result of three months of painstaking investigative work and surveillance of key suspects. Operation Zeus switched from tracking mode to busting on December 12th when six men in northwestern Turkey\u2019s Duzce province were arrested in the course of attempting to sell some of the trafficked artifacts. They were interrogated and named names leading to more arrests in four other provinces. </p>\n<p>Police haven\u2019t been to determine how such a vast number of high quality artifacts were acquired or where they came from, but we know they were intended to be sold on the black market through art dealers and shady outfits in multiple countries. Investigations are ongoing. The objects will be given to the Istanbul Museum of Archaeology for further study and conservation.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Some-of-the-seized-artifacts.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-49962\" height=\"323\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Some-of-the-seized-artifacts-430x323.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Some-of-the-seized-artifacts-430x323.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Some-of-the-seized-artifacts-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Some-of-the-seized-artifacts-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Some-of-the-seized-artifacts-768x576.jpg 768w\" title=\"Anatolian, Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Hittite and Mycenean artifacts seized by Turkish police in an operation against smugglers are displayed at the police headquarters in Istanbul.

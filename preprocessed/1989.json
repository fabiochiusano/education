{"content": "A UK parliamentary committee which has been running a multi-month investigation into the impact of online disinformation on political campaigning \u2014 and on democracy itself \u2014 has published a preliminary report highlighting what it describes as \u201csignificant concerns\u201d over the risks to \u201cshared values and the integrity of our democratic institutions\u201d. It\u2019s calling for \u201curgent action\u201d from government and regulatory bodies to \u201cbuild resilience against misinformation and disinformation into our democratic system\u201d. \u201cWe are faced with a crisis concerning the use of data, the manipulation of our data, and the targeting of pernicious views,\u201d the DCMS committee warns. \u201cIn particular, we heard evidence of Russian state-sponsored attempts to influence elections in the US and the UK through social media, of the efforts of private companies to do the same, and of law-breaking by certain Leave campaign groups in the UK\u2019s EU Referendum in their use of social media.\u201d The inquiry, which was conceived of and begun in the previous UK parliament \u2014 before relaunching in fall 2017, after the June General Election \u2014 has found itself slap-bang in the middle of one of the major scandals of the modern era, as revelations about the extent of disinformation and social media data misuse and allegations of election fiddling and law bending have piled up thick and fast , especially in recent months \u00a0(albeit, concerns have been rising steadily, ever since the 2016 US presidential election and revelations about the cottage industry of fake news purveyors spun up to feed US voters, in addition to Kremlin troll farm activity.) Yet the Facebook- Cambridge Analytica data misuse saga (which snowballed into a major global scandal this March) is just one of the strands of the committee\u2019s inquiry. Hence they\u2019ve opted to publish multiple reports \u2014 the initial one recommending urgent actions for the government and regulators, which will be followed by another report covering the inquiry\u2019s \u201cwider terms of reference\u201d and including a closer look at the role of advertising. (The latter report is slated to land in the fall.) For now, the committee is suggesting\u00a0 \u201cprinciple-based recommendations\u201d designed to be\u00a0 \u201csufficiently adaptive to deal with fast-moving technological developments\u201d.\u00a0 Among a very long list of recommendations are: How the government will respond to the committee\u2019s laundry list of recommendations for cleaning up online political advertising remains to be seen, although the issue of Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns was at least\u00a0 raised publicly by the prime minister last year . Although Theresa May has been rather quieter on revelations about EU referendum-related data misuse and election law breaches. While the committee uses the term \u201ctech companies\u201d throughout its report to refer to multiple companies, Facebook specifically comes in for some excoriating criticism, with the committee accusing the company of misleading by omission and actively seeking to impede the progress of the inquiry. It also reiterates its call \u2014 for something like the fifth time at this point \u2014 for founder Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence. Facebook has provided several witnesses to the committee, including its CTO , but Zuckerberg has declined its requests he appear, even via video link. (And even though he did find time for a couple of hours in front of the EU parliament back in May .) The committee writes: We undertook fifteen exchanges of correspondence with Facebook, and two oral evidence sessions, in an attempt to elicit some of the information that they held, including information regarding users\u2019 data, foreign interference and details of the so-called \u2018dark ads\u2019 that had reached Facebook users.\u00a0 Facebook consistently responded to questions by giving the minimal amount of information possible, and routinely failed to offer information relevant to the inquiry, unless it had been expressly asked for. It provided witnesses who have been unwilling or unable to give full answers to the Committee\u2019s questions. This is the reason why the Committee has continued to press for Mark Zuckerberg to appear as a witness as, by his own admission, he is the person who decides what happens at Facebook. \u2026 Tech companies are \u00a0not passive platforms on which users input content; they reward \u00a0what is most engaging, because engagement is part of their \u00a0business model and their growth strategy. They have profited greatly \u00a0by using this model. This manipulation of the sites by \u00a0tech companies must be made more transparent. Facebook has all \u00a0of the information. Those outside of the company have none \u00a0of it, unless Facebook chooses to release it. Facebook was \u00a0reluctant to share information with the Committee, which does not \u00a0bode well for future transparency . We ask, once more, for \u00a0Mr Zuckerberg to come to the Committee to answer the \u00a0many outstanding questions to which Facebook has not responded adequately , to date. The committee suggests that the UK\u2019s Defamation Act 2013 means Facebook and other social media \u00a0companies have a duty to publish and to follow transparent \u00a0rules \u2014 arguing that the Act has provisions which state that \u201cif \u00a0a user is defamed on social media, and the offending \u00a0individual cannot be identified, the liability rests with the platform\u201d . \u201cWe urge the government to examine the effectiveness of these \u00a0provisions, and to monitor tech companies to ensure they are \u00a0complying with court orders in the UK and to provide \u00a0details of the source of disputed content\u2013 including advertisements \u2014 to \u00a0ensure that they are operating in accordance with the law , or any future industry Codes of Ethics or Conduct. Tech \u00a0companies also have a responsibility to ensure full disclosure of \u00a0the source of any political advertising they carry,\u201d it adds. The committee is especially damning of Facebook\u2019s actions in Burma (as indeed many others have also been ), condemning the company\u2019s failure to prevent its platform from being used to spread hate and fuel violence against the\u00a0Rohingya ethnic minority \u2014 and citing the UN\u2019s similarly damning assessment . \u201cFacebook has hampered our efforts to get information about their company throughout this inquiry. It is as if it thinks that the problem will go away if it does not share information about the problem, and reacts only when it is pressed. Time and again we heard from Facebook about mistakes being made and then (sometimes) rectified, rather than designing the product ethically from the beginning of the process. Facebook has a \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019, which highlights the principles by which Facebook staff carry out their work, and states that employees are expected to \u201cact lawfully, honestly, ethically, and in the best interests of the company while performing duties on behalf of Facebook\u201d.\u00a0 Facebook has fallen well below this standard in Burma,\u201d it argues. The committee also directly blames Facebook\u2019s actions for undermining the UK\u2019s international aid efforts in the country \u2014 writing: The United Nations has named Facebook as being responsible for inciting hatred against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma, through its \u2018Free Basics\u2019 service. It provides people free mobile phone access without data charges, but is also responsible for the spread disinformation and propaganda. The CTO of Facebook, Mike Schroepfer described the situation in Burma as \u201cawful\u201d, yet Facebook cannot show us that it has done anything to stop the spread of disinformation against the Rohingya minority. The hate speech\u00a0against the Rohingya\u2014built up on Facebook, much of which\u00a0is disseminated through fake accounts\u2014and subsequent ethnic cleansing, has\u00a0potentially resulted in the success of DFID\u2019s [the UK Department for International Development] aid programmes\u00a0being greatly reduced, based on the qualifications they set for success. The activity of Facebook undermines international aid to Burma, including the UK Government\u2019s work. Facebook is releasing a\u00a0product that is dangerous to consumers and deeply unethical. We\u00a0urge the Government to demonstrate how seriously it takes Facebook\u2019s apparent collusion in spreading disinformation in Burma, at the\u00a0earliest opportunity. This is a further example of Facebook failing\u00a0to take responsibility for the misuse of its platform. We reached out to Facebook for a response to the committee\u2019s report, and in an email statement \u2014 attributed to Richard Allan, VP policy \u2014 the company told us: The Committee has raised some important issues and we were pleased to be able to contribute to their work. We share their goal of ensuring that political advertising is fair and transparent and agree that electoral rule changes are needed. We have already made all advertising on Facebook more transparent. We provide more information on the Pages behind any ad and you can now see all the ads any Facebook Page is running, even if they are not targeted at you. We are working on ways to authenticate and label political ads in the UK and create an archive of those ads that anyone can search. We will work closely with the UK Government and Electoral Commission as we develop these new transparency tools. We\u2019re also investing heavily in both people and technology to keep bad content off our services. We took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts globally in the first quarter of 2018 \u2014 much of it before anyone needed to report this to Facebook. By using technology like machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision, we can detect more bad content and take action more quickly. The statement makes no mention of Burma. Nor indeed of the committee\u2019s suggestion that social media firms should be taxed to pay for defending democracy and civil society against the damaging excesses of their tools. On Thursday , rolling out its latest ads transparency features, Facebook announced that users could now\u00a0see the ads a Page is running across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and its partner network \u201ceven if those ads aren\u2019t shown to you\u201d. To do so, users have to log into Facebook, visit any Page and select \u201cInfo and Ads\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll see ad creative and copy, and you can flag anything suspicious by clicking on \u2018Report Ad\u2019,\u201d it added. It also flagged a \u2018more Page information\u2019 feature that users can use to get more details about a Page such as recent name changes and the date it was created. \u201cThe vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organizations \u2014 whether it\u2019s a small business looking for new customers, an advocacy group raising money for their cause, or a politician running for office. But we\u2019ve seen that bad actors can misuse our products, too,\u201d Facebook wrote, adding that the features being announced \u201care just the start\u201d of its efforts \u201cto improve\u201d and \u201croot out abuse\u201d. Europe needs it's own Mueller, to investigate the extent of Russian disinformation campaigns & other attacks on our democracies. In September I will push the Eur Parliament to such measures to clean up our internet & social media. It's time to fight back! /C4Gby6gJ1O \u2014 Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) July 29, 2018 The committee\u2019s\u00a0 interim report \u00a0was pushed out at the weekend ahead of the original embargo as a result of yet more Brexiteer-induced drama \u2014 after the campaign director of the UK\u2019s official Brexit supporting \u2018Vote Leave\u2019 campaign, Dominic Cummings, deliberately broke the embargo by publishing the report on his blog in order to spin his own response before the report had been widely covered by the media. Cummings blog on DCMS report \u2013 and his explanatory gloss /HfmK1VkdRa pic.twitter.com/pEMBXIouTd \u2014 Robert Peston (@Peston) July 27, 2018 Last week the Electoral Commission published its own \u00a0report following a multi-month investigation into Brexit campaign spending. The oversight body concluded that Vote Leave broke UK electoral law by massively overspending via a joint working arrangement with another Brexit supporting campaign (BeLeave) \u2014 an arrangement via which an additional almost half a million pound\u2019s worth of targeted Facebook ads were co-ordinated by Vote Leave in the final days of the campaign when it had already reached its spending limit (Facebook finally released some of the 2016 Brexit campaign ads \u00a0that had been microtargeted at UK voters via its platform to the committee, which published these ads last week. Many of Vote Leave\u2019s (up to that point \u2018dark\u2019) adverts show the official Brexit campaign generating fake news of its own with ads that, for example, claim Turkey is on the cusp of joining the EU and flooding the UK with millions of migrants; or spreading the widely debunked claim that the UK would be able to spend \u00a3350M more per week on the NHS if it left the EU. In general, dog whistle racism appears to have been Vote Leave\u2019s preferred \u2018persuasion\u2019 tactic of microtargeted ad choice \u2014 and thanks to Facebook\u2019s ad platform, no one other than each ad\u2019s chosen recipients would have been likely to see the messages. Cummings also comes in for a major roasting in the committee\u2019s report after his failure to appear before it to answer questions, despite multiple summons (including an unprecedented House of Commons motion ordering him to appear \u2014 which he nonetheless also ignored). \u201cMr Cummings\u2019 contemptuous behaviour is unprecedented in the history of this Committee\u2019s inquiries and underlines concerns about the difficulties of enforcing co-operation with Parliamentary scrutiny in the modern age,\u201d it writes, adding: \u201cWe will return to this issue in our Report in the autumn, and believe it to be an urgent matter for consideration by the Privileges Committee and by Parliament as a whole.\u201d On his blog, Cummings claims the committee offered him dates they knew he couldn\u2019t do; slams its investigation as \u2018fake news\u2019; moans copiously that the committee is made up of Remain supporting MPs; and argues that the investigation should be under oath \u2014 as his major defense seems to be that key campaign whistleblowers are lying (despite ex-Cambridge Analytica employee Chris Wylie and ex-BeLeave treasurer Shahmir Sanni having provided copious amounts of documentary evidence to back up their claims; evidence which both the Electoral Commission and the UK\u2019s data watchdog, the ICO, have found convincing enough to announce some of the largest fines they can issue \u2014 in the latter case, the ICO announced its intention to fine Facebook the maximum penalty possible \u00a0(under the prior UK data protection regime) for failing to protect users\u2019 information. The data watchdog is continuing to investigate multiple aspects of what is a hugely complex (technically and politically) online ad ops story, and earlier this month commissioner Elizabeth Denham called for an \u2018ethical pause\u2019 on the use of online ad platforms for microtargeting voters with political messages, arguing \u2014 as the DCMS committee is \u2014 that there are very real and very stark risks for democratic processes. There\u2019s much, much more self-piteous whining on Cummings blog for anyone who wants to make themselves queasy reading. But do also bear in mind the Electoral Commission\u2019s withering criticism of the Vote Leave campaign, specifically \u2014 for not so much a failure to co-operate with its investigation but for intentional obstruction.

Hence they\u2019ve opted to publish multiple reports \u2014 the initial one recommending urgent actions for the government and regulators, which will be followed by another report covering the inquiry\u2019s \u201cwider terms of reference\u201d and including a closer look at the role of advertising. (The latter report is slated to land in the fall.)</p>\n<p>For now, the committee is suggesting\u00a0<span class=\"Recommendation\">\u201cprinciple-based recommendations\u201d designed to be\u00a0</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">\u201csufficiently adaptive to deal with fast-moving technological developments\u201d.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Among a very long list of recommendations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a <strong>levy on social media and tech giants</strong> to fund expanding a \u201cmajor investment\u201d in the UK\u2019s data watchdog so the body is able to \u201c<span class=\"Recommendation\">attract and employ more technically</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">-skilled engineers who not only can analyse current technologies, but</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">\u00a0have the capacity to predict future technologies\u201d \u2014 with the tech company levy operating</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">\u00a0in \u201ca similar vein</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">\u00a0to the way in which the banking sector pays for</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">\u00a0the upkeep of the Financial Conduct Authority\u201d. Additionally, the committee also wants the government put forward proposals for an educational levy to be raised by social media\u00a0companies, \u201cto finance a comprehensive educational framework (developed by charities\u00a0and non-governmental organisations) and based online\u201d. \u201cDigital literacy should\u00a0be the fourth pillar of education, alongside reading, writing and\u00a0maths,\u201d the committee writes. \u201cThe DCMS Department should co-ordinate with the Department\u00a0for Education, in highlighting proposals to include digital literacy, as\u00a0part of the Physical, Social, Health and Economic curriculum (PSHE).\u00a0The social media educational levy should be used, in part,\u00a0by the government, to finance this additional part of the\u00a0curriculum.<span class=\"No-break\">\u201d It also wants to see a rolling unified public awareness\u00a0initiative, part-funded by a tech company levy,\u00a0to \u201cset the\u00a0context of social media content, explain to people what their\u00a0rights over their data are\u2026\u00a0and set out ways in which people can interact\u00a0with political campaigning on social media. \u201cThe public should be made more aware of their ability to report digital campaigning that they think is misleading, or unlawful,\u201d it adds</span></span></li>\n<li><strong>amendments to UK Electoral Law</strong> to reflect use of new technologies \u2014 with the committee backing the Electoral Commission\u2019s suggestion that \u201c<span class=\"Recommendation\">all\u00a0</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">electronic campaigning should have easily accessible digital imprint requirements, including\u00a0</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">information on the publishing organisation and who is legally responsible\u00a0</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">for the spending, so that it is obvious at a\u00a0</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">glance who has sponsored that campaigning material, thereby bringing all\u00a0</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">online advertisements and messages into line with physically published leaflets,\u00a0</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">circulars and advertisements\u201d.

The Government should provide the\u00a0appropriate body with the power to audit these companies, including\u00a0algorithmic auditing, and we reiterate the point that the ICO\u2019s powers should be substantially strengthened in these respects\u201d. The committee also floats the idea that the Competition and Markets Authority considers conducting an audit of the operation of the advertising market\u00a0on social media (given the risk of fake accounts leading to ad fraud)</li>\n<li>a requirement for <strong>tech companies to make full disclosure of targeting used as part of\u00a0advert transparency</strong>.

Although Theresa May has been rather quieter on revelations about EU referendum-related data misuse and election law breaches.</p>\n<p>While the committee uses the term \u201ctech companies\u201d throughout its report to refer to multiple companies, Facebook specifically comes in for some excoriating criticism, with the committee accusing the company of misleading by omission and actively seeking to impede the progress of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>It also reiterates its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/uk-parliaments-call-for-zuckerberg-to-testify-goes-next-level/\">call</a> \u2014 for something like the fifth time at this point \u2014 for founder Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence.

It provided witnesses who have been unwilling or unable to give full answers to the Committee\u2019s questions.

It is as if it thinks that the problem will go away if it does not share information about the problem, and reacts only when it is pressed. Time and again we heard from Facebook about mistakes being made and then (sometimes) rectified, rather than designing the product ethically from the beginning of the process. Facebook has a \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019, which highlights the principles by which Facebook staff carry out their work, and states that employees are expected to \u201cact lawfully, honestly, ethically, and in the best interests of the company while performing duties on behalf of Facebook\u201d.\u00a0<span id=\"footnote-221-backlink\"></span>Facebook has fallen well below this standard in Burma,\u201d it argues.</p>\n<p>The committee also directly blames Facebook\u2019s actions for undermining the UK\u2019s international aid efforts in the country \u2014 writing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"CRPara1\">The <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"united-nations\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/united-nations\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has named Facebook as being responsible for inciting hatred against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma, through its \u2018Free Basics\u2019 service. It provides people free mobile phone access without data charges, but is also responsible for the spread disinformation and propaganda. The CTO of Facebook, Mike Schroepfer described the situation in Burma as \u201cawful\u201d, yet Facebook cannot show us that it has done anything to stop the spread of disinformation against the Rohingya minority.</p>\n<p class=\"CRPara1\">The hate speech\u00a0against the Rohingya\u2014built up on Facebook, much of which\u00a0is disseminated through fake accounts\u2014and subsequent ethnic cleansing, has\u00a0potentially resulted in the success of DFID\u2019s [the UK Department for International Development] aid programmes\u00a0being greatly reduced, based on the qualifications they set for success. The activity of Facebook undermines international aid to Burma, including the UK Government\u2019s work. Facebook is releasing a\u00a0product that is dangerous to consumers and deeply unethical. We\u00a0urge the Government to demonstrate how seriously it takes Facebook\u2019s apparent collusion in spreading disinformation in Burma, at the\u00a0earliest opportunity. This is a further example of Facebook failing\u00a0to take responsibility for the misuse of its platform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We reached out to Facebook for a response to the committee\u2019s report, and in an email statement \u2014 attributed to Richard Allan, VP policy \u2014 the company told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Committee has raised some important issues and we were pleased to be able to contribute to their work.</p>\n<p>We share their goal of ensuring that political advertising is fair and transparent and agree that electoral rule changes are needed. We have already made all advertising on Facebook more transparent. We provide more information on the Pages behind any ad and you can now see all the ads any Facebook Page is running, even if they are not targeted at you. We are working on ways to authenticate and label political ads in the UK and create an archive of those ads that anyone can search. We will work closely with the UK Government and Electoral Commission as we develop these new transparency tools.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re also investing heavily in both people and technology to keep bad content off our services. We took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts globally in the first quarter of 2018 \u2014 much of it before anyone needed to report this to Facebook. By using technology like machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision, we can detect more bad content and take action more quickly.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The statement makes no mention of Burma. Nor indeed of the committee\u2019s suggestion that social media firms should be taxed to pay for defending democracy and civil society against the damaging excesses of their tools.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/transparency-for-ads-and-pages/\">Thursday</a>, rolling out its latest ads transparency features, Facebook announced that users could now\u00a0see the ads a Page is running across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and its partner network \u201ceven if those ads aren\u2019t shown to you\u201d.</p>\n<p>To do so, users have to log into Facebook, visit any Page and select \u201cInfo and Ads\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll see ad creative and copy, and you can flag anything suspicious by clicking on \u2018Report Ad\u2019,\u201d it added.</p>\n<p>It also flagged a \u2018more Page information\u2019 feature that users can use to get more details about a Page such as recent name changes and the date it was created.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organizations \u2014 whether it\u2019s a small business looking for new customers, an advocacy group raising money for their cause, or a politician running for office.

The oversight body concluded that Vote Leave broke UK electoral law by massively overspending via a joint working arrangement with another Brexit supporting campaign (BeLeave) \u2014 an arrangement via which an additional almost half a million pound\u2019s worth of targeted Facebook ads were co-ordinated by Vote Leave in the final days of the campaign when it had already reached its spending limit (Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/facebook-finally-hands-over-leave-campaign-brexit-ads/\">finally released some of the 2016 Brexit campaign ads</a>\u00a0that had been microtargeted at UK voters via its platform to the committee, which published these ads last week. Many of Vote Leave\u2019s (up to that point \u2018dark\u2019) adverts show the official Brexit campaign generating fake news of its own with ads that, for example, claim Turkey is on the cusp of joining the EU and flooding the UK with millions of migrants; or spreading the widely debunked claim that the UK would be able to spend \u00a3350M more per week on the NHS if it left the EU.</p>\n<p>In general, dog whistle racism appears to have been Vote Leave\u2019s preferred \u2018persuasion\u2019 tactic of microtargeted ad choice \u2014 and thanks to Facebook\u2019s ad platform, no one other than each ad\u2019s chosen recipients would have been likely to see the messages.</p>\n<p>Cummings also comes in for a major roasting in the committee\u2019s report after his failure to appear before it to answer questions, despite multiple summons (including an unprecedented House of Commons motion ordering him to appear \u2014 which he nonetheless also ignored).</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Cummings\u2019 contemptuous behaviour is unprecedented in the history of this Committee\u2019s inquiries and underlines concerns about the difficulties of enforcing co-operation with Parliamentary scrutiny in the modern age,\u201d it writes, adding: \u201cWe will return to this issue in our Report in the autumn, and believe it to be an urgent matter for consideration by the Privileges Committee and by Parliament as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p>On his blog, Cummings claims the committee offered him dates they knew he couldn\u2019t do; slams its investigation as \u2018fake news\u2019; moans copiously that the committee is made up of Remain supporting MPs; and argues that the investigation should be under oath \u2014 as his major defense seems to be that key campaign whistleblowers are lying (despite ex-Cambridge Analytica employee <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"chris-wylie\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/chris-wylie\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Wylie <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and ex-BeLeave treasurer Shahmir Sanni having provided copious amounts of documentary evidence to back up their claims; evidence which both the Electoral Commission and the UK\u2019s data watchdog, the ICO, have found convincing enough to announce some of the largest fines they can issue \u2014 in the latter case, the ICO announced its intention to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/uks-information-commissioner-will-fine-facebook-the-maximum-500k-over-cambridge-analytica-breach/\">fine Facebook the maximum penalty possible</a>\u00a0(under the prior UK data protection regime) for failing to protect users\u2019 information. The data watchdog is continuing to investigate multiple aspects of what is a hugely complex (technically and politically) online ad ops story, and earlier this month commissioner Elizabeth Denham <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/\">called for an \u2018ethical pause\u2019</a> on the use of online ad platforms for microtargeting voters with political messages, arguing \u2014 as the DCMS committee is \u2014 that there are very real and very stark risks for democratic processes.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s much, much more self-piteous whining on Cummings blog for anyone who wants to make themselves queasy reading. But do also bear in mind the Electoral Commission\u2019s withering criticism of the Vote Leave campaign, specifically \u2014 for not so much a failure to co-operate with its investigation but for intentional obstruction.

investigation into the impact of online disinformation on political campaigning &#8212; and on democracy itself &#8212; has published a preliminary <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/publications.parliament.uk\\/pa\\/cm201719\\/cmselect\\/cmcumeds\\/363\\/36302.htm\\\">report<\\/a> highlighting what it describes as &#8220;significant concerns&#8221; over the risks to &#8220;shared values and the integrity of our democratic institutions&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s calling for &#8220;urgent action&#8221; from government and regulatory bodies to &#8220;build resilience against misinformation and disinformation into our democratic system&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We are faced with a crisis concerning the use of data, the manipulation of our data, and the targeting of pernicious views,&#8221; the DCMS committee warns. &#8220;In particular, we heard evidence of Russian state-sponsored attempts to influence elections in the US and the UK through social media, of the efforts of private companies to do the same, and of law-breaking by certain Leave campaign groups in the UK\\u2019s EU Referendum in their use of social media.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The inquiry, which was conceived of and begun in the previous UK parliament &#8212; before relaunching in fall 2017, after the June General Election &#8212; has found itself slap-bang in the middle of one of the major scandals of the modern era, as revelations about the extent of disinformation and social media data misuse and allegations of election fiddling and law bending have piled up <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2017\\/10\\/30\\/russian-backed-content-may-have-reached-126-million-on-facebook\\/\\\">thick<\\/a> and <a

Hence they&#8217;ve opted to publish multiple reports &#8212; the initial one recommending urgent actions for the government and regulators, which will be followed by another report covering the inquiry&#8217;s &#8220;wider terms of reference&#8221; and including a closer look at the role of advertising. (The latter report is slated to land in the fall.)<\\/p>\\n<p>For now, the committee is suggesting\\u00a0<span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">&#8220;principle-based recommendations&#8221; designed to be\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">&#8220;sufficiently adaptive to deal with fast-moving technological developments&#8221;.\\u00a0<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p>Among a very long list of recommendations are:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>a <strong>levy on social media and tech giants<\\/strong> to fund expanding a &#8220;major investment&#8221; in the UK&#8217;s data watchdog so the body is able to &#8220;<span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">attract and employ more technically<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">-skilled engineers who not only can analyse current technologies, but<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0have the capacity to predict future technologies&#8221; &#8212; with the tech company levy operating<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0in &#8220;a similar vein<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0to the way in which the banking sector pays for<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0the upkeep of the Financial Conduct Authority&#8221;. Additionally, the committee also wants the government put forward proposals for an educational levy to be raised by social media\\u00a0companies, &#8220;to finance a comprehensive educational framework (developed by charities\\u00a0and non-governmental organisations) and based online&#8221;. &#8220;Digital literacy should\\u00a0be the fourth pillar of education, alongside reading, writing and\\u00a0maths,&#8221; the committee writes. &#8220;The DCMS Department should co-ordinate with the Department\\u00a0for Education, in highlighting proposals to include digital literacy, as\\u00a0part of the Physical, Social, Health and Economic curriculum (PSHE).\\u00a0The social media educational levy should be used, in part,\\u00a0by the government, to finance this additional part of the\\u00a0curriculum.<span class=\\\"No-break\\\">&#8221; It also wants to see a rolling unified public awareness\\u00a0initiative, part-funded by a tech company levy,\\u00a0to &#8220;set the\\u00a0context of social media content, explain to people what their\\u00a0rights over their data are&#8230;\\u00a0and set out ways in which people can interact\\u00a0with political campaigning on social media. &#8220;The public should be made more aware of their ability to report digital campaigning that they think is misleading, or unlawful,&#8221; it adds<\\/span><\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li><strong>amendments to UK Electoral Law<\\/strong> to reflect use of new technologies &#8212; with the committee backing the Electoral Commission&#8217;s suggestion that &#8220;<span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">all\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">electronic campaigning should have easily accessible digital imprint requirements, including\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">information on the publishing organisation and who is legally responsible\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">for the spending, so that it is obvious at a\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">glance who has sponsored that campaigning material, thereby bringing all\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">online advertisements and messages into line with physically published leaflets,\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">circulars and advertisements&#8221;. It also suggests government should &#8220;consider the feasibility of clear, persistent banners\\u00a0on all paid-for political adverts and videos, indicating the\\u00a0source and making it easy for users to identify what\\u00a0is in the adverts, and who the advertiser is&#8221;. And urges the government to<\\/span>\\u00a0carry out &#8220;a comprehensive review\\u00a0<span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">of the current rules and regulations surrounding political work during\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">elections and referenda, including: increasing the length of the regulated\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">period; definitions of what constitutes political campaigning; absolute transparency of\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">online political campaigning; a category introduced for digital spending on\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">campaigns; reducing the time for spending returns to be sent\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">to the Electoral Commission (the current time for large political\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">organisations is six months)&#8221;. <\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">the Electoral Commission to establish\\u00a0<strong><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">a code for advertising\\u00a0<\\/span><\\/strong><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\"><strong>through social media during election periods<\\/strong> &#8220;giving consideration to whether\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">such activity should be restricted during the regulated period, to\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">political organisations or campaigns that have registered with the Commission&#8221;. It also urges the Commission to propose &#8220;more stringent requirements\\u00a0for major donors to demonstrate the source of their donations&#8221;, and backs its suggestion of a change in the rules covering political spending so\\u00a0that limits are put on the amount of money an\\u00a0individual can donate<\\/span><\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li>a <strong>major increase in the maximum fine<\\/strong>\\u00a0<strong>that can be levied by the Electoral Commission<\\/strong> (currently just \\u00a320,000) &#8212;<span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0saying this should rather be based on a fixed\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">percentage of turnover. It also suggests the body<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0should have the ability to\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">refer matters to the Crown Prosecution Service, before their investigations\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">have been completed; and urges the government to consider giving it the power to compel organisations that it\\u00a0does not specifically regulate, including tech companies and individuals, to\\u00a0provide information relevant to their inquiries, subject to due process.<\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li><strong>a public register for political\\u00a0advertising <\\/strong>&#8212;\\u00a0&#8220;requiring all political advertising work to be listed for\\u00a0public display so that, even if work is not requiring\\u00a0regulation, it is accountable, clear, and transparent for all to\\u00a0see&#8221;. So it also wants the government to conduct a\\u00a0review of UK\\u00a0law to ensure that digital campaigning is defined in a way that includes online adverts that\\u00a0use political terminology but are not sponsored by a specific\\u00a0political party.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>a ban on micro-targeted political\\u00a0advertising to lookalikes online<\\/strong>, and a minimum limit for the\\u00a0number of voters sent individual political messages to be agreed\\u00a0at a national level. The committee also suggests the\\u00a0<span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">Electoral Commission and the ICO should consider the\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">ethics of Facebook or other relevant social media companies selling\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">lookalike political audiences to advertisers during the regulated period, saying<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0they should consider whether\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">users should\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">have the right to opt out from being included in\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">such lookalike audiences<\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li>a recommendation to formulate<strong> a <\\/strong><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\"><strong>new regulatory category for tech companies<\\/strong> that is not necessarily either a platform or a publisher, and which<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0&#8220;tightens tech companies\\u2019 liabilities&#8221;<\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">a suggestion that the<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0government consider (as part of an existing review of digital advertising) whether the Advertising Standards Agency could regulate digital advertising. &#8220;It is our recommendation that this process should\\u00a0<strong>establish<\\/strong> <strong>clear legal liability for the tech companies to act\\u00a0against harmful and illegal content on their platforms<\\/strong>,&#8221; the committee writes. &#8220;This should\\u00a0include both content that has been referred to them for\\u00a0takedown by their users, and other content that should have\\u00a0been easy for the tech companies to identify for themselves. In these cases, failure to act on behalf of the\\u00a0tech companies could leave them open to legal proceedings launched\\u00a0either by a public regulator, and\\/or by individuals or\\u00a0organisations who have suffered as a result of this content\\u00a0being freely disseminated on a social media platform.&#8221;<\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">another suggestion that the government consider establishing <strong>a &#8220;digital Atlantic Charter<\\/strong><\\/span><strong><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">\\u00a0as a new mechanism to reassure users that their digital<\\/span><\\/strong><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\"><strong>\\u00a0rights are guaranteed&#8221;<\\/strong> &#8212; with the committee also raising concerns that the UK risks a privacy loophole opening up after it leave the EU when US-based companies will be able to take UK citizens&#8217; data to the US for processing without the protections afforded by the EU&#8217;s GDPR framework (as the UK will then be a third country)<\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">a suggestion that <strong>a professional &#8220;global Code of Ethics&#8221; should be developed\\u00a0<\\/strong><\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\"><strong>by tech companies<\\/strong>, in collaboration with international governments,\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">academics and other &#8220;interested parties&#8221; (including the World Summit on Information\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">Society), in order to &#8220;set down in writing what is and what\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">is not acceptable by users on social media, with possible\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">liabilities for companies and for individuals working for those companies,\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">including those technical engineers involved in creating the software for\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">the companies&#8221;. &#8220;New products should be tested to ensure that\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">products are fit-for-purpose and do not constitute dangers\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"Recommendation\\\">to the users, or to society,&#8221; it suggests. &#8220;The Code of Ethics\\u00a0should be the backbone of tech companies\\u2019 work, and should\\u00a0be continually referred to when developing new technologies and algorithms.\\u00a0If companies fail to adhere to their own Code of\\u00a0Ethics, the UK Government should introduce regulation to make such\\u00a0ethical rules compulsory.&#8221;<\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li>the committee also suggests the government avoids using the (charged and confusing) term &#8216;fake news&#8217; &#8212; and instead puts forward an agreed definition of the words &#8216;misinformation&#8217; and &#8216;disinformation&#8217;. It should also support research into the methods by which misinformation and disinformation\\u00a0are created and spread across the internet, including <strong>support for fact-checking<\\/strong>. &#8220;We recommend that the government\\u00a0initiate a working group of experts to create a credible\\u00a0annotation of standards, so that people can see, at a\\u00a0glance, the level of verification of a site. This would\\u00a0help people to decide on the level of importance that\\u00a0they put on those sites,&#8221; it writes<\\/li>\\n<li>a suggestion that tech companies should be subject to <strong>security and algorithmic auditing<\\/strong>\\u00a0&#8212; with the committee writing: &#8220;Just as the finances of companies\\u00a0are audited and scrutinised, the same type of auditing and\\u00a0scrutinising should be carried out on the non-financial aspects\\u00a0of technology companies, including their security mechanisms and algorithms, to\\u00a0ensure they are operating responsibly. The Government should provide the\\u00a0appropriate body with the power to audit these companies, including\\u00a0algorithmic auditing, and we reiterate the point that the ICO\\u2019s powers should be substantially strengthened in these respects&#8221;. The committee also floats the idea that the Competition and Markets Authority considers conducting an audit of the operation of the advertising market\\u00a0on social media (given the risk of fake accounts leading to ad fraud)<\\/li>\\n<li>a requirement for <strong>tech companies to make full disclosure of targeting used as part of\\u00a0advert transparency<\\/strong>. The committee says tech companies must also address the issue of shell corporations and &#8220;other professional attempts to hide identity in advert purchasing.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p>How the government will respond to the committee&#8217;s laundry list of recommendations for cleaning up online political advertising remains to be seen, although the issue of Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns was at least\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/politics\\/2017\\/nov\\/13\\/theresa-may-accuses-russia-of-interfering-in-elections-and-fake-news\\\">raised publicly by the prime minister last year<\\/a>. Although Theresa May has been rather quieter on revelations about EU referendum-related data misuse and election law breaches.<\\/p>\\n<p>While the committee uses the term &#8220;tech companies&#8221; throughout its report to refer to multiple companies, Facebook specifically comes in for some excoriating criticism, with the committee accusing the company of misleading by omission and actively seeking to impede the progress of the inquiry.<\\/p>\\n<p>It also reiterates its <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/05\\/01\\/uk-parliaments-call-for-zuckerberg-to-testify-goes-next-level\\/\\\">call<\\/a> &#8212; for something like the fifth time at this point &#8212; for founder Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence.

It is as if it thinks that the problem will go away if it does not share information about the problem, and reacts only when it is pressed. Time and again we heard from Facebook about mistakes being made and then (sometimes) rectified, rather than designing the product ethically from the beginning of the process. Facebook has a \\u2018Code of Conduct\\u2019, which highlights the principles by which Facebook staff carry out their work, and states that employees are expected to \\u201cact lawfully, honestly, ethically, and in the best interests of the company while performing duties on behalf of Facebook\\u201d.\\u00a0<span id=\\\"footnote-221-backlink\\\"><\\/span>Facebook has fallen well below this standard in Burma,&#8221; it argues.<\\/p>\\n<p>The committee also directly blames Facebook&#8217;s actions for undermining the UK&#8217;s international aid efforts in the country &#8212; writing:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p class=\\\"CRPara1\\\">The <a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/united-nations\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-type=\\\"organization\\\" data-entity=\\\"united-nations\\\">United Nations <span class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> has named Facebook as being responsible for inciting hatred against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma, through its \\u2018Free Basics\\u2019 service. It provides people free mobile phone access without data charges, but is also responsible for the spread disinformation and propaganda. The CTO of Facebook, Mike Schroepfer described the situation in Burma as \\u201cawful\\u201d, yet Facebook cannot show us that it has done anything to stop the spread of disinformation against the Rohingya minority.<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"CRPara1\\\">The hate speech\\u00a0against the Rohingya\\u2014built up on Facebook, much of which\\u00a0is disseminated through fake accounts\\u2014and subsequent ethnic cleansing, has\\u00a0potentially resulted in the success of DFID\\u2019s [the UK Department for International Development] aid programmes\\u00a0being greatly reduced, based on the qualifications they set for success. The activity of Facebook undermines international aid to Burma, including the UK Government\\u2019s work. Facebook is releasing a\\u00a0product that is dangerous to consumers and deeply unethical. We\\u00a0urge the Government to demonstrate how seriously it takes Facebook\\u2019s apparent collusion in spreading disinformation in Burma, at the\\u00a0earliest opportunity. This is a further example of Facebook failing\\u00a0to take responsibility for the misuse of its platform.<\\/p>\\n<\\/blockquote>\\n<p>We reached out to Facebook for a response to the committee&#8217;s report, and in an email statement &#8212; attributed to Richard Allan, VP policy &#8212; the company told us:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p>The Committee has raised some important issues and we were pleased to be able to contribute to their work.<\\/p>\\n<p>We share their goal of ensuring that political advertising is fair and transparent and agree that electoral rule changes are needed. We have already made all advertising on Facebook more transparent. We provide more information on the Pages behind any ad and you can now see all the ads any Facebook Page is running, even if they are not targeted at you. We are working on ways to authenticate and label political ads in the UK and create an archive of those ads that anyone can search. We will work closely with the UK Government and Electoral Commission as we develop these new transparency tools.<\\/p>\\n<p>We\\u2019re also investing heavily in both people and technology to keep bad content off our services. We took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts globally in the first quarter of 2018 \\u2014 much of it before anyone needed to report this to Facebook. By using technology like machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision, we can detect more bad content and take action more quickly.<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>The statement makes no mention of Burma.

The oversight body concluded that Vote Leave broke UK electoral law by massively overspending via a joint working arrangement with another Brexit supporting campaign (BeLeave) &#8212; an arrangement via which an additional almost half a million pound&#8217;s worth of targeted Facebook ads were co-ordinated by Vote Leave in the final days of the campaign when it had already reached its spending limit (Facebook <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/07\\/26\\/facebook-finally-hands-over-leave-campaign-brexit-ads\\/\\\">finally released some of the 2016 Brexit campaign ads<\\/a>\\u00a0that had been microtargeted at UK voters via its platform to the committee, which published these ads last week. Many of Vote Leave&#8217;s (up to that point &#8216;dark&#8217;) adverts show the official Brexit campaign generating fake news of its own with ads that, for example, claim Turkey is on the cusp of joining the EU and flooding the UK with millions of migrants; or spreading the widely debunked claim that the UK would be able to spend \\u00a3350M more per week on the NHS if it left the EU.<\\/p>\\n<p>In general, dog whistle racism appears to have been Vote Leave&#8217;s preferred &#8216;persuasion&#8217; tactic of microtargeted ad choice &#8212; and thanks to Facebook&#8217;s ad platform, no one other than each ad&#8217;s chosen recipients would have been likely to see the messages.<\\/p>\\n<p>Cummings also comes in for a major roasting in the committee&#8217;s report after his failure to appear before it to answer questions, despite multiple summons (including an unprecedented House of Commons motion ordering him to appear &#8212; which he nonetheless also ignored).<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Mr Cummings\\u2019 contemptuous behaviour is unprecedented in the history of this Committee\\u2019s inquiries and underlines concerns about the difficulties of enforcing co-operation with Parliamentary scrutiny in the modern age,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;We will return to this issue in our Report in the autumn, and believe it to be an urgent matter for consideration by the Privileges Committee and by Parliament as a whole.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>On his blog, Cummings claims the committee offered him dates they knew he couldn&#8217;t do; slams its investigation as &#8216;fake news&#8217;; moans copiously that the committee is made up of Remain supporting MPs; and argues that the investigation should be under oath &#8212; as his major defense seems to be that key campaign whistleblowers are lying (despite ex-Cambridge Analytica employee <a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase.com\\/person\\/chris-wylie\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-type=\\\"person\\\" data-entity=\\\"chris-wylie\\\">Chris Wylie <span class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> and ex-BeLeave treasurer Shahmir Sanni having provided copious amounts of documentary evidence to back up their claims; evidence which both the Electoral Commission and the UK&#8217;s data watchdog, the ICO, have found convincing enough to announce some of the largest fines they can issue &#8212; in the latter case, the ICO announced its intention to <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/07\\/10\\/uks-information-commissioner-will-fine-facebook-the-maximum-500k-over-cambridge-analytica-breach\\/\\\">fine Facebook the maximum penalty possible<\\/a>\\u00a0(under the prior UK data protection regime) for failing to protect users&#8217; information.

"content_html": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A UK parliamentary committee which has been running a multi-month investigation into the impact of online disinformation on political campaigning \u2014 and on democracy itself \u2014 has published a preliminary <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/363/36302.htm\">report</a> highlighting what it describes as \u201csignificant concerns\u201d over the risks to \u201cshared values and the integrity of our democratic institutions\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s calling for \u201curgent action\u201d from government and regulatory bodies to \u201cbuild resilience against misinformation and disinformation into our democratic system\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are faced with a crisis concerning the use of data, the manipulation of our data, and the targeting of pernicious views,\u201d the DCMS committee warns. \u201cIn particular, we heard evidence of Russian state-sponsored attempts to influence elections in the US and the UK through social media, of the efforts of private companies to do the same, and of law-breaking by certain Leave campaign groups in the UK\u2019s EU Referendum in their use of social media.\u201d</p> <p>The inquiry, which was conceived of and begun in the previous UK parliament \u2014 before relaunching in fall 2017, after the June General Election \u2014 has found itself slap-bang in the middle of one of the major scandals of the modern era, as revelations about the extent of disinformation and social media data misuse and allegations of election fiddling and law bending have piled up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/30/russian-backed-content-may-have-reached-126-million-on-facebook/\">thick</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/26/twitter-accused-of-dodging-brexit-botnet-questions-again/\">fast</a>, especially in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/16/facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica-the-data-analysis-firm-that-worked-for-the-trump-campaign/\">recent months</a>\u00a0(albeit, concerns have been rising steadily, ever since the 2016 US presidential election and revelations about the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/\">cottage industry of fake news purveyors</a> spun up to feed US voters, in addition to Kremlin troll farm activity.)</p> <p>Yet the Facebook-<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"cambridge-analytica\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge Analytica <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> data misuse saga (which snowballed into a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/\">major global scandal</a> this March) is just one of the strands of the committee\u2019s inquiry. Hence they\u2019ve opted to publish multiple reports \u2014 the initial one recommending urgent actions for the government and regulators, which will be followed by another report covering the inquiry\u2019s \u201cwider terms of reference\u201d and including a closer look at the role of advertising. (The latter report is slated to land in the fall.)</p> <p>For now, the committee is suggesting\u00a0<span class=\"Recommendation\">\u201cprinciple-based recommendations\u201d designed to be\u00a0</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">\u201csufficiently adaptive to deal with fast-moving technological developments\u201d.\u00a0</span></p> <p>Among a very long list of recommendations are:</p> <p>How the government will respond to the committee\u2019s laundry list of recommendations for cleaning up online political advertising remains to be seen, although the issue of Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns was at least\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/13/theresa-may-accuses-russia-of-interfering-in-elections-and-fake-news\">raised publicly by the prime minister last year</a>. Although Theresa May has been rather quieter on revelations about EU referendum-related data misuse and election law breaches.</p> <p>While the committee uses the term \u201ctech companies\u201d throughout its report to refer to multiple companies, Facebook specifically comes in for some excoriating criticism, with the committee accusing the company of misleading by omission and actively seeking to impede the progress of the inquiry.</p> <p>It also reiterates its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/uk-parliaments-call-for-zuckerberg-to-testify-goes-next-level/\">call</a> \u2014 for something like the fifth time at this point \u2014 for founder Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence. Facebook has provided several witnesses to the committee, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/what-we-learned-from-facebooks-latest-data-misuse-grilling/\">including its CTO</a>, but Zuckerberg has declined its requests he appear, even via video link. (And even though he did find time for a couple of hours in front of the EU parliament <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/zuckerberg-didnt-make-any-friends-in-europe-today/\">back in May</a>.)</p> <p>The committee writes:</p> <p>We undertook fifteen exchanges of correspondence with Facebook, and two oral evidence sessions, in an attempt to elicit some of the information that they held, including information regarding users\u2019 data, foreign interference and details of the so-called \u2018dark ads\u2019 that had reached Facebook users.\u00a0<span id=\"footnote-244-backlink\"></span>Facebook consistently responded to questions by giving the minimal amount of information possible, and routinely failed to offer information relevant to the inquiry, unless it had been expressly asked for. It provided witnesses who have been unwilling or unable to give full answers to the Committee\u2019s questions. This is the reason why the Committee has continued to press for Mark Zuckerberg to appear as a witness as, by his own admission, he is the person who decides what happens at Facebook.</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p><strong class=\"Conclusion\">Tech companies are</strong><strong class=\"Conclusion\">\u00a0not passive platforms on which users input content; they reward</strong><strong class=\"Conclusion\">\u00a0what is most engaging, because engagement is part of their</strong><strong class=\"Conclusion\">\u00a0business model and their growth strategy.

Tech</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">\u00a0companies also have a responsibility to ensure full disclosure of</span><span class=\"Recommendation\">\u00a0the source of any political advertising they carry,\u201d it adds.</span></p> <p>The committee is especially damning of Facebook\u2019s actions in Burma (as indeed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/myanmar-group-blasts-zuckerbergs-claim-on-facebook-hate-speech-prevention/\">many others have also been</a>), condemning the company\u2019s failure to prevent its platform from being used to spread hate and fuel violence against the\u00a0Rohingya ethnic minority \u2014 and citing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/un-says-facebook-is-accelerating-ethnic-violence-in-myanmar/\">UN\u2019s similarly damning assessment</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook has hampered our efforts to get information about their company throughout this inquiry. It is as if it thinks that the problem will go away if it does not share information about the problem, and reacts only when it is pressed. Time and again we heard from Facebook about mistakes being made and then (sometimes) rectified, rather than designing the product ethically from the beginning of the process. Facebook has a \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019, which highlights the principles by which Facebook staff carry out their work, and states that employees are expected to \u201cact lawfully, honestly, ethically, and in the best interests of the company while performing duties on behalf of Facebook\u201d.\u00a0<span id=\"footnote-221-backlink\"></span>Facebook has fallen well below this standard in Burma,\u201d it argues.</p> <p>The committee also directly blames Facebook\u2019s actions for undermining the UK\u2019s international aid efforts in the country \u2014 writing:</p> <p class=\"CRPara1\">The <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"united-nations\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/united-nations\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has named Facebook as being responsible for inciting hatred against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma, through its \u2018Free Basics\u2019 service. It provides people free mobile phone access without data charges, but is also responsible for the spread disinformation and propaganda. The CTO of Facebook, Mike Schroepfer described the situation in Burma as \u201cawful\u201d, yet Facebook cannot show us that it has done anything to stop the spread of disinformation against the Rohingya minority.</p> <p class=\"CRPara1\">The hate speech\u00a0against the Rohingya\u2014built up on Facebook, much of which\u00a0is disseminated through fake accounts\u2014and subsequent ethnic cleansing, has\u00a0potentially resulted in the success of DFID\u2019s [the UK Department for International Development] aid programmes\u00a0being greatly reduced, based on the qualifications they set for success. The activity of Facebook undermines international aid to Burma, including the UK Government\u2019s work. Facebook is releasing a\u00a0product that is dangerous to consumers and deeply unethical. We\u00a0urge the Government to demonstrate how seriously it takes Facebook\u2019s apparent collusion in spreading disinformation in Burma, at the\u00a0earliest opportunity. This is a further example of Facebook failing\u00a0to take responsibility for the misuse of its platform.</p> <p>We reached out to Facebook for a response to the committee\u2019s report, and in an email statement \u2014 attributed to Richard Allan, VP policy \u2014 the company told us:</p> <p>The Committee has raised some important issues and we were pleased to be able to contribute to their work.</p> <p>We share their goal of ensuring that political advertising is fair and transparent and agree that electoral rule changes are needed. We have already made all advertising on Facebook more transparent. We provide more information on the Pages behind any ad and you can now see all the ads any Facebook Page is running, even if they are not targeted at you. We are working on ways to authenticate and label political ads in the UK and create an archive of those ads that anyone can search. We will work closely with the UK Government and Electoral Commission as we develop these new transparency tools.</p> <p>We\u2019re also investing heavily in both people and technology to keep bad content off our services. We took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts globally in the first quarter of 2018 \u2014 much of it before anyone needed to report this to Facebook. By using technology like machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision, we can detect more bad content and take action more quickly.</p> <p>The statement makes no mention of Burma. Nor indeed of the committee\u2019s suggestion that social media firms should be taxed to pay for defending democracy and civil society against the damaging excesses of their tools.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/transparency-for-ads-and-pages/\">Thursday</a>, rolling out its latest ads transparency features, Facebook announced that users could now\u00a0see the ads a Page is running across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and its partner network \u201ceven if those ads aren\u2019t shown to you\u201d.</p> <p>To do so, users have to log into Facebook, visit any Page and select \u201cInfo and Ads\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll see ad creative and copy, and you can flag anything suspicious by clicking on \u2018Report Ad\u2019,\u201d it added.</p> <p>It also flagged a \u2018more Page information\u2019 feature that users can use to get more details about a Page such as recent name changes and the date it was created.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organizations \u2014 whether it\u2019s a small business looking for new customers, an advocacy group raising money for their cause, or a politician running for office. But we\u2019ve seen that bad actors can misuse our products, too,\u201d Facebook wrote, adding that the features being announced \u201care just the start\u201d of its efforts \u201cto improve\u201d and \u201croot out abuse\u201d.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Europe needs it's own Mueller, to investigate the extent of Russian disinformation campaigns &amp; other attacks on our democracies.

The oversight body concluded that Vote Leave broke UK electoral law by massively overspending via a joint working arrangement with another Brexit supporting campaign (BeLeave) \u2014 an arrangement via which an additional almost half a million pound\u2019s worth of targeted Facebook ads were co-ordinated by Vote Leave in the final days of the campaign when it had already reached its spending limit (Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/facebook-finally-hands-over-leave-campaign-brexit-ads/\">finally released some of the 2016 Brexit campaign ads</a>\u00a0that had been microtargeted at UK voters via its platform to the committee, which published these ads last week. Many of Vote Leave\u2019s (up to that point \u2018dark\u2019) adverts show the official Brexit campaign generating fake news of its own with ads that, for example, claim Turkey is on the cusp of joining the EU and flooding the UK with millions of migrants; or spreading the widely debunked claim that the UK would be able to spend \u00a3350M more per week on the NHS if it left the EU.</p> <p>In general, dog whistle racism appears to have been Vote Leave\u2019s preferred \u2018persuasion\u2019 tactic of microtargeted ad choice \u2014 and thanks to Facebook\u2019s ad platform, no one other than each ad\u2019s chosen recipients would have been likely to see the messages.</p> <p>Cummings also comes in for a major roasting in the committee\u2019s report after his failure to appear before it to answer questions, despite multiple summons (including an unprecedented House of Commons motion ordering him to appear \u2014 which he nonetheless also ignored).</p> <p>\u201cMr Cummings\u2019 contemptuous behaviour is unprecedented in the history of this Committee\u2019s inquiries and underlines concerns about the difficulties of enforcing co-operation with Parliamentary scrutiny in the modern age,\u201d it writes, adding: \u201cWe will return to this issue in our Report in the autumn, and believe it to be an urgent matter for consideration by the Privileges Committee and by Parliament as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>On his blog, Cummings claims the committee offered him dates they knew he couldn\u2019t do; slams its investigation as \u2018fake news\u2019; moans copiously that the committee is made up of Remain supporting MPs; and argues that the investigation should be under oath \u2014 as his major defense seems to be that key campaign whistleblowers are lying (despite ex-Cambridge Analytica employee <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"chris-wylie\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/chris-wylie\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Wylie <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and ex-BeLeave treasurer Shahmir Sanni having provided copious amounts of documentary evidence to back up their claims; evidence which both the Electoral Commission and the UK\u2019s data watchdog, the ICO, have found convincing enough to announce some of the largest fines they can issue \u2014 in the latter case, the ICO announced its intention to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/uks-information-commissioner-will-fine-facebook-the-maximum-500k-over-cambridge-analytica-breach/\">fine Facebook the maximum penalty possible</a>\u00a0(under the prior UK data protection regime) for failing to protect users\u2019 information. The data watchdog is continuing to investigate multiple aspects of what is a hugely complex (technically and politically) online ad ops story, and earlier this month commissioner Elizabeth Denham <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/\">called for an \u2018ethical pause\u2019</a> on the use of online ad platforms for microtargeting voters with political messages, arguing \u2014 as the DCMS committee is \u2014 that there are very real and very stark risks for democratic processes.</p> <p>There\u2019s much, much more self-piteous whining on Cummings blog for anyone who wants to make themselves queasy reading. But do also bear in mind the Electoral Commission\u2019s withering criticism of the Vote Leave campaign, specifically \u2014 for not so much a failure to co-operate with its investigation but for intentional obstruction.

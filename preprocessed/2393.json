Photo by Livioandronico2013.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Between 50 and 20 B.C., in the late Republic, early Imperial period, a man named Eurysaces built a tomb outside the eastern boundary of Rome. Part of what is today called the Porta Maggiore after the nearby Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Two inscriptions identify the tomb\u2019s owner. The complete one says: EST HOC MONIMENTUM MARGEI VERGILEI EURSYACIS PISTORIS REDEMPTORIS APPARET, meaning \u201cThis is the monument of Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces, baker contractor, public servant. His name, the Latin nomen and Greek cognomen, could be indications that he was a freedman, a manumitted slave who became a wealthy and successful baker. His name is not followed by L or LIB for libertinus to denote freedman status, however. It wasn\u2019t a requirement that freedmen identify themselves this way, but it was a widespread practice. He could also have just been a poor immigrant who made good and wanted to broadcast as much in his own stab at immortality with a tomb dedicated to his success in business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54454\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Store of Dolii in Ostia Antica.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The three surviving facades of the tomb feature a unique design: three rows in five columns of hollow circles in the third story. It is sui generis as tomb design, but could represent <em>dolia frumentaria</em>, massive round-mouth earthenware jars that had capacities in the hundreds of gallons and were used to store grain for commercial enterprises. (Dolia were used to store pretty much every foodstuff, liquid and solid \u2014 wine, oil, fresh and dried fruits and vegetables, salted ham, fish, fish guts in the fermentation of garum. They\u2019ve been found on shipwrecks and  buried in rows up to their shoulders in industrial and commercial neighborhoods.)</p>\n<p>A far more literal representation of the baker\u2019s craft is sculpted in a frieze below the cornice. Every stage of commercial bread-making is depicted, from the milling of grain on the south fa\u00e7ade to the baking of the loaves on the north fa\u00e7ade to the weighing and sale of the bread on the west.</p>\n<p>The tomb survived construction of the Aqua Claudia in the middle of the 1st century. The soaring arches of the aqueduct loomed over and all around it, but it remained intact. The construction of the Aurelian Walls in the 3rd century took a march larger toll, absorbing the tomb into the new defensive perimeter. The east fa\u00e7ade was destroyed when the tomb was built into a tower of the Porta Praenestina. Finally the tomb was fully enclosed in reinforcements of the wall built by the emperor Honorius.</p>\n<p>In 1838, the structures built by Honorius were demolished by order of Pope Gregory XVI who had a notion that stripping later modifications would return the gate to Cladius\u2019 original. During the works, the baker\u2019s tomb was rediscovered. The Pope let it stand despite his pet project and today it remains in place at the Porta Maggiore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Restored-relief-and-loaned-inscription.jpg\"><img alt=\"Restored relief of Eurysaces and Atistia with epitaph at their feet.

Crews discovered fragments of inscriptions and sculptural elements that had fallen off the tomb or been knocked down. The most significant was a full-length marble relief portrait of an adult man and woman. Expertly carved wearing the highly draped traditional Roman garb of tunic and toga (for him) and tunic and palla (for her), the figures look dignified and expensive, not unlike the family portraits of Augustus and Livia on the Ara Pacis. The woman is even wearing her hair like Livia\u2019s.</p>\n<p>An epitaph found in the rubble appears to match this relief. It reads: FUIT ATISTIA UXOR MIHEI FEMINA OPITUMA VEIXSIT QUOIUS CORPORIS RELIQUAE QUOD SUPERANT SUNT IN HOC PANARIO, meaning \u201cAtistia was my wife; a most excellent lady in life; the surviving remains of her body are in this breadbasket.\u201d A cinerary urn in the shape of a cylindrical basket was found near the tomb during the 1838 demolition.

Mainly on my feet. Sitting on a bench near Keat\u2019s grave, looking at the pyramid and the Porta San Paolo under the warm sunlight, I was weary but content. I realized that my half-formed idea of walking as much of the Aurelian Wall as remained would be too ambitious for a week-long trip, but I had done the full south perimeter and that felt like a real accomplishment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Castro-Pretorio.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53172\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Castro-Pretorio-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Castro-Pretorio-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Castro-Pretorio-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Castro-Pretorio-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Castro-Pretorio-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Picking up the wall at Castro Pretorio\" width=\"150\"/></a>Only the matter of the cannonball remained. I still wanted badly to capture it even though walking around the wall up to the north gates was no longer an option at this point. The Piramide metro station rose up to play the part of my Merlin, cutting through the city to deliver me north to Castro Pretorio where I could pick up the trail of the wall again and walk along it towards the Porta Pinciana and the Borghese Gardens where my quest had been so cruelly interrupted coming from the other direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Razor-wire.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53171\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Razor-wire-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Razor-wire-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Razor-wire-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Razor-wire-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Razor-wire-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Razor wire keeping out the barbarians (or just keeping people from climbing the unstable section).\" width=\"150\"/></a>My busted feets were revitalized by the sheer happiness of walking a new stretch of wall, one I had never ever seen before when I lived in Rome. Castro Pretorio station is named after the Praetorian Guard barracks whose remains are embedded in the wall. I was delighted to find modern-day offices and barracks of the Italian military adjacent to the Metro station. One does enjoy a 2,000-year-old recurring theme.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Porta-Pia.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53170\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Porta-Pia-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Porta-Pia-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Porta-Pia-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Porta-Pia-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Porta-Pia-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Porta Pia\" width=\"150\"/></a>For a length I was able to walk directly under the looming shadow of the wall, one section of which was topped with razor wire, as if it were still a bulwark against all manner of barbarians overunning the city\u2019s defenses (or at least foolhardy idiots trying to scale a particularly unstable piece). While I soon had to cross the insanely busy multi-lane Corso d\u2019Italia instead of walking directly under it, I had every hope that I would be able to spot the cannonball in the tower. I greeted the Porta Pia with a jaunty how-de-do. I doffed my cap to the late Porta Salaria, demolished in 1921. I stopped short, foot brakes squealing Looney Tunes-style, at the church of Saint Teresa of Avila. This was the marker. Across the Corso d\u2019Italia, now split into lanes on either side of an underpass, somewhere in that section of wall the treasure awaited me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/treasure-tower.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53173\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/treasure-tower-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/treasure-tower-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/treasure-tower-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/treasure-tower-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/treasure-tower-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"At long last, the tower with the Ball in the Stone\" width=\"113\"/></a>Crossing the small lane to the fence keeping traffic vehicular and pedestrian from falling into the underpass, I gazed hungrily at the towering heights of brickwork. And there it was. A large hole like so many areas of wear and tear I had seen on my journey along the walls. The cannonball itself was barely visible. The sun was in my eyes and it is so much smaller than the hole it carved out for itself in 1870. It was a dark curve more than anything.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Treasure-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Click to claim your reward.\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53174\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Treasure-det-106x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Treasure-det-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Treasure-det-200x284.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Treasure-det-768x1090.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Treasure-det-430x610.jpg 430w\" width=\"106\"/></a>The reward had to be brought back for the benefit of mankind. Them\u2019s the rules of the hero\u2019s journey. Even a dark curve would count as long as the camera could capture it. One shot. Then another. Is that\u2026? If I zoom in can it be\u2026? And so it came to pass as I had scarce dared hope. The Ball in the Stone was mine. Now it is yours too.</p>\n<p>I all but flew to the Porta Pinciana and strutted down the Via Veneto living the history nerd\u2019s most dolce vita. Okay so the wings kinda gave out and I snagged a bus at the bottom of the street, but the shine of my final tally of seven gates, miles of largely uninterrupted walls and one precious cannonball picture could not be dulled.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Ball in the Stone Part III: The Treasure\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53158\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53158#comments\">8 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53119\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53119\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to I can\u2019t believe I missed this\">I can\u2019t believe I missed this</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, November 1st, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-after-restoration.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-53123\" height=\"237\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-after-restoration-200x237.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-after-restoration-200x237.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-after-restoration-126x150.jpg 126w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-after-restoration-768x911.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-after-restoration-430x510.jpg 430w\" title=\"Madonna di San Luca after restoration. Photo courtesy Polo Museale del Lazio.\" width=\"200\"/></a>A famous medieval icon of the Madonna and Child traditionally held to have been painted by Saint Luke the Evangelist has been <a href=\"https://www.romereports.com/en/2018/10/28/ancient-icon-of-blessed-mother-with-baby-jesus-discovered-as-filippo-rusutis-work/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conclusively identified as the work of late 13th century artist Filippo Rusuti</a>, creator of the grand upper facade of St. Mary Major. That mosaic depicting Christ enthroned among angels, saints and the symbols of the Evangelists actually bears the artist\u2019s signature in mosaic tiles. The facade is today mostly hidden by the 18th century loggia built over it, but the verisimilitude of the signature made it possible for experts to confirm the one on the icon.</p>\n<p>Art historians had previously attributed it to the Master of San Saba due to some stylistic similarities to frescoes in the nave of the Church of San Saba. A restoration that began in 2017 used the latest technology to analyze the panel painting (canvas mounted on walnut). That\u2019s how the previously invisible signature of the artist was discovered. Like the mosaic, the icon is Byzantine in style with rigid figures imbued with symbolism rather than naturalistic postures and affect.</p>\n<p>The icon\u2019s permanent home is the church of Santa Maria del Popolo to which it has deep ties extending back to the 13th century. The church\u2019s founding and early history is hazy \u2014 many church records were destroyed during the Napoleonic occupation of Rome \u2014 but it does appear on a list of Roman churches from the late 1220s, early 1230s. The physical structure as it exists today is largely Baroque, an expansion and reconstruction designed by Gianlorenzo Bernini in the mid-17th century that drastically altered its 15th century predecessor. The greatest international claim to fame and tourist attraction of Santa Maria del Popolo today, the Cerasi Chapel with its two Caravaggio masterpieces, <em>Crucifixion of St. Peter</em> and <em>Conversion on the Way to Damascus</em>, dates to the Baroque reconstruction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-53122\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-det-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-det-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-det-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-det-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Madonna-di-San-Luca-det-430x645.jpg 430w\" title=\"Madonna di San Luca detail. Photo courtesy Polo Museale del Lazio.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Long before the Caravaggio pilgrims lined up on the church steps waiting for it to open, however, pilgrims seeking the blessings of the Madonna traveled to Santa Maria del Popolo to venerate the icon. Legend dates its miraculous reputation back to the earliest records of the church. The story goes that the icon of Virgin and Child was painted by the very hand of St. Luke the Evangelist and kept with the rest of the most important relics in Christendom in the Sancta Sanctorum of the Lateran palace, the Pope\u2019s residence. In 1230, the Tiber overflowed its banks, as it was wont to do, and with the flood came plague. To cure the city of this pestilence, the Pope led the city in a procession carrying aloft the icon to Santa Maria del Popolo. The plague ended and the Madonna of San Luca became one the most venerated icons in Rome.</p>\n<p>Several Popes and cardinals were passionately devoted to the icon. The high altar of Santa Maria del Popolo was commissioned, likely by Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, in 1473 to showcase it. One of those popes, Sixtus V, put Santa Maria del Popolo on the list of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome in 1586, replacing the church of Saint Sebastian on the Appia outside the walls, solely because of the importance of icon. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Readhering-paint.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-53121\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Readhering-paint-200x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Readhering-paint-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Readhering-paint-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Readhering-paint-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Readhering-paint-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Restorers readhere lifting paint to icon.

It is currently on display at the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo through November 18th. I didn\u2019t even realize it was there and I probably wouldn\u2019t have thought anything of it even if I had known because I\u2019ve seen the icon at Santa Maria, albeit not within such close view. I did have the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo\u2019s exhibition of arms and armature on the short list, however, and saw the other half of that show at the Palazzo Venezia. Time got away with me is all, what with all the questing and wall walking.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"I can\u2019t believe I missed this\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53119\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53119#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53117\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53117\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Ball in the Stone Part II: the Call of the Wall\">Ball in the Stone Part II: the Call of the Wall</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, October 30th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Via-di-Porta-Latina.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53135\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Via-di-Porta-Latina-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Via-di-Porta-Latina-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Via-di-Porta-Latina-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Via-di-Porta-Latina-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Via-di-Porta-Latina-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Via di Porta Latina, gate in the distance.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The plan was to go back to the Appia Antica, walk the ecological park of Valle di Carafella, check out its various columbaria and nymphae, maybe hit a catacomb or two. The Museo delle Mura had been such a treat on Sunday that I didn\u2019t get very far down the ancient road after going through the Appian Gate. So Tuesday I set off bright and early going largely the same way. A rhino was spotted and it was good. Instead of taking Via di San Sebastiano, however, which leads directly to the gate and the museum, for variety\u2019s sake I decided to take the Via di Porta Latina which diverged left to go to a different, much smaller gate a short distance from the big one. It\u2019s a pretty road with large walled villas on either side, walls I hugged more than once when cars barreled down the tiny cobblestone street. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/San-Giovanni-in-Oleo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53146\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/San-Giovanni-in-Oleo-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/San-Giovanni-in-Oleo-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/San-Giovanni-in-Oleo-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/San-Giovanni-in-Oleo-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/San-Giovanni-in-Oleo-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"San Giovanni in Oleo\" width=\"113\"/></a>The gate in sight, I stopped to read the info panel about the wee church of San Giovanni in Oleo, a Renaissance structure (original design attributed Bramante, current roof by Borromini), built on the site of a 5th century church which ostensibly marked the spot where John the Evangelist was martyred by Domitian by being boiled in a vat oil. Well, almost martyred. It didn\u2019t take, so alive and unboiled, John was exiled to Patmos where he wrote the book of Revelation. </p>\n<p>An obstacle arose here too in the form of a tour group that would not move the hell on so I could get a picture of the Porta Latina. Patience, which I hear is a virtue although I wouldn\u2019t know from personal experience, paid off eventually.

It called to me, a stone and brick siren 30 feet high and a half-mile long. I had to follow its call. That whole stretch of wall from the Porta Latina to the Porta Metronia is a park, a peaceful green space on the perimeter of a residential neighborhood. There were more dogs than people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Metronia-r.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53152\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Metronia-r-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Metronia-r-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Metronia-r-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Metronia-r-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Metronia-r-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Porta Metronia, right side, from inside the wall.\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was so wonderful a walk that I would have gone on to the next gate, the Porta San Giovanni, had not dark forces prevented me. The dark force in this case was the construction of Metro Line C whose high scaffolding was wrapped tight like an anti-present blocking the view of the wall and access to the street under it. I could have continued nonetheless, heading in that direction even if not at the foot of the wall or even in view of it, but I didn\u2019t know when I\u2019d get back to proper wall walking. I turned back, going on to the Porta Appia to resume my original trajectory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Juno.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53136\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Juno-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Juno-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Juno-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Juno-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Juno-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Juno's representative.\" width=\"113\"/></a>And so I reached the Valle di Carafella, embarking on an exploration of its archaeological sites. There was just one problem. Most of the sites of note are way at the end of the park. I enjoy an ecological preserve, mind you, and had I not had a very specific brief, I would have gladly spent the day hiking the whole thing. Instead, I reached the working farm, received the blessing of Juno\u2019s representative, and then turned back.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Ardeatina.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53142\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Ardeatina-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Ardeatina-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Ardeatina-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Ardeatina-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-Ardeatina-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Porta Ardeatina at Cristoforo Colombo.\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was the wall, you see. Its call could not be denied. Facing the Porta Appia, I turned left and walked. And walked. And walked some more. I reached the Porta Ardeatina and the Christoforo Colombo, the large thoroughfare that took us home/to town so often when I was a child. I kept going. And going. At one point I found some stairs and climbed them. They took me to a high road (far more modern) that tracked the inside of the wall. It was from the internal wall perimeter that I saw the gate. It was the Porta San Paolo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Paolo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53141\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Paolo-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Paolo-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Paolo-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Paolo-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Paolo-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Porta San Paolo and the Pyramid of Gaius Cestius.\" width=\"150\"/></a>When I walked through it, the pyramid of Gaius Cestius welcomed me. The marble cladding, mottled grey and white, gleamed in the sun. Never once, when I was little, did I imagine the blackened, weed-choked pyramid could ever look like this. It\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31486\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of the best restorations</a> I\u2019ve ever seen. It was a little thin on cats, however. They used to colonize the base of the pyramid and there were zero cats to be found. Thankfully the Cimitero Accatolico, the non-Catholic cemetery best known as the final resting place of John Keats, \u201cone whose name was writ in water,\u201d was as catty as I recalled.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pyramid.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-53143\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pyramid-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pyramid-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pyramid-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pyramid-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pyramid-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Restored pyramid.\" width=\"113\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Keats-Severn.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-53145\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Keats-Severn-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Keats-Severn-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Keats-Severn-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Keats-Severn-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Keats-Severn-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Graves of Keats and Severn.\" width=\"150\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kitty.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-53147\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kitty-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kitty-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kitty-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kitty-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Kitty-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cemetery cat, as supremely unimpressed as ever.

This is the final part of the quest, wherein I return with the treasure to benefit humanity. So, like, you guys.</p>\n<p>The story begins on September 20th, 1870, when the army of the Kingdom of Italy, then less than a decade old, breached the ancient Aurelian Wall at Porta Pia to wrest Rome from the white-knuckle grip of Pope Pius IX and make it the capital of a truly unified Italy. The date and the breach of the walls has gone down in history with a spin that\u2019s more legend than fact. The army did \u201cbesiege\u201d the city, but the siege amounted to three hours of cannon fire against the walls. </p>\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking that maybe it\u2019s not all that remarkable that a few hours of cannon fire would breach a 1600-year-old wall peppered with holes, cave-ins, crumbling ramparts and patchwork repairs, you are wise. The Pope\u2019s resistance was token. He knew it was over; he just didn\u2019t want to go down without some pretense at fighting back. After those three hours of artillery lobbed at Porta Pia, 72 troops \u2014 53 Italian and 19 papal \u2014 were dead and the kingdom\u2019s forces made their triumphal entry down the Via Pia, today named Via XX Settembre after that momentous day.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, the Aurelian Wall at Porta Pia is a snarl of traffic with the modern version of the ancient consular roads transporting an endless parade of cars, motorini and buses both tourist and public. The Corso d\u2019Italia, fat with lanes and divides and over and underpasses, runs along the outside of the wall past the former Porta Salaria (demolished in 1921) to the Porta Pinciana. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mappaMuraAureliane.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-53114\" height=\"144\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mappaMuraAureliane-200x144.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mappaMuraAureliane-200x144.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mappaMuraAureliane-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mappaMuraAureliane-768x553.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mappaMuraAureliane-430x309.jpg 430w\" title=\"Map of the Aurelian Walls with subway stops\" width=\"200\"/></a>Somewhere between the Porta Pia and Pinciana, embedded high on a tower of the Aurelian Wall is a single cannon ball that was shot during the siege of September 20th. As I had already determined to walk as many tracts of the ancient wall I could manage, I thought it would be groovy to cap one of those walks with a picture of the 1870 cannon ball in the 270s wall. I knew from my childhood days that the Borghese Gallery is right across from the Pinciana Gate north of the city, its massive park stretching out below the villa itself practically all the way down to the Porta del Popolo, the gate adjacent to the church of Santa Maria del Popolo famous for its Caravaggio paintings. The stretch of Aurelian Wall that goes up the hill from the Porta del Popolo towards the Porta Pinciana still stands. It\u2019s called the Muro Torto (crooked wall, after a sharp dogleg east) and when I was a kid, I had a distinct fixation with it, staring at the looming structure whenever we drove by it. I was looking forward to experiencing that looming feeling even more keenly walking at its feet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTorto.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-53113\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTorto-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTorto-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTorto-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTorto-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTorto-430x323.jpg 430w\" titled=\"Trapped in the wilderness at the Muro Torto.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Such was my call to adventure. The ordeals began with a \u201csidewalk\u201d that could only have been designed by forces of supernatural malignity. Sometimes it was wide enough for two feet. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t. More than once it was a line painted on asphalt, literally forcing my back against the wall, hands clutching the clammy grunge of masonry and brick as cars sped past me so fast they made a laser-like \u201cpew!\u201d sound. When there was sufficient sidewalk to lower the risk from almost certainly deadly to \u201cdanger Will Robinson\u201d flailing, new enemies sprang up in the form of weeds. The embankments and sides of the walls were choked with vegetation, so much so that I feared I\u2019d miss the cannon ball hidden in cascades of wild plants.</p>\n<p>But the obstacle that would defeat me, seemingly ending my quest, was road work. I wasn\u2019t even at the top of the hill when the sidewalk and right lane were taped off for some pressing infrastructure modification project. Being in Rome, I did as any Roman would do and simply ducked under the tape to continue on my not-so-merry way. I was chased out by a supernatural apparition only spoken of in hushed tones in this city but never seen: an actual worker working.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTortoclean.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-53112\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTortoclean-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTortoclean-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTortoclean-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTortoclean-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MuroTortoclean-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"One of the few cleaner sections of the Muro Torto\" width=\"200\"/></a>Now I was on the street, a target for high-speed vehicles and their eardrum-shattering horns. Again I had to walk feet splayed outwards, heels together, in the few inches of gutter space that made the difference between life and death. If the cannonball had appeared during that stretch, there was no way I could have seen it.</p>\n<p>Finally at the top of the hill but not even at the Porta Pia yet, the wall disappeared. The last I could see of it ended in a piney private park far above me. I had to admit defeat. Crushed, bereft of cannonballs, I lost hope and had to find a new reason to go on. I walked heavily down the steps to the Spagna Metro station and made my way to the patrician domuses under the Palazzo Valentini in Trajan\u2019s Forum where I had booked a tour. </p>\n<p>It turned out to be an epic tour and will be a topic for its own chanson de geste, but it could not erase the memory of my lost cannonball. It would be the Aurelian Wall itself that would resuscitate the deceased hope that I might achieve my quest after all.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"The quest for the ball in the stone: Part I\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53108\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53108#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53084\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53084\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to How\u2019s this for a view from your office?\">How\u2019s this for a view from your office?</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, October 26th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Heading south in the historic center shortly before one encounters a rhino in front of a quadrifons arch, there\u2019s a lovely palazzo off Piazza Campitelli on the Via Montanara. The first time I happened past it was when I went to the Museo della Mura at the Porta Appia. That was Sunday and the portellone (big ol\u2019 door) was closed so it was just a felicitously located building. I barely noted it because it was clearly new (well, new for Rome).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53089\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pretty courtyard.\" width=\"150\"/></a>When I returned down that path for the Wednesday excursion which took me past the rhino, the portellone was wide open and I saw a beautiful courtyard with a fountain and a few handsome pieces of ancient marble work. That was notable and how. I popped in to have a quick look around, as one does in open doors in Rome, and I saw this:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-Teatro.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-53095\" height=\"349\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-Teatro-430x349.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-Teatro-430x349.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-Teatro-150x122.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-Teatro-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Courtyard-Teatro-768x624.jpg 768w\" title=\"Just another day at the office.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>That is what the employees of the Municipal Department of Culture see every morning when they trudge in to the office. The door was open for randos like me to wander in because there\u2019s a little information booth with a bunch of pamphlets about cultural activities sponsored by the city and oh yeah, a freaking incredible view of three important ancient sites and a cool Renaissance building.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ponte-Rotto.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53098\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ponte-Rotto-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ponte-Rotto-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ponte-Rotto-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ponte-Rotto-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ponte-Rotto-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ponte Rotto, Isola Tiberina behind it.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The view from the courtyard stretches from the slopes of the Capitoline to the Velabrum valley. This was always a busy area, even before the Cloaca drained the marsh, because it\u2019s where the Isola Tiberina divides the Tiber making a convenient ford for a commercial harbor. The remains of the first bridge built on the river, the Ponte Rotto, still stand in front of the island. </p>\n<p>Once the marshes were dried up, the area filled with temples and monumental structures. The Theater of Marcellus was built in by August in 13 or 11 B.C. in memory of his beloved nephew who died at a young age under suspicious circumstances (did Livia poison him?). It was originally three levels high, the first level supported by Doric columns, the second Ionic and the third adorned by Corinthian pilasters. It seated 15,000.</p>\n<p>A Temple of Apollo was first built on the site in 431 B.C. by consul Gnaeus Iulius Mento in thanks for the conclusion of a plague. It was the first and for centuries the only temple to Apollo in the city. The remains visible today date to a rebuild of the site during the Augustan period, a rebuild made necessary by various demolitions done to accommodate the Theater of Marcellus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Clearing-of-Theater-of-Marcellus-area-in-the-1930s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53100\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Clearing-of-Theater-of-Marcellus-area-in-the-1930s-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Clearing-of-Theater-of-Marcellus-area-in-the-1930s-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Clearing-of-Theater-of-Marcellus-area-in-the-1930s-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Clearing-of-Theater-of-Marcellus-area-in-the-1930s-768x462.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Clearing-of-Theater-of-Marcellus-area-in-the-1930s-430x259.jpg 430w\" title=\"Clearing of the Theater of Marcellus area in the 1930s\" width=\"150\"/></a>You will not be surprised to hear that the theater, like sooo many other ancient Roman buildings, was converted into a fortress by local potentates. In the Renaissance the fortress got an architectural upgrade into a palace, designed by Baldassarre Peruzzi for the noble Savelli family, later owned by the Orsini.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reassembly-of-three-columns.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53099\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reassembly-of-three-columns-106x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reassembly-of-three-columns-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reassembly-of-three-columns-200x284.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reassembly-of-three-columns-768x1089.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reassembly-of-three-columns-430x610.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reassembly-of-three-columns.jpg 868w\" title=\"Reassembly of three columns of the Temple of Apollo.\" width=\"106\"/></a>In the 1930s, the Fascist thirst for creating a grandiose vision of the ancient Caput Mundi led to the demolition of much of the medieval and Renaissance construction in the area. The columns from the Temple of Apollo, incorporated into a later building, were reconstructed in their original location and raised on April 21st, 1940, Rome\u2019s birthday. Other remains were released from the bondage of the structures built on top of them.</p>\n<p>So what you see from the courtyard is a remarkable cross-section of Roman history. The tower in the left middle ground is the Torre dei Pierleoni, a medieval defensive tower once linked to all the fortressification of the Theater of Marcellus. A block or so behind it, past the tree, is the facade of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, of Bocca della Verita\u2019 fame. On the right is the Theater of Marcellus, only two of its original three ancient storeys remaining, with the Renaissance <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcellus-fossajpg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53088\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcellus-fossajpg-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcellus-fossajpg-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcellus-fossajpg-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcellus-fossajpg-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marcellus-fossajpg-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Temple of Apollo remains under the courtyard balcony.\" width=\"150\"/></a>palazzo taking up the third storey now. The columns and hill they\u2019re on are the site of the Temple of Apollo. The mass against the fence in the left foreground is the podium of the Temple of Bellona, originally erected in 296 B.C. to celebrate a victory over the Etruscans and also reconstructed under Augustus (5-15 B.C.). The building with the tile roof overlooking the Temple of Apollo is the Albergo della Catena, an active inn from at least the 16th century until 1931 when it was bought by the city of Rome.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"How\u2019s this for a view from your office?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53084\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53084#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53067\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53067\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Random arch rhinos\">Random arch rhinos</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, October 25th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>In the Forum Boarium across from the Theater of Marcellus and a block or so from Santa Maria in Cosmedin where crazy people who have seen <em>Roman Holiday</em> one too many times line up for hours to get a picture of themselves putting their hands in an ancient manhole cover, lies one of those gems that is so large it\u2019s weird to call it hidden. And yet it is, at least in the sense of being little known these days.</p>\n<p>It is the only surviving quadrifrons arch in Rome. Quadrifons literally means \u201cfour fronts\u201d and that\u2019s how the arch was designed: four pylons supporting a cross vault, like the way you set up the central double wicket in croquet. That gives it the look of a cube with a gate on each side. It\u2019s the four faces that earned it the appellation Arch of Janus, a deity sometimes depicted in Roman iconography in the form of Ianus Quadrifons, so with four faces instead of two. The arch wasn\u2019t dedicated to him. The Latin word for door, \u201cianua,\u201d is derived from the god and is the likely reference in the name.</p>\n<p>There are no records of it going by the Arch of Janus in antiquity. Historians think it might be the \u201carcum divi Constantini\u201d listed as one of the monuments in the Velabrum in the regionary <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/Regionaries/text*.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Notitia urbis Romae</em></a> in which case it would have been dedicated to Constantine or his one of his sons Constantine II, Constans or Constantius II. </p>\n<p>The arch was built in the second half of the 4th century A.D. in the Velabrum, the valley connecting the Roman Forum with the Forum Boarium (the cattle market). Once a marsh fed by the Tiber, the area was drained by the construction of the Cloaca Maxima, and the arch straddles the large drain leading to the great sewer. It was constructed of concrete and faced with marble taken from earlier structures. The marble cladding of the pylons have two rows of three niches on each side. Empty now, they originally contained statues. Today the only figural decoration remaining is a different goddess on each keystone: Roma on the east pylon, Minerva on the north, and possibly Juno and Ceres on the remaining two (identification is uncertain).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Drawing-of-the-Arch-of-Janus-in-the-1700s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-53072\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Drawing-of-the-Arch-of-Janus-in-the-1700s-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Drawing-of-the-Arch-of-Janus-in-the-1700s-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Drawing-of-the-Arch-of-Janus-in-the-1700s-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Drawing-of-the-Arch-of-Janus-in-the-1700s-768x577.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Drawing-of-the-Arch-of-Janus-in-the-1700s-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Print of the Arch of Janus in the 1700s.\" width=\"200\"/></a>In the Middle Ages the Frangipani family occupied it, filling in the gates and using it as a fortress. Those alterations were corrected in 1827-1830 and the arch became an arch again. There was just one wee little problem. The restorers mistakenly believed that an attic atop the arch was a Frangipani addition and tore the whole thing off. It was original, part of the ancient arch now lost forever. </p>\n<p>Through the opening of the gates you can see the church of San Giorgio al Velabro right behind it. In 1993, a car bomb went off in front of the church, after which the arch was fenced in and visitors locked out. While other buildings in the Velabrum were restored in the 90s and early 2000s, the arch alone remained untouched, blackening under the constant assault of Roman traffic. It was included in the World Monuments Fund 2014 World Monuments Watch, and with funding from private sponsors, the WMF and the Superintendency for the Coliseum were able to start an in-depth study and restoration of the arch. </p>\n<p>In May of 2017, visitors were invited to see the work in progress at a WMF-organized Watch Day. This video shows tantalizing but not satisfying snippets of the restoration.</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8z3x_X7-HI\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>A year and a half has passed since that Watch Day, and as of 9:00 AM October 24th, 2018, the Arch of Janus is still fenced in. A sign on the gate warns that visitors are not allowed due to the ongoing restoration work. There was no work visible. No workers. No scaffolding. There was, however, a rhino.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Giano-Al-Velabro.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-53070\" height=\"217\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Giano-Al-Velabro-430x217.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Giano-Al-Velabro-430x217.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Giano-Al-Velabro-150x76.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Giano-Al-Velabro-200x101.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Giano-Al-Velabro-768x387.jpg 768w\" title=\"Giano Al Velabro with rhino friend.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Rome, ladies and gentlemen.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Random arch rhinos\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53067\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53067#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53051\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53051\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Random street marbles\">Random street marbles</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, October 23rd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>This morning was all about the city of Rome as an easily accessible museum with no tickets to buy. After the de rigeur breakfast caffe\u2019 at Sant\u2019Eustachio, which, just by the by, is a miracle wondercoffee touched by the gods, it was off to see a couple of little things plopped in the middle of random alleyways in the <em>centro storico</em>. First up: a lump of marble with what looks like a cut in it. According to legend, that cut was put there by the Roland, knight of Charlemagne and hero of France\u2019s national epic, the chanson de geste <em>The Song of Roland</em>. This is why the tiny, otherwise unremarkable alleyway is called Vicolo della Spada d\u2019Orlando (Alley of the Sword of Roland).</p>\n<p>There are actually two legends attendant this lump, both star not just Roland, but his trusty sword, Durendal. Durendal was the sharpest sword in the world and unbreakable because it was filled with the power of four relics: one tooth of Saint Peter\u2019s, some blood from Saint Basil, a piece of the Virgin Mary\u2019s robe and a hair from Saint Denis. Charlemagne had received it directly from an angel and gave it to his loyal warlord Roland.</p>\n<p>Roland was fighting a Muslim ambush at Roncesvalles in northern Spain, slaughtering thousands with his great skill in combat and his unbreakable, sharpest of sharp sword. Even so, the Franks were tremendously outnumbered and when he saw that he was about to be overrun, Roland tried to destroy Durendal to keep such a powerful weapon out of their hands. He struck a powerful blow against a solid marble column. The sword did not break. It just cut the column instead. Roland would die at Roncesvalles from blowing his horn Oliphant, calling to Charlemagne\u2019s forces that they avenge him. He blew so hard his temples exploded and his brains popped out. Somehow, the piece of marble with the cut in it made its way to a Roman alley. That niggling detail is not recorded in this iteration of the legend.</p>\n<p>The second version cuts the whole mysterious transport of a column chunk out of the picture and instead simply declares that Roland was in Rome this one time. He was attacked and in defending himself against said attackers, he slashed vigorously in all directions at his many enemies, inadvertently cutting through a nearby column.</p>\n<p>Now, it is reasonable that a whole column might have been in that wee streetlet, because the remains of a wall have been found there that once belonged the Temple of Matidia, a temple built by Hadrian in 119 A.D. dedicated to his mother-in-law Salonia Matidia, niece of Trajan. Almost none of that temple remains, but there are a couple of columns embedded into a palazzo at the end of the alley in Piazza Capranica. That Roland happened to be walking by only to be beset upon by foes and stabbed his invincible sword in the stone may be less reasonable but it\u2019s even more awesome.</p>\n<p>Amusing anecdote typical of Rome: there were three workmen lounging around at the entrance to the alley.

I wrote about that marble foot <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12170\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than seven years ago</a> when it got a shiny new pedicure transforming it from the gunky blackened thing I remembered from childhood to a clean white. The news accounts at the time said it had a new fence around it, and so it does, a simple black iron square band. It\u2019s not as bright white as it was seven years ago, but frankly I think the lived-in look suits it better. I\u2019m happy it got some attention amidst the unstoppable avalanche of work that always needs doing in so ancient a city.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-53054\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-side-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-side-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-side-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-side-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-side-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pie' di Marmo, side view.\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-53055\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-front-200x267.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-front-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-front-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-front-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pie-di-marmo-front-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Pie' di marmo, front view.\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Random street marbles\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53051\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53051#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53022\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53022\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The walls, awake this time\">The walls, awake this time</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, October 22nd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Where were we? Right. The Aurelian Walls south where the Appia Antica begins. Today it\u2019s known as the Porta San Sebastiano after the Christian soldier martyred by Diocletian whose remains are interred in the basilica that bears his name a couple of miles down the Appia, but its original name when it was built by Aurelian around 275 A.D. was the Porta Appia, for obvious reasons, and the museum\u2019s labels and maps refer to it by the Aurelian name.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gate-approach.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53024\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gate-approach-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gate-approach-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gate-approach-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gate-approach-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gate-approach-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"View of the Arch of Drusus backed by the towers of the Porta Appia as you approach from the north on the Via San Sebastiano.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Before you reach the huge gate with its two crenelated towers that make it look like a storybook medieval castle, there\u2019s a much smaller, rather hard-worn Roman arch called the Arch of Drusus. It bears no relation to your friendly neighborhood blogger and probably no relation to any of the other Drusi who have graced (or disgraced) the family name either. It was used as part of an extension of the Aqua Marcia added by Caracalla in the early third century to feed the enormous thirst of his new baths. It pre-existed the construction of the spur, however. All that\u2019s left of it now is a single arch \u2014 it used to be a triple \u2014 with some concrete and brick on top that likely dates to after the Caracalla-era construction.</p>\n<p>You can see from the picture that the arch appears as you approach on the Via Sebastiano (closed to traffic on Sundays, btw, so pedestrians and bikes get to spread out nicely). Click to enlarge the image because the arch almost disappears against the towering backdrop of the gate. Here it is as seen from the window of the first gallery in the museum:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Seb.jpg\"><img alt=\"Arch of Drusus viewed through the window of the first gallery in the Museo delle Mura.\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-53026\" height=\"573\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Seb-430x573.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Seb-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Seb-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Seb-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Porta-San-Seb-768x1024.jpg 768w\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Incidentally, the black and white mosaic inlaid in the marble floor of that first gallery (see pic from yesterday) is not ancient. The marble floor isn\u2019t either. They were installed in 1942-1943 when the Porta Appia was used as an office by the Secretary of the Fascist Party Ettore Muti. There are no labels claiming that modification, needless to say. </p>\n<p>Actually, there are very few in the way of information panels in the whole museum. The first room did have a nice touchscreen with photos and explanations of the walls (all of them) and the gates from the early Servian ones to the Aurelian, the modifications of Honorius, and later demolitions/reconstructions by a slew of Popes. It was comprehensive and the text is available in Italian and English. I wish they sold a version in book or DVD form, but they don\u2019t sell anything. No gift shop at all. That makes me a sad panda, especially since I really want a foldout version of this model:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Map-with-walls.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-53027\" height=\"323\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Map-with-walls-430x323.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Map-with-walls-430x323.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Map-with-walls-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Map-with-walls-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Map-with-walls-768x576.jpg 768w\" title=\"Model of Servian and Aurelian walls with gates and major city sites marked.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Recycled-material-in-steps.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53030\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Recycled-material-in-steps-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Recycled-material-in-steps-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Recycled-material-in-steps-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Recycled-material-in-steps-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Recycled-material-in-steps-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Recycled material visible in steps.\" width=\"113\"/></a>A few more details about the awesome wall walk. There are more stairs than you might expect leading up to and down from the towers, and they have pretty hefty rises. None of the information placards mentioned the steps, so they could date to Aurelian, Honorius or later alterations, or be a mixture. I bring them up because they very clearly employ recycled building materials, a practice that was done from ancient times all through to 20th century when laws against cannibalizing cultural patrimony were passed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Arrow-slit.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53031\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Arrow-slit-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Arrow-slit-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Arrow-slit-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Arrow-slit-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Arrow-slit-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Arrow slit in tower wall.\" width=\"113\"/></a>Here is an arrow slit just because I think arrow slits are cool, and this one is deep in an ancient wall therefore extra cool. The bow windows in the Porta Appia were modified as late as 1848 when they were made more rectangular to accommodate modern artillery, as you can see in this image. A pigeon gave me a brutal side-eye through one of those and it would have made such an awesome picture but the little bugger flew off before I could capture him.</p>\n<p>The third tower along the wall walk route is nifty for two reasons: it retains its original configuration from <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fresco-of-Virgin-and-Child.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53029\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fresco-of-Virgin-and-Child-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fresco-of-Virgin-and-Child-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fresco-of-Virgin-and-Child-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fresco-of-Virgin-and-Child-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fresco-of-Virgin-and-Child-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Fresco of Virgin and Child on the exterior of the third tower.\" width=\"113\"/></a>the modifications of Honorius (401-402 A.D.) and because a hermit is believed to have lived there in the Middle Ages. A fresco of the Virgin Mary and Child was painted on the exterior during that time. It was recently restored and still looks pretty bad, not unexpectedly so given its exposure to the elements for centuries and the budget nature of the original work.</p>\n<p>I mentioned in my bleary post yesterday that the interiors of the two massive flanking towers were cool. They are suffused with light, unlike the towers in the wall, and the west tower has a fascinating series of graffiti preserved and embedded in its new(ish) plaster walls. I assume these came from the outside of the gate which still has a bunch of medieval inscriptions carved into its marble, but there were no panels explaining them.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-stuff.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-53038\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-stuff-200x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-stuff-200x90.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-stuff-150x67.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-stuff-768x345.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-stuff-430x193.jpg 430w\" title=\"Preserved writing and drawings inside the west tower.\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Graffiti-in-west-tower.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-53041\" height=\"67\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Graffiti-in-west-tower-200x67.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Graffiti-in-west-tower-200x67.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Graffiti-in-west-tower-150x50.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Graffiti-in-west-tower-768x258.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Graffiti-in-west-tower-430x144.jpg 430w\" title=\"More writing preserved in west tower.\" width=\"200\"/></a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-writing-in-west-tower.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-53039\" height=\"178\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-writing-in-west-tower-200x178.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-writing-in-west-tower-200x178.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-writing-in-west-tower-150x134.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-writing-in-west-tower-768x685.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-writing-in-west-tower-430x383.jpg 430w\" title=\"Preserved writing in west tower\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-drawing-in-west-tower.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-53040\" height=\"172\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-drawing-in-west-tower-200x172.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-drawing-in-west-tower-200x172.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-drawing-in-west-tower-150x129.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-drawing-in-west-tower-768x662.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Preserved-drawing-in-west-tower-430x370.jpg 430w\" title=\"Preserved drawing in west tower\" width=\"200\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>There you have it.

Just buzz to be let in and up you go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Museum-bridge.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53016\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Museum-bridge-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Museum-bridge-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Museum-bridge-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Museum-bridge-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Museum-bridge-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"The first room with casts from other walls and gates.\" width=\"113\"/></a>The contents are limited \u2014 a few plaster casts of brick crosses from surviving sections of the walls and gates, plastic models of the phases of construction, a topographical map illustrating the perimeter of the Servian Wall (ca. 4th century B.C.) and the far larger expansion of the city\u2019s defenses built by Aurelian (271-275 A.D.).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Beginning-of-wall-walk.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53017\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Beginning-of-wall-walk-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Beginning-of-wall-walk-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Beginning-of-wall-walk-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Beginning-of-wall-walk-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Beginning-of-wall-walk-430x573.jpg 430w\" title=\"Beginning of wall walk\" width=\"113\"/></a>The real treasure here is the museum itself. It\u2019s really misnamed. It should be the Museo nelle Mura, the Museum in the Walls, instead of the Museum of the Walls. The modest displays are eclipsed by a truly fantastic wall walk that takes you through four of the surviving towers in the stretch of the Aurelian Wall, later given a second story by Honorius with more arrow slits and a roof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scale.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Wee spiral staircase to the right flanking tower.\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53019\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scale-113x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scale-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scale-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scale-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scale-430x573.jpg 430w\" width=\"113\"/></a>The interior spaces, particularly in the two massive gate towers, are magnificent, but you will never get a view of Rome and environs like you do from the very top of the right tower. That\u2019s if you dare to take the tiniest, tightest of spiral staircases to get up there, which of course I did because I am a most generous blogger.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the wall walk seen from above:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/View-of-walk-from-top-terrace.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-53018\" height=\"573\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/View-of-walk-from-top-terrace-430x573.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/View-of-walk-from-top-terrace-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/View-of-walk-from-top-terrace-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/View-of-walk-from-top-terrace-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/View-of-walk-from-top-terrace-768x1024.jpg 768w\" title=\"View of walk from top terrace.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the Appia Antica heading south from the gate:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Appia-from-terrace.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-53020\" height=\"573\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Appia-from-terrace-430x573.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Appia-from-terrace-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Appia-from-terrace-113x150.jpg 113w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Appia-from-terrace-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Appia-from-terrace-768x1024.jpg 768w\" title=\"Appia Antica from the gate terrace.\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>There\u2019s much more, but that will have to tide you over for now as my moribund state demands sleep. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Walking the walls at the Porta Appia\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53013\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53013#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

Part of what is today called the Porta Maggiore after the nearby Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Two inscriptions identify the tomb\u2019s owner. The complete one says: EST HOC MONIMENTUM MARGEI VERGILEI EURSYACIS PISTORIS REDEMPTORIS APPARET, meaning \u201cThis is the monument of Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces, baker contractor, public servant. His name, the Latin nomen and Greek cognomen, could be indications that he was a freedman, a manumitted slave who became a wealthy and successful baker. His name is not followed by L or LIB for libertinus to denote freedman status, however. It wasn\u2019t a requirement that freedmen identify themselves this way, but it was a widespread practice. He could also have just been a poor immigrant who made good and wanted to broadcast as much in his own stab at immortality with a tomb dedicated to his success in business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-54454\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Magazzino_dei_Doli_Ostia_Antica_2006-09-08-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Store of Dolii in Ostia Antica.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The three surviving facades of the tomb feature a unique design: three rows in five columns of hollow circles in the third story.

(Dolia were used to store pretty much every foodstuff, liquid and solid \u2014 wine, oil, fresh and dried fruits and vegetables, salted ham, fish, fish guts in the fermentation of garum.

Generously funded by the Wellcome Trust, which is also offering <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/2012/News/WTP040557.htm\" target=\"_blank\">a critical workshop on how best to cope with a zombie outbreak</a>, <em>Harnessing the Power of the Criminal Corpse</em> brings together experts in archaeology, medical history, folklore, philosophy and literature from the University of Leicester, the University of Hertfordshire and the National University of Ireland to examine how the corpses of executed criminals were used as cautionary tales in the gibbet and as sources of scientific knowledge on the dissection table, the significance they were imbued with culturally and morally, and the lasting effect they had on the physical landscape and on our attitudes about the treatment of the dead body.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis is a great opportunity to study the history of the body at a fascinating time,\u201d said Professor Sarah Tarlow, an archaeologist at the University of Leicester and the leader of the team. \u201cThis is a key period in the development of modern medical knowledge, where the inside of the body was carefully explored and described by anatomists. At the same time it was generally believed that the touch of a hanged man\u2019s hand could cure cancers of the neck, and that suicides should be buried with a stake through their bodies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe emotional power of the dead body of the criminal was exploited by the State to enforce conformity with the law, they were exploited as sources of scientific or medical knowledge; they gave meaning to places in the landscape, for example, \u2018Gibbet Hills\u2019 and so on. At a popular level, their ghosts were believed to stalk the living and their bodies to be places of lurking malevolence which might threaten our comfortable lives \u2013 as Frankenstein\u2019s monster did.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>(I always feel compelled to defend the creature when he\u2019s described as intrinsically evil. He was intrinsically <em>repulsive</em> with his papery skin and yellow eyes, but he was much more than the sum of his Abby Normal parts and had his creator/father not been so mean to him, he would never have killed children and best friends and nice ladies on their wedding night. It\u2019s the hubristic scientist, the modern Prometheus, the grave-robbing narcissist who thinks he can do whatever he wants in the name of scientific advancement whose selfishness, cowardice and obstinacy destroy everyone he loves.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Captain-Kidd-executed-1701-gibbet.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Captain Kidd hanging in a gibbet after 1701 execution\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-11184\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 105px) 100vw, 105px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Captain-Kidd-executed-1701-gibbet-105x150.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Captain-Kidd-executed-1701-gibbet-105x150.png 105w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Captain-Kidd-executed-1701-gibbet-210x300.png 210w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Captain-Kidd-executed-1701-gibbet.png 486w\" title=\"Captain Kidd hanging in a gibbet after 1701 execution\" width=\"105\"/></a>The team will spend five years following the journey of the criminal body through six strands of study. The first is the <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/research/criminal-bodies-1/justice\" target=\"_blank\">criminal justice system</a>, wherein will be examined the crime itself, the legal proceedings at trial, the sentences which were sometimes applied and sometimes commuted, with a subsequent focus on how the body of the executed criminal was used to support the judicial system that created it. Although there\u2019s been plenty of study of the crime and punishment from trial to execution, this research will tread new ground in its study of the body after execution. The team will trace the physical movements of the bodies through the justice system and the people \u2014 sheriffs, judges, court officers, legal commentators \u2014 involved in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Strand two focuses on the voyage of the criminal corpse through <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/research/criminal-bodies-1/anatomical\" target=\"_blank\">the anatomical world</a>, how executed bodies were used to sustain the explosion of private anatomy schools, all of which required copious numbers of cadavers for their students to get their money\u2019s worth. The team will examine the condition of the corpses when they arrived and how they were dissected and put on display. The <a href=\"http://www.wellcomecollection.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Wellcome Collection</a>, the museum of medical history connected to the Trust funding this program, has a fair few human specimens which traveled this road.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hogarth-Reward-of-Cruelty.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The Reward of Cruelty, satirical depiction of anatomized criminal by William Hogarth, 1751\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-21029\" height=\"256\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hogarth-Reward-of-Cruelty-200x256.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hogarth-Reward-of-Cruelty-200x256.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hogarth-Reward-of-Cruelty-430x551.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hogarth-Reward-of-Cruelty.jpg 900w\" title=\"The Reward of Cruelty, satirical depiction of anatomized criminal by William Hogarth, 1751\" width=\"200\"/></a>The third strand, <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/research/criminal-bodies-1/place\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cPlacing the Criminal Corpse,\u201d</a> pivots off the first two strands to focus on the corpse on display, whether in the gibbet or in the anatomy class or museum, through to its burial.

This connects to strand four in its examination of folkloric traditions but will study the interplay between traditions and literary fiction.</p>\n<p>The last strand, <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/research/criminal-bodies-1/remembered\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Criminal Corpse Remembered,\u201d</a> brings it all together through a comparative analysis of historical attitudes towards the criminal corpse and contemporary ones. It will look at how our own anxieties and ambivalence about how we treat the dead are informed by the symbolic and practical significance with which the criminal corpse was imbued from the late 17th century through the mid-19th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Burkes-death-mask-and-pocketbook.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Death mask and a pocketbook made from the skin of executed serial murderer/resurrection man Burke\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-21025\" height=\"282\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Burkes-death-mask-and-pocketbook-200x282.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Burkes-death-mask-and-pocketbook-200x282.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Burkes-death-mask-and-pocketbook-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Burkes-death-mask-and-pocketbook-430x607.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Burkes-death-mask-and-pocketbook.jpg 724w\" title=\"Death mask and a pocketbook made from the skin of executed serial murderer/resurrection man Burke\" width=\"200\"/></a>The <em>Harnessing the Power of the Criminal Corpse</em> <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/research/criminal-bodies-1\" target=\"_blank\">project website</a> is already great reading but will continue to expand as the program proceeds.

After nearly a year of preliminary study, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12033\" target=\"_blank\">conservation began in July of 2011</a> and continued through spring of this year. The famous green curtain dress and the burgundy ball gown Scarlett wore to Ashley\u2019s birthday party were stabilized enough to be sent across the ocean so they could be displayed for the first time in 30 years at the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-hollywood-costume/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hollywood Costume</em></a> exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</p>\n<p>Conservators from the <a href=\"http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Ransom Center</a> at the University of Texas at Austin spent 180 hours painstakingly reinforcing weakened areas and correcting previous attempts at restoration on the green curtain dress, the burgundy ball gown and the green velvet dressing gown. The fabrics used by costume designer Walter Plunkett are heavy and the construction was not intended to last. Neither were they authentically period, but rather streamlined versions in keeping with 1930s glamour, which means some of the techniques used are unique and not the sort of thing conservators had encountered before restoring period clothing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Burgundy-ball-gown.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Scarlett's burgundy ball gown\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7380\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 129px) 100vw, 129px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Burgundy-ball-gown-129x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Burgundy-ball-gown-129x150.jpg 129w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Burgundy-ball-gown-258x300.jpg 258w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Burgundy-ball-gown.jpg 387w\" title=\"Scarlett's burgundy ball gown\" width=\"129\"/></a>For example, the bustle at the back of the burgundy ball gown was gathered and stitched into place. Over the years that the dress was on display before it was donated to the Ransom Center along with the rest of producer David O. Selznick\u2019s collection in the 1980s, the bustle had been repaired repeatedly. Old stitches were removed and new ones put in, which means many new holes poked through the fabric. Over decades, even the tiny holes left by needles add up, so by the time the Ransom Center got the dress, the area on the waist where the bustle was attached was weak and unable to support the weight of the velvet gathered there.</p>\n<p>In order to stabilize the garment, conservators first had to determine the original shape and draping of the bustle. Then they had to remove as few of the repair stitches as necessary to return the dress to the shape Plunkett had created. The pierced and weakened areas of the fabric were reinforced with Japanese tissue (a thin but strong paper made from plant fibers) and other stabilization techniques. This accomplished both goals of the conservation: stabilization with as little interference as possible, and the restoration of the original look of the gown.</p>\n<p>The ostrich feathers on the burgundy dress were another major headache. At some point, new feathers had been added, but they weren\u2019t stitched in the same way as the originals so they didn\u2019t have the elegant curl Plunkett\u2019s original feathers had. Some feathers fell out, but it seems over time the fabric stretched so it looked like more feathers were missing than had actually been lost. Half-assed replacements that were neither the right color nor the right shape were added, making it look more Old West saloon girl than Scarlett O\u2019Hara vixen. See this video for details on the ostrich feather conservation:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCHr14s3HM&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The green curtain dress also had problems with sagging and weak points along the waistline. The heavy pleated velvet of the skirt had been sewn to a slim cotton bodice to ensure there was no extra bulk whatsoever at Vivien Leigh\u2019s waist. At first conservators planned to remove repair stitches and reset the pleats to their original depth and location, but they were unable to determine the exact original locations and stitches of the pleats. Instead they decided to go with the conservative option and stabilize the pleats as they were. You can see some of the work on the curtain dress in this video:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxHlg5FHwuY&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The green velvet dressing gown, which at first glance appeared to be one of the better preserved dresses in the collection, turned out to have significant damage. There were stress tears in the skirt and sleeves, splits, holes, loose threads and loose sequins.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke8eCtoYhuw&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>Although the conservation team was able to mitigate some of these problems, the gown is in no shape for a transoceanic voyage. It will remain at the Ransom Center in a carefully climate- and moisture-controlled environment.</p>\n<p>The Victoria and Albert exhibition runs from October 20, 2012 through January 27, 2013. After that, the burgundy and curtain dresses will return to Austin in preparation for the 75th anniversary <em>Gone With The Wind</em> exhibition in 2014. The dressing gown is planned to be on display in that exhibition since it won\u2019t have to travel far. They already have a <a href=\"http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/gwtw/\" target=\"_blank\">nice companion online exhibition</a> on the web with details about the casting of the movie, the purchase of the book and, my favorite part, <a href=\"http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/web/gwtw/wardrobe/\" target=\"_blank\">wardrobe and makeup</a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the blue velvet peignoir and Scarlett\u2019s wedding dress and veil are too fragile even to conserve. They will be preserved in their current condition in storage and will not go back on display.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s dresses conserved and on display\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20974\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20974#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-20945\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20945\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The oldest piggy banks are also the cutest\">The oldest piggy banks are also the cutest</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, October 28th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Containers with slots have been used as home savings banks since ancient times.

Before he left his village to start his new life, an old man told him to take the lesson of the piggy bank: if you stuff yourself full of treasure, you will eventually be smashed. Instead, live frugally, like the humble clay money box itself. That way you\u2019ll earn your money gradually, honorably, and nobody will be looking to bust you open to get to riches within. Gongsun Hong took the elder\u2019s advice and became known far and wide for his honesty, plain living and incorruptibility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Tang-Dynasty-clay-bank-9th-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Tang Dynasty clay bank, 9th century\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20960\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Tang-Dynasty-clay-bank-9th-c-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Tang-Dynasty-clay-bank-9th-c-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Tang-Dynasty-clay-bank-9th-c-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Tang-Dynasty-clay-bank-9th-c-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Tang-Dynasty-clay-bank-9th-c.jpg 480w\" title=\"Tang Dynasty clay bank, 9th century\" width=\"112\"/></a>By the Tang Dynasty in the 9th century A.D., the official clay money boxes of antiquity had transformed into the household savings devices, especially for children, that piggy banks are today.

In medieval England, an orange clay called \u201cpygg\u201d (pronounced \u201cpug\u201d in Middle English) was used to make a variety of inexpensive household containers, including coin jars. Again, the pygg jars had a small opening or slot to slide coins into but would have to be broken for the coins to be retrieved.</p>\n<p>Then came the <a href=\"http://eweb.furman.edu/~mmenzer/gvs/what.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Great Vowel Shift</a>. Between 1400 and 1700, English vowels came to be formed increasingly higher up and forward in the mouth. This turned the \u201cpug\u201d sound of \u201cpygg\u201d into \u201cpig,\u201d and although by the 18th century pygg was no longer the commonly used clay, the name had stuck, thus giving artisans a new design theme in the creation of money boxes for the home. Because their total destruction was a key design element, very few of these have survived.

That honor goes to the Majapahit Empire of Southeast Asia. Based on the island of Java, the Majapahit Empire reigned over what is today the Indonesian archipelago from 1293 to 1500. After defeating an invasion fleet of Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan, Majapahit settled into a mutually beneficially trading relationship with China and other countries whose ships, laden with spices and other merchandise, passed through the archipelago.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Kepeng-coin.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Kepeng coin, obverse and reverse\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20961\" height=\"80\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Kepeng-coin-150x80.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Kepeng-coin-150x80.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Kepeng-coin-200x106.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Kepeng-coin-430x229.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Kepeng-coin.jpg 1387w\" title=\"Kepeng coin, obverse and reverse\" width=\"150\"/></a>Somewhere around 1300, an enormous quantity of Chinese copper kepeng coins were imported into Majapahit. Although Java had had a gold and silver coin economy for centuries by then, the increase in non-agricultural prosperity under the Majapahit Empire created a new need for lower value cash with which to purchase goods and services. After the initial imports, the Majapahit began to cast copper coins of their own in the shape of the Chinese kepeng. Once regular people started having cash on hand, they needed a place to store it at home. Enter the first pig-shaped piggy banks.</p>\n<p>A celeng is a wild boar native to the jungles of Java. As with all its porcine cousins, these boars are fertile, have large appetites and enjoy wallowing in the earth. As such they are symbols of prosperity, of good fortune and of a connection to spirits of the earth. It makes sense, therefore, that clay taken from the earth would be shaped into a fat little pig and used for keeping coins. Prosperity literally lies within its adorable round belly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Majapahit-piggy-bank-in-National-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Majapahit piggy bank in National Museum\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20952\" height=\"129\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Majapahit-piggy-bank-in-National-Museum-150x129.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Majapahit-piggy-bank-in-National-Museum-150x129.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Majapahit-piggy-bank-in-National-Museum-200x172.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Majapahit-piggy-bank-in-National-Museum-430x371.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Majapahit-piggy-bank-in-National-Museum.jpg 567w\" title=\"Majapahit piggy bank in National Museum\" width=\"150\"/></a>By the 15th century, terracotta piggy banks were made in all shapes and sizes.

On May 23rd, 1861, just over a month after the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter started the Civil War, an overwhelming majority of Virginia\u2019s voters ratified the articles of secession which had been passed by the General Assembly\u2019s secession convention on April 17th. The next morning just before dawn, eight regiments of federal troops crossed the Potomac River to claim Arlington Heights and Alexandria, Virginia. Among them was a regiment of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry, also known as the Fire Zouaves because it was principally composed of New York City firefighters, commanded by its dashing twenty-four-year-old colonel, Elmer E. Ellsworth.</p>\n<p>Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth was born April 11th, 1837 in Malta, a small town in Saratoga County, New York. He had always been fascinated by the military and had made a personal study of it, but he didn\u2019t have the formal education to be accepted at West Point. He joined local militias and distinguished himself as a drillmaster. To seek employment sufficiently gainful to impress his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s father, he moved to Chicago to study law. There he formed his first troop of Zouaves, inspired by the exploits of the French Army in the Crimean War that he had read so much about. He designed their red and blue uniforms and trained them to become a crack drill team. Their gaudy colors and sharp moves made them and their leader famous as they toured the major cities of the northeast in the summer of 1860.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Col-Elmer-Ellsworth-Matthew-Brady.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Col.

There he worked as a law clerk and for Lincoln\u2019s presidential campaign. Ellsworth became a good friend of Abraham, Mary and the children. When Lincoln won the election, Ellsworth was put in charge of security for his trip to Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>With the onset of hostilities, Ellsworth saw his chance to finally do more than run a drill team, so he returned to New York and recruited the 1st New York Fire Zouaves which became the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry. They were one of the first recruited regiments to arrive in Washington, D.C., and although they had a reputation as undisciplined rakehells (30 women were found in their camp when they got to D.C.), they also immediately proved their valour by fighting fires in the city.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/period-lithograph-1861-May-24-death-of-Col-Ellsworth.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Lithograph of the death of Col.

They encountered no resistance as they stationed troops in strategic locations around Alexandria, like the train station and telegraph office. Seeing a massive Confederate flag large enough to be seen from a spyglass at the White House eight miles away flying over the Marshall House Inn on the corner of King Street and Pitt Street, Colonel Ellsworth and a small detachment entered the hotel to take down the flag. Inside they encountered James W. Jackson, the owner of the hotel, who told them he was just a guest. They made their way to the rooftop where Ellsworth cut down the flag. He was rolling it up on the way back down the stairs when Jim Jackson appeared on the second floor landing wielding a double-barrel shotgun (<a href=\"http://www.civilwar.si.edu/firstblood_shotgun.html\" target=\"_blank\">now in the Smithsonian</a>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Corporal-Francis-E.-Brownell.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Francis E.

Brownell immediately responded, shooting Jackson in the face with his Army-issue Model 1855 U.S. percussion rifle (<a href=\"http://www.civilwar.si.edu/firstblood_1855rifle.html\" target=\"_blank\">also in the Smithsonian</a>), and then running him through with the bayonet as he fell to the floor. Brownell would later receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for this act. Although he received it in 1877, his \u201cshooting the murderer of Col. Ellsworth,\u201d as the inscription on the medal states, was the first in the Civil War to merit the Congressional Medal of Honor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-funeral-White-House.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ellsworth's funeral in the East Room of the White House, drawing on May 25th, 1861, by artist Alfred Waud\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20928\" height=\"107\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-funeral-White-House-150x107.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-funeral-White-House-150x107.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-funeral-White-House-200x142.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-funeral-White-House-430x306.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ellsworth's funeral in the East Room of the White House, drawing on May 25th, 1861, by artist Alfred Waud\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Zouaves, heartbroken by the loss of their beloved leader, were sent to dig earthworks outside of Alexandria out of fear that they would destroy the city in retaliation. Ellsworth\u2019s body and the flag he had died to capture were transported to the Washington Navy Yard. The Lincolns were devastated by the news of his death. By order of the President, Ellsworth\u2019s body was taken to the East Room of the White House to lie in state. Thousands came to pay their last respects. Lincoln was seen openly weeping in grief. He told a group of dignitaries who approached him, \u201cExcuse me but I cannot talk. I will make no apology, gentlemen, for my weakness but I knew Ellsworth well, and held him in great regard.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-memorial-envelope.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ellsworth memorial envelope\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20926\" height=\"85\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-memorial-envelope-150x85.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-memorial-envelope-150x85.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-memorial-envelope-200x114.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworth-memorial-envelope-430x245.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ellsworth memorial envelope\" width=\"150\"/></a>Carried by telegraph and newspapers, word of Ellsworth\u2019s death spread like wildfire across the North. He became an instant martyr, the first Union officer to die at the hands of those dastardly ambushing rebels. His youth, good looks and death for the cause made him an ideal symbolic figure for the Union to rally around. His image and death scene were sold all over the North on lithographs, prints, ceramic mugs, plates, even envelopes. Souvenir hunters flooded the Marshall House, stripping it of the furniture, carpeting, window shutters, stairs, handrail, floorboards and flagpole.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworths-grave.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Ellsworth's grave in Mechanicsville, New York\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20936\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Ellsworths-grave-34x150.jpg\" title=\"Ellsworth's grave in Mechanicsville, New York\" width=\"34\"/></a>After the funeral service in the East Room, Ellsworth\u2019s body was brought by train home to New York escorted by Francis Brownell, who carried the Marshall House Flag with him.

The <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20067\" target=\"_blank\">figure was definitely carved from a piece of the Chinga meteorite</a> which fell near the Mongolian-Siberian border 15,000 years ago. It\u2019s the part about it being an 11th century B\u00f6n culture artifact that is suspect, and, even more sadly, the part about it having been found during Ernst Sch\u00e4fer\u2019s Tibet expedition. Buddhism expert Achim Bayer from Dongguk University in South Korea argues persuasively <a href=\"http://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/pdf/publikationen/Bayer_2012-Trousers.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in this article (pdf)</a> that the statue\u2019s features mark it as a European counterfeit probably made between 1910 and 1970.</p>\n<p>Bayer first notes that the team led by University of Stuttgart planetologist Dr. Elmar Buchner included no experts in Tibetan or Mongolian art, no ethnologists, no archaeologists. The team\u2019s expertise rested entirely on the fields of mineralogy and planetary science, which is great for the analysis of the material but left them relying on what amounts to hearsay on the question of the sculpture\u2019s origin. According to Bayer, Buchner\u2019s team contacted museums and some individuals to determine which character from Tibetan culture the figure might represent, but no Tibetologists, a glaring oversight, especially considering that one of the paper\u2019s authors is from the University of Vienna which has a well-known and highly respected South Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies department.</p>\n<p>Had they sought out the input of such experts in the field, Bayer believes they would have immediately been confronted with severe doubts about the statue\u2019s authenticity. The pseudo-Tibetan characteristics of the iconography are glaringly obvious, in his opinion. He brings up 13 main examples, but there are even more minor issues. The posture, positioning and design of the hands, legs and feet are wrong, as is the full beard. The halos, the small one behind the head and the large one behind the body, are suspiciously round and plain. Halos are elaborately decorated in Tibetan art and either do not appear on metal statues or appear only as separate pieces.</p>\n<p>The biggest red flags are with the garments. The sleeves, hat and cape do not match those worn by Vai\u015brava\u1e47a and other deities, or really anything at all in the Tibetan tradition \u2014 the knotted and draped cape looks more Roman than Asian \u2014  but it\u2019s the shoes and pants that get top billing on Bayer\u2019s list of errors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>1. The lama is neither barefoot nor does he wear traditional boots. The shoes cover the feet, like European shoes, up to the ankles and no further.<br/>\n2. Obviously, the trousers worn by the lama do not resemble anything seen in Tibetan or Mongolian sculpture. Traditional statues feature robes, occasionally armour at the shins, but never trousers. The slits at the end of the trousers are probably meant<br/>\nto make a vaguely oriental, mediaeval or pastoral impression.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That seems to be the common thread with all these would-be Tibetan elements: they\u2019re what a Westerner with little knowledge of Tibetan and Buddhist iconography would imagine is Tibetan based on, say, a two dimensional image they\u2019ve seen in a book. Tibet became a subject of fascination in Europe in the early 20th century, but since its traditional craftsmanship and iconography were not well-known, artists relied on images of sculptures and their own imaginations to create objects for the Tibetica market. The consumers didn\u2019t know any better either. Genuine Tibetan scholarship took root in the European academy in 1970, and the art and antiquities markets followed suit. Bayer therefore places the creation of the Iron Man piece in the period between the dawn of European fascination with Tibetan art (ca. 1910) and the actual study of it (ca. 1970).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JLKipling_Kim_The_Lama.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='\"Kim and the Lama\" by J.L.

J.L. Kipling was a sculptor, art teacher and museum curator in India for decades starting in 1865. The illustrations depicting Kim\u2019s Lama mentor have several elements in common with Iron Man: the non-standard short hat, the siddha-like earrings, even the swastika on his begging bowl which is positioned in the middle of his torso like it is on the statue (see illustration <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/kim_____00kipl#page/44/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\">on page 44</a>).

As much as I\u2019d like it to be so because it would make the whole Sch\u00e4fer story even better, it\u2019s unlikely that local craftsmen would have made so many iconographic errors. It\u2019s more likely that the raw meteorite chunk made it to Europe from Asia and was carved there, either for the general market in Tibet artifacts or for the market in Nazi memorabilia. In the latter case, it would likely have been commissioned with the specific intent of selling it as an artifact from the famous Sch\u00e4fer expedition.</p>\n<p>Bayer has corresponded with Buchner and asked him what evidence the team was given for the Sch\u00e4fer provenance. The answer is none. They have no evidence whatsoever beyond the word of the anonymous collector who believed that\u2019s where it came from. Bayer\u2019s doubts on the provenance were confirmed by researcher Isrun Engelhardt, an expert on Sch\u00e4fer expeditions, who is also looking into the Iron Man story and believes the connection to Sch\u00e4fer is fiction.</p>\n<p><img alt=\":(\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frown.gif\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\"/></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"\u201cIron Man\u201d meteorite carving may be fake\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20889\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20889#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-20840\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20840\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Stone slabs stolen from Bront\u00eb chapel churchyard\">Stone slabs stolen from Bront\u00eb chapel churchyard</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, October 25th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Old-Bell-Chapel.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Old Bell Chapel\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20867\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Old-Bell-Chapel-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Old-Bell-Chapel-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Old-Bell-Chapel-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Old-Bell-Chapel-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Old-Bell-Chapel.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Old Bell Chapel\" width=\"150\"/></a>More than one hundred feet of gravestones, paving stones and coping stones have been <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/police-appeal-after-organised-gang-desecrate-bront-family-church-8222610.html\" target=\"_blank\">stolen from the churchyard of the Old Bell Chapel</a> (also known as the Bront\u00eb Bell Chapel because Patrick Bront\u00eb, father of the literary sisters, was the curate there from 1815 to 1820) in the West Yorkshire village of Thornton.

There was an even earlier church known as Saint Leonard\u2019s built in 1587 (the date stone is part of the walls of the chapel today), but in 1612 it was rebuilt from scratch and called Saint James\u2019 Church.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Patrick-Bront\u00eb-in-old-age.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Patrick Bront\u00eb in old age\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20865\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Patrick-Bront\u00eb-in-old-age-80x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Patrick-Bront\u00eb-in-old-age-80x150.jpg 80w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Patrick-Bront\u00eb-in-old-age-161x300.jpg 161w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Patrick-Bront\u00eb-in-old-age.jpg 409w\" title=\"Patrick Bront\u00eb in old age\" width=\"80\"/></a>By the time Patrick Bront\u00eb arrived 200 years later, the chapel was dilapidated. The growing Dissenter movements of the 17th and 18th centuries had turned many people from the small, cramped Anglican church to its Independent Congregationalist competition, the Kipping Chapel. It was still a popular spot for burials, though. The churchyard has seen 6000 burials from 1597 until the last one in 1965, and up until Patrick\u2019s time, people could pay extra and be buried under the floor of the church itself. Bront\u00eb put a stop to that practice because it was making the church smell awful. He also spearheaded a major renovation of the church in 1818, rebuilding the south walls with windows and erecting a bell tower.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bront\u00eb-baptismal-font-St.-James-Church.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bront\u00eb baptismal font, St. James' Church\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20864\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bront\u00eb-baptismal-font-St.-James-Church-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bront\u00eb-baptismal-font-St.-James-Church-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bront\u00eb-baptismal-font-St.-James-Church-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bront\u00eb-baptismal-font-St.-James-Church-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Bront\u00eb-baptismal-font-St.-James-Church.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Bront\u00eb baptismal font, St. James' Church\" width=\"112\"/></a>Although the nearby village of Haworth where the children grew up and Emily and Charlotte would write their masterpieces is more widely associated with Patrick\u2019s clutch of world-famous children, the five of them born during his curacy of St. James\u2019 Church were baptized there: Elizabeth (baptized August 26th, 1815), Charlotte (June 29th, 1816), Patrick Branwell (July 23rd, 1817), Emily (August 26th, 1818) and Ann (March 25th, 1820).

The hilt has an iron wheel pommel engraved with a crosslet cross (a heraldic symbol signifying the spread of Christianity to the four corners of the earth by means of four Latin crosses combined so that their tops point north, south, east and west), a leather-wrapped grip and a straight cross-guard. It is nine inches (23.2 centimeters) long, bringing the total length of the sword to an impressive three feet nine and 35/64 inches (115.7 centimeters).</p>\n<p>The sword was made in Italy in the mid-14th century. Its first duty was diplomatic, as a gift to the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt al-Nasir Hasan from Peter I, King of Cyprus. By Peter\u2019s time, Cyprus was the last Crusader state in existence. Although he held the titles of King of Jerusalem and Count of Tripoli, these were in name only, and even the empty titles weren\u2019t exactly grounded in valid claims of descendance. Peter was a Lusignan, a branch of a French knightly family whose most famous son Guy had married extraordinarily well. Guy de Lusignan was one of those troublesome knights who spent his downtime back home in Aquitaine assaulting people and stealing their stuff. One of his victims was Patrick, the 1st Earl of Salisbury, who died in an ambush by Guy and his scoundrel brothers in 1168.</p>\n<p>The Lusignans were exiled for this crime, reputedly by their overlord Richard, acting Duke of Aquitaine and future Lionhearted king of England, but since Richard was 11 years old in 1168, it was probably his redoubtable mother Eleanor of Aquitaine\u2019s doing. On the other hand, he did get a very early start. Richard was touring the duchy as official Duke just three years later in 1171. His mother was by his side, but by all accounts Richard was a well-established ruler in his early teens. He led his first army when he was 16.</p>\n<p>As was so often the fate of the many and varied violent criminal knights of medieval Europe, Guy de Lusignan made his way to Jerusalem, which had been the capital of a Catholic kingdom in Palestine since the First Crusade in 1099. His older brother was already there and doing well for himself. Guy did even better, marrying Sibylla, sister of Baldwin IV, the leper King of Jersualem, in 1180. Baldwin IV died in 1185. His nephew, Sibylla\u2019s son from a former marriage, was crowned Baldwin V, but he died soon thereafter. Sibylla became Queen, and she saw to it that Guy became King with a clever deception. She had the marriage annulled to appease his enemies in court, on the condition that she could choose her next husband. They agreed, the marriage was annulled and then Sibylla announced that her choice for a new husband was (drumroll) Guy de Lusignan. They remarried in August 1186, and she literally handed him her crown so he could crown himself King of Jerusalem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Guy-of-Lusignan-and-Saladin-by-Jan-Lievens-1625.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Guy de Lusignan and Saladin by Jan Lievens, 1625\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20819\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Guy-of-Lusignan-and-Saladin-by-Jan-Lievens-1625-122x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Guy-of-Lusignan-and-Saladin-by-Jan-Lievens-1625-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Guy-of-Lusignan-and-Saladin-by-Jan-Lievens-1625-200x244.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Guy-of-Lusignan-and-Saladin-by-Jan-Lievens-1625-430x526.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Guy-of-Lusignan-and-Saladin-by-Jan-Lievens-1625.jpg 667w\" title=\"Guy de Lusignan and Saladin by Jan Lievens, 1625\" width=\"122\"/></a>The good times didn\u2019t last. On July 4th, 1187, Guy made the extremely bad call of leading the army of Jerusalem across the desert in the middle of the summer day to relieve Tiberias, under siege by the forces of \u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn, aka Saladin. The Battle of Hattin was a rout, the army destroyed and Guy captured. Saladin moved on to Jerusalem, besieging it from September 20th until its capitulation on October 2nd. The King and Queen of Jerusalem no longer had Jerusalem in their kingdom.</p>\n<p>The movie <em>Kingdom of Heaven</em> depicts a highly fictionalized version of these events. Despite its many, many historical inaccuracies, it is a visually stunning film and well worth watching, especially the director\u2019s cut on Blu-ray. Guy does not get a sympathetic portrayal, to put it mildly.</p>\n<p>Guy was released in 1188. In 1190, he besieged Acre in anticipation of the arrival of the Third Crusade. His wife and daughters died of plague there, leaving him without even the titular right to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He insisted it was still his, though, and appealed to his old overlord Richard, now King Richard I of England and a vigorous crusader. Ultimately he would lose, but as compensation for Guy\u2019s loss of the crown his wife had given him, in 1192 Richard pulled some strings so Guy could purchase Cyprus from the Knights Templar, who had just purchased it from Richard after he had taken it from self-styled Byzantine \u201cemperor\u201d Isaac Komnenos in 1191. Guy ruled there as king (even though it wasn\u2019t really a kingdom) and kept his fake King of Jerusalem title to boot. Thus began the reign of the Lusignan Dynasty in Cyprus which would continue until 1474.</p>\n<p>As for Peter I\u2019s claim to be Count of Tripoli, Qalawun, the seventh Mamluk sultan of Egypt, captured Tripoli on April 27, 1289, putting an end to the Crusader County of Tripoli for good. In 1291, Qalawun\u2019s son and successor, Al-Ashraf Khalil, took Acre, the last fragment of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem remaining in Palestine. After that, Cyprus, once the consolation prize for the failed would-be King of Jerusalem, was the only Crusader kingdom left.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pierre_1er_de_Lusignan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"King Peter I of Cyprus, detail from fresco in Santa Maria Novella in Florence by Andrea di Bonaiuto, 1365\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20815\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 117px) 100vw, 117px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pierre_1er_de_Lusignan-117x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pierre_1er_de_Lusignan-117x150.jpg 117w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pierre_1er_de_Lusignan-200x256.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pierre_1er_de_Lusignan-430x551.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pierre_1er_de_Lusignan.jpg 780w\" title=\"King Peter I of Cyprus, detail from fresco in Santa Maria Novella in Florence by Andrea di Bonaiuto, 1365\" width=\"117\"/></a>Peter\u2019s fondest dream was to recapture Jerusalem for Christianity, redeem the Lusignan name and make his phantom title real. Since his ascension to the throne in 1358, his allies in Armenia had asked him to fight the Turks, who were harrying the town of Korikos. Seeking to establish a bulwark in Asia Minor, Peter sent troops to Korikos who successfully defended the city. Now the Turks were mad, so they sent ships straight to Cyprus. Peter was again successful, and he responded by attacking Antalya and other towns in Asia Minor.</p>\n<p>While all this was going on, he really didn\u2019t need the other Islamic powers on his jock, so he struck a treaty with the Sultan of Mamluk Egypt, even though he was fully planning on attacking them too when he got a moment. That moment came on October 9th, 1365, when a Cypriot force, fortified by ships and troops from Venice, the Knights Hospitaller on Rhodes and the other European powers he had lobbied for three years to support him in this new crusade (which like many of the old crusades turned out to have less to do with religion than with plunder), attacked Alexandria. For the next three days, Peter\u2019s troops sacked the city, helping themselves to its armory which of course included the sword he had given the sultan a few years before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Taking-of-Alexandria-by-Guillaume-de-Machaut-1372-1377.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The Taking of Alexandria, illumination in book by Guillaume de Machaut, 1372-1377\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20816\" height=\"81\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Taking-of-Alexandria-by-Guillaume-de-Machaut-1372-1377-150x81.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Taking-of-Alexandria-by-Guillaume-de-Machaut-1372-1377-150x81.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Taking-of-Alexandria-by-Guillaume-de-Machaut-1372-1377-200x108.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Taking-of-Alexandria-by-Guillaume-de-Machaut-1372-1377-430x233.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Taking-of-Alexandria-by-Guillaume-de-Machaut-1372-1377.jpg 669w\" title=\"The Taking of Alexandria, illumination in book by Guillaume de Machaut, 1372-1377\" width=\"150\"/></a>Peter wanted to move on to capture Cairo, but his patchwork army had zero interest in going against the far stronger Mamluk garrison there, so they just loaded the treasures of Alexandria onto ships and went home. The exact path of the sword from that point on is unknown, but I suspect it ended up back on Cyprus again. The reason I suspect this is the Arabic inscription on the blade, which translates to \u201cDonation to the armory in the frontier city of Alexandria in the days of al-Sayfi Faris al-[Muhammadi].\u201d Amir Faris was a inspector in Alexandria in 1436-7, so that means the sword made its way back to the armory after the Alexandrian Crusade. Mamluk Sultans attacked Cyprus in force in 1426, capturing King Janus and pillaging far and wide, so perhaps they got this hot potato of a sword back then.</p>\n<p>Janus was eventually ransomed, but from then on, the Lusignan kings of Cyprus paid a yearly tribute to the Sultans of Egypt. The last Lusignan king of Cyprus was James II. He died in 1473, just a few months after his marriage to an 18-year-old Venetian noblewoman Catherine Cornaro.

The conclusive victory resulted in the surrender of British General John Burgoyne\u2019s army and was the immediate cause of France\u2019s agreement to negotiate an alliance with the ragtag colonists, which would force Britain to fight on multiple fronts and would provision the Revolutionaries with much-needed arms and money. The Battle of Saratoga is widely considered America\u2019s greatest victory in the War of Independence.</p>\n<p>For some time after Saratoga, General Gates was held in the highest esteem. He and George Washington were treated as equally great heroes, appearing on the cover of almanacs and in contemporary histories as luminaries of the Continental Army. Then things went awry, which is why few people have heard of Gates today while we daily palpate George Washington\u2019s visage on the dollar bill. The main problem was that General Gates had a gigantic ego which led him to take more credit than he may have deserved, and to attempt to secure more power than was wise.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Glorious-Gates-and-Washington-Bickerstaffs-Boston-Almanack-1778.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"&quot;The Glorious Gates and Washington&quot; on the cover of Bickerstaff's Boston Almanack, 1778\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20789\" height=\"128\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Glorious-Gates-and-Washington-Bickerstaffs-Boston-Almanack-1778-e1351004522870-150x128.jpg\" title=\"&quot;The Glorious Gates and Washington&quot; on the cover of Bickerstaff's Boston Almanack, 1778\" width=\"150\"/></a>Born in 1727 in Deptford, England, Horatio Gates was the son of a housekeeper with outstanding connections to the aristocracy and a civil servant. His mother\u2019s service for the Duke of Bolton secured a military commission for her son, who ten years later would move to New York and serve under British General Edward Braddock in the French and Indian War. An injury early on in the campaign kept him from doing much field duty, but by all accounts he was an excellent military administrator.</p>\n<p>By 1769, he was over the British army with its strict class-based promotion system that had kept him stuck at the rank of major for years. He sold his commission and bought a small plantation outside Leetown in what was then Virginia and is now West Virginia. When hostilities broke out with Britain in 1775, Gates immediately presented himself to Washington, whom he had known when they both served under Braddock in the French and Indian War, as an experienced candidate for high rank in the nascent US army. Valuing his inside knowledge of British military tactics and his administrative abilities, Washington appointed him Brigadier General and Adjutant General of the Continental Army.</p>\n<p>Gates wanted a field command, though. In fact, he wanted the whole command, actively lobbying the Continental Congress in 1776 to appoint him Commander-in-Chief instead of Washington. He had many influential backers, especially among the New England delegates, but Washington\u2019s victories at Trenton (after he famously crossed the icy Delaware River standing up in the front of a rowboat) on December 26th, 1776 and at Princeton on January 2nd, 1777 entrenched his position at the head of the army. General Gates was sent to New York State to help Major General Philip Schuyler, commander of the army\u2019s Northern Department.</p>\n<p>When Schuyler lost <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11875\" target=\"_blank\">Fort Ticonderoga</a> to the British, Gates saw his chance (even though he was plenty involved in the failed campaigns). Congress appointed him commander of the Northern Department in August of 1777, a month before the initial encounters with General Burgoyne\u2019s troops at Saratoga.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Benedict-Arnold-Boot-Monument.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Benedict Arnold Boot Monument on the spot where he was shot in Saratoga National Historical Park; his name is not mentioned anywhere on it\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20791\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Benedict-Arnold-Boot-Monument-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Benedict-Arnold-Boot-Monument-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Benedict-Arnold-Boot-Monument-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Benedict-Arnold-Boot-Monument-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Benedict-Arnold-Boot-Monument.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Benedict Arnold Boot Monument on the spot where he was shot in Saratoga National Historical Park; his name is not mentioned anywhere on it\" width=\"112\"/></a>There is much debate on the question of how much credit he deserves for the victory there. His field generals, most notably Benedict Arnold, did much of the on-the-ground fighting, and Arnold\u2019s greatest success repelling a British attack on the left flank happened against Gates\u2019 orders. Arnold was shot in the leg in that battle. The shot broke his leg and killed his horse, which then fell on top of him and broke his leg some more.</p>\n<p>Gates liked his action defensive, always advocating for retreat and holding back. It\u2019s not as glamorous as Arnold\u2019s inspiring charge into the breach, but in this case Gates\u2019 cautiousness served the troops well since it ensured they were well-established in a defensive position on Bemis\u2019 Heights with solid supply lines all the way back to Albany. The British Army, on the other hand, had major supply issues and although they had won the first encounter in September, they did so at great human cost, particularly among their officers who had been successfully targeted by American shooters. The American army was able to cut off British resupply, and the German troops refused Burgoyne\u2019s orders to attack again. On October 17th, Burgoyne surrendered to Gates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Surrender-of-General-Burgoyne-at-Saratoga-by-John-Trumbull-1822.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='\"The Surrender of General Burgoyne at Saratoga\" by John Trumbull, 1822' class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20790\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Surrender-of-General-Burgoyne-at-Saratoga-by-John-Trumbull-1822-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Surrender-of-General-Burgoyne-at-Saratoga-by-John-Trumbull-1822-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Surrender-of-General-Burgoyne-at-Saratoga-by-John-Trumbull-1822-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Surrender-of-General-Burgoyne-at-Saratoga-by-John-Trumbull-1822-430x284.jpg 430w\" title='\"The Surrender of General Burgoyne at Saratoga\" by John Trumbull, 1822' width=\"150\"/></a>Riding high on the Saratoga victory, Gates was appointed head of the Board of War, a civilian position which put him in the absurdly conflict-rife position of having political command over George Washington who was his commanding officer in the army. During this time, he and a cabal of officers, including General Thomas Conway, discussed having Washington fired and Gates appointed Commander-in-Chief in his place. It never went beyond an exchange of letters, and the Conway Cabal, as it became known, failed when Washington found out about it and confronted the grumblers. Gates apologized, resigned from the Board of War, and quietly took command of the Eastern Department.</p>\n<p>In 1780, he was given command of the Southern Department after the British victory in the Siege of Charleston, South Carolina. This would turn out to be his military nadir. At the Battle of Camden on August 16th, Gates\u2019 army was beaten like a red-headed stepchild by General Charles Cornwallis. The British took 1,000 of Gates\u2019 men prisoner and all of his artillery. Gates reputedly distinguished himself in one way: by running 170 miles in three days on horseback to get back to safety up north.</p>\n<p>Congress called for an inquiry into Gates\u2019 conduct in the aftermath of the disaster, but it went nowhere and his supporters had it repealed in 1782. With the end of hostilities in 1783, you\u2019d think his chances to mess up would also end, but Gates was involved in one more embarrassment, the Newburgh conspiracy, in which officers unhappy about the prospect of their promised pensions remaining unpaid due to Congressional brokeness tried to stir up trouble. They proposed Washington be replaced by Gates, but Washington yet again headed them off at the pass by delivering a speech which, though unpersuasive in substance, swayed his officers back to his side with a reference to his now having to wear glasses because of the hardships he\u2019d suffered along with them during this war.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Travelers-Rest.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Traveler's Rest in Leetown, West Virginia, picture from 1933 or later\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-20787\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Travelers-Rest-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Travelers-Rest-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Travelers-Rest-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Travelers-Rest-430x303.jpg 430w\" title=\"Traveler's Rest in Leetown, West Virginia, picture from 1933 or later\" width=\"150\"/></a>Gates went back to Traveler\u2019s Rest, his estate in Virginia, for a few years. Then he sold the estate, manumitted his slaves, and moved to New York. He died in Manhattan in 1806 and was buried in the Trinity Church graveyard on Wall Street. Doubtless he had a gravestone at that point, but over time it was lost, as was the exact location of his burial.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DAR-lay-wreath-at-Trinity-Church-Sunday.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"DAR lay wreath at Trinity Church\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-20786\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DAR-lay-wreath-at-Trinity-Church-Sunday-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DAR-lay-wreath-at-Trinity-Church-Sunday-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DAR-lay-wreath-at-Trinity-Church-Sunday-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DAR-lay-wreath-at-Trinity-Church-Sunday-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DAR-lay-wreath-at-Trinity-Church-Sunday.jpg 480w\" title=\"DAR lay wreath at Trinity Church\" width=\"150\"/></a>Now, thanks to the efforts of James S.

There are an estimated 100,000 shipwrecks resting on the floor of the Baltic Sea, with perhaps 6,000 of them deemed of particular archaeological and historical significance. Although Swedish Baltic archaeological finds have made much of the news lately, there are approximately 1,500 protected marine monuments (mostly shipwrecks, but also some downed aircraft and submerged archaeological remains that were once on dry land) in German Baltic waters.</p>\n<p>Before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, these were mainly left alone. Much of the coastal Baltic was restricted territory. Except for a few select people, divers weren\u2019t allowed to explore the vast historical wealth under water. Since reunification, areas that were once off limits are now open, and advances in diving technology have greatly increased the numbers of sports divers hoping to see the Baltic sights. They can also go further offshore to reach shipwrecks that 20 years ago wouldn\u2019t have been accessible. Add to that a wider range of available tools for the sports diver, and now stealing objects of historical value from Baltic wrecks becomes a lucrative proposition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steel-plate-sealing-gap-in-U-boat-turret-hatch.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Steel plate sealing gap in U-boat turret hatch\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-20755\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steel-plate-sealing-gap-in-U-boat-turret-hatch-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steel-plate-sealing-gap-in-U-boat-turret-hatch-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steel-plate-sealing-gap-in-U-boat-turret-hatch-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steel-plate-sealing-gap-in-U-boat-turret-hatch-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Steel-plate-sealing-gap-in-U-boat-turret-hatch.jpg 850w\" title=\"Steel plate sealing gap in U-boat turret hatch\" width=\"200\"/></a>Only 350 of the marine monuments have been officially explored and mapped, which makes it hard to know exactly how bad the undersea looting situation has gotten. The evidence on the sites that have been documented, however, is extremely disturbing. For example, one World War II U-boat, a small two-man vessel discovered 60 feet under Baltic waters off the coast of Boltenhagen in 2000, was found with its turret hatch closed and undamaged. It was therefore designated a war grave, since its crew remained sealed within. In 2002, divers broke into the hatch. Regional government officials sealed the hole with a steel plate which is still in place today, but shows clear signs of having been tampered with in an attempt to break into the U-boat.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of our big worries, over the years people keep trying to get into it and that is of course utterly disrespectful,\u201d says Detlef Jantzen, an archaeologist at the regional agency for monument protection in the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that these divers don\u2019t realize the U-boat is a war grave, or at least aren\u2019t consciously thinking about the fact that they\u2019re desecrating a grave by messing with the hatch. Some of the other wreck sites that are regularly visited by hobby divers may be damaged because the tourists with good intentions don\u2019t understand how their interactions with the artifacts can cause harm. In an attempt to appeal to better natures, and maybe to enlist conditioned reactions to museum signs, Germany\u2019s Society of Maritime Archaeology has started a project to <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-archaeologists-attaching-signs-to-protect-baltic-shipwrecks-a-861830.html\" target=\"_blank\">add underwater signs to historic shipwrecks</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-first-sign.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"The first sign, next to 100-year-old tugboat\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-20753\" height=\"137\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-first-sign-200x137.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-first-sign-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-first-sign-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-first-sign-430x294.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-first-sign.jpg 850w\" title=\"The first sign, next to 100-year-old tugboat\" width=\"200\"/></a>Last week the first sign was added to a 100-year-old tugboat thought to have been sunk during or just after World War II. At only 30 feet deep, it\u2019s a popular site for sport divers to visit. The wreck was discovered three years ago and is already showing the ill-effects of diver interference. The sign informs divers that the wreck is a protected historical monument and provides additional information about the site\u2019s layout and history.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The group will start by signposting nine monuments. One particularly valuable wreck is that of the \u201cDarsser Kogge,\u201d a 14th century ship that is a rare example of medieval shipbuilding. \u201cIt\u2019s lying on its side and the remains provide valuable information on construction and manufacturing techniques of the time,\u201d said [Society of Maritime Archaeology chairman Martin] Siegel. \u201cThese preserved vessels are often the only source of research into traditional shipbuilding.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Darsser Kogge</em> has enough to worry about as it is without divers making things worse. The Baltic Sea is increasingly subject to the depredations of the dreaded <em>Teredo navalis</em>, naval shipworm, which used to stick to saltier waters leaving Baltic wooden wrecks free of its destructive devouring. As the waters of the Baltic have gotten warmer and their salinity has increased, particularly over the past decade, the wood boring creatures have spread from the coast of Denmark east into German Baltic territory and north into Swedish waters.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Spread-of-surface-larvae-in-Baltic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Spread of Teredo navalis surface larvae in Baltic, 1980-1989 (l), 1990-1999 (m), 2000-2008 (r)\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-20759\" height=\"168\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Spread-of-surface-larvae-in-Baltic-430x168.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Spread-of-surface-larvae-in-Baltic-430x168.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Spread-of-surface-larvae-in-Baltic-150x58.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Spread-of-surface-larvae-in-Baltic-200x78.jpg 200w\" title=\"Spread of Teredo navalis surface larvae in Baltic, 1980-1989 (l), 1990-1999 (m), 2000-2008 (r)\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The EU has funded a study of the presence of shipworm in the Baltic, the <a href=\"http://wreckprotect.eu/index.php?id=12679\">Wreck Protect Project</a>, to determine how far <em>Teredo navalis</em> has spread, whether, as researchers suspect, climate change is the underlying cause of the Baltic\u2019s environmental changes, and how best to preserve archaeological and historical sites in situ, since logistics and funding make it impossible to contemplate raising every wreck for conservation on dry land.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Darsser-Kogge-wreck.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Darsser Kogge wreck\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-20765\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Darsser-Kogge-wreck-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Darsser-Kogge-wreck-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Darsser-Kogge-wreck-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Darsser-Kogge-wreck-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Darsser-Kogge-wreck.jpg 800w\" title=\"Darsser Kogge wreck\" width=\"200\"/></a>The EU\u2019s MoSS (Monitoring Safeguarding and Visualizing North European Shipwreck Sites) Project worked to document and protect four wreck sites in the Baltic and elsewhere in Northern Europe, including the <em>Darsser Kogge</em>.

Next up is \u201cThe Criminal Corpse in Pieces,\u201d a particularly Halloween-appropriate strand of research which looks at the part played by the criminal corpse in fiction. The bodies of executed criminals frequently starred in the literature of this period as vengeful ghosts, loci of punishment and relics of supernatural power (the Whitby Hand of Glory, for example, the hand of a hanged man which, when holding a candle made from the fat of the same executed criminal, was said to render motionless whomever it was given to, or to unlock all doors). This connects to strand four in its examination of folkloric traditions but will study the interplay between traditions and literary fiction. The last strand, \u201cThe Criminal Corpse Remembered,\u201d brings it all together through a comparative analysis of historical attitudes towards the criminal corpse and contemporary ones. It will look at how our own anxieties and ambivalence about how we treat the dead are informed by the symbolic and practical significance with which the criminal corpse was imbued from the late 17th century through the mid-19th. The Harnessing the Power of the Criminal Corpse project website is already great reading but will continue to expand as the program proceeds. Any published material that comes out of the project or that is relevant to it will be posted on the publications page. Any news stories and events connected to the project will be posted on the news page. There\u2019s one particularly exciting event hosted by University of Hertfordshire Professor of Social History Owen Davis (one of the Strand Four researchers). It\u2019s a reenactment of the inquest of the infamous \u201cElstree Murder\u201d case of 1823, which will be held on November 13th at 8:00 PM in the Old Barge Pub in Hertford. It\u2019s free of charge to all comers. Just show up and you\u2019ll get to be a part of the inquest jury that decides whether John Thurtell, the wastrel son of the Mayor of Norwich, and his accomplices murdered the solicitor William Weare because he had cheated John out of \u00a3300 in a card game. After you\u2019re done presiding over this shocking case, you can head over to the Museum of London to see its Doctors, Dissection and Resurrection Men exhibit, which has been getting rave reviews.", "read_time": 341.09999999999997, "title_html": "<h3 id=\"post-21016\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21016\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Harnessing the Power of the Criminal Corpse\">Harnessing the Power of the Criminal Corpse</a></h3>"}

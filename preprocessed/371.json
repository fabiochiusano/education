She had been widowed for several years but the reason for her distress was not the loss of her husband. It was her falling in love with a married man. As she shared her story with me over a cup of tea and Kleenex, I tried to keep a professional and compassionate countenance, though, internally, I was bewildered by the realization that even into their 80s, people still fall for one another in that teenage, butterflies-in-the-stomach kind of way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"78a6\" name=\"78a6\">One of the strange and wonderful features of my job as a minister is that I get to be a confidant and advisor to people at all stages of life. I\u2019ve worked with people who are double and even triple my age. Experience like this is rare; our economic structure and workforce are stratified, and most people are employed within their own demographics. But because I\u2019m a minister in a mainline denomination with an aging base, the people I primarily interact with are over the age of 60. I came into my job assuming that I, a Korean-American woman in my mid-30s, would not be able to connect with these people\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re from a completely different racial and cultural background than me. It did not take long for me to discover how very wrong I was.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"020c\" name=\"020c\">We all have joys, hopes, fears, and longings that never go away no matter how old we get. Until recently, I mistakenly associated deep yearnings and ambitions with the energy and idealism of youth. My subconscious and unexamined assumption was that the elderly transcend these desires because they become more stoic and sage-like over time. Or the opposite: They become disillusioned by life and gradually shed their vibrancy and vitality.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"871d\" name=\"871d\">When I initially realized that my assumptions might be wrong, I set out to research the internal lives of older people. Who <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really</em> were they, and what had they learned in life? Using my congregation as a resource, I interviewed several members in their 90s with a pen, notebook, a listening ear, and a promise to keep everyone anonymous. I did not hold back, asking them burning questions about their fears, hopes, sex lives or lack thereof. Fortunately, I had willing participants. Many of them were flattered by my interest, as America tends to forget people as they age.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"d98b\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\" id=\"f769\" name=\"f769\">I began each conversation by asking if they had any regrets. By this point, they\u2019d lived long enough to look at life from multiple angles so I knew their responses would be meaningful. Most of their regrets revolved around their families. They wished relationships, either with their children or between their children, turned out differently. These relational fractures, I could see on their faces, still caused them much pain and sorrow. One of my interviewees has two children who haven\u2019t seen or spoken to each another for over two decades. She lamented that this, among all the mistakes and regrets she could bring to mind, was the single thing keeping her up at night.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cc41\" name=\"cc41\">I then moved on to the happiest moments of their lives. Every single one of these 90-something-year-olds, all of whom are widowed, recalled a time when their spouses were still alive and their children were younger and living at home. As a busy young mom and working professional who frequently fantasizes about the faraway, imagined pleasures of retirement, I quickly responded, \u201cBut weren\u2019t those the most stressful times of your lives?\u201d Yes of course, they all agreed. But there was no doubt that those days were also the happiest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e08c\" name=\"e08c\">Their responses intrigued me. They contradicted a well-known article on happiness in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Economist</em>, \u201c<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@the_economist/the-u-bend-of-life-f8d0abf8a4e5\" href=\"https://medium.com/@the_economist/the-u-bend-of-life-f8d0abf8a4e5\" target=\"_blank\">The U-bend of Life</a>.\u201d The article went viral in 2010 and was a common conversation topic among my family and friends. Its counter-intuitive yet completely reasonable analyses seemed to resonate with my generation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f90\" name=\"2f90\">The theory of the \u201cU-bend\u201d came about as researchers discovered consistent findings from several independent research projects on happiness and well-being around the world. They concluded that happiness, pleasure and enjoyment are most tenuous during the middle ages of life, starting in our 20s with depression peaking at 46\u200a\u2014\u200awhich the author described as \u201cmiddle-age-misery.\u201d The happiness of youth however, not only returned but was experienced at higher levels in subjects\u2019 70s. Researchers hypothesized that middle-age-misery was due to the overwhelming number of familial, professional, and financial demands during these years. Following a happiness dip in middle age, researchers concluded that we become more self-accepting, less ambitious and more mindful of living in the present moment (instead of the future) as we approach our 70s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"cb68\" name=\"cb68\">My interviewees\u2019 responses contradicted the popular \u201cU-bend\u201d theory. Why? Perhaps happiness is more complex than we thought. Maybe our understanding of what makes us happy changes as we age. When we\u2019re younger, perhaps we think of happiness as a feeling instead of a state of fulfillment, meaning, or abundance\u200a\u2014\u200awhich my interviewees were associating it with. Regardless, their responses came as a sobering reminder to fully appreciate and soak in these chaotic days of diaper changes, messiness, and minimal me-time. They may just end up being my happiest moments.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"10a9\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\" id=\"20e2\" name=\"20e2\">I was dying to ask if their spouses (of many decades, in most cases) were really the loves of their lives. As it turns out, this was true for some and not for others. In both cases, though, they kept trying to make their marriages work. I got the sense from their responses that after they had children, their marriages became much less important to their happiness than the overall nuclear family dynamic. This focus on the family unit, however, did not mean their sexual and romantic passion vanished. They still longed to be wooed and pursued. They still experienced intense attraction to people who were not their spouses and continue to experience intense attraction for others to this day. Of course, sex becomes more tiresome, as well as masturbation, but their desire for companionship is just as prominent as it was during the height of their youth.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"b339\" name=\"b339\">Being old brought a lot of advantages: more time, more perspective, less hustling to be the best and most successful, and an urgency to strengthen the important relationships in her\u00a0life.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"2551\" name=\"2551\">My interviewees\u2019 thoughts on beauty and aging were also varied\u200a\u2014\u200atheir physical appearance only mattered insofar as it mattered to them when they were younger. Those who were valued for their good looks or athleticism experienced much more grief in regards to their current bodies than those who derived confidence from qualities that were much less time-fixed. One interviewee, for example, was well-known in her community for being a writer and columnist in local newspapers. When I asked her if she was saddened by her aging appearance, she responded, \u201cWell, I never thought I was pretty to begin with so, no.\u201d The ones who did experience greater negative emotions about aging, though, shared that the peak of that grief occurred in their 70s and has diminished since then.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"d338\" name=\"d338\">The same woman who told me she wasn\u2019t bothered by her aging appearance also shared that she wasn\u2019t afraid of death but of dying. I found this to be a profound distinction. She believed in an afterlife, as one might expect given that she belongs to a church. She felt sure that she would, in one way or another, be well taken care of after her time here came to an end. She is still very physically and mentally healthy, so it was that final leg of her journey that worried her. Would she be restricted to a hospital bed, just a mess of tubes and needles? Would she still recognize family and friends? Would she be in constant pain? Being old didn\u2019t bother her until it affected the quality of her life in an incredibly detrimental way. In fact, being old, she shared, brought a lot of advantages: more time, more perspective, less hustling to be the best and most successful, and an urgency to strengthen the important relationships in her life.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\" name=\"6d19\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\" id=\"5013\" name=\"5013\">The radical relationship-based orientation of all my subjects caught me by surprise. As someone entering the height of my career, I expend much more energy on work than on relationships. And when I imagine my future, I envision what I will have accomplished rather than the quality of my interactions with those who are most important to me. These 90-something-year-olds emphasize the opposite when they look back on their lives. Their joys and regrets have nothing to do with their careers, but with their parents, children, spouses, and friends. Put simply, when I asked one person, \u201cDo you wish you accomplished more?\u201d He responded, \u201cNo, I wished I loved more.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"01dd\" name=\"01dd\">My conversations challenged me. I certainly won\u2019t be giving up my job to hang out with my family more because I also recognize that satisfying careers and financial stability are great sources of fulfillment\u200a\u2014\u200awhich, in turn, affect family well-being. But these different perspectives helped me focus on what really matters in the face of competing responsibilities and priorities. That sermon really does not have to be the best sermon in the world when my son is starving for my attention. My husband really does not need to get the highest-paying job he can find if that means I can spend more time with him.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"ec6f\" name=\"ec6f\">Put simply, when I asked one person, \u201cDo you wish you accomplished more?\u201d He responded, \u201cNo, I wished I loved\u00a0more.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing\" id=\"2207\" name=\"2207\">However, the biggest impact they left on me was not reprioritization but being okay with aging. I confess that prior to my conversations, I had an intense fear about growing old. This, I realize, was what motivated me to begin this research in the first place. I assumed the elderly lost their vibrancy and thirst for life. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. They still laugh like crazy, fall in love like mad and pursue happiness fiercely.</p></div></div></section></div></main></div><section class=\"u-maxWidth700 u-paddingHorizontal20 u-marginAuto\"><div

But because I\u2019m a minister in a mainline denomination with an aging base, the people I primarily interact with are over the age of 60.

This focus on the family unit, however, did not mean their sexual and romantic passion vanished. They still longed to be wooed and pursued. They still experienced intense attraction to people who were not their spouses and continue to experience intense attraction for others to this day.

When I asked her if she was saddened by her aging appearance, she responded, \u201cWell, I never thought I was pretty to begin with so, no.\u201d The ones who did experience greater negative emotions about aging, though, shared that the peak of that grief occurred in their 70s and has diminished since then.\",\"markups\":[]},{\"name\":\"d338\",\"type\":1,\"text\":\"The same woman who told me she wasn\u2019t bothered by her aging appearance also shared that she wasn\u2019t afraid of death but of dying.

She felt sure that she would, in one way or another, be well taken care of after her time here came to an end. She is still very physically and mentally healthy, so it was that final leg of her journey that worried her. Would she be restricted to a hospital bed, just a mess of tubes and needles? Would she still recognize family and friends? Would she be in constant pain? Being old didn\u2019t bother her until it affected the quality of her life in an incredibly detrimental way.

She had been widowed for several years but the reason for her distress was not the loss of her husband. It was her falling in love with a married man. As she shared her story with me over a cup of tea and Kleenex, I tried to keep a professional and compassionate countenance, though, internally, I was bewildered by the realization that even into their 80s, people still fall for one another in that teenage, butterflies-in-the-stomach kind of way.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"78a6\\\" id=\\\"78a6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOne of the strange and wonderful features of my job as a minister is that I get to be a confidant and advisor to people at all stages of life. I\u2019ve worked with people who are double and even triple my age. Experience like this is rare; our economic structure and workforce are stratified, and most people are employed within their own demographics. But because I\u2019m a minister in a mainline denomination with an aging base, the people I primarily interact with are over the age of 60. I came into my job assuming that I, a Korean-American woman in my mid-30s, would not be able to connect with these people\u200a\u2014\u200athey\u2019re from a completely different racial and cultural background than me. It did not take long for me to discover how very wrong I was.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"020c\\\" id=\\\"020c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWe all have joys, hopes, fears, and longings that never go away no matter how old we get. Until recently, I mistakenly associated deep yearnings and ambitions with the energy and idealism of youth. My subconscious and unexamined assumption was that the elderly transcend these desires because they become more stoic and sage-like over time. Or the opposite: They become disillusioned by life and gradually shed their vibrancy and vitality.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"871d\\\" id=\\\"871d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eWhen I initially realized that my assumptions might be wrong, I set out to research the internal lives of older people. Who \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ereally\\x3c/em\\x3e were they, and what had they learned in life? Using my congregation as a resource, I interviewed several members in their 90s with a pen, notebook, a listening ear, and a promise to keep everyone anonymous. I did not hold back, asking them burning questions about their fears, hopes, sex lives or lack thereof. Fortunately, I had willing participants. Many of them were flattered by my interest, as America tends to forget people as they age.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"d98b\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f769\\\" id=\\\"f769\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--leading\\\"\\x3eI began each conversation by asking if they had any regrets. By this point, they\u2019d lived long enough to look at life from multiple angles so I knew their responses would be meaningful. Most of their regrets revolved around their families. They wished relationships, either with their children or between their children, turned out differently. These relational fractures, I could see on their faces, still caused them much pain and sorrow. One of my interviewees has two children who haven\u2019t seen or spoken to each another for over two decades. She lamented that this, among all the mistakes and regrets she could bring to mind, was the single thing keeping her up at night.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"cc41\\\" id=\\\"cc41\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eI then moved on to the happiest moments of their lives. Every single one of these 90-something-year-olds, all of whom are widowed, recalled a time when their spouses were still alive and their children were younger and living at home. As a busy young mom and working professional who frequently fantasizes about the faraway, imagined pleasures of retirement, I quickly responded, \u201cBut weren\u2019t those the most stressful times of your lives?\u201d Yes of course, they all agreed. But there was no doubt that those days were also the happiest.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e08c\\\" id=\\\"e08c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTheir responses intrigued me. They contradicted a well-known article on happiness in \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eThe Economist\\x3c/em\\x3e, \u201c\\x3ca href=\\\"https://medium.com/@the_economist/the-u-bend-of-life-f8d0abf8a4e5\\\" data-href=\\\"https://medium.com/@the_economist/the-u-bend-of-life-f8d0abf8a4e5\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3eThe U-bend of Life\\x3c/a\\x3e.\u201d The article went viral in 2010 and was a common conversation topic among my family and friends. Its counter-intuitive yet completely reasonable analyses seemed to resonate with my generation.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2f90\\\" id=\\\"2f90\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe theory of the \u201cU-bend\u201d came about as researchers discovered consistent findings from several independent research projects on happiness and well-being around the world. They concluded that happiness, pleasure and enjoyment are most tenuous during the middle ages of life, starting in our 20s with depression peaking at 46\u200a\u2014\u200awhich the author described as \u201cmiddle-age-misery.\u201d The happiness of youth however, not only returned but was experienced at higher levels in subjects\u2019 70s. Researchers hypothesized that middle-age-misery was due to the overwhelming number of familial, professional, and financial demands during these years. Following a happiness dip in middle age, researchers concluded that we become more self-accepting, less ambitious and more mindful of living in the present moment (instead of the future) as we approach our 70s.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"cb68\\\" id=\\\"cb68\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eMy interviewees\u2019 responses contradicted the popular \u201cU-bend\u201d theory. Why? Perhaps happiness is more complex than we thought. Maybe our understanding of what makes us happy changes as we age. When we\u2019re younger, perhaps we think of happiness as a feeling instead of a state of fulfillment, meaning, or abundance\u200a\u2014\u200awhich my interviewees were associating it with. Regardless, their responses came as a sobering reminder to fully appreciate and soak in these chaotic days of diaper changes, messiness, and minimal me-time. They may just end up being my happiest moments.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"10a9\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"20e2\\\" id=\\\"20e2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--leading\\\"\\x3eI was dying to ask if their spouses (of many decades, in most cases) were really the loves of their lives. As it turns out, this was true for some and not for others. In both cases, though, they kept trying to make their marriages work. I got the sense from their responses that after they had children, their marriages became much less important to their happiness than the overall nuclear family dynamic. This focus on the family unit, however, did not mean their sexual and romantic passion vanished. They still longed to be wooed and pursued. They still experienced intense attraction to people who were not their spouses and continue to experience intense attraction for others to this day. Of course, sex becomes more tiresome, as well as masturbation, but their desire for companionship is just as prominent as it was during the height of their youth.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"b339\\\" id=\\\"b339\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBeing old brought a lot of advantages: more time, more perspective, less hustling to be the best and most successful, and an urgency to strengthen the important relationships in her\u00a0life.\\x3c/blockquote\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2551\\\" id=\\\"2551\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\\\"\\x3eMy interviewees\u2019 thoughts on beauty and aging were also varied\u200a\u2014\u200atheir physical appearance only mattered insofar as it mattered to them when they were younger. Those who were valued for their good looks or athleticism experienced much more grief in regards to their current bodies than those who derived confidence from qualities that were much less time-fixed. One interviewee, for example, was well-known in her community for being a writer and columnist in local newspapers. When I asked her if she was saddened by her aging appearance, she responded, \u201cWell, I never thought I was pretty to begin with so, no.\u201d The ones who did experience greater negative emotions about aging, though, shared that the peak of that grief occurred in their 70s and has diminished since then.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d338\\\" id=\\\"d338\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eThe same woman who told me she wasn\u2019t bothered by her aging appearance also shared that she wasn\u2019t afraid of death but of dying. I found this to be a profound distinction. She believed in an afterlife, as one might expect given that she belongs to a church. She felt sure that she would, in one way or another, be well taken care of after her time here came to an end. She is still very physically and mentally healthy, so it was that final leg of her journey that worried her. Would she be restricted to a hospital bed, just a mess of tubes and needles? Would she still recognize family and friends? Would she be in constant pain? Being old didn\u2019t bother her until it affected the quality of her life in an incredibly detrimental way. In fact, being old, she shared, brought a lot of advantages: more time, more perspective, less hustling to be the best and most successful, and an urgency to strengthen the important relationships in her life.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"6d19\\\" class=\\\"section section--body section--last\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5013\\\" id=\\\"5013\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--leading\\\"\\x3eThe radical relationship-based orientation of all my subjects caught me by surprise. As someone entering the height of my career, I expend much more energy on work than on relationships. And when I imagine my future, I envision what I will have accomplished rather than the quality of my interactions with those who are most important to me. These 90-something-year-olds emphasize the opposite when they look back on their lives. Their joys and regrets have nothing to do with their careers, but with their parents, children, spouses, and friends. Put simply, when I asked one person, \u201cDo you wish you accomplished more?\u201d He responded, \u201cNo, I wished I loved more.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"01dd\\\" id=\\\"01dd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMy conversations challenged me. I certainly won\u2019t be giving up my job to hang out with my family more because I also recognize that satisfying careers and financial stability are great sources of fulfillment\u200a\u2014\u200awhich, in turn, affect family well-being. But these different perspectives helped me focus on what really matters in the face of competing responsibilities and priorities. That sermon really does not have to be the best sermon in the world when my son is starving for my attention. My husband really does not need to get the highest-paying job he can find if that means I can spend more time with him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cblockquote name=\\\"ec6f\\\" id=\\\"ec6f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3ePut simply, when I asked one person, \u201cDo you wish you accomplished more?\u201d He responded, \u201cNo, I wished I loved\u00a0more.\u201d\\x3c/blockquote\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2207\\\" id=\\\"2207\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eHowever, the biggest impact they left on me was not reprioritization but being okay with aging.

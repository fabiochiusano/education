I want to get out! This is all fucked up inside! I can\u2019t stand another night! I just can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9260\" name=\"9260\">It was a defining moment in what has become perhaps the best-known psychology study of all time. Whether you learned about Philip Zimbardo\u2019s famous \u201cStanford Prison Experiment\u201d in an introductory psych class or just absorbed it from the cultural ether, you\u2019ve probably heard the basic story.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"63d9\" name=\"63d9\">Zimbardo, a young Stanford psychology professor, built a mock jail in the basement of Jordan Hall and stocked it with nine \u201cprisoners,\u201d and nine \u201cguards,\u201d all male, college-age respondents to a newspaper ad who were assigned their roles at random and paid a generous daily wage to participate. The senior prison \u201cstaff\u201d consisted of Zimbardo himself and a handful of his students.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee84\" name=\"ee84\">The study was supposed to last for two weeks, but after Zimbardo\u2019s girlfriend stopped by six days in and witnessed the conditions in the \u201cStanford County Jail,\u201d she convinced him to shut it down. Since then, the tale of guards run amok and terrified prisoners breaking down one by one has become world-famous, a cultural touchstone that\u2019s been the subject of books, documentaries, and feature films\u200a\u2014\u200aeven an episode of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Veronica Mars</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"27d5\" name=\"27d5\">The SPE is often used to teach the lesson that our behavior is profoundly affected by the social roles and situations in which we find ourselves. But its deeper, more disturbing implication is that we all have a wellspring of potential sadism lurking within us, waiting to be tapped by circumstance. It has been invoked to explain the massacre at My Lai during the Vietnam War, the Armenian genocide, and the horrors of the Holocaust. And the ultimate symbol of the agony that man helplessly inflicts on his brother is Korpi\u2019s famous breakdown, set off after only 36 hours by the cruelty of his peers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3204\" name=\"3204\">There\u2019s just one problem: Korpi\u2019s breakdown was a sham.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"62b0\" name=\"62b0\">\u201cAnybody who is a clinician would know that I was faking,\u201d he told me last summer, in the first extensive interview he has granted in years. \u201cIf you listen to the tape, it\u2019s not subtle. I\u2019m not that good at acting. I mean, I think I do a fairly good job, but I\u2019m more hysterical than psychotic.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"40bc\" name=\"40bc\">Now a forensic psychologist himself, Korpi told me his dramatic performance in the SPE was indeed inspired by fear, but not of abusive guards. Instead, he was worried about failing to get into grad school.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9644\" name=\"9644\">\u201cThe reason I took the job was that I thought I\u2019d have every day to sit around by myself and study for my GREs,\u201d Korpi explained of the Graduate Record Exams often used to determine admissions, adding that he was scheduled to take the test just after the study concluded. Shortly after the experiment began, he asked for his study books. The prison staff refused. The next day Korpi asked again. No dice. At that point he decided there was, as he put it to me, \u201cno point to this job.\u201d First, Korpi tried faking a stomach-ache. When that didn\u2019t work, he tried faking a breakdown. Far from feeling traumatized, he added, he had actually enjoyed himself for much of his short tenure in the jail, other than a tussle with the guards over his bed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0457\" name=\"0457\">\u201c[The first day] was really fun,\u201d Korpi recalled. \u201cThe rebellion was fun. There were no repercussions. We knew [the guards] couldn\u2019t hurt us, they couldn\u2019t hit us. They were white college kids just like us, so it was a very safe situation. It was just a job. If you listen to the tape, you can hear it in my voice: I have a great job. I get to yell and scream and act all hysterical. I get to act like a prisoner. I was being a good employee. It was a great time.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1a31\" name=\"1a31\">For Korpi, the most frightening thing about the experiment was being told that, regardless of his desire to quit, he truly did not have the power to leave.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ce70\" name=\"ce70\">\u201cI was entirely shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it was one thing to pick me up in a cop car and put me in a smock. But they\u2019re really escalating the game by saying that I can\u2019t leave. They\u2019re stepping to a new level. I was just like, \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 That was my feeling.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b1b8\" name=\"b1b8\">Another prisoner, Richard Yacco, recalled being stunned on the experiment\u2019s second day after asking a staff-member how to quit and learning that he couldn\u2019t. A third prisoner, Clay Ramsay, was so dismayed on discovering that he was trapped that he started a hunger strike. \u201cI regarded it as a real prison because [in order to get out], you had to do something that made them worry about their liability,\u201d Ramsay told me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"835a\" name=\"835a\">When I spoke to Zimbardo this past May about Korpi\u2019s and Yacco\u2019s claims, he initially denied that they were obligated to stay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4eb2\" name=\"4eb2\">\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4163\" name=\"4163\">But it is no longer just a question of Zimbardo\u2019s word against theirs. This past April, a French academic and filmmaker named Thibault Le Texier published <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Histoire d\u2019un Mensonge [History of a Lie], </em>plumbing newly-released documents from Zimbardo\u2019s archives at Stanford University to tell a dramatically different story of the experiment. After Zimbardo told me that Korpi and Yacco\u2019s accusations were baseless, I read him a <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:vx097ry2810/Tape8.pdf\" href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:vx097ry2810/Tape8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">transcript</a> unearthed by Le Texier of a taped conversation between Zimbardo and his staff on day three of the simulation: \u201cAn interesting thing was that the guys who came in yesterday, the two guys who came in and said they wanted to leave, and I said no,\u201d Zimbardo told his staff. \u201cThere are only two conditions under which you can leave, medical help or psychiatric\u2026 I think they really believed they can\u2019t get out.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a81d\" name=\"a81d\">\u201cNow, okay,\u201d Zimbardo corrected himself on the phone with me. He then acknowledged that the informed consent forms which subjects signed had included an explicit safe phrase: \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201d Only that precise phrase would trigger their release.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2836\" name=\"2836\">\u201cNone of them said that,\u201d Zimbardo said. \u201cThey said, \u2018I want out. I want a doctor. I want my mother,\u2019 etc., etc. Essentially I was saying, \u2018You have to say, \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201d\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fa63\" name=\"fa63\">But the informed consent forms that Zimbardo\u2019s subjects signed, which are <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://pdf.prisonexp.org/consent.pdf\" href=\"http://pdf.prisonexp.org/consent.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available online</a> from Zimbardo\u2019s own website, contain no mention of the phrase \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8a63\" name=\"8a63\">Zimbardo\u2019s standard narrative of the Stanford prison experiment offers the prisoners\u2019 emotional responses as proof of how powerfully affected they were by the guards\u2019 mistreatment. The shock of real imprisonment provides a simpler and far less groundbreaking explanation. It may also have had legal implications, should prisoners have thought to pursue them. Korpi told me that the greatest regret of his life was failing to sue Zimbardo.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dba0\" name=\"dba0\">\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we file false imprisonment charges?\u201d Korpi asked during an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing! We should have done something!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3de4\" name=\"3de4\">According to James Cahan, former Deputy District Attorney for Stanford University\u2019s Santa Clara County, Korpi may well have had a case: the six hours or so after Korpi made his desire to quit the experiment plain, much of which he spent confined in the closet, appear to have met the statutory requirements for false imprisonment in California.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4e6c\" name=\"4e6c\">\u201cIf he says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. I want to talk to you about getting out,\u2019\u201d Cahan said, \u201cand he\u2019s then locked in a room, and he is at some point trying to or asking to get out of that room in order to communicate as a contract employee or whatever he is, and he is unable to get out of that room, then that would seem to get very close to being out of the realm of informed consent and into the realm of a violation of the penal code.\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"be18\" name=\"be18\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"e21b\" name=\"e21b\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">W</span>hile Zimbardo likes to begin the story of the Stanford prison experiment on Sunday, August 15th, 1971, when guards began harassing newly arrived prisoners at the \u201cStanford County Jail\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amaking it sound as if they became abusive of their own accord\u200a\u2014\u200aa more honest telling begins a day earlier, with the orientation meeting for the guards.

Jaffe and a few fellow students had actually cooked up the idea of a simulated prison themselves three months earlier, in response to an open-ended assignment in an undergraduate class taught by Zimbardo. Jaffe cast some of his dormmates in Toyon Hall as prisoners and some as guards and came up with 15 draconian prison rules for his guards to enforce, including \u201cPrisoners must address each other by number only,\u201d \u201cPrisoners must never refer to their condition as an \u2018experiment\u2019 or a \u2018simulation,\u201d and \u201cFailure to obey any of the above rules may result in punishment.\u201d Zimbardo was so taken with the tears and drama produced by Jaffe\u2019s two-day simulation that he decided to try it himself, this time randomly assigning guards and prisoners and dragging the action on much longer. Because Zimbardo himself had never visited a real prison, the standards of realism were defined by Jaffe\u2019s prison research and the nightmarish recollections of Carlo Prescott, a San Quentin parolee whom Zimbardo met through Jaffe and brought in as a consultant. Jaffe was given extraordinary leeway in shaping the Stanford prison experiment in order to replicate his previous results. \u201cDr. Zimbardo suggested that the most difficult problem would be to get the guards to behave like guards,\u201d Jaffe wrote in a post-experiment <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\" href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">evaluation</a>. \u201cI was asked to suggest tactics based on my previous experience as master sadist.\u00a0\u2026 I was given the responsibility of trying to elicit \u2018tough-guard\u2019 behavior.\u201d Though Zimbardo has often stated that the guards devised their own rules, in fact most of them were copied directly from Jaffe\u2019s class assignment during that Saturday orientation meeting. Jaffe also offered the guards ideas for hassling the prisoners, including forcing them to clean thorns out of dirty blankets that had been thrown in the weeds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"54ed\" name=\"54ed\">Once the simulation got underway, Jaffe explicitly corrected guards who weren\u2019t acting tough enough, fostering exactly the pathological behavior that Zimbardo would later claim had arisen organically.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fcdb\" name=\"fcdb\">\u201cThe guards have to know that every guard is going to be what we call a tough guard,\u201d Jaffe <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/wn708sg0050\" href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/wn708sg0050\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told one such guard</a> [skip to 8:35]. \u201c[H]opefully what will come out of this study is some very serious recommendations for reform\u2026 so that we can get on the media and into the press with it, and say \u2018Now look at what this is really about.\u2019\u00a0\u2026 [T]ry and react as you picture the pigs reacting.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1363\" name=\"1363\">Though most guards gave lackluster performances, some even going out of their way to do small favors for the prisoners, one in particular rose to the challenge: Dave Eshleman, whom prisoners nicknamed \u201cJohn Wayne\u201d for his Southern accent and inventive cruelty. But Eshleman, who had studied acting throughout high school and college, has always admitted that his accent was just as fake as Korpi\u2019s breakdown. His overarching goal, as he told me in an interview, was simply to help the experiment succeed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6b70\" name=\"6b70\">\u201cI took it as a kind of an improv exercise,\u201d Eshleman said. \u201cI believed that I was doing what the researchers wanted me to do, and I thought I\u2019d do it better than anybody else by creating this despicable guard persona. I\u2019d never been to the South, but I used a southern accent, which I got from <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Cool Hand Luke.</em>\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4dff\" name=\"4dff\">Eshleman expressed regret to me for the way he mistreated prisoners, adding that at times he was calling on his own experience undergoing a brutal fraternity hazing a few months earlier. \u201cI took it just way over the top,\u201d he said. But Zimbardo and his staff seemed to approve. After the experiment ended, Zimbardo singled him out and thanked him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d9e0\" name=\"d9e0\">\u201cAs I was walking down the hall,\u201d Eshleman recalled, \u201che made it a point to come and let me know what a great job I\u2019d done. I actually felt like I had accomplished something good because I had contributed in some way to the understanding of human nature.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a610\" name=\"a610\">According to Alex Haslam and Stephen Reicher, psychologists who co-directed an attempted replication of the Stanford prison experiment in Great Britain in 2001, a critical factor in making people commit atrocities is a leader assuring them that they are acting in the service of a higher moral cause with which they identify\u200a\u2014\u200afor instance, scientific progress or prison reform. We have been taught that guards abused prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment because of the power of their roles, but Haslam and Reicher argue that their behavior arose instead from their identification with the experimenters, which Jaffe and Zimbardo encouraged at every turn. Eshleman, who described himself on an intake questionnaire as a \u201cscientist at heart,\u201d may have identified more powerfully than anyone, but Jaffe himself put it well in his <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\" href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">self-evaluation</a>: \u201cI am startled by the ease with which I could turn off my sensitivity and concern for others for \u2018a good cause.\u2019\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"a892\" name=\"a892\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"7d65\" name=\"7d65\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">F</span>rom the beginning, Zimbardo sought a high media profile for his experiment, allowing KRON, a San Francisco television station, to film his mock arrests and sending them periodic press releases as the action evolved. But Zimbardo\u2019s prison simulation quickly garnered more press attention than he could have imagined. On August 21st, a day after the study\u2019s premature closure, the attempt by George Jackson, radical black activist and author of the bestselling <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Soledad Brother</em>, to escape from San Quentin, an hour north of Stanford, led to the deaths of three corrections officers and three inmates, including Jackson himself. In short order, KRON arranged a televised debate between Zimbardo and San Quentin\u2019s associate warden. Three weeks later, the predominately African American prisoners at Attica State Prison in New York seized control of the facility from the nearly all-white correctional staff, demanding better treatment. Ordered by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to retake the prison by force, helicopters dumped tear gas canisters and hundreds of law-enforcement officers and armed Attica guards fired blindly into the smoke, slaughtering prisoners and hostages alike.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eac0\" name=\"eac0\">In an era before the mass shootings that have since become the norm in American news headlines, it was a shocking bloodbath\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the deadliest since the Civil War, according to the New York State Special Commission on Attica. The country scrambled for answers, and Zimbardo\u2019s experiment appeared to offer them, putting guards and prisoners on the same moral plane\u200a\u2014\u200amutual victims of the carceral state\u200a\u2014\u200athough in fact nearly all the Attica killings had been committed by guards and officers. Zimbardo\u2019s tale of guards-run-amok and terrorized prisoners first came to national attention with a twenty-minute prime-time special on NBC. Richard Yacco told NBC\u2019s reporter that he and other prisoners had been told they couldn\u2019t quit, but, after he failed to hew to Zimbardo\u2019s narrative of prisoners organically \u201cslipping into\u201d their roles, he was edited out of the program (the recording survives <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/jh477zg7277\" href=\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/jh477zg7277\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d802\" name=\"d802\">In his 1973 article in the New York Times Magazine, Zimbardo wrote unequivocally that Korpi\u2019s breakdown was genuine. By the mid 1980s, when he asked Korpi to appear on the Phil Donahue show and in the documentary <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Quiet Rage</em>, Korpi had long since made clear that he\u2019d been faking, but Zimbardo still wanted to include the breakdown. Korpi went along with it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e435\" name=\"e435\">\u201cIf he wanted to say I had a mental breakdown, it seemed a minor note,\u201d he told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t really object. I thought it was an exaggeration that served Phil\u2019s purposes.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7cac\" name=\"7cac\">In <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Quiet Rage</em>, Zimbardo introduced dramatic audio footage of Korpi\u2019s \u201cbreakdown\u201d by saying \u201che began to play the role of the crazy person but soon the role became too real as he went into an uncontrollable rage.\u201d A taped segment in which Korpi admitted playacting and described how tiring it was to keep it up for so many hours was edited out. Korpi told me that Zimbardo hounded him for further media appearances long after Korpi asked him to stop, pressuring him with occasional offers of professional help.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"59b4\" name=\"59b4\">\u201cWe unlisted the number and [Zimbardo] figured out our unlisted number,\u201d Korpi said. \u201cIt was just bizarre. I would always tell him, \u2018I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with the experiment anymore.\u2019 \u2018But Doug, but Doug, you\u2019re so important! And I\u2019ll give you lots of referrals!\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I know Phil, but I testify in court now and it\u2019s embarrassing how I was. I don\u2019t want to have that be a big public thing anymore.\u2019 But Phil just couldn\u2019t hear that I didn\u2019t want to be involved. This went on for years.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"886a\" name=\"886a\">(Zimbardo confirmed that he gave Korpi referrals, but declined to comment further.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5e4\" name=\"f5e4\">The Stanford prison experiment established Zimbardo as perhaps the most prominent living American psychologist. He became the primary author of one of the field\u2019s most popular and long-running textbooks, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Psychology: Core Concepts</em>, and the host of a 1990 PBS video series, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Discovering Psychology</em>, which gained wide usage in high school and college classes and is still screened today. Both featured the Stanford prison experiment. And its popularity wasn\u2019t limited to the United States. Polish philosopher Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s citation of the experiment in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Modernity and the Holocaust</em> in 1989 typified a growing tradition in Eastern Europe and Germany of looking to the Stanford prison experiment for help explaining the Holocaust. In his influential 1992 book, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ordinary Men</em>, historian Christopher Browning relied on both the Stanford prison experiment and the Milgram experiment, another social psychology touchstone, in arguing that Nazi mass killings were in part the result of situational factors (other scholars argued that subscribers to a national ideology that identified Jews as enemies of the state could hardly be described as \u201cordinary men\u201d). 2001, the same year Zimbardo was elected president of the American Psychological Association, saw the release of a German-language film, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Das Experiment</em>, that was based on the SPE but amped the violence up to Nazi-worthy levels, with guards not only abusing prisoners but murdering them and each other. When prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib came to light in 2004, Zimbardo again made the rounds on the talk show circuit, arguing that the abuse had been the result not of a few \u201cbad apple\u201d soldiers but of a \u201cbad barrel\u201d and providing expert testimony on behalf of Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick, the staff sergeant supervising the military policemen who committed the abuses. With the resurgence of interest in the experiment, Zimbardo published <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Lucifer Effect</em> in 2007, offering more detail about it than ever before, though framed in such a way as to avoid calling his basic findings into question. The book became a national bestseller.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5f0\" name=\"c5f0\">All the while, however, experts had been casting doubt on Zimbardo\u2019s work.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"7bb9\" name=\"7bb9\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"101c\" name=\"101c\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">D</span>espite the Stanford prison experiment\u2019s canonical status in intro psych classes around the country today, methodological criticism of it was swift and widespread in the years after it was conducted.

In 2005, Carlo Prescott, the San Quentin parolee who consulted on the experiment\u2019s design, published an <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford20050428-01.2.24&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------\" href=\"https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford20050428-01.2.24&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Op-Ed</a> in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Stanford Daily</em> entitled \u201cThe Lie of the Stanford Prison Experiment,\u201d revealing that many of the guards\u2019 techniques for tormenting prisoners had been taken from his own experience at San Quentin rather than having been invented by the participants.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e8c\" name=\"4e8c\">In another blow to the experiment\u2019s scientific credibility, Haslam and Reicher\u2019s attempted replication, in which guards received no coaching and prisoners were free to quit at any time, failed to reproduce Zimbardo\u2019s findings. Far from breaking down under escalating abuse, prisoners banded together and won extra privileges from guards, who became increasingly passive and cowed. According to Reicher, Zimbardo did not take it well when they attempted to publish their findings in the British Journal of Social Psychology.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"40d8\" name=\"40d8\">\u201cWe discovered that he was privately writing to editors to try to stop us getting published by claiming that we were fraudulent,\u201d Reicher told me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"57c5\" name=\"57c5\">Despite Zimbardo\u2019s intervention, the journal decided to publish Reicher and Haslam\u2019s article, alongside a <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/014466605X81720\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/014466605X81720\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commentary</a> by Zimbardo in which he wrote, \u201cI believe this alleged \u2018social psychology field study\u2019 is fraudulent and does not merit acceptance by the social psychological community in Britain, the United States or anywhere except in media psychology.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"40b3\" name=\"40b3\">\u201cUltimately,\u201d said Reicher, \u201cwhat we discovered was that we weren\u2019t in a scientific debate, which is what we thought we were in. We were in a commercial rivalry. At that point he was very keen on getting the Hollywood film out.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ccea\" name=\"ccea\">Zimbardo\u2019s decades-long effort to turn his work into a feature film finally bore fruit in 2015 with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Stanford Prison Experiment, </em>for which he served as consultant (he is played by Billy Crudup). Though the film purports to take a critical stance toward the experiment, it hews in essential ways to Zimbardo\u2019s narrative, neglecting to include Zimbardo\u2019s encouragement of tough tactics in the Saturday guard orientation or to mention David Jaffe\u2019s role at all. Beleaguered by abusive guards, the character based on Korpi (Ezra Miller) succumbs to a delusion that he is not participating in an experiment at all but has been placed in a real prison and, in the emotional turning point of the film, suffers a screaming meltdown. Gradually his delusion begins to infect the other prisoners.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05c3\" name=\"05c3\">Somehow, neither Prescott\u2019s letter nor the failed replication nor the numerous academic critiques have so far lessened the grip of Zimbardo\u2019s tale on the public imagination. The appeal of the Stanford prison experiment seems to go deeper than its scientific validity, perhaps because it tells us a story about ourselves that we desperately want to believe: that we, as individuals, cannot really be held accountable for the sometimes reprehensible things we do. As troubling as it might seem to accept Zimbardo\u2019s fallen vision of human nature, it is also profoundly liberating. It means we\u2019re off the hook. Our actions are determined by circumstance. Our fallibility is situational. Just as the Gospel promised to absolve us of our sins if we would only believe, the SPE offered a form of redemption tailor-made for a scientific era, and we embraced it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f6c\" name=\"9f6c\">For psychology professors, the Stanford prison experiment is a reliable crowd-pleaser, typically presented with lots of vividly disturbing video footage. In introductory psychology lecture halls, often filled with students from other majors, the counterintuitive assertion that students\u2019 own belief in their inherent goodness is flatly wrong offers dramatic proof of psychology\u2019s ability to teach them new and surprising things about themselves. Some intro psych professors I spoke to felt that it helped instill the understanding that those who do bad things are not necessarily bad people. Others pointed to the importance of teaching students in our unusually individualistic culture that their actions are profoundly influenced by external factors.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0400\" name=\"0400\">\u201cEven if the science was quirky,\u201d said Kenneth Carter, professor of psychology at Emory University and co-author of the textbook <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Learn Psychology</em>, \u201cor there was something that was wrong about the way that it was put together, I think at the end of the day, I still want students to be mindful that they may find themselves in powerful situations that could override how they might behave as an individual. That\u2019s the story that\u2019s bigger than the science.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"395a\" name=\"395a\">But if Zimbardo\u2019s work was so profoundly unscientific, how can we trust the stories it claims to tell? Many other studies, such as Soloman Asch\u2019s famous <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html\" href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">experiment</a> demonstrating that people will ignore the evidence of their own eyes in conforming to group judgments about line lengths, illustrate the profound effect our environments can have on us.

What is unique, and uniquely compelling, about Zimbardo\u2019s narrative of the Stanford prison experiment is its suggestion that all it takes to make us enthusiastic sadists is a jumpsuit, a billy club, and the green light to dominate our fellow human beings.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"871b\" name=\"871b\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 566px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 80.80000000000001%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png\" data-height=\"850\" data-image-id=\"1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png\" data-width=\"1052\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure\" id=\"48c3\" name=\"48c3\">\u201cYou have a vertigo when you look into it,\u201d Le Texier explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my god, I could be a Nazi myself.

Curious about why the field\u2019s appointed gatekeepers, presumably well-informed about the experiment\u2019s dubious history, would choose to include it nonetheless, I reached out. Three told me they had originally omitted the Stanford prison experiment from their first editions because of concerns about its scientific legitimacy. But even psychology professors are not immune to the forces of social influence: two added it back in under pressure from reviewers and teachers, a third because it was so much in the news after Abu Ghraib. Other authors I spoke with expressed far more critical perspectives on the experiment than appeared in their textbooks, offering an array of reasons why it nonetheless had pedagogical value.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c947\" name=\"c947\">Greg Feist, coauthor of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Psychology: Perspectives and Connections</em>, told me that his personal view of the experiment shifted some years back after he came across the 2005 Op-Ed by Carlo Prescott, which he described as \u201cshocking.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"579a\" name=\"579a\">\u201cOnce I found out some of the ethical and scientific problems with the study, I didn\u2019t think it was worth perpetuating, to be honest,\u201d Feist said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2de3\" name=\"2de3\">But there it is in his textbook\u2019s third edition, published in 2014: a thoroughly conventional telling of Zimbardo\u2019s standard narrative, with brief criticisms appearing only later in the chapter.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"5c95\" name=\"5c95\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"6d2b\" name=\"6d2b\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> October 25, 1971, a mere two months after concluding an experiment so stressful that he lost ten pounds in the span of a week, Philip Zimbardo traveled to Washington D.C. at the request of the House Committee on the Judiciary. In the hearing chamber, Zimbardo sat before the assembled Congressmen of Subcommittee 3 and told a whopper: the \u201cguards\u201d in his recent experiment \u201cwere simply told that they were going to go into a situation that could be serious and have perhaps some danger\u2026 They made up their own rules for maintaining law, order, and respect.\u201d Zimbardo described a laundry list of abuses, causing \u201cacute situational traumatic reactions\u201d from the prisoners. Despite still never having set foot in an actual prison, he generalized freely from the unreviewed, unpublished, and largely unanalyzed results of his study: \u201cThe prison situation in our country is guaranteed to generate severe enough pathological reactions in both guards and prisoners as to debase their humanity, lower their feelings of self-worth, and make it difficult for them to be part of a society outside of their prison.\u201d Zimbardo was a hit. As Representative Hamilton Fish, Jr. of New York put it: \u201cYou certainly helped me a great deal in clarifying some of the things we have seen the past few days and understanding them.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1406\" name=\"1406\">In the wake of the prison uprisings at San Quentin and Attica, Zimbardo\u2019s message was perfectly attuned to the national zeitgeist. A critique of the criminal justice system that shunted blame away from inmates and guards alike onto a \u201csituation\u201d defined so vaguely as to fit almost any agenda offered a seductive lens on the day\u2019s social ills for just about everyone. Reform-minded liberals were hungry for evidence that people who committed crimes were driven to do so by the environment they\u2019d been born into, which played into their argument that reducing urban crime would require systemic reform\u200a\u2014\u200aa continuation of Johnson\u2019s \u201cwar on poverty\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200arather than the \u201c<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377\" href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">war on crime</a>\u201d that President Richard M. Nixon had campaigned on. \u201cWhen I heard of the study,\u201d recalls Frances Cullen, one of the preeminent criminologists of the last half century, \u201cI just thought, \u2018Well of course that\u2019s true.\u2019 I was uncritical. Everybody was uncritical.\u201d In Cullen\u2019s field, the Stanford prison experiment provided handy evidence that the prison system was fundamentally broken. \u201cIt confirmed what people already believed, which was that prisons were inherently inhumane,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7536\" name=\"7536\">The racial dynamics of the Stanford prison experiment, which have never been adequately explored, should probably have given reformers pause. Carlo Prescott, who had just suffered sixteen years of imprisonment as an African American, played a pivotal role in shaping the architecture of the experiment. Frustrated in part by the lack of black experimental subjects, he intervened repeatedly in the action, seeking to bring, as he put it to me, \u201can air of authenticity to boys who were getting $15 a day to pretend to be prisoners\u200a\u2014\u200aall Caucasian, as you recall. [Ed. note: one prisoner was Asian American.] Some of the genuine things that shock you as a result of having your liberty taken and your ass being controlled by people who hate you before you even get there.\u201d Yet Zimbardo\u2019s account of the \u201csituation\u201d that engendered abuse left race out of the equation. He often used the word \u201cnormal\u201d to describe the participants in his study despite the fact that they were hardly a normal representation of the American inmate population at that time. Analyzing American prisoner abuse as a product of race-blind \u201csituational forces\u201d erased its deep roots in racial oppression.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e921\" name=\"e921\">Nonetheless, the Stanford prison experiment came to exert a significant influence on American criminology. Zimbardo\u2019s first academic article about his results was published in the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">International Journal of Criminology and Penology</em> rather than a psychology journal. A year later, Robert Martinson, one of a team of sociologists who had been commissioned by the state of New York to evaluate various prison programs, appeared on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">60 Minutes</em> with a dark message: when it came to rehabilitation of prisoners, Martinson said, nothing worked. Almost overnight, Martinson\u2019s \u201cnothing works doctrine\u201d became accepted wisdom in America. It is often cited as the cause of the widespread abandonment in the 1970s by academics and policymakers alike of the notion that a prison could be a rehabilitative environment. Cullen believes Zimbardo\u2019s study played a role too.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1050\" name=\"1050\">\u201cWhat the Stanford Prison Experiment did,\u201d Cullen says, \u201cwas to say: prisons are not reformable. The crux of many prison reforms, especially among academic criminologists, became that prisons were inherently inhumane, so our agenda had to be minimizing the use of prisons, emphasizing alternatives to prison, emphasizing community corrections.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c58\" name=\"2c58\">In an era of rapidly rising crime, this agenda proved politically untenable. Instead, conservative politicians who had no qualms about using imprisonment purely to punish ushered in a decades-long \u201cget tough\u201d era in crime that disproportionately targeted African Americans. The incarceration rate rose steadily, standing now at five times higher than in comparable countries; one in three black men in America today will spend time in prison.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80cf\" name=\"80cf\">It would, of course, be unfair to lay mass incarceration at Zimbardo\u2019s door. It is more accurate to say that, for all its reformist ideals, the Stanford prison experiment contributed to the polarizing intellectual currents of its time. According to a 2017 survey conducted by Cullen and his colleagues Teresa Kulig and Travis Pratt, 95% of the many criminology papers that have cited the Stanford prison experiment over the years have accepted its basic message that prisons are inherently inhumane.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2db9\" name=\"2db9\">\u201cWhat struck me later in life was how all of us lost our scientific skepticism,\u201d Cullen says. \u201cWe became as ideological, in our way, as the climate change deniers. Zimbardo\u2019s and Martinson\u2019s studies made so much intuitive sense that no one took a step back and said, \u2018Well, this could be wrong.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c34d\" name=\"c34d\">Most criminologists today agree that prisons are not, in fact, as hopeless as Zimbardo and Martinson made them out to be. Some prison programs do reliably help inmates better their lives. Though international comparisons are difficult to make, Norway\u2019s maximum-security Halden prison, where convicted murderers wear casual clothing, receive extensive job-skill training, share meals with unarmed guards, and wander at will during daylight hours through a scenic landscape of pine trees and blueberry bushes, offers a hopeful sign. Norwegians prisoners seldom get in fights and reoffend at lower rates than anywhere else in the world. To begin to ameliorate the evils of mass incarceration, Cullen argues, will require researching what makes some forms of prison management better than others, rather than, as the Stanford prison experiment did, dismissing them all as inherently abusive.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"848b\" name=\"848b\">Meanwhile, the legacy of Zimbardo\u2019s work goes well beyond its influence on our troubled criminal justice system, touching directly on how we understand our personal moral freedom.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"1dee\" name=\"1dee\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"ab00\" name=\"ab00\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> a sunny August afternoon in 2006, at the height of the Iraq War, a nineteen-year-old U.S. Army Ranger named Alex Blum drove a superior in the Rangers and three other men to a Bank of America branch in Tacoma, where they leapt out of his car and committed an armed takeover robbery using pistols and AK-47s. Three days later, Alex, who happens to be my cousin, was arrested in our hometown of Denver, Colorado. Alex claimed to our family to have believed he had been participating in a training exercise. After the radical conditioning of the month-long Ranger Indoctrination Program he had just undergone, he had followed his superior without questioning. For Alex\u2019s sentencing hearing, his defense team called on a prominent expert to argue that his involvement in the robbery was due not to his own free will but to powerful \u201csituational forces\u201d: Dr. Philip Zimbardo. Alex received an extraordinarily lenient sentence, and Dr. Zimbardo became a family hero.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f941\" name=\"f941\">In October 2010, Zimbardo co-hosted a special episode of the Dr. Phil Show entitled <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">When Good People Do Bad Things, </em>using Alex\u2019s story to spread his message that evil acts are the result of circumstance rather than character and choice. From my place in the studio audience, I heard Zimbardo describe guards abusing prisoners without any urging whatsoever\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cI constrained the guards not to use any physical force, but they intuitively knew how to use psychological force,\u201d Zimbardo said. Next he used his theories to explain the abuses at Abu Ghraib, offering up the same arguments he\u2019d recently used to defend Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick. When Dr. Phil asked who in the studio audience thought they too might have tortured detainees in a similar situation, everyone in my family stood up, almost the only ones to do so. We were proud to support Alex, and we knew this was the lesson we were supposed to derive from Zimbardo\u2019s work.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"1aea\" name=\"1aea\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 566px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 80.80000000000001%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\" data-height=\"850\" data-image-id=\"1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\" data-width=\"1052\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"43a0\" name=\"43a0\">A few years later, after deciding to write a book about Alex\u2019s story, I discovered evidence that he hadn\u2019t told the whole truth about his involvement. When I confronted him, he confessed to me that his choice to participate in the bank robbery was freer and more informed than he had ever let on before. Accepting responsibility was transformative for him. It freed him from the aggrieved victim mindset in which he had been trapped for years. Zimbardo\u2019s \u201csituational forces\u201d excuse had once appeared to give my cousin a way to believe in his fundamental goodness despite his egregious crime, but seeing the personal growth that came with deeper moral reckoning, I began to wonder if it had really done him a service.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"695a\" name=\"695a\">It was only after interviewing Zimbardo at his home in San Francisco for my book about Alex that I began researching the history of his famous experiment in depth. The more I found, the more unsettled I became. Shortly after my book was published, having by now spoken to a number of former participants in the study, I approached Zimbardo for another interview. For months I didn\u2019t hear back. Then Le Texier\u2019s book was published, and Zimbardo suddenly agreed to speak to me, apparently eager to respond to the charges. We spoke by Skype shortly after his return from a psychology conference. His office was stacked high with books and papers, the phone constantly ringing in the background as we talked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed11\" name=\"ed11\">After hearing Zimbardo describe the experiment so many times over the years, I was not expecting to hear anything new. The first surprise came when I asked about Korpi\u2019s and Yacco\u2019s claims to me that they had been told they couldn\u2019t leave. After dismissing them at first as lies and then claiming that Korpi and Yacco had simply forgotten the safe phrase \u201cI quit the experiment,\u201d Zimbardo astonished me by acknowledging that he had in fact instructed his staff to tell prisoners they couldn\u2019t get out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ab62\" name=\"ab62\">\u201cIf [prisoners] said, \u2018I want to get out,\u2019 and you said, \u2018Okay,\u2019 then as soon as they left, the experiment would be over,\u201d Zimbardo explained. \u201cAll the prisoners would say, \u2018I want to get out.\u2019 There has to be a good reason now for them to get out. The mentality has to be, in their mind, \u2018I am a prisoner in a prison,\u2019 not, \u2018I\u2019m a college student in an experiment. I don\u2019t want my money. I\u2019m quitting the experiment.\u2019 You don\u2019t quit a prison. That\u2019s the whole point of the Pirandellian prison [Ed. note: Pirandello was an Italian playwright whose plays blended fiction and reality]. At one level you\u2019re a student in a basement in an experiment. At another level, you\u2019re a prisoner being abused by guards in a county jail.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a932\" name=\"a932\">Zimbardo confirmed that David Jaffe had devised the rules with the guards, but tried to argue that he hadn\u2019t been lying when he told Congress (and, years later, insisted to Lesley Stahl on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">60 Minutes</em>) that the guards had devised the rules themselves, on the grounds that Zimbardo himself had not been present at the time. He at first denied that the experiment had had any political motive, but after I read him an excerpt from a press release disseminated on the experiment\u2019s second day explicitly stating that it aimed to bring awareness to the need for reform, he admitted that he had probably written it himself under pressure from Carlo Prescott, with whom he had co-taught a summer school class on the psychology of imprisonment<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"edbc\" name=\"edbc\">\u201cDuring that course, I began to see that prisons are a waste of time, and money, and lives,\u201d Zimbardo said. \u201cSo yes, I am a social activist, and prison reform was always important in my mind. It was not the reason to do the study.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6088\" name=\"6088\">At the close of a long, tense conversation, I asked him whether he thought Le Texier\u2019s book would change the way people saw the experiment.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e7c\" name=\"7e7c\">\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, sounding tired. \u201cIn a sense, I don\u2019t really care. At this point, the big problem is, I don\u2019t want to waste any more of my time. After my talk with you, I\u2019m not going to do any interviews about it. It\u2019s just a waste of time. People can say whatever they want about it. It\u2019s the most famous study in the history of psychology at this point. There\u2019s no study that people talk about 50 years later. Ordinary people know about it. They say, \u2018What do you do?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a psychologist.\u2019 It could be a cab driver in Budapest. It could be a restaurant owner in Poland. I mention I\u2019m a psychologist, and they say, \u2018Did you hear about the study?\u2019 It\u2019s got a life of its own now. If he wants to say it was all a hoax, that\u2019s up to him. I\u2019m not going to defend it anymore. The defense is its longevity.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe29\" name=\"fe29\">Zimbardo has spent much of the last fifty years answering questions about the darkest six days of his life, in some ways a prisoner of his own experiment\u2019s success. When I asked him if he was glad, looking back, to have conducted the study, he said he had mixed feelings. He considered the shyness clinic he founded in Palo Alto in 1975 to be his most important work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3450\" name=\"3450\">\u201cIf it was not for the prison study, that would be my legacy,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e948\" name=\"e948\">\u201cDoes some part of you wish that were your legacy?\u201d I asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"508b\" name=\"508b\">\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said, \u201cof course. That\u2019s positive. The prison study, the negative part is I am Dr. Evil. I created this evil situation, like Svengali or something.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f6c6\" name=\"f6c6\">In Zimbardo\u2019s telling, he, too, is a victim of circumstance\u200a\u2014\u200ashaped by his surroundings like everyone else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3aec\" name=\"3aec\">\u201cI gradually, with a lack of awareness, transformed myself into being the prison superintendent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? My office had the sign \u2018Prison Superintendent.\u2019 David Jaffe\u2019s office said \u2018Warden.\u2019 Then I had to deal with the parents. I had to deal with the parole board hearings. I had to deal with the priest coming in. People are dealing with me not as a researcher but as the prison superintendent, asking for help with their prisoner son.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bb36\" name=\"bb36\">This excuse has served Zimbardo as well as anyone over the years, but it may no longer be enough. After reviewing some of Le Texier\u2019s evidence, textbook author Greg Feist told me he is considering taking a firmer stand in the forthcoming edition of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Psychology: Perspectives and Connections</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"28ac\" name=\"28ac\">\u201cI hope there does come a point, now that we know what we do, where Zimbardo\u2019s narrative dies,\u201d Feist said. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s not going to happen soon, but hopefully it will happen. Because I just think it\u2019s a\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"361e\" name=\"361e\">Feist paused, searching for the appropriate word, then settled on a simple one.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"44cb\" name=\"44cb\">\u201cIt is a lie.\u201d</p></div></div>", "title": "The Lifespan of a Lie", "url": "https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62", "content": "It was late in the evening of August 16th, 1971, and twenty-two-year-old Douglas Korpi, a slim, short-statured Berkeley graduate with a mop of pale, shaggy hair, was locked in a dark closet in the basement of the Stanford psychology department, naked beneath a thin white smock bearing the number 8612, screaming his head off.\u201cI mean, Jesus Christ, I\u2019m burning up inside!\u201d he yelled, kicking furiously at the door. \u201cDon\u2019t you know? I want to get out! This is all fucked up inside! I can\u2019t stand another night! I just can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201dIt was a defining moment in what has become perhaps the best-known psychology study of all time. Whether you learned about Philip Zimbardo\u2019s famous \u201cStanford Prison Experiment\u201d in an introductory psych class or just absorbed it from the cultural ether, you\u2019ve probably heard the basic story.Zimbardo, a young Stanford psychology professor, built a mock jail in the basement of Jordan Hall and stocked it with nine \u201cprisoners,\u201d and nine \u201cguards,\u201d all male, college-age respondents to a newspaper ad who were assigned their roles at random and paid a generous daily wage to participate. The senior prison \u201cstaff\u201d consisted of Zimbardo himself and a handful of his students.The study was supposed to last for two weeks, but after Zimbardo\u2019s girlfriend stopped by six days in and witnessed the conditions in the \u201cStanford County Jail,\u201d she convinced him to shut it down. Since then, the tale of guards run amok and terrified prisoners breaking down one by one has become world-famous, a cultural touchstone that\u2019s been the subject of books, documentaries, and feature films\u200a\u2014\u200aeven an episode of Veronica Mars.The SPE is often used to teach the lesson that our behavior is profoundly affected by the social roles and situations in which we find ourselves. But its deeper, more disturbing implication is that we all have a wellspring of potential sadism lurking within us, waiting to be tapped by circumstance. It has been invoked to explain the massacre at My Lai during the Vietnam War, the Armenian genocide, and the horrors of the Holocaust. And the ultimate symbol of the agony that man helplessly inflicts on his brother is Korpi\u2019s famous breakdown, set off after only 36 hours by the cruelty of his peers.There\u2019s just one problem: Korpi\u2019s breakdown was a sham.\u201cAnybody who is a clinician would know that I was faking,\u201d he told me last summer, in the first extensive interview he has granted in years. \u201cIf you listen to the tape, it\u2019s not subtle. I\u2019m not that good at acting. I mean, I think I do a fairly good job, but I\u2019m more hysterical than psychotic.\u201dNow a forensic psychologist himself, Korpi told me his dramatic performance in the SPE was indeed inspired by fear, but not of abusive guards. Instead, he was worried about failing to get into grad school.\u201cThe reason I took the job was that I thought I\u2019d have every day to sit around by myself and study for my GREs,\u201d Korpi explained of the Graduate Record Exams often used to determine admissions, adding that he was scheduled to take the test just after the study concluded. Shortly after the experiment began, he asked for his study books. The prison staff refused. The next day Korpi asked again. No dice. At that point he decided there was, as he put it to me, \u201cno point to this job.\u201d First, Korpi tried faking a stomach-ache. When that didn\u2019t work, he tried faking a breakdown. Far from feeling traumatized, he added, he had actually enjoyed himself for much of his short tenure in the jail, other than a tussle with the guards over his bed.\u201c[The first day] was really fun,\u201d Korpi recalled. \u201cThe rebellion was fun. There were no repercussions. We knew [the guards] couldn\u2019t hurt us, they couldn\u2019t hit us. They were white college kids just like us, so it was a very safe situation. It was just a job. If you listen to the tape, you can hear it in my voice: I have a great job. I get to yell and scream and act all hysterical. I get to act like a prisoner. I was being a good employee. It was a great time.\u201dFor Korpi, the most frightening thing about the experiment was being told that, regardless of his desire to quit, he truly did not have the power to leave.\u201cI was entirely shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it was one thing to pick me up in a cop car and put me in a smock. But they\u2019re really escalating the game by saying that I can\u2019t leave. They\u2019re stepping to a new level. I was just like, \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 That was my feeling.\u201dAnother prisoner, Richard Yacco, recalled being stunned on the experiment\u2019s second day after asking a staff-member how to quit and learning that he couldn\u2019t. A third prisoner, Clay Ramsay, was so dismayed on discovering that he was trapped that he started a hunger strike. \u201cI regarded it as a real prison because [in order to get out], you had to do something that made them worry about their liability,\u201d Ramsay told me.When I spoke to Zimbardo this past May about Korpi\u2019s and Yacco\u2019s claims, he initially denied that they were obligated to stay.\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201dBut it is no longer just a question of Zimbardo\u2019s word against theirs. This past April, a French academic and filmmaker named Thibault Le Texier published Histoire d\u2019un Mensonge [History of a Lie], plumbing newly-released documents from Zimbardo\u2019s archives at Stanford University to tell a dramatically different story of the experiment. After Zimbardo told me that Korpi and Yacco\u2019s accusations were baseless, I read him a transcript unearthed by Le Texier of a taped conversation between Zimbardo and his staff on day three of the simulation: \u201cAn interesting thing was that the guys who came in yesterday, the two guys who came in and said they wanted to leave, and I said no,\u201d Zimbardo told his staff. \u201cThere are only two conditions under which you can leave, medical help or psychiatric\u2026 I think they really believed they can\u2019t get out.\u201d\u201cNow, okay,\u201d Zimbardo corrected himself on the phone with me. He then acknowledged that the informed consent forms which subjects signed had included an explicit safe phrase: \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201d Only that precise phrase would trigger their release.\u201cNone of them said that,\u201d Zimbardo said. \u201cThey said, \u2018I want out. I want a doctor. I want my mother,\u2019 etc., etc. Essentially I was saying, \u2018You have to say, \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201d\u2019\u201dBut the informed consent forms that Zimbardo\u2019s subjects signed, which are available online from Zimbardo\u2019s own website, contain no mention of the phrase \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201dZimbardo\u2019s standard narrative of the Stanford prison experiment offers the prisoners\u2019 emotional responses as proof of how powerfully affected they were by the guards\u2019 mistreatment. The shock of real imprisonment provides a simpler and far less groundbreaking explanation. It may also have had legal implications, should prisoners have thought to pursue them. Korpi told me that the greatest regret of his life was failing to sue Zimbardo.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we file false imprisonment charges?\u201d Korpi asked during an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing! We should have done something!\u201dAccording to James Cahan, former Deputy District Attorney for Stanford University\u2019s Santa Clara County, Korpi may well have had a case: the six hours or so after Korpi made his desire to quit the experiment plain, much of which he spent confined in the closet, appear to have met the statutory requirements for false imprisonment in California.\u201cIf he says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. I want to talk to you about getting out,\u2019\u201d Cahan said, \u201cand he\u2019s then locked in a room, and he is at some point trying to or asking to get out of that room in order to communicate as a contract employee or whatever he is, and he is unable to get out of that room, then that would seem to get very close to being out of the realm of informed consent and into the realm of a violation of the penal code.\u201dWhile Zimbardo likes to begin the story of the Stanford prison experiment on Sunday, August 15th, 1971, when guards began harassing newly arrived prisoners at the \u201cStanford County Jail\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amaking it sound as if they became abusive of their own accord\u200a\u2014\u200aa more honest telling begins a day earlier, with the orientation meeting for the guards. There, addressing the group less as experimental subjects than as collaborators, Zimbardo put a thumb on the scales, clearly indicating to the guards that their role was to help induce the desired prisoner mindset of powerlessness and fear.\u201cWe cannot physically abuse or torture them,\u201d Zimbardo told them, in recordings first released a decade and a half after the experiment. \u201cWe can create boredom. We can create a sense of frustration. We can create fear in them, to some degree\u2026 We have total power in the situation. They have none.\u201dMuch of the meeting was conducted by David Jaffe, the undergraduate student serving as \u201cWarden,\u201d whose foundational contribution to the experiment Zimbardo has long underplayed. Jaffe and a few fellow students had actually cooked up the idea of a simulated prison themselves three months earlier, in response to an open-ended assignment in an undergraduate class taught by Zimbardo. Jaffe cast some of his dormmates in Toyon Hall as prisoners and some as guards and came up with 15 draconian prison rules for his guards to enforce, including \u201cPrisoners must address each other by number only,\u201d \u201cPrisoners must never refer to their condition as an \u2018experiment\u2019 or a \u2018simulation,\u201d and \u201cFailure to obey any of the above rules may result in punishment.\u201d Zimbardo was so taken with the tears and drama produced by Jaffe\u2019s two-day simulation that he decided to try it himself, this time randomly assigning guards and prisoners and dragging the action on much longer. Because Zimbardo himself had never visited a real prison, the standards of realism were defined by Jaffe\u2019s prison research and the nightmarish recollections of Carlo Prescott, a San Quentin parolee whom Zimbardo met through Jaffe and brought in as a consultant. Jaffe was given extraordinary leeway in shaping the Stanford prison experiment in order to replicate his previous results. \u201cDr. Zimbardo suggested that the most difficult problem would be to get the guards to behave like guards,\u201d Jaffe wrote in a post-experiment evaluation. \u201cI was asked to suggest tactics based on my previous experience as master sadist.\u00a0\u2026 I was given the responsibility of trying to elicit \u2018tough-guard\u2019 behavior.\u201d Though Zimbardo has often stated that the guards devised their own rules, in fact most of them were copied directly from Jaffe\u2019s class assignment during that Saturday orientation meeting. Jaffe also offered the guards ideas for hassling the prisoners, including forcing them to clean thorns out of dirty blankets that had been thrown in the weeds.Once the simulation got underway, Jaffe explicitly corrected guards who weren\u2019t acting tough enough, fostering exactly the pathological behavior that Zimbardo would later claim had arisen organically.\u201cThe guards have to know that every guard is going to be what we call a tough guard,\u201d Jaffe told one such guard [skip to 8:35]. \u201c[H]opefully what will come out of this study is some very serious recommendations for reform\u2026 so that we can get on the media and into the press with it, and say \u2018Now look at what this is really about.\u2019\u00a0\u2026 [T]ry and react as you picture the pigs reacting.\u201dThough most guards gave lackluster performances, some even going out of their way to do small favors for the prisoners, one in particular rose to the challenge: Dave Eshleman, whom prisoners nicknamed \u201cJohn Wayne\u201d for his Southern accent and inventive cruelty. But Eshleman, who had studied acting throughout high school and college, has always admitted that his accent was just as fake as Korpi\u2019s breakdown. His overarching goal, as he told me in an interview, was simply to help the experiment succeed.\u201cI took it as a kind of an improv exercise,\u201d Eshleman said. \u201cI believed that I was doing what the researchers wanted me to do, and I thought I\u2019d do it better than anybody else by creating this despicable guard persona. I\u2019d never been to the South, but I used a southern accent, which I got from Cool Hand Luke.\u201dEshleman expressed regret to me for the way he mistreated prisoners, adding that at times he was calling on his own experience undergoing a brutal fraternity hazing a few months earlier. \u201cI took it just way over the top,\u201d he said. But Zimbardo and his staff seemed to approve. After the experiment ended, Zimbardo singled him out and thanked him.\u201cAs I was walking down the hall,\u201d Eshleman recalled, \u201che made it a point to come and let me know what a great job I\u2019d done. I actually felt like I had accomplished something good because I had contributed in some way to the understanding of human nature.\u201dAccording to Alex Haslam and Stephen Reicher, psychologists who co-directed an attempted replication of the Stanford prison experiment in Great Britain in 2001, a critical factor in making people commit atrocities is a leader assuring them that they are acting in the service of a higher moral cause with which they identify\u200a\u2014\u200afor instance, scientific progress or prison reform. We have been taught that guards abused prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment because of the power of their roles, but Haslam and Reicher argue that their behavior arose instead from their identification with the experimenters, which Jaffe and Zimbardo encouraged at every turn. Eshleman, who described himself on an intake questionnaire as a \u201cscientist at heart,\u201d may have identified more powerfully than anyone, but Jaffe himself put it well in his self-evaluation: \u201cI am startled by the ease with which I could turn off my sensitivity and concern for others for \u2018a good cause.\u2019\u201dFrom the beginning, Zimbardo sought a high media profile for his experiment, allowing KRON, a San Francisco television station, to film his mock arrests and sending them periodic press releases as the action evolved. But Zimbardo\u2019s prison simulation quickly garnered more press attention than he could have imagined. On August 21st, a day after the study\u2019s premature closure, the attempt by George Jackson, radical black activist and author of the bestselling Soledad Brother, to escape from San Quentin, an hour north of Stanford, led to the deaths of three corrections officers and three inmates, including Jackson himself. In short order, KRON arranged a televised debate between Zimbardo and San Quentin\u2019s associate warden. Three weeks later, the predominately African American prisoners at Attica State Prison in New York seized control of the facility from the nearly all-white correctional staff, demanding better treatment. Ordered by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to retake the prison by force, helicopters dumped tear gas canisters and hundreds of law-enforcement officers and armed Attica guards fired blindly into the smoke, slaughtering prisoners and hostages alike.In an era before the mass shootings that have since become the norm in American news headlines, it was a shocking bloodbath\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the deadliest since the Civil War, according to the New York State Special Commission on Attica. The country scrambled for answers, and Zimbardo\u2019s experiment appeared to offer them, putting guards and prisoners on the same moral plane\u200a\u2014\u200amutual victims of the carceral state\u200a\u2014\u200athough in fact nearly all the Attica killings had been committed by guards and officers. Zimbardo\u2019s tale of guards-run-amok and terrorized prisoners first came to national attention with a twenty-minute prime-time special on NBC. Richard Yacco told NBC\u2019s reporter that he and other prisoners had been told they couldn\u2019t quit, but, after he failed to hew to Zimbardo\u2019s narrative of prisoners organically \u201cslipping into\u201d their roles, he was edited out of the program (the recording survives here).In his 1973 article in the New York Times Magazine, Zimbardo wrote unequivocally that Korpi\u2019s breakdown was genuine. By the mid 1980s, when he asked Korpi to appear on the Phil Donahue show and in the documentary Quiet Rage, Korpi had long since made clear that he\u2019d been faking, but Zimbardo still wanted to include the breakdown. Korpi went along with it.\u201cIf he wanted to say I had a mental breakdown, it seemed a minor note,\u201d he told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t really object. I thought it was an exaggeration that served Phil\u2019s purposes.\u201dIn Quiet Rage, Zimbardo introduced dramatic audio footage of Korpi\u2019s \u201cbreakdown\u201d by saying \u201che began to play the role of the crazy person but soon the role became too real as he went into an uncontrollable rage.\u201d A taped segment in which Korpi admitted playacting and described how tiring it was to keep it up for so many hours was edited out. Korpi told me that Zimbardo hounded him for further media appearances long after Korpi asked him to stop, pressuring him with occasional offers of professional help.\u201cWe unlisted the number and [Zimbardo] figured out our unlisted number,\u201d Korpi said. \u201cIt was just bizarre. I would always tell him, \u2018I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with the experiment anymore.\u2019 \u2018But Doug, but Doug, you\u2019re so important! And I\u2019ll give you lots of referrals!\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I know Phil, but I testify in court now and it\u2019s embarrassing how I was. I don\u2019t want to have that be a big public thing anymore.\u2019 But Phil just couldn\u2019t hear that I didn\u2019t want to be involved. This went on for years.\u201d(Zimbardo confirmed that he gave Korpi referrals, but declined to comment further.)The Stanford prison experiment established Zimbardo as perhaps the most prominent living American psychologist. He became the primary author of one of the field\u2019s most popular and long-running textbooks, Psychology: Core Concepts, and the host of a 1990 PBS video series, Discovering Psychology, which gained wide usage in high school and college classes and is still screened today. Both featured the Stanford prison experiment. And its popularity wasn\u2019t limited to the United States. Polish philosopher Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s citation of the experiment in Modernity and the Holocaust in 1989 typified a growing tradition in Eastern Europe and Germany of looking to the Stanford prison experiment for help explaining the Holocaust. In his influential 1992 book, Ordinary Men, historian Christopher Browning relied on both the Stanford prison experiment and the Milgram experiment, another social psychology touchstone, in arguing that Nazi mass killings were in part the result of situational factors (other scholars argued that subscribers to a national ideology that identified Jews as enemies of the state could hardly be described as \u201cordinary men\u201d). 2001, the same year Zimbardo was elected president of the American Psychological Association, saw the release of a German-language film, Das Experiment, that was based on the SPE but amped the violence up to Nazi-worthy levels, with guards not only abusing prisoners but murdering them and each other. When prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib came to light in 2004, Zimbardo again made the rounds on the talk show circuit, arguing that the abuse had been the result not of a few \u201cbad apple\u201d soldiers but of a \u201cbad barrel\u201d and providing expert testimony on behalf of Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick, the staff sergeant supervising the military policemen who committed the abuses. With the resurgence of interest in the experiment, Zimbardo published The Lucifer Effect in 2007, offering more detail about it than ever before, though framed in such a way as to avoid calling his basic findings into question. The book became a national bestseller.All the while, however, experts had been casting doubt on Zimbardo\u2019s work.Despite the Stanford prison experiment\u2019s canonical status in intro psych classes around the country today, methodological criticism of it was swift and widespread in the years after it was conducted. Deviating from scientific protocol, Zimbardo and his students had published their first article about the experiment not in an academic journal of psychology but in The New York Times Magazine, sidestepping the usual peer review. Famed psychologist Erich Fromm, unaware that guards had been explicitly instructed to be \u201ctough,\u201d nonetheless opined that in light of the obvious pressures to abuse, what was most surprising about the experiment was how few guards did. \u201cThe authors believe it proves that the situation alone can within a few days transform normal people into abject, submissive individuals or into ruthless sadists,\u201d Fromm wrote. \u201cIt seems to me that the experiment proves, if anything, rather the contrary.\u201d Some scholars have argued that it wasn\u2019t an experiment at all. Leon Festinger, the psychologist who pioneered the concept of cognitive dissonance, dismissed it as a \u201chappening.\u201dA steady trickle of critiques have continued to emerge over the years, expanding the attack on the experiment to more technical issues around its methodology, such as demand characteristics, ecological validity, and selection bias. In 2005, Carlo Prescott, the San Quentin parolee who consulted on the experiment\u2019s design, published an Op-Ed in The Stanford Daily entitled \u201cThe Lie of the Stanford Prison Experiment,\u201d revealing that many of the guards\u2019 techniques for tormenting prisoners had been taken from his own experience at San Quentin rather than having been invented by the participants.In another blow to the experiment\u2019s scientific credibility, Haslam and Reicher\u2019s attempted replication, in which guards received no coaching and prisoners were free to quit at any time, failed to reproduce Zimbardo\u2019s findings. Far from breaking down under escalating abuse, prisoners banded together and won extra privileges from guards, who became increasingly passive and cowed. According to Reicher, Zimbardo did not take it well when they attempted to publish their findings in the British Journal of Social Psychology.\u201cWe discovered that he was privately writing to editors to try to stop us getting published by claiming that we were fraudulent,\u201d Reicher told me.Despite Zimbardo\u2019s intervention, the journal decided to publish Reicher and Haslam\u2019s article, alongside a commentary by Zimbardo in which he wrote, \u201cI believe this alleged \u2018social psychology field study\u2019 is fraudulent and does not merit acceptance by the social psychological community in Britain, the United States or anywhere except in media psychology.\u201d\u201cUltimately,\u201d said Reicher, \u201cwhat we discovered was that we weren\u2019t in a scientific debate, which is what we thought we were in. We were in a commercial rivalry. At that point he was very keen on getting the Hollywood film out.\u201dZimbardo\u2019s decades-long effort to turn his work into a feature film finally bore fruit in 2015 with The Stanford Prison Experiment, for which he served as consultant (he is played by Billy Crudup). Though the film purports to take a critical stance toward the experiment, it hews in essential ways to Zimbardo\u2019s narrative, neglecting to include Zimbardo\u2019s encouragement of tough tactics in the Saturday guard orientation or to mention David Jaffe\u2019s role at all. Beleaguered by abusive guards, the character based on Korpi (Ezra Miller) succumbs to a delusion that he is not participating in an experiment at all but has been placed in a real prison and, in the emotional turning point of the film, suffers a screaming meltdown. Gradually his delusion begins to infect the other prisoners.Somehow, neither Prescott\u2019s letter nor the failed replication nor the numerous academic critiques have so far lessened the grip of Zimbardo\u2019s tale on the public imagination. The appeal of the Stanford prison experiment seems to go deeper than its scientific validity, perhaps because it tells us a story about ourselves that we desperately want to believe: that we, as individuals, cannot really be held accountable for the sometimes reprehensible things we do. As troubling as it might seem to accept Zimbardo\u2019s fallen vision of human nature, it is also profoundly liberating. It means we\u2019re off the hook. Our actions are determined by circumstance. Our fallibility is situational. Just as the Gospel promised to absolve us of our sins if we would only believe, the SPE offered a form of redemption tailor-made for a scientific era, and we embraced it.For psychology professors, the Stanford prison experiment is a reliable crowd-pleaser, typically presented with lots of vividly disturbing video footage. In introductory psychology lecture halls, often filled with students from other majors, the counterintuitive assertion that students\u2019 own belief in their inherent goodness is flatly wrong offers dramatic proof of psychology\u2019s ability to teach them new and surprising things about themselves. Some intro psych professors I spoke to felt that it helped instill the understanding that those who do bad things are not necessarily bad people. Others pointed to the importance of teaching students in our unusually individualistic culture that their actions are profoundly influenced by external factors.\u201cEven if the science was quirky,\u201d said Kenneth Carter, professor of psychology at Emory University and co-author of the textbook Learn Psychology, \u201cor there was something that was wrong about the way that it was put together, I think at the end of the day, I still want students to be mindful that they may find themselves in powerful situations that could override how they might behave as an individual. That\u2019s the story that\u2019s bigger than the science.\u201dBut if Zimbardo\u2019s work was so profoundly unscientific, how can we trust the stories it claims to tell? Many other studies, such as Soloman Asch\u2019s famous experiment demonstrating that people will ignore the evidence of their own eyes in conforming to group judgments about line lengths, illustrate the profound effect our environments can have on us. The far more methodologically sound\u200a\u2014\u200abut still controversial\u200a\u2014\u200aMilgram experiment demonstrates how prone we are to obedience in certain settings. What is unique, and uniquely compelling, about Zimbardo\u2019s narrative of the Stanford prison experiment is its suggestion that all it takes to make us enthusiastic sadists is a jumpsuit, a billy club, and the green light to dominate our fellow human beings.\u201cYou have a vertigo when you look into it,\u201d Le Texier explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my god, I could be a Nazi myself. I thought I was a good guy, and now I discover that I could be this monster.\u2019 And in the meantime, it\u2019s quite reassuring, because if I become a monster, it\u2019s not because deep inside me I am the devil, it\u2019s because of the situation. I think that\u2019s why the experiment was so famous in Germany and Eastern Europe. You don\u2019t feel guilty. \u2018Oh, okay, it was the situation. We are all good guys. No problem. It\u2019s just the situation made us do it.\u2019 So it\u2019s shocking, but at the same time it\u2019s reassuring. I think these two messages of the experiment made it famous.\u201dIn surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015, Richard Griggs and Jared Bartels each found that nearly every introductory psychology textbook on the market included Zimbardo\u2019s narrative of the experiment, most uncritically. Curious about why the field\u2019s appointed gatekeepers, presumably well-informed about the experiment\u2019s dubious history, would choose to include it nonetheless, I reached out. Three told me they had originally omitted the Stanford prison experiment from their first editions because of concerns about its scientific legitimacy. But even psychology professors are not immune to the forces of social influence: two added it back in under pressure from reviewers and teachers, a third because it was so much in the news after Abu Ghraib. Other authors I spoke with expressed far more critical perspectives on the experiment than appeared in their textbooks, offering an array of reasons why it nonetheless had pedagogical value.Greg Feist, coauthor of Psychology: Perspectives and Connections, told me that his personal view of the experiment shifted some years back after he came across the 2005 Op-Ed by Carlo Prescott, which he described as \u201cshocking.\u201d\u201cOnce I found out some of the ethical and scientific problems with the study, I didn\u2019t think it was worth perpetuating, to be honest,\u201d Feist said.But there it is in his textbook\u2019s third edition, published in 2014: a thoroughly conventional telling of Zimbardo\u2019s standard narrative, with brief criticisms appearing only later in the chapter.On October 25, 1971, a mere two months after concluding an experiment so stressful that he lost ten pounds in the span of a week, Philip Zimbardo traveled to Washington D.C. at the request of the House Committee on the Judiciary. In the hearing chamber, Zimbardo sat before the assembled Congressmen of Subcommittee 3 and told a whopper: the \u201cguards\u201d in his recent experiment \u201cwere simply told that they were going to go into a situation that could be serious and have perhaps some danger\u2026 They made up their own rules for maintaining law, order, and respect.\u201d Zimbardo described a laundry list of abuses, causing \u201cacute situational traumatic reactions\u201d from the prisoners. Despite still never having set foot in an actual prison, he generalized freely from the unreviewed, unpublished, and largely unanalyzed results of his study: \u201cThe prison situation in our country is guaranteed to generate severe enough pathological reactions in both guards and prisoners as to debase their humanity, lower their feelings of self-worth, and make it difficult for them to be part of a society outside of their prison.\u201d Zimbardo was a hit. As Representative Hamilton Fish, Jr. of New York put it: \u201cYou certainly helped me a great deal in clarifying some of the things we have seen the past few days and understanding them.\u201dIn the wake of the prison uprisings at San Quentin and Attica, Zimbardo\u2019s message was perfectly attuned to the national zeitgeist. A critique of the criminal justice system that shunted blame away from inmates and guards alike onto a \u201csituation\u201d defined so vaguely as to fit almost any agenda offered a seductive lens on the day\u2019s social ills for just about everyone. Reform-minded liberals were hungry for evidence that people who committed crimes were driven to do so by the environment they\u2019d been born into, which played into their argument that reducing urban crime would require systemic reform\u200a\u2014\u200aa continuation of Johnson\u2019s \u201cwar on poverty\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200arather than the \u201cwar on crime\u201d that President Richard M. Nixon had campaigned on. \u201cWhen I heard of the study,\u201d recalls Frances Cullen, one of the preeminent criminologists of the last half century, \u201cI just thought, \u2018Well of course that\u2019s true.\u2019 I was uncritical. Everybody was uncritical.\u201d In Cullen\u2019s field, the Stanford prison experiment provided handy evidence that the prison system was fundamentally broken. \u201cIt confirmed what people already believed, which was that prisons were inherently inhumane,\u201d he said.The racial dynamics of the Stanford prison experiment, which have never been adequately explored, should probably have given reformers pause. Carlo Prescott, who had just suffered sixteen years of imprisonment as an African American, played a pivotal role in shaping the architecture of the experiment. Frustrated in part by the lack of black experimental subjects, he intervened repeatedly in the action, seeking to bring, as he put it to me, \u201can air of authenticity to boys who were getting $15 a day to pretend to be prisoners\u200a\u2014\u200aall Caucasian, as you recall. [Ed. note: one prisoner was Asian American.] Some of the genuine things that shock you as a result of having your liberty taken and your ass being controlled by people who hate you before you even get there.\u201d Yet Zimbardo\u2019s account of the \u201csituation\u201d that engendered abuse left race out of the equation. He often used the word \u201cnormal\u201d to describe the participants in his study despite the fact that they were hardly a normal representation of the American inmate population at that time. Analyzing American prisoner abuse as a product of race-blind \u201csituational forces\u201d erased its deep roots in racial oppression.Nonetheless, the Stanford prison experiment came to exert a significant influence on American criminology. Zimbardo\u2019s first academic article about his results was published in the International Journal of Criminology and Penology rather than a psychology journal. A year later, Robert Martinson, one of a team of sociologists who had been commissioned by the state of New York to evaluate various prison programs, appeared on 60 Minutes with a dark message: when it came to rehabilitation of prisoners, Martinson said, nothing worked. Almost overnight, Martinson\u2019s \u201cnothing works doctrine\u201d became accepted wisdom in America. It is often cited as the cause of the widespread abandonment in the 1970s by academics and policymakers alike of the notion that a prison could be a rehabilitative environment. Cullen believes Zimbardo\u2019s study played a role too.\u201cWhat the Stanford Prison Experiment did,\u201d Cullen says, \u201cwas to say: prisons are not reformable. The crux of many prison reforms, especially among academic criminologists, became that prisons were inherently inhumane, so our agenda had to be minimizing the use of prisons, emphasizing alternatives to prison, emphasizing community corrections.\u201dIn an era of rapidly rising crime, this agenda proved politically untenable. Instead, conservative politicians who had no qualms about using imprisonment purely to punish ushered in a decades-long \u201cget tough\u201d era in crime that disproportionately targeted African Americans. The incarceration rate rose steadily, standing now at five times higher than in comparable countries; one in three black men in America today will spend time in prison.It would, of course, be unfair to lay mass incarceration at Zimbardo\u2019s door. It is more accurate to say that, for all its reformist ideals, the Stanford prison experiment contributed to the polarizing intellectual currents of its time. According to a 2017 survey conducted by Cullen and his colleagues Teresa Kulig and Travis Pratt, 95% of the many criminology papers that have cited the Stanford prison experiment over the years have accepted its basic message that prisons are inherently inhumane.\u201cWhat struck me later in life was how all of us lost our scientific skepticism,\u201d Cullen says. \u201cWe became as ideological, in our way, as the climate change deniers. Zimbardo\u2019s and Martinson\u2019s studies made so much intuitive sense that no one took a step back and said, \u2018Well, this could be wrong.\u2019\u201dMost criminologists today agree that prisons are not, in fact, as hopeless as Zimbardo and Martinson made them out to be. Some prison programs do reliably help inmates better their lives. Though international comparisons are difficult to make, Norway\u2019s maximum-security Halden prison, where convicted murderers wear casual clothing, receive extensive job-skill training, share meals with unarmed guards, and wander at will during daylight hours through a scenic landscape of pine trees and blueberry bushes, offers a hopeful sign. Norwegians prisoners seldom get in fights and reoffend at lower rates than anywhere else in the world. To begin to ameliorate the evils of mass incarceration, Cullen argues, will require researching what makes some forms of prison management better than others, rather than, as the Stanford prison experiment did, dismissing them all as inherently abusive.Meanwhile, the legacy of Zimbardo\u2019s work goes well beyond its influence on our troubled criminal justice system, touching directly on how we understand our personal moral freedom.On a sunny August afternoon in 2006, at the height of the Iraq War, a nineteen-year-old U.S. Army Ranger named Alex Blum drove a superior in the Rangers and three other men to a Bank of America branch in Tacoma, where they leapt out of his car and committed an armed takeover robbery using pistols and AK-47s. Three days later, Alex, who happens to be my cousin, was arrested in our hometown of Denver, Colorado. Alex claimed to our family to have believed he had been participating in a training exercise. After the radical conditioning of the month-long Ranger Indoctrination Program he had just undergone, he had followed his superior without questioning. For Alex\u2019s sentencing hearing, his defense team called on a prominent expert to argue that his involvement in the robbery was due not to his own free will but to powerful \u201csituational forces\u201d: Dr. Philip Zimbardo. Alex received an extraordinarily lenient sentence, and Dr. Zimbardo became a family hero.In October 2010, Zimbardo co-hosted a special episode of the Dr. Phil Show entitled When Good People Do Bad Things, using Alex\u2019s story to spread his message that evil acts are the result of circumstance rather than character and choice. From my place in the studio audience, I heard Zimbardo describe guards abusing prisoners without any urging whatsoever\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cI constrained the guards not to use any physical force, but they intuitively knew how to use psychological force,\u201d Zimbardo said. Next he used his theories to explain the abuses at Abu Ghraib, offering up the same arguments he\u2019d recently used to defend Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick. When Dr. Phil asked who in the studio audience thought they too might have tortured detainees in a similar situation, everyone in my family stood up, almost the only ones to do so. We were proud to support Alex, and we knew this was the lesson we were supposed to derive from Zimbardo\u2019s work.A few years later, after deciding to write a book about Alex\u2019s story, I discovered evidence that he hadn\u2019t told the whole truth about his involvement. When I confronted him, he confessed to me that his choice to participate in the bank robbery was freer and more informed than he had ever let on before. Accepting responsibility was transformative for him. It freed him from the aggrieved victim mindset in which he had been trapped for years. Zimbardo\u2019s \u201csituational forces\u201d excuse had once appeared to give my cousin a way to believe in his fundamental goodness despite his egregious crime, but seeing the personal growth that came with deeper moral reckoning, I began to wonder if it had really done him a service.It was only after interviewing Zimbardo at his home in San Francisco for my book about Alex that I began researching the history of his famous experiment in depth. The more I found, the more unsettled I became. Shortly after my book was published, having by now spoken to a number of former participants in the study, I approached Zimbardo for another interview. For months I didn\u2019t hear back. Then Le Texier\u2019s book was published, and Zimbardo suddenly agreed to speak to me, apparently eager to respond to the charges. We spoke by Skype shortly after his return from a psychology conference. His office was stacked high with books and papers, the phone constantly ringing in the background as we talked.After hearing Zimbardo describe the experiment so many times over the years, I was not expecting to hear anything new. The first surprise came when I asked about Korpi\u2019s and Yacco\u2019s claims to me that they had been told they couldn\u2019t leave. After dismissing them at first as lies and then claiming that Korpi and Yacco had simply forgotten the safe phrase \u201cI quit the experiment,\u201d Zimbardo astonished me by acknowledging that he had in fact instructed his staff to tell prisoners they couldn\u2019t get out.\u201cIf [prisoners] said, \u2018I want to get out,\u2019 and you said, \u2018Okay,\u2019 then as soon as they left, the experiment would be over,\u201d Zimbardo explained. \u201cAll the prisoners would say, \u2018I want to get out.\u2019 There has to be a good reason now for them to get out. The mentality has to be, in their mind, \u2018I am a prisoner in a prison,\u2019 not, \u2018I\u2019m a college student in an experiment. I don\u2019t want my money. I\u2019m quitting the experiment.\u2019 You don\u2019t quit a prison. That\u2019s the whole point of the Pirandellian prison [Ed. note: Pirandello was an Italian playwright whose plays blended fiction and reality]. At one level you\u2019re a student in a basement in an experiment. At another level, you\u2019re a prisoner being abused by guards in a county jail.\u201dZimbardo confirmed that David Jaffe had devised the rules with the guards, but tried to argue that he hadn\u2019t been lying when he told Congress (and, years later, insisted to Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes) that the guards had devised the rules themselves, on the grounds that Zimbardo himself had not been present at the time. He at first denied that the experiment had had any political motive, but after I read him an excerpt from a press release disseminated on the experiment\u2019s second day explicitly stating that it aimed to bring awareness to the need for reform, he admitted that he had probably written it himself under pressure from Carlo Prescott, with whom he had co-taught a summer school class on the psychology of imprisonment.\u201cDuring that course, I began to see that prisons are a waste of time, and money, and lives,\u201d Zimbardo said. \u201cSo yes, I am a social activist, and prison reform was always important in my mind. It was not the reason to do the study.\u201dAt the close of a long, tense conversation, I asked him whether he thought Le Texier\u2019s book would change the way people saw the experiment.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, sounding tired. \u201cIn a sense, I don\u2019t really care. At this point, the big problem is, I don\u2019t want to waste any more of my time. After my talk with you, I\u2019m not going to do any interviews about it. It\u2019s just a waste of time. People can say whatever they want about it. It\u2019s the most famous study in the history of psychology at this point. There\u2019s no study that people talk about 50 years later. Ordinary people know about it. They say, \u2018What do you do?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a psychologist.\u2019 It could be a cab driver in Budapest. It could be a restaurant owner in Poland. I mention I\u2019m a psychologist, and they say, \u2018Did you hear about the study?\u2019 It\u2019s got a life of its own now. If he wants to say it was all a hoax, that\u2019s up to him. I\u2019m not going to defend it anymore. The defense is its longevity.\u201dZimbardo has spent much of the last fifty years answering questions about the darkest six days of his life, in some ways a prisoner of his own experiment\u2019s success. When I asked him if he was glad, looking back, to have conducted the study, he said he had mixed feelings. He considered the shyness clinic he founded in Palo Alto in 1975 to be his most important work.\u201cIf it was not for the prison study, that would be my legacy,\u201d he said.\u201cDoes some part of you wish that were your legacy?\u201d I asked.\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said, \u201cof course. That\u2019s positive. The prison study, the negative part is I am Dr. Evil. I created this evil situation, like Svengali or something.\u201dIn Zimbardo\u2019s telling, he, too, is a victim of circumstance\u200a\u2014\u200ashaped by his surroundings like everyone else.\u201cI gradually, with a lack of awareness, transformed myself into being the prison superintendent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? My office had the sign \u2018Prison Superintendent.\u2019 David Jaffe\u2019s office said \u2018Warden.\u2019 Then I had to deal with the parents. I had to deal with the parole board hearings. I had to deal with the priest coming in. People are dealing with me not as a researcher but as the prison superintendent, asking for help with their prisoner son.\u201dThis excuse has served Zimbardo as well as anyone over the years, but it may no longer be enough. After reviewing some of Le Texier\u2019s evidence, textbook author Greg Feist told me he is considering taking a firmer stand in the forthcoming edition of Psychology: Perspectives and Connections.\u201cI hope there does come a point, now that we know what we do, where Zimbardo\u2019s narrative dies,\u201d Feist said. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s not going to happen soon, but hopefully it will happen. Because I just think it\u2019s a\u2026\u201dFeist paused, searching for the appropriate word, then settled on a simple one.\u201cIt is a lie.\u201d", "tfidf": {"logidf": {"fear": 1.12000347865, "top":

I want to get out! This is all fucked up inside! I can\u2019t stand another night! I just can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9260\" name=\"9260\">It was a defining moment in what has become perhaps the best-known psychology study of all time. Whether you learned about Philip Zimbardo\u2019s famous \u201cStanford Prison Experiment\u201d in an introductory psych class or just absorbed it from the cultural ether, you\u2019ve probably heard the basic story.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"63d9\" name=\"63d9\">Zimbardo, a young Stanford psychology professor, built a mock jail in the basement of Jordan Hall and stocked it with nine \u201cprisoners,\u201d and nine \u201cguards,\u201d all male, college-age respondents to a newspaper ad who were assigned their roles at random and paid a generous daily wage to participate. The senior prison \u201cstaff\u201d consisted of Zimbardo himself and a handful of his students.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee84\" name=\"ee84\">The study was supposed to last for two weeks, but after Zimbardo\u2019s girlfriend stopped by six days in and witnessed the conditions in the \u201cStanford County Jail,\u201d she convinced him to shut it down. Since then, the tale of guards run amok and terrified prisoners breaking down one by one has become world-famous, a cultural touchstone that\u2019s been the subject of books, documentaries, and feature films\u200a\u2014\u200aeven an episode of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Veronica Mars</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"27d5\" name=\"27d5\">The SPE is often used to teach the lesson that our behavior is profoundly affected by the social roles and situations in which we find ourselves. But its deeper, more disturbing implication is that we all have a wellspring of potential sadism lurking within us, waiting to be tapped by circumstance. It has been invoked to explain the massacre at My Lai during the Vietnam War, the Armenian genocide, and the horrors of the Holocaust. And the ultimate symbol of the agony that man helplessly inflicts on his brother is Korpi\u2019s famous breakdown, set off after only 36 hours by the cruelty of his peers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3204\" name=\"3204\">There\u2019s just one problem: Korpi\u2019s breakdown was a sham.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"62b0\" name=\"62b0\">\u201cAnybody who is a clinician would know that I was faking,\u201d he told me last summer, in the first extensive interview he has granted in years. \u201cIf you listen to the tape, it\u2019s not subtle. I\u2019m not that good at acting. I mean, I think I do a fairly good job, but I\u2019m more hysterical than psychotic.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"40bc\" name=\"40bc\">Now a forensic psychologist himself, Korpi told me his dramatic performance in the SPE was indeed inspired by fear, but not of abusive guards. Instead, he was worried about failing to get into grad school.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9644\" name=\"9644\">\u201cThe reason I took the job was that I thought I\u2019d have every day to sit around by myself and study for my GREs,\u201d Korpi explained of the Graduate Record Exams often used to determine admissions, adding that he was scheduled to take the test just after the study concluded. Shortly after the experiment began, he asked for his study books. The prison staff refused. The next day Korpi asked again. No dice. At that point he decided there was, as he put it to me, \u201cno point to this job.\u201d First, Korpi tried faking a stomach-ache. When that didn\u2019t work, he tried faking a breakdown. Far from feeling traumatized, he added, he had actually enjoyed himself for much of his short tenure in the jail, other than a tussle with the guards over his bed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0457\" name=\"0457\">\u201c[The first day] was really fun,\u201d Korpi recalled. \u201cThe rebellion was fun. There were no repercussions. We knew [the guards] couldn\u2019t hurt us, they couldn\u2019t hit us. They were white college kids just like us, so it was a very safe situation. It was just a job. If you listen to the tape, you can hear it in my voice: I have a great job. I get to yell and scream and act all hysterical. I get to act like a prisoner. I was being a good employee. It was a great time.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1a31\" name=\"1a31\">For Korpi, the most frightening thing about the experiment was being told that, regardless of his desire to quit, he truly did not have the power to leave.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ce70\" name=\"ce70\">\u201cI was entirely shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it was one thing to pick me up in a cop car and put me in a smock. But they\u2019re really escalating the game by saying that I can\u2019t leave. They\u2019re stepping to a new level. I was just like, \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 That was my feeling.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b1b8\" name=\"b1b8\">Another prisoner, Richard Yacco, recalled being stunned on the experiment\u2019s second day after asking a staff-member how to quit and learning that he couldn\u2019t. A third prisoner, Clay Ramsay, was so dismayed on discovering that he was trapped that he started a hunger strike. \u201cI regarded it as a real prison because [in order to get out], you had to do something that made them worry about their liability,\u201d Ramsay told me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"835a\" name=\"835a\">When I spoke to Zimbardo this past May about Korpi\u2019s and Yacco\u2019s claims, he initially denied that they were obligated to stay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4eb2\" name=\"4eb2\">\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4163\" name=\"4163\">But it is no longer just a question of Zimbardo\u2019s word against theirs. This past April, a French academic and filmmaker named Thibault Le Texier published <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Histoire d\u2019un Mensonge [History of a Lie], </em>plumbing newly-released documents from Zimbardo\u2019s archives at Stanford University to tell a dramatically different story of the experiment. After Zimbardo told me that Korpi and Yacco\u2019s accusations were baseless, I read him a <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:vx097ry2810/Tape8.pdf\" href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:vx097ry2810/Tape8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">transcript</a> unearthed by Le Texier of a taped conversation between Zimbardo and his staff on day three of the simulation: \u201cAn interesting thing was that the guys who came in yesterday, the two guys who came in and said they wanted to leave, and I said no,\u201d Zimbardo told his staff. \u201cThere are only two conditions under which you can leave, medical help or psychiatric\u2026 I think they really believed they can\u2019t get out.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a81d\" name=\"a81d\">\u201cNow, okay,\u201d Zimbardo corrected himself on the phone with me. He then acknowledged that the informed consent forms which subjects signed had included an explicit safe phrase: \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201d Only that precise phrase would trigger their release.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2836\" name=\"2836\">\u201cNone of them said that,\u201d Zimbardo said. \u201cThey said, \u2018I want out. I want a doctor. I want my mother,\u2019 etc., etc. Essentially I was saying, \u2018You have to say, \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201d\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fa63\" name=\"fa63\">But the informed consent forms that Zimbardo\u2019s subjects signed, which are <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://pdf.prisonexp.org/consent.pdf\" href=\"http://pdf.prisonexp.org/consent.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available online</a> from Zimbardo\u2019s own website, contain no mention of the phrase \u201cI quit the experiment.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8a63\" name=\"8a63\">Zimbardo\u2019s standard narrative of the Stanford prison experiment offers the prisoners\u2019 emotional responses as proof of how powerfully affected they were by the guards\u2019 mistreatment. The shock of real imprisonment provides a simpler and far less groundbreaking explanation. It may also have had legal implications, should prisoners have thought to pursue them. Korpi told me that the greatest regret of his life was failing to sue Zimbardo.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dba0\" name=\"dba0\">\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we file false imprisonment charges?\u201d Korpi asked during an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing! We should have done something!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3de4\" name=\"3de4\">According to James Cahan, former Deputy District Attorney for Stanford University\u2019s Santa Clara County, Korpi may well have had a case: the six hours or so after Korpi made his desire to quit the experiment plain, much of which he spent confined in the closet, appear to have met the statutory requirements for false imprisonment in California.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4e6c\" name=\"4e6c\">\u201cIf he says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. I want to talk to you about getting out,\u2019\u201d Cahan said, \u201cand he\u2019s then locked in a room, and he is at some point trying to or asking to get out of that room in order to communicate as a contract employee or whatever he is, and he is unable to get out of that room, then that would seem to get very close to being out of the realm of informed consent and into the realm of a violation of the penal code.\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"be18\" name=\"be18\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"e21b\" name=\"e21b\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">W</span>hile Zimbardo likes to begin the story of the Stanford prison experiment on Sunday, August 15th, 1971, when guards began harassing newly arrived prisoners at the \u201cStanford County Jail\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200amaking it sound as if they became abusive of their own accord\u200a\u2014\u200aa more honest telling begins a day earlier, with the orientation meeting for the guards.

Jaffe and a few fellow students had actually cooked up the idea of a simulated prison themselves three months earlier, in response to an open-ended assignment in an undergraduate class taught by Zimbardo. Jaffe cast some of his dormmates in Toyon Hall as prisoners and some as guards and came up with 15 draconian prison rules for his guards to enforce, including \u201cPrisoners must address each other by number only,\u201d \u201cPrisoners must never refer to their condition as an \u2018experiment\u2019 or a \u2018simulation,\u201d and \u201cFailure to obey any of the above rules may result in punishment.\u201d Zimbardo was so taken with the tears and drama produced by Jaffe\u2019s two-day simulation that he decided to try it himself, this time randomly assigning guards and prisoners and dragging the action on much longer. Because Zimbardo himself had never visited a real prison, the standards of realism were defined by Jaffe\u2019s prison research and the nightmarish recollections of Carlo Prescott, a San Quentin parolee whom Zimbardo met through Jaffe and brought in as a consultant. Jaffe was given extraordinary leeway in shaping the Stanford prison experiment in order to replicate his previous results. \u201cDr. Zimbardo suggested that the most difficult problem would be to get the guards to behave like guards,\u201d Jaffe wrote in a post-experiment <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\" href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">evaluation</a>. \u201cI was asked to suggest tactics based on my previous experience as master sadist.\u00a0\u2026 I was given the responsibility of trying to elicit \u2018tough-guard\u2019 behavior.\u201d Though Zimbardo has often stated that the guards devised their own rules, in fact most of them were copied directly from Jaffe\u2019s class assignment during that Saturday orientation meeting. Jaffe also offered the guards ideas for hassling the prisoners, including forcing them to clean thorns out of dirty blankets that had been thrown in the weeds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"54ed\" name=\"54ed\">Once the simulation got underway, Jaffe explicitly corrected guards who weren\u2019t acting tough enough, fostering exactly the pathological behavior that Zimbardo would later claim had arisen organically.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"fcdb\" name=\"fcdb\">\u201cThe guards have to know that every guard is going to be what we call a tough guard,\u201d Jaffe <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/wn708sg0050\" href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/wn708sg0050\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told one such guard</a> [skip to 8:35]. \u201c[H]opefully what will come out of this study is some very serious recommendations for reform\u2026 so that we can get on the media and into the press with it, and say \u2018Now look at what this is really about.\u2019\u00a0\u2026 [T]ry and react as you picture the pigs reacting.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1363\" name=\"1363\">Though most guards gave lackluster performances, some even going out of their way to do small favors for the prisoners, one in particular rose to the challenge: Dave Eshleman, whom prisoners nicknamed \u201cJohn Wayne\u201d for his Southern accent and inventive cruelty.

His overarching goal, as he told me in an interview, was simply to help the experiment succeed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"6b70\" name=\"6b70\">\u201cI took it as a kind of an improv exercise,\u201d Eshleman said. \u201cI believed that I was doing what the researchers wanted me to do, and I thought I\u2019d do it better than anybody else by creating this despicable guard persona.

But Zimbardo and his staff seemed to approve. After the experiment ended, Zimbardo singled him out and thanked him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d9e0\" name=\"d9e0\">\u201cAs I was walking down the hall,\u201d Eshleman recalled, \u201che made it a point to come and let me know what a great job I\u2019d done.

We have been taught that guards abused prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment because of the power of their roles, but Haslam and Reicher argue that their behavior arose instead from their identification with the experimenters, which Jaffe and Zimbardo encouraged at every turn. Eshleman, who described himself on an intake questionnaire as a \u201cscientist at heart,\u201d may have identified more powerfully than anyone, but Jaffe himself put it well in his <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\" href=\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">self-evaluation</a>: \u201cI am startled by the ease with which I could turn off my sensitivity and concern for others for \u2018a good cause.\u2019\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"a892\" name=\"a892\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"7d65\" name=\"7d65\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">F</span>rom the beginning, Zimbardo sought a high media profile for his experiment, allowing KRON, a San Francisco television station, to film his mock arrests and sending them periodic press releases as the action evolved. But Zimbardo\u2019s prison simulation quickly garnered more press attention than he could have imagined. On August 21st, a day after the study\u2019s premature closure, the attempt by George Jackson, radical black activist and author of the bestselling <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Soledad Brother</em>, to escape from San Quentin, an hour north of Stanford, led to the deaths of three corrections officers and three inmates, including Jackson himself. In short order, KRON arranged a televised debate between Zimbardo and San Quentin\u2019s associate warden. Three weeks later, the predominately African American prisoners at Attica State Prison in New York seized control of the facility from the nearly all-white correctional staff, demanding better treatment. Ordered by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to retake the prison by force, helicopters dumped tear gas canisters and hundreds of law-enforcement officers and armed Attica guards fired blindly into the smoke, slaughtering prisoners and hostages alike.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eac0\" name=\"eac0\">In an era before the mass shootings that have since become the norm in American news headlines, it was a shocking bloodbath\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the deadliest since the Civil War, according to the New York State Special Commission on Attica. The country scrambled for answers, and Zimbardo\u2019s experiment appeared to offer them, putting guards and prisoners on the same moral plane\u200a\u2014\u200amutual victims of the carceral state\u200a\u2014\u200athough in fact nearly all the Attica killings had been committed by guards and officers. Zimbardo\u2019s tale of guards-run-amok and terrorized prisoners first came to national attention with a twenty-minute prime-time special on NBC. Richard Yacco told NBC\u2019s reporter that he and other prisoners had been told they couldn\u2019t quit, but, after he failed to hew to Zimbardo\u2019s narrative of prisoners organically \u201cslipping into\u201d their roles, he was edited out of the program (the recording survives <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/jh477zg7277\" href=\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/jh477zg7277\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d802\" name=\"d802\">In his 1973 article in the New York Times Magazine, Zimbardo wrote unequivocally that Korpi\u2019s breakdown was genuine. By the mid 1980s, when he asked Korpi to appear on the Phil Donahue show and in the documentary <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Quiet Rage</em>, Korpi had long since made clear that he\u2019d been faking, but Zimbardo still wanted to include the breakdown. Korpi went along with it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e435\" name=\"e435\">\u201cIf he wanted to say I had a mental breakdown, it seemed a minor note,\u201d he told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t really object.

Korpi told me that Zimbardo hounded him for further media appearances long after Korpi asked him to stop, pressuring him with occasional offers of professional help.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"59b4\" name=\"59b4\">\u201cWe unlisted the number and [Zimbardo] figured out our unlisted number,\u201d Korpi said. \u201cIt was just bizarre.

And I\u2019ll give you lots of referrals!\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I know Phil, but I testify in court now and it\u2019s embarrassing how I was. I don\u2019t want to have that be a big public thing anymore.\u2019 But Phil just couldn\u2019t hear that I didn\u2019t want to be involved. This went on for years.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"886a\" name=\"886a\">(Zimbardo confirmed that he gave Korpi referrals, but declined to comment further.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5e4\" name=\"f5e4\">The Stanford prison experiment established Zimbardo as perhaps the most prominent living American psychologist. He became the primary author of one of the field\u2019s most popular and long-running textbooks, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Psychology: Core Concepts</em>, and the host of a 1990 PBS video series, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Discovering Psychology</em>, which gained wide usage in high school and college classes and is still screened today. Both featured the Stanford prison experiment. And its popularity wasn\u2019t limited to the United States. Polish philosopher Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s citation of the experiment in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Modernity and the Holocaust</em> in 1989 typified a growing tradition in Eastern Europe and Germany of looking to the Stanford prison experiment for help explaining the Holocaust. In his influential 1992 book, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ordinary Men</em>, historian Christopher Browning relied on both the Stanford prison experiment and the Milgram experiment, another social psychology touchstone, in arguing that Nazi mass killings were in part the result of situational factors (other scholars argued that subscribers to a national ideology that identified Jews as enemies of the state could hardly be described as \u201cordinary men\u201d). 2001, the same year Zimbardo was elected president of the American Psychological Association, saw the release of a German-language film, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Das Experiment</em>, that was based on the SPE but amped the violence up to Nazi-worthy levels, with guards not only abusing prisoners but murdering them and each other. When prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib came to light in 2004, Zimbardo again made the rounds on the talk show circuit, arguing that the abuse had been the result not of a few \u201cbad apple\u201d soldiers but of a \u201cbad barrel\u201d and providing expert testimony on behalf of Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick, the staff sergeant supervising the military policemen who committed the abuses. With the resurgence of interest in the experiment, Zimbardo published <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Lucifer Effect</em> in 2007, offering more detail about it than ever before, though framed in such a way as to avoid calling his basic findings into question. The book became a national bestseller.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5f0\" name=\"c5f0\">All the while, however, experts had been casting doubt on Zimbardo\u2019s work.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"7bb9\" name=\"7bb9\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"101c\" name=\"101c\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">D</span>espite the Stanford prison experiment\u2019s canonical status in intro psych classes around the country today, methodological criticism of it was swift and widespread in the years after it was conducted. Deviating from scientific protocol, Zimbardo and his students had published their first article about the experiment not in an academic journal of psychology but in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The New York Times Magazine, </em>sidestepping the usual peer review. Famed psychologist Erich Fromm, unaware that guards had been explicitly instructed to be \u201ctough,\u201d nonetheless opined that in light of the obvious pressures to abuse, what was most surprising about the experiment was how few guards did. \u201cThe authors believe it proves that the situation alone can within a few days transform normal people into abject, submissive individuals or into ruthless sadists,\u201d Fromm wrote. \u201cIt seems to me that the experiment proves, if anything, rather the contrary.\u201d Some scholars have argued that it wasn\u2019t an experiment at all.

In 2005, Carlo Prescott, the San Quentin parolee who consulted on the experiment\u2019s design, published an <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford20050428-01.2.24&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------\" href=\"https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford20050428-01.2.24&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Op-Ed</a> in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Stanford Daily</em> entitled \u201cThe Lie of the Stanford Prison Experiment,\u201d revealing that many of the guards\u2019 techniques for tormenting prisoners had been taken from his own experience at San Quentin rather than having been invented by the participants.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e8c\" name=\"4e8c\">In another blow to the experiment\u2019s scientific credibility, Haslam and Reicher\u2019s attempted replication, in which guards received no coaching and prisoners were free to quit at any time, failed to reproduce Zimbardo\u2019s findings. Far from breaking down under escalating abuse, prisoners banded together and won extra privileges from guards, who became increasingly passive and cowed. According to Reicher, Zimbardo did not take it well when they attempted to publish their findings in the British Journal of Social Psychology.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"40d8\" name=\"40d8\">\u201cWe discovered that he was privately writing to editors to try to stop us getting published by claiming that we were fraudulent,\u201d Reicher told me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"57c5\" name=\"57c5\">Despite Zimbardo\u2019s intervention, the journal decided to publish Reicher and Haslam\u2019s article, alongside a <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/014466605X81720\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/014466605X81720\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commentary</a> by Zimbardo in which he wrote, \u201cI believe this alleged \u2018social psychology field study\u2019 is fraudulent and does not merit acceptance by the social psychological community in Britain, the United States or anywhere except in media psychology.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"40b3\" name=\"40b3\">\u201cUltimately,\u201d said Reicher, \u201cwhat we discovered was that we weren\u2019t in a scientific debate, which is what we thought we were in. We were in a commercial rivalry. At that point he was very keen on getting the Hollywood film out.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ccea\" name=\"ccea\">Zimbardo\u2019s decades-long effort to turn his work into a feature film finally bore fruit in 2015 with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Stanford Prison Experiment, </em>for which he served as consultant (he is played by Billy Crudup). Though the film purports to take a critical stance toward the experiment, it hews in essential ways to Zimbardo\u2019s narrative, neglecting to include Zimbardo\u2019s encouragement of tough tactics in the Saturday guard orientation or to mention David Jaffe\u2019s role at all. Beleaguered by abusive guards, the character based on Korpi (Ezra Miller) succumbs to a delusion that he is not participating in an experiment at all but has been placed in a real prison and, in the emotional turning point of the film, suffers a screaming meltdown. Gradually his delusion begins to infect the other prisoners.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"05c3\" name=\"05c3\">Somehow, neither Prescott\u2019s letter nor the failed replication nor the numerous academic critiques have so far lessened the grip of Zimbardo\u2019s tale on the public imagination. The appeal of the Stanford prison experiment seems to go deeper than its scientific validity, perhaps because it tells us a story about ourselves that we desperately want to believe: that we, as individuals, cannot really be held accountable for the sometimes reprehensible things we do. As troubling as it might seem to accept Zimbardo\u2019s fallen vision of human nature, it is also profoundly liberating. It means we\u2019re off the hook. Our actions are determined by circumstance. Our fallibility is situational. Just as the Gospel promised to absolve us of our sins if we would only believe, the SPE offered a form of redemption tailor-made for a scientific era, and we embraced it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f6c\" name=\"9f6c\">For psychology professors, the Stanford prison experiment is a reliable crowd-pleaser, typically presented with lots of vividly disturbing video footage. In introductory psychology lecture halls, often filled with students from other majors, the counterintuitive assertion that students\u2019 own belief in their inherent goodness is flatly wrong offers dramatic proof of psychology\u2019s ability to teach them new and surprising things about themselves. Some intro psych professors I spoke to felt that it helped instill the understanding that those who do bad things are not necessarily bad people. Others pointed to the importance of teaching students in our unusually individualistic culture that their actions are profoundly influenced by external factors.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0400\" name=\"0400\">\u201cEven if the science was quirky,\u201d said Kenneth Carter, professor of psychology at Emory University and co-author of the textbook <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Learn Psychology</em>, \u201cor there was something that was wrong about the way that it was put together, I think at the end of the day, I still want students to be mindful that they may find themselves in powerful situations that could override how they might behave as an individual. That\u2019s the story that\u2019s bigger than the science.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"395a\" name=\"395a\">But if Zimbardo\u2019s work was so profoundly unscientific, how can we trust the stories it claims to tell? Many other studies, such as Soloman Asch\u2019s famous <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html\" href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">experiment</a> demonstrating that people will ignore the evidence of their own eyes in conforming to group judgments about line lengths, illustrate the profound effect our environments can have on us. The far more methodologically sound\u200a\u2014\u200abut still <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377\" href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">controversial</a>\u200a\u2014\u200aMilgram experiment demonstrates how prone we are to obedience in certain settings. What is unique, and uniquely compelling, about Zimbardo\u2019s narrative of the Stanford prison experiment is its suggestion that all it takes to make us enthusiastic sadists is a jumpsuit, a billy club, and the green light to dominate our fellow human beings.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"871b\" name=\"871b\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 566px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 80.80000000000001%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png\" data-height=\"850\" data-image-id=\"1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png\" data-width=\"1052\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RHTcOkv4M0rAbTUVsDJodg.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure\" id=\"48c3\" name=\"48c3\">\u201cYou have a vertigo when you look into it,\u201d Le Texier explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my god, I could be a Nazi myself.

Curious about why the field\u2019s appointed gatekeepers, presumably well-informed about the experiment\u2019s dubious history, would choose to include it nonetheless, I reached out. Three told me they had originally omitted the Stanford prison experiment from their first editions because of concerns about its scientific legitimacy. But even psychology professors are not immune to the forces of social influence: two added it back in under pressure from reviewers and teachers, a third because it was so much in the news after Abu Ghraib. Other authors I spoke with expressed far more critical perspectives on the experiment than appeared in their textbooks, offering an array of reasons why it nonetheless had pedagogical value.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c947\" name=\"c947\">Greg Feist, coauthor of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Psychology: Perspectives and Connections</em>, told me that his personal view of the experiment shifted some years back after he came across the 2005 Op-Ed by Carlo Prescott, which he described as \u201cshocking.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"579a\" name=\"579a\">\u201cOnce I found out some of the ethical and scientific problems with the study, I didn\u2019t think it was worth perpetuating, to be honest,\u201d Feist said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2de3\" name=\"2de3\">But there it is in his textbook\u2019s third edition, published in 2014: a thoroughly conventional telling of Zimbardo\u2019s standard narrative, with brief criticisms appearing only later in the chapter.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"5c95\" name=\"5c95\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"6d2b\" name=\"6d2b\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> October 25, 1971, a mere two months after concluding an experiment so stressful that he lost ten pounds in the span of a week, Philip Zimbardo traveled to Washington D.C. at the request of the House Committee on the Judiciary. In the hearing chamber, Zimbardo sat before the assembled Congressmen of Subcommittee 3 and told a whopper: the \u201cguards\u201d in his recent experiment \u201cwere simply told that they were going to go into a situation that could be serious and have perhaps some danger\u2026 They made up their own rules for maintaining law, order, and respect.\u201d Zimbardo described a laundry list of abuses, causing \u201cacute situational traumatic reactions\u201d from the prisoners. Despite still never having set foot in an actual prison, he generalized freely from the unreviewed, unpublished, and largely unanalyzed results of his study: \u201cThe prison situation in our country is guaranteed to generate severe enough pathological reactions in both guards and prisoners as to debase their humanity, lower their feelings of self-worth, and make it difficult for them to be part of a society outside of their prison.\u201d Zimbardo was a hit. As Representative Hamilton Fish, Jr. of New York put it: \u201cYou certainly helped me a great deal in clarifying some of the things we have seen the past few days and understanding them.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1406\" name=\"1406\">In the wake of the prison uprisings at San Quentin and Attica, Zimbardo\u2019s message was perfectly attuned to the national zeitgeist. A critique of the criminal justice system that shunted blame away from inmates and guards alike onto a \u201csituation\u201d defined so vaguely as to fit almost any agenda offered a seductive lens on the day\u2019s social ills for just about everyone. Reform-minded liberals were hungry for evidence that people who committed crimes were driven to do so by the environment they\u2019d been born into, which played into their argument that reducing urban crime would require systemic reform\u200a\u2014\u200aa continuation of Johnson\u2019s \u201cwar on poverty\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200arather than the \u201c<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377\" href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">war on crime</a>\u201d that President Richard M. Nixon had campaigned on. \u201cWhen I heard of the study,\u201d recalls Frances Cullen, one of the preeminent criminologists of the last half century, \u201cI just thought, \u2018Well of course that\u2019s true.\u2019 I was uncritical. Everybody was uncritical.\u201d In Cullen\u2019s field, the Stanford prison experiment provided handy evidence that the prison system was fundamentally broken. \u201cIt confirmed what people already believed, which was that prisons were inherently inhumane,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7536\" name=\"7536\">The racial dynamics of the Stanford prison experiment, which have never been adequately explored, should probably have given reformers pause. Carlo Prescott, who had just suffered sixteen years of imprisonment as an African American, played a pivotal role in shaping the architecture of the experiment. Frustrated in part by the lack of black experimental subjects, he intervened repeatedly in the action, seeking to bring, as he put it to me, \u201can air of authenticity to boys who were getting $15 a day to pretend to be prisoners\u200a\u2014\u200aall Caucasian, as you recall. [Ed. note: one prisoner was Asian American.] Some of the genuine things that shock you as a result of having your liberty taken and your ass being controlled by people who hate you before you even get there.\u201d Yet Zimbardo\u2019s account of the \u201csituation\u201d that engendered abuse left race out of the equation. He often used the word \u201cnormal\u201d to describe the participants in his study despite the fact that they were hardly a normal representation of the American inmate population at that time. Analyzing American prisoner abuse as a product of race-blind \u201csituational forces\u201d erased its deep roots in racial oppression.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e921\" name=\"e921\">Nonetheless, the Stanford prison experiment came to exert a significant influence on American criminology. Zimbardo\u2019s first academic article about his results was published in the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">International Journal of Criminology and Penology</em> rather than a psychology journal. A year later, Robert Martinson, one of a team of sociologists who had been commissioned by the state of New York to evaluate various prison programs, appeared on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">60 Minutes</em> with a dark message: when it came to rehabilitation of prisoners, Martinson said, nothing worked. Almost overnight, Martinson\u2019s \u201cnothing works doctrine\u201d became accepted wisdom in America. It is often cited as the cause of the widespread abandonment in the 1970s by academics and policymakers alike of the notion that a prison could be a rehabilitative environment. Cullen believes Zimbardo\u2019s study played a role too.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1050\" name=\"1050\">\u201cWhat the Stanford Prison Experiment did,\u201d Cullen says, \u201cwas to say: prisons are not reformable. The crux of many prison reforms, especially among academic criminologists, became that prisons were inherently inhumane, so our agenda had to be minimizing the use of prisons, emphasizing alternatives to prison, emphasizing community corrections.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c58\" name=\"2c58\">In an era of rapidly rising crime, this agenda proved politically untenable. Instead, conservative politicians who had no qualms about using imprisonment purely to punish ushered in a decades-long \u201cget tough\u201d era in crime that disproportionately targeted African Americans. The incarceration rate rose steadily, standing now at five times higher than in comparable countries; one in three black men in America today will spend time in prison.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80cf\" name=\"80cf\">It would, of course, be unfair to lay mass incarceration at Zimbardo\u2019s door. It is more accurate to say that, for all its reformist ideals, the Stanford prison experiment contributed to the polarizing intellectual currents of its time. According to a 2017 survey conducted by Cullen and his colleagues Teresa Kulig and Travis Pratt, 95% of the many criminology papers that have cited the Stanford prison experiment over the years have accepted its basic message that prisons are inherently inhumane.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2db9\" name=\"2db9\">\u201cWhat struck me later in life was how all of us lost our scientific skepticism,\u201d Cullen says. \u201cWe became as ideological, in our way, as the climate change deniers. Zimbardo\u2019s and Martinson\u2019s studies made so much intuitive sense that no one took a step back and said, \u2018Well, this could be wrong.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c34d\" name=\"c34d\">Most criminologists today agree that prisons are not, in fact, as hopeless as Zimbardo and Martinson made them out to be. Some prison programs do reliably help inmates better their lives. Though international comparisons are difficult to make, Norway\u2019s maximum-security Halden prison, where convicted murderers wear casual clothing, receive extensive job-skill training, share meals with unarmed guards, and wander at will during daylight hours through a scenic landscape of pine trees and blueberry bushes, offers a hopeful sign. Norwegians prisoners seldom get in fights and reoffend at lower rates than anywhere else in the world. To begin to ameliorate the evils of mass incarceration, Cullen argues, will require researching what makes some forms of prison management better than others, rather than, as the Stanford prison experiment did, dismissing them all as inherently abusive.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"848b\" name=\"848b\">Meanwhile, the legacy of Zimbardo\u2019s work goes well beyond its influence on our troubled criminal justice system, touching directly on how we understand our personal moral freedom.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"1dee\" name=\"1dee\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-height=\"30\" data-image-id=\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\" data-width=\"700\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\"/></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"ab00\" name=\"ab00\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> a sunny August afternoon in 2006, at the height of the Iraq War, a nineteen-year-old U.S. Army Ranger named Alex Blum drove a superior in the Rangers and three other men to a Bank of America branch in Tacoma, where they leapt out of his car and committed an armed takeover robbery using pistols and AK-47s. Three days later, Alex, who happens to be my cousin, was arrested in our hometown of Denver, Colorado. Alex claimed to our family to have believed he had been participating in a training exercise. After the radical conditioning of the month-long Ranger Indoctrination Program he had just undergone, he had followed his superior without questioning. For Alex\u2019s sentencing hearing, his defense team called on a prominent expert to argue that his involvement in the robbery was due not to his own free will but to powerful \u201csituational forces\u201d: Dr. Philip Zimbardo. Alex received an extraordinarily lenient sentence, and Dr. Zimbardo became a family hero.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f941\" name=\"f941\">In October 2010, Zimbardo co-hosted a special episode of the Dr. Phil Show entitled <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">When Good People Do Bad Things, </em>using Alex\u2019s story to spread his message that evil acts are the result of circumstance rather than character and choice. From my place in the studio audience, I heard Zimbardo describe guards abusing prisoners without any urging whatsoever\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cI constrained the guards not to use any physical force, but they intuitively knew how to use psychological force,\u201d Zimbardo said. Next he used his theories to explain the abuses at Abu Ghraib, offering up the same arguments he\u2019d recently used to defend Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick. When Dr. Phil asked who in the studio audience thought they too might have tortured detainees in a similar situation, everyone in my family stood up, almost the only ones to do so. We were proud to support Alex, and we knew this was the lesson we were supposed to derive from Zimbardo\u2019s work.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"1aea\" name=\"1aea\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 566px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 80.80000000000001%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\" data-height=\"850\" data-image-id=\"1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\" data-width=\"1052\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"43a0\" name=\"43a0\">A few years later, after deciding to write a book about Alex\u2019s story, I discovered evidence that he hadn\u2019t told the whole truth about his involvement. When I confronted him, he confessed to me that his choice to participate in the bank robbery was freer and more informed than he had ever let on before. Accepting responsibility was transformative for him. It freed him from the aggrieved victim mindset in which he had been trapped for years. Zimbardo\u2019s \u201csituational forces\u201d excuse had once appeared to give my cousin a way to believe in his fundamental goodness despite his egregious crime, but seeing the personal growth that came with deeper moral reckoning, I began to wonder if it had really done him a service.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"695a\" name=\"695a\">It was only after interviewing Zimbardo at his home in San Francisco for my book about Alex that I began researching the history of his famous experiment in depth. The more I found, the more unsettled I became. Shortly after my book was published, having by now spoken to a number of former participants in the study, I approached Zimbardo for another interview. For months I didn\u2019t hear back. Then Le Texier\u2019s book was published, and Zimbardo suddenly agreed to speak to me, apparently eager to respond to the charges. We spoke by Skype shortly after his return from a psychology conference. His office was stacked high with books and papers, the phone constantly ringing in the background as we talked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed11\" name=\"ed11\">After hearing Zimbardo describe the experiment so many times over the years, I was not expecting to hear anything new. The first surprise came when I asked about Korpi\u2019s and Yacco\u2019s claims to me that they had been told they couldn\u2019t leave. After dismissing them at first as lies and then claiming that Korpi and Yacco had simply forgotten the safe phrase \u201cI quit the experiment,\u201d Zimbardo astonished me by acknowledging that he had in fact instructed his staff to tell prisoners they couldn\u2019t get out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ab62\" name=\"ab62\">\u201cIf [prisoners] said, \u2018I want to get out,\u2019 and you said, \u2018Okay,\u2019 then as soon as they left, the experiment would be over,\u201d Zimbardo explained. \u201cAll the prisoners would say, \u2018I want to get out.\u2019 There has to be a good reason now for them to get out. The mentality has to be, in their mind, \u2018I am a prisoner in a prison,\u2019 not, \u2018I\u2019m a college student in an experiment. I don\u2019t want my money. I\u2019m quitting the experiment.\u2019 You don\u2019t quit a prison. That\u2019s the whole point of the Pirandellian prison [Ed. note: Pirandello was an Italian playwright whose plays blended fiction and reality]. At one level you\u2019re a student in a basement in an experiment. At another level, you\u2019re a prisoner being abused by guards in a county jail.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a932\" name=\"a932\">Zimbardo confirmed that David Jaffe had devised the rules with the guards, but tried to argue that he hadn\u2019t been lying when he told Congress (and, years later, insisted to Lesley Stahl on <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">60 Minutes</em>) that the guards had devised the rules themselves, on the grounds that Zimbardo himself had not been present at the time. He at first denied that the experiment had had any political motive, but after I read him an excerpt from a press release disseminated on the experiment\u2019s second day explicitly stating that it aimed to bring awareness to the need for reform, he admitted that he had probably written it himself under pressure from Carlo Prescott, with whom he had co-taught a summer school class on the psychology of imprisonment<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"edbc\" name=\"edbc\">\u201cDuring that course, I began to see that prisons are a waste of time, and money, and lives,\u201d Zimbardo said. \u201cSo yes, I am a social activist, and prison reform was always important in my mind. It was not the reason to do the study.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6088\" name=\"6088\">At the close of a long, tense conversation, I asked him whether he thought Le Texier\u2019s book would change the way people saw the experiment.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7e7c\" name=\"7e7c\">\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, sounding tired. \u201cIn a sense, I don\u2019t really care. At this point, the big problem is, I don\u2019t want to waste any more of my time. After my talk with you, I\u2019m not going to do any interviews about it. It\u2019s just a waste of time. People can say whatever they want about it. It\u2019s the most famous study in the history of psychology at this point. There\u2019s no study that people talk about 50 years later. Ordinary people know about it. They say, \u2018What do you do?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a psychologist.\u2019 It could be a cab driver in Budapest. It could be a restaurant owner in Poland. I mention I\u2019m a psychologist, and they say, \u2018Did you hear about the study?\u2019 It\u2019s got a life of its own now. If he wants to say it was all a hoax, that\u2019s up to him. I\u2019m not going to defend it anymore. The defense is its longevity.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe29\" name=\"fe29\">Zimbardo has spent much of the last fifty years answering questions about the darkest six days of his life, in some ways a prisoner of his own experiment\u2019s success. When I asked him if he was glad, looking back, to have conducted the study, he said he had mixed feelings. He considered the shyness clinic he founded in Palo Alto in 1975 to be his most important work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3450\" name=\"3450\">\u201cIf it was not for the prison study, that would be my legacy,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e948\" name=\"e948\">\u201cDoes some part of you wish that were your legacy?\u201d I asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"508b\" name=\"508b\">\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said, \u201cof course. That\u2019s positive. The prison study, the negative part is I am Dr. Evil. I created this evil situation, like Svengali or something.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f6c6\" name=\"f6c6\">In Zimbardo\u2019s telling, he, too, is a victim of circumstance\u200a\u2014\u200ashaped by his surroundings like everyone else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3aec\" name=\"3aec\">\u201cI gradually, with a lack of awareness, transformed myself into being the prison superintendent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? My office had the sign \u2018Prison Superintendent.\u2019 David Jaffe\u2019s office said \u2018Warden.\u2019 Then I had to deal with the parents. I had to deal with the parole board hearings. I had to deal with the priest coming in. People are dealing with me not as a researcher but as the prison superintendent, asking for help with their prisoner son.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bb36\" name=\"bb36\">This excuse has served Zimbardo as well as anyone over the years, but it may no longer be enough. After reviewing some of Le Texier\u2019s evidence, textbook author Greg Feist told me he is considering taking a firmer stand in the forthcoming edition of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Psychology: Perspectives and Connections</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"28ac\" name=\"28ac\">\u201cI hope there does come a point, now that we know what we do, where Zimbardo\u2019s narrative dies,\u201d Feist said. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s not going to happen soon, but hopefully it will happen. Because I just think it\u2019s a\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"361e\" name=\"361e\">Feist paused, searching for the appropriate word, then settled on a simple one.</p><p

When prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib came to light in 2004, Zimbardo again made the rounds on the talk show circuit, arguing that the abuse had been the result not of a few \u201cbad apple\u201d soldiers but of a \u201cbad barrel\u201d and providing expert testimony on behalf of Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick, the staff sergeant supervising the military policemen who committed the abuses.

But its deeper, more disturbing implication is that we all have a wellspring of potential sadism lurking within us, waiting to be tapped by circumstance. It has been invoked to explain the massacre at My Lai during the Vietnam War, the Armenian genocide, and the horrors of the Holocaust. And the ultimate symbol of the agony that man helplessly inflicts on his brother is Korpi\u2019s famous breakdown, set off after only 36 hours by the cruelty of his peers.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3204\\\" id=\\\"3204\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThere\u2019s just one problem: Korpi\u2019s breakdown was a sham.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"62b0\\\" id=\\\"62b0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cAnybody who is a clinician would know that I was faking,\u201d he told me last summer, in the first extensive interview he has granted in years. \u201cIf you listen to the tape, it\u2019s not subtle.

Shortly after the experiment began, he asked for his study books. The prison staff refused. The next day Korpi asked again. No dice. At that point he decided there was, as he put it to me, \u201cno point to this job.\u201d First, Korpi tried faking a stomach-ache. When that didn\u2019t work, he tried faking a breakdown. Far from feeling traumatized, he added, he had actually enjoyed himself for much of his short tenure in the jail, other than a tussle with the guards over his bed.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0457\\\" id=\\\"0457\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201c[The first day] was really fun,\u201d Korpi recalled. \u201cThe rebellion was fun. There were no repercussions. We knew [the guards] couldn\u2019t hurt us, they couldn\u2019t hit us. They were white college kids just like us, so it was a very safe situation. It was just a job. If you listen to the tape, you can hear it in my voice: I have a great job. I get to yell and scream and act all hysterical. I get to act like a prisoner. I was being a good employee.

A third prisoner, Clay Ramsay, was so dismayed on discovering that he was trapped that he started a hunger strike. \u201cI regarded it as a real prison because [in order to get out], you had to do something that made them worry about their liability,\u201d Ramsay told me.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"835a\\\" id=\\\"835a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhen I spoke to Zimbardo this past May about Korpi\u2019s and Yacco\u2019s claims, he initially denied that they were obligated to stay.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4eb2\\\" id=\\\"4eb2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4163\\\" id=\\\"4163\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut it is no longer just a question of Zimbardo\u2019s word against theirs.

Jaffe and a few fellow students had actually cooked up the idea of a simulated prison themselves three months earlier, in response to an open-ended assignment in an undergraduate class taught by Zimbardo. Jaffe cast some of his dormmates in Toyon Hall as prisoners and some as guards and came up with 15 draconian prison rules for his guards to enforce, including \u201cPrisoners must address each other by number only,\u201d \u201cPrisoners must never refer to their condition as an \u2018experiment\u2019 or a \u2018simulation,\u201d and \u201cFailure to obey any of the above rules may result in punishment.\u201d Zimbardo was so taken with the tears and drama produced by Jaffe\u2019s two-day simulation that he decided to try it himself, this time randomly assigning guards and prisoners and dragging the action on much longer. Because Zimbardo himself had never visited a real prison, the standards of realism were defined by Jaffe\u2019s prison research and the nightmarish recollections of Carlo Prescott, a San Quentin parolee whom Zimbardo met through Jaffe and brought in as a consultant. Jaffe was given extraordinary leeway in shaping the Stanford prison experiment in order to replicate his previous results. \u201cDr. Zimbardo suggested that the most difficult problem would be to get the guards to behave like guards,\u201d Jaffe wrote in a post-experiment \\x3ca href=\\\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\\\" data-href=\\\"https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:gg576zj2664/SC0750_s5_b09_f40.pdf\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"noopener nofollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3eevaluation\\x3c/a\\x3e. \u201cI was asked to suggest tactics based on my previous experience as master sadist.\u00a0\u2026 I was given the responsibility of trying to elicit \u2018tough-guard\u2019 behavior.\u201d Though Zimbardo has often stated that the guards devised their own rules, in fact most of them were copied directly from Jaffe\u2019s class assignment during that Saturday orientation meeting.

We have been taught that guards abused prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment because of the power of their roles, but Haslam and Reicher argue that their behavior arose instead from their identification with the experimenters, which Jaffe and Zimbardo encouraged at every turn.

But Zimbardo\u2019s prison simulation quickly garnered more press attention than he could have imagined. On August 21st, a day after the study\u2019s premature closure, the attempt by George Jackson, radical black activist and author of the bestselling \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eSoledad Brother\\x3c/em\\x3e, to escape from San Quentin, an hour north of Stanford, led to the deaths of three corrections officers and three inmates, including Jackson himself. In short order, KRON arranged a televised debate between Zimbardo and San Quentin\u2019s associate warden. Three weeks later, the predominately African American prisoners at Attica State Prison in New York seized control of the facility from the nearly all-white correctional staff, demanding better treatment. Ordered by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to retake the prison by force, helicopters dumped tear gas canisters and hundreds of law-enforcement officers and armed Attica guards fired blindly into the smoke, slaughtering prisoners and hostages alike.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"eac0\\\" id=\\\"eac0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn an era before the mass shootings that have since become the norm in American news headlines, it was a shocking bloodbath\u200a\u2014\u200aone of the deadliest since the Civil War, according to the New York State Special Commission on Attica. The country scrambled for answers, and Zimbardo\u2019s experiment appeared to offer them, putting guards and prisoners on the same moral plane\u200a\u2014\u200amutual victims of the carceral state\u200a\u2014\u200athough in fact nearly all the Attica killings had been committed by guards and officers. Zimbardo\u2019s tale of guards-run-amok and terrorized prisoners first came to national attention with a twenty-minute prime-time special on NBC. Richard Yacco told NBC\u2019s reporter that he and other prisoners had been told they couldn\u2019t quit, but, after he failed to hew to Zimbardo\u2019s narrative of prisoners organically \u201cslipping into\u201d their roles, he was edited out of the program (the recording survives \\x3ca href=\\\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/jh477zg7277\\\" data-href=\\\"https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/jh477zg7277\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3ehere\\x3c/a\\x3e).\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d802\\\" id=\\\"d802\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn his 1973 article in the New York Times Magazine, Zimbardo wrote unequivocally that Korpi\u2019s breakdown was genuine.

He became the primary author of one of the field\u2019s most popular and long-running textbooks, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ePsychology: Core Concepts\\x3c/em\\x3e, and the host of a 1990 PBS video series, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eDiscovering Psychology\\x3c/em\\x3e, which gained wide usage in high school and college classes and is still screened today. Both featured the Stanford prison experiment. And its popularity wasn\u2019t limited to the United States. Polish philosopher Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s citation of the experiment in \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eModernity and the Holocaust\\x3c/em\\x3e in 1989 typified a growing tradition in Eastern Europe and Germany of looking to the Stanford prison experiment for help explaining the Holocaust. In his influential 1992 book, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eOrdinary Men\\x3c/em\\x3e, historian Christopher Browning relied on both the Stanford prison experiment and the Milgram experiment, another social psychology touchstone, in arguing that Nazi mass killings were in part the result of situational factors (other scholars argued that subscribers to a national ideology that identified Jews as enemies of the state could hardly be described as \u201cordinary men\u201d). 2001, the same year Zimbardo was elected president of the American Psychological Association, saw the release of a German-language film, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eDas Experiment\\x3c/em\\x3e, that was based on the SPE but amped the violence up to Nazi-worthy levels, with guards not only abusing prisoners but murdering them and each other. When prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib came to light in 2004, Zimbardo again made the rounds on the talk show circuit, arguing that the abuse had been the result not of a few \u201cbad apple\u201d soldiers but of a \u201cbad barrel\u201d and providing expert testimony on behalf of Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick, the staff sergeant supervising the military policemen who committed the abuses. With the resurgence of interest in the experiment, Zimbardo published \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eThe Lucifer Effect\\x3c/em\\x3e in 2007, offering more detail about it than ever before, though framed in such a way as to avoid calling his basic findings into question.

Famed psychologist Erich Fromm, unaware that guards had been explicitly instructed to be \u201ctough,\u201d nonetheless opined that in light of the obvious pressures to abuse, what was most surprising about the experiment was how few guards did. \u201cThe authors believe it proves that the situation alone can within a few days transform normal people into abject, submissive individuals or into ruthless sadists,\u201d Fromm wrote. \u201cIt seems to me that the experiment proves, if anything, rather the contrary.\u201d Some scholars have argued that it wasn\u2019t an experiment at all.

Beleaguered by abusive guards, the character based on Korpi (Ezra Miller) succumbs to a delusion that he is not participating in an experiment at all but has been placed in a real prison and, in the emotional turning point of the film, suffers a screaming meltdown. Gradually his delusion begins to infect the other prisoners.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"05c3\\\" id=\\\"05c3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSomehow, neither Prescott\u2019s letter nor the failed replication nor the numerous academic critiques have so far lessened the grip of Zimbardo\u2019s tale on the public imagination. The appeal of the Stanford prison experiment seems to go deeper than its scientific validity, perhaps because it tells us a story about ourselves that we desperately want to believe: that we, as individuals, cannot really be held accountable for the sometimes reprehensible things we do. As troubling as it might seem to accept Zimbardo\u2019s fallen vision of human nature, it is also profoundly liberating. It means we\u2019re off the hook. Our actions are determined by circumstance. Our fallibility is situational. Just as the Gospel promised to absolve us of our sins if we would only believe, the SPE offered a form of redemption tailor-made for a scientific era, and we embraced it.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9f6c\\\" id=\\\"9f6c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eFor psychology professors, the Stanford prison experiment is a reliable crowd-pleaser, typically presented with lots of vividly disturbing video footage. In introductory psychology lecture halls, often filled with students from other majors, the counterintuitive assertion that students\u2019 own belief in their inherent goodness is flatly wrong offers dramatic proof of psychology\u2019s ability to teach them new and surprising things about themselves. Some intro psych professors I spoke to felt that it helped instill the understanding that those who do bad things are not necessarily bad people. Others pointed to the importance of teaching students in our unusually individualistic culture that their actions are profoundly influenced by external factors.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0400\\\" id=\\\"0400\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cEven if the science was quirky,\u201d said Kenneth Carter, professor of psychology at Emory University and co-author of the textbook \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eLearn Psychology\\x3c/em\\x3e, \u201cor there was something that was wrong about the way that it was put together, I think at the end of the day, I still want students to be mindful that they may find themselves in powerful situations that could override how they might behave as an individual.

Curious about why the field\u2019s appointed gatekeepers, presumably well-informed about the experiment\u2019s dubious history, would choose to include it nonetheless, I reached out. Three told me they had originally omitted the Stanford prison experiment from their first editions because of concerns about its scientific legitimacy. But even psychology professors are not immune to the forces of social influence: two added it back in under pressure from reviewers and teachers, a third because it was so much in the news after Abu Ghraib.

In the hearing chamber, Zimbardo sat before the assembled Congressmen of Subcommittee 3 and told a whopper: the \u201cguards\u201d in his recent experiment \u201cwere simply told that they were going to go into a situation that could be serious and have perhaps some danger\u2026 They made up their own rules for maintaining law, order, and respect.\u201d Zimbardo described a laundry list of abuses, causing \u201cacute situational traumatic reactions\u201d from the prisoners. Despite still never having set foot in an actual prison, he generalized freely from the unreviewed, unpublished, and largely unanalyzed results of his study: \u201cThe prison situation in our country is guaranteed to generate severe enough pathological reactions in both guards and prisoners as to debase their humanity, lower their feelings of self-worth, and make it difficult for them to be part of a society outside of their prison.\u201d Zimbardo was a hit. As Representative Hamilton Fish, Jr. of New York put it: \u201cYou certainly helped me a great deal in clarifying some of the things we have seen the past few days and understanding them.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1406\\\" id=\\\"1406\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn the wake of the prison uprisings at San Quentin and Attica, Zimbardo\u2019s message was perfectly attuned to the national zeitgeist. A critique of the criminal justice system that shunted blame away from inmates and guards alike onto a \u201csituation\u201d defined so vaguely as to fit almost any agenda offered a seductive lens on the day\u2019s social ills for just about everyone. Reform-minded liberals were hungry for evidence that people who committed crimes were driven to do so by the environment they\u2019d been born into, which played into their argument that reducing urban crime would require systemic reform\u200a\u2014\u200aa continuation of Johnson\u2019s \u201cwar on poverty\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200arather than the \u201c\\x3ca href=\\\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377\\\" data-href=\\\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3ewar on crime\\x3c/a\\x3e\u201d that President Richard M.

Everybody was uncritical.\u201d In Cullen\u2019s field, the Stanford prison experiment provided handy evidence that the prison system was fundamentally broken. \u201cIt confirmed what people already believed, which was that prisons were inherently inhumane,\u201d he said.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7536\\\" id=\\\"7536\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe racial dynamics of the Stanford prison experiment, which have never been adequately explored, should probably have given reformers pause. Carlo Prescott, who had just suffered sixteen years of imprisonment as an African American, played a pivotal role in shaping the architecture of the experiment. Frustrated in part by the lack of black experimental subjects, he intervened repeatedly in the action, seeking to bring, as he put it to me, \u201can air of authenticity to boys who were getting $15 a day to pretend to be prisoners\u200a\u2014\u200aall Caucasian, as you recall. [Ed. note: one prisoner was Asian American.] Some of the genuine things that shock you as a result of having your liberty taken and your ass being controlled by people who hate you before you even get there.\u201d Yet Zimbardo\u2019s account of the \u201csituation\u201d that engendered abuse left race out of the equation. He often used the word \u201cnormal\u201d to describe the participants in his study despite the fact that they were hardly a normal representation of the American inmate population at that time. Analyzing American prisoner abuse as a product of race-blind \u201csituational forces\u201d erased its deep roots in racial oppression.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e921\\\" id=\\\"e921\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNonetheless, the Stanford prison experiment came to exert a significant influence on American criminology. Zimbardo\u2019s first academic article about his results was published in the \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eInternational Journal of Criminology and Penology\\x3c/em\\x3e rather than a psychology journal. A year later, Robert Martinson, one of a team of sociologists who had been commissioned by the state of New York to evaluate various prison programs, appeared on \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3e60 Minutes\\x3c/em\\x3e with a dark message: when it came to rehabilitation of prisoners, Martinson said, nothing worked. Almost overnight, Martinson\u2019s \u201cnothing works doctrine\u201d became accepted wisdom in America. It is often cited as the cause of the widespread abandonment in the 1970s by academics and policymakers alike of the notion that a prison could be a rehabilitative environment. Cullen believes Zimbardo\u2019s study played a role too.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1050\\\" id=\\\"1050\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cWhat the Stanford Prison Experiment did,\u201d Cullen says, \u201cwas to say: prisons are not reformable. The crux of many prison reforms, especially among academic criminologists, became that prisons were inherently inhumane, so our agenda had to be minimizing the use of prisons, emphasizing alternatives to prison, emphasizing community corrections.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2c58\\\" id=\\\"2c58\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn an era of rapidly rising crime, this agenda proved politically untenable. Instead, conservative politicians who had no qualms about using imprisonment purely to punish ushered in a decades-long \u201cget tough\u201d era in crime that disproportionately targeted African Americans. The incarceration rate rose steadily, standing now at five times higher than in comparable countries; one in three black men in America today will spend time in prison.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"80cf\\\" id=\\\"80cf\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt would, of course, be unfair to lay mass incarceration at Zimbardo\u2019s door. It is more accurate to say that, for all its reformist ideals, the Stanford prison experiment contributed to the polarizing intellectual currents of its time. According to a 2017 survey conducted by Cullen and his colleagues Teresa Kulig and Travis Pratt, 95% of the many criminology papers that have cited the Stanford prison experiment over the years have accepted its basic message that prisons are inherently inhumane.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2db9\\\" id=\\\"2db9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cWhat struck me later in life was how all of us lost our scientific skepticism,\u201d Cullen says. \u201cWe became as ideological, in our way, as the climate change deniers. Zimbardo\u2019s and Martinson\u2019s studies made so much intuitive sense that no one took a step back and said, \u2018Well, this could be wrong.\u2019\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c34d\\\" id=\\\"c34d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMost criminologists today agree that prisons are not, in fact, as hopeless as Zimbardo and Martinson made them out to be. Some prison programs do reliably help inmates better their lives. Though international comparisons are difficult to make, Norway\u2019s maximum-security Halden prison, where convicted murderers wear casual clothing, receive extensive job-skill training, share meals with unarmed guards, and wander at will during daylight hours through a scenic landscape of pine trees and blueberry bushes, offers a hopeful sign. Norwegians prisoners seldom get in fights and reoffend at lower rates than anywhere else in the world. To begin to ameliorate the evils of mass incarceration, Cullen argues, will require researching what makes some forms of prison management better than others, rather than, as the Stanford prison experiment did, dismissing them all as inherently abusive.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"848b\\\" id=\\\"848b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMeanwhile, the legacy of Zimbardo\u2019s work goes well beyond its influence on our troubled criminal justice system, touching directly on how we understand our personal moral freedom.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"1dee\\\" id=\\\"1dee\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 30px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 4.3%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\\\" data-width=\\\"700\\\" data-height=\\\"30\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*q2yGj1PEiG1ziPTM5oNDdQ.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ab00\\\" id=\\\"ab00\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eOn\\x3c/span\\x3e a sunny August afternoon in 2006, at the height of the Iraq War, a nineteen-year-old U.S. Army Ranger named Alex Blum drove a superior in the Rangers and three other men to a Bank of America branch in Tacoma, where they leapt out of his car and committed an armed takeover robbery using pistols and AK-47s. Three days later, Alex, who happens to be my cousin, was arrested in our hometown of Denver, Colorado. Alex claimed to our family to have believed he had been participating in a training exercise. After the radical conditioning of the month-long Ranger Indoctrination Program he had just undergone, he had followed his superior without questioning. For Alex\u2019s sentencing hearing, his defense team called on a prominent expert to argue that his involvement in the robbery was due not to his own free will but to powerful \u201csituational forces\u201d: Dr. Philip Zimbardo. Alex received an extraordinarily lenient sentence, and Dr. Zimbardo became a family hero.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f941\\\" id=\\\"f941\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn October 2010, Zimbardo co-hosted a special episode of the Dr. Phil Show entitled \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eWhen Good People Do Bad Things, \\x3c/em\\x3eusing Alex\u2019s story to spread his message that evil acts are the result of circumstance rather than character and choice. From my place in the studio audience, I heard Zimbardo describe guards abusing prisoners without any urging whatsoever\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cI constrained the guards not to use any physical force, but they intuitively knew how to use psychological force,\u201d Zimbardo said. Next he used his theories to explain the abuses at Abu Ghraib, offering up the same arguments he\u2019d recently used to defend Ivan \u201cChip\u201d Frederick. When Dr. Phil asked who in the studio audience thought they too might have tortured detainees in a similar situation, everyone in my family stood up, almost the only ones to do so. We were proud to support Alex, and we knew this was the lesson we were supposed to derive from Zimbardo\u2019s work.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"1aea\\\" id=\\\"1aea\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 566px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 80.80000000000001%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\\\" data-width=\\\"1052\\\" data-height=\\\"850\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Pf3KbdE7riFBQOe6GKDuBg.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"43a0\\\" id=\\\"43a0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3eA few years later, after deciding to write a book about Alex\u2019s story, I discovered evidence that he hadn\u2019t told the whole truth about his involvement. When I confronted him, he confessed to me that his choice to participate in the bank robbery was freer and more informed than he had ever let on before. Accepting responsibility was transformative for him. It freed him from the aggrieved victim mindset in which he had been trapped for years. Zimbardo\u2019s \u201csituational forces\u201d excuse had once appeared to give my cousin a way to believe in his fundamental goodness despite his egregious crime, but seeing the personal growth that came with deeper moral reckoning, I began to wonder if it had really done him a service.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"695a\\\" id=\\\"695a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt was only after interviewing Zimbardo at his home in San Francisco for my book about Alex that I began researching the history of his famous experiment in depth. The more I found, the more unsettled I became. Shortly after my book was published, having by now spoken to a number of former participants in the study, I approached Zimbardo for another interview. For months I didn\u2019t hear back. Then Le Texier\u2019s book was published, and Zimbardo suddenly agreed to speak to me, apparently eager to respond to the charges. We spoke by Skype shortly after his return from a psychology conference. His office was stacked high with books and papers, the phone constantly ringing in the background as we talked.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ed11\\\" id=\\\"ed11\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAfter hearing Zimbardo describe the experiment so many times over the years, I was not expecting to hear anything new. The first surprise came when I asked about Korpi\u2019s and Yacco\u2019s claims to me that they had been told they couldn\u2019t leave. After dismissing them at first as lies and then claiming that Korpi and Yacco had simply forgotten the safe phrase \u201cI quit the experiment,\u201d Zimbardo astonished me by acknowledging that he had in fact instructed his staff to tell prisoners they couldn\u2019t get out.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ab62\\\" id=\\\"ab62\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cIf [prisoners] said, \u2018I want to get out,\u2019 and you said, \u2018Okay,\u2019 then as soon as they left, the experiment would be over,\u201d Zimbardo explained. \u201cAll the prisoners would say, \u2018I want to get out.\u2019 There has to be a good reason now for them to get out. The mentality has to be, in their mind, \u2018I am a prisoner in a prison,\u2019 not, \u2018I\u2019m a college student in an experiment. I don\u2019t want my money. I\u2019m quitting the experiment.\u2019 You don\u2019t quit a prison. That\u2019s the whole point of the Pirandellian prison [Ed. note: Pirandello was an Italian playwright whose plays blended fiction and reality]. At one level you\u2019re a student in a basement in an experiment. At another level, you\u2019re a prisoner being abused by guards in a county jail.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a932\\\" id=\\\"a932\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eZimbardo confirmed that David Jaffe had devised the rules with the guards, but tried to argue that he hadn\u2019t been lying when he told Congress (and, years later, insisted to Lesley Stahl on \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3e60 Minutes\\x3c/em\\x3e) that the guards had devised the rules themselves, on the grounds that Zimbardo himself had not been present at the time. He at first denied that the experiment had had any political motive, but after I read him an excerpt from a press release disseminated on the experiment\u2019s second day explicitly stating that it aimed to bring awareness to the need for reform, he admitted that he had probably written it himself under pressure from Carlo Prescott, with whom he had co-taught a summer school class on the psychology of imprisonment\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3e.\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"edbc\\\" id=\\\"edbc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cDuring that course, I began to see that prisons are a waste of time, and money, and lives,\u201d Zimbardo said. \u201cSo yes, I am a social activist, and prison reform was always important in my mind. It was not the reason to do the study.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6088\\\" id=\\\"6088\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAt the close of a long, tense conversation, I asked him whether he thought Le Texier\u2019s book would change the way people saw the experiment.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7e7c\\\" id=\\\"7e7c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, sounding tired. \u201cIn a sense, I don\u2019t really care. At this point, the big problem is, I don\u2019t want to waste any more of my time. After my talk with you, I\u2019m not going to do any interviews about it. It\u2019s just a waste of time. People can say whatever they want about it. It\u2019s the most famous study in the history of psychology at this point. There\u2019s no study that people talk about 50 years later. Ordinary people know about it. They say, \u2018What do you do?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a psychologist.\u2019 It could be a cab driver in Budapest. It could be a restaurant owner in Poland. I mention I\u2019m a psychologist, and they say, \u2018Did you hear about the study?\u2019 It\u2019s got a life of its own now. If he wants to say it was all a hoax, that\u2019s up to him. I\u2019m not going to defend it anymore. The defense is its longevity.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fe29\\\" id=\\\"fe29\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eZimbardo has spent much of the last fifty years answering questions about the darkest six days of his life, in some ways a prisoner of his own experiment\u2019s success. When I asked him if he was glad, looking back, to have conducted the study, he said he had mixed feelings. He considered the shyness clinic he founded in Palo Alto in 1975 to be his most important work.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3450\\\" id=\\\"3450\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cIf it was not for the prison study, that would be my legacy,\u201d he said.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e948\\\" id=\\\"e948\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cDoes some part of you wish that were your legacy?\u201d I asked.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"508b\\\" id=\\\"508b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said, \u201cof course. That\u2019s positive. The prison study, the negative part is I am Dr. Evil. I created this evil situation, like Svengali or something.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f6c6\\\" id=\\\"f6c6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn Zimbardo\u2019s telling, he, too, is a victim of circumstance\u200a\u2014\u200ashaped by his surroundings like everyone else.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3aec\\\" id=\\\"3aec\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cI gradually, with a lack of awareness, transformed myself into being the prison superintendent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?

I had to deal with the priest coming in.

The little 5 1/2\u2033-by-9\u2033 landscape, reputedly painted by the Impressionist master for his mistress on a linen napkin at a cafe on the shores of the Seine in 1879, first made the news <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/19568\" target=\"_blank\">in 2012</a> when it was put up for auction by a woman (later revealed to be one Marcia \u201cMartha\u201d Fuqua) who claimed she bought it at a flea market for $7 in a box lot along with a plastic cow and a Paul Bunyan doll. That story soon turned out to have more than a few gaping holes which were exposed when a Washington Post reporter <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/20101\" target=\"_blank\">discovered evidence in the archives of the Baltimore Museum of Art</a> that the painting had been stolen from the museum on November 17th, 1951. </p>\n<p>The sale was canceled while a federal court decided who owned legal title to the painting. Possible contenders were the museum, Fuqua and the Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company which had paid the museum $2,500 after the theft. The insurance company declined to pursue their own claim because they believed that the Renoir should return to the Baltimore Museum of Art. In January, the court decided that even if Fuqua was an \u201cinnocent owner\u201d who had no idea the painting was stolen when she acquired it, a thief cannot pass title to a new owner, innocent or otherwise. The landscape was <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/28627\" target=\"_blank\">going back to the museum</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Joan-Miro-Portrait-No-1-1938.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29863\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Joan-Miro-Portrait-No-1-1938-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Joan-Miro-Portrait-No-1-1938-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Joan-Miro-Portrait-No-1-1938-200x248.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Joan-Miro-Portrait-No-1-1938-430x534.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Joan-Miro-Portrait-No-1-1938.jpg 824w\" title=\"Portrait No. 1 by Joan Mir\u00f3, 1938, bequeathed to the Baltimore Museum of Art by Saidie Adler May\" width=\"120\"/></a>Since then, BMA conservators have treated the work \u2014 it was in excellent condition and only needed a surface cleaning \u2014 to prepare it for its triumphant return.

A dedicated collector of Impressionist and early 20th century art, Saidie Adler May left her entire collection to the Baltimore Museum of Art, but this is the first time, believe it or not, that the museum has dedicated an exhibition to Saidie May\u2019s donations. Works from the May collection by Mondrian, Klee and Mir\u00f3 join the Renoir in the two-gallery show.

Lehman, ca. 1920.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Earlier articles said that according the records of the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in Paris, the painting was purchased by Herbert L. May, Saidie\u2019s estranged husband, in 1926. According to the BMA\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/03/prweb11713136.htm\" target=\"_blank\">press release about the exhibition</a>, however, Saidie and Herbert bought the painting together in November of 1925. Museum researchers discovered a diary in which she wrote about her acquisition of the Renoir. She bought it from Bernheim-Jeune along with an oil sketch by Georges Seurat, paying $2,000 for both. The diary entry and the original receipt of the purchase are part of the exhibition, as is the Seurat. </p>\n<p>Researchers also found evidence supporting the linen napkin story.</p>\n<blockquote><p>New research conducted by the BMA\u2019s conservation and textile departments confirms part of Saidie May\u2019s story about Renoir painting the landscape on a linen napkin at a restaurant on the Seine for his mistress. Since Renoir was not married at the time, there is no conclusive information about the identity of his mistress, but the surface of the painting is in fact a linen damask with an elaborate geometric weave. It was unusual for painters to use this type of fabric as a background, but very common for table linens of that period. It turns out to have been a good choice, as linen increases in strength when wet and is smoother than wool and cotton. </p></blockquote>\n<p>As for what happened to the painting between 1951 and 2012, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll be getting answers any time soon. The <a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-03-27/entertainment/bs-ae-renoir-fbi-exhibit-20140327_1_saidie-may-renoir-painting-painting-returns\" target=\"_blank\">FBI has closed its investigation</a> because they don\u2019t have enough evidence to arrest someone for the theft or even for knowingly possessing stolen goods. There are too many contradictory stories to pin anything on anyone. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Martha-Fouquet-in-her-art-school-days.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29865\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Martha-Fouquet-in-her-art-school-days-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Martha-Fouquet-in-her-art-school-days-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Martha-Fouquet-in-her-art-school-days-200x277.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Martha-Fouquet-in-her-art-school-days.jpg 404w\" title=\"Martha Fouquet in her art school days\" width=\"108\"/></a>One key witness, and possible suspect, was Martha Fuqua\u2019s mother Marcia Fouquet. She was an art student in Baltimore in 1951 and had at least one friend who worked at the museum. Borders and family, including her son Matt, recall seeing the painting in her home in the 80s and 90s. The FBI did interview her before her death in September of 2013, but didn\u2019t actually ask her if she was involved in the theft or even if she had the painting hanging in her home. Special agent in charge of the investigation Gregg Horner says: \u201cI did not ask her about the Renoir. I did not feel that the timing was right. She\u2019s a very interesting lady, very well-educated. We had a nice, pleasant conversation. I talked to her in general terms about her art.\u201d He never followed up with her because of her precipitous decline in health (she was 85 years old and had cancer). \u201cGiven her illness,\u201d Horner said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p>I am completely perplexed by this. It\u2019s not idle curiosity, after all. He\u2019s an agent investigating a crime. What is the point of interviewing a witness/suspect IF YOU DON\u2019T ASK THEM ABOUT THE CRIME?

It\u2019s likely that the latter commissioned <em>Lute Player</em> since it appears in the inventory of the Villa Medici at Artimino in 1638, only 20 or so years after it was painted. The inventory describes it as \u201cA picture on canvas 1 1/2 <em>braccia</em> high and 1 1/4 <em>braccia</em> wide in a black frame bordered in gold, the portrait of Artemisia playing a lute painted by her own hand.\u201d (A Florentine <em>braccio</em> is 58.4 centimeters, which would make the portrait 87.6 cm x 73 cm when in fact it\u2019s 77.5 x 71.8 cm, but it was probably trimmed by idiots over the centuries. You can see the bottom edge crops the arm and lute awkwardly.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Landscape-with-a-Scene-of-Witchcraft-by-Agostino-Tassi-1620-1640.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29856\" height=\"126\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Landscape-with-a-Scene-of-Witchcraft-by-Agostino-Tassi-1620-1640-150x126.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Landscape-with-a-Scene-of-Witchcraft-by-Agostino-Tassi-1620-1640-150x126.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Landscape-with-a-Scene-of-Witchcraft-by-Agostino-Tassi-1620-1640-200x168.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Landscape-with-a-Scene-of-Witchcraft-by-Agostino-Tassi-1620-1640-430x363.jpg 430w\" title='\"Landscape with a Scene of Witchcraft\" by serial rapist Agostino Tassi 1620-1640' width=\"150\"/></a>Her success at the Florentine court was unprecedented for a woman and was all the more astonishing considering the personal horror that brought her to the city. In 1611, when she was 17 years old, Artemisia Gentileschi was raped by Agostino Tassi, a colleague of her father\u2019s and full-on psycho stalker who had already raped at least two women (his sister-in-law and one of his wives, the latter of whom disappeared and was probably murdered by bandits Tassi hired). The rape trial lasted seven months and all except a few final pages of the transcripts have survived. Artemisia, per standard legal practice in the Papal States at that time for any woman who accused someone of rape, was tortured with thumbscrews to prove she wasn\u2019t lying. Tassi was convicted but only served eight months in prison after the judge pardoned him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Judith-Slaying-Holofernes-1611-1612.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29853\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 117px) 100vw, 117px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Judith-Slaying-Holofernes-1611-1612-117x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Judith-Slaying-Holofernes-1611-1612-117x150.jpg 117w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Judith-Slaying-Holofernes-1611-1612-200x254.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Judith-Slaying-Holofernes-1611-1612-430x547.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Judith-Slaying-Holofernes-1611-1612.jpg 1178w\" title='\"Judith Slaying Holofernes\" by Artemisia Gentileschi, ca. 1611-1612 around the time of her rape and the subsequent trial' width=\"117\"/></a>Even though Tassi\u2019s testimony \u2014 denials coupled with completely fictitious claims about Artemisia\u2019s purported promiscuity which fit handily into the blame-the-victim template that still haunts the halls of justice today \u2014 was blatantly false and widely seen as such, the scandal of the trial generated so much malicious gossip against her that a few months after Tassi\u2019s conviction, she was hastily married to Pierantonio Stiattesi, a mediocre Florentine artist, and left Rome with him to start afresh in Florence where she supported them with her commissions. Her husband proved to be a deadbeat who ran up huge debts and forced her to leave Florence with creditors baying for blood. She dumped the bum and moved back to Rome in 1621 without him.</p>\n<p>Her immense gifts have been recognized by art critics from the beginning, but for many centuries the rape trial overshadowed her talent. It was 20th century feminist analysis that brought Artemisia Gentileschi back into the spotlight to take her rightful place among the greatest artists of her era.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Wadsworth Atheneum acquires Artemisia Gentileschi self-portrait\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29836\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29836#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-29823\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29823\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to What is this hinged imperial white jade piece?\">What is this hinged imperial white jade piece?</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, March 29th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-29824\" height=\"146\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-200x146.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-200x146.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-430x314.jpg 430w\" title=\"Imperial white jade hinge-fitting, 18th c.\" width=\"200\"/></a>An imperial white jade object from the 18th century that is as mysterious as it is beautiful will be <a href=\"http://www.bonhams.com/press_release/16229/\" target=\"_blank\">going up for auction at Bonhams next month</a>. Made for the Qianlong Emperor (reigned 1735-1796), sixth emperor of the Qing Dynasty, the piece is made out of two hollowed rectangles that are connected to a central triangle via two hinges. They hinges work, allowing the rectangles to move from laid out straight to fully vertical. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The hinge-fitting embodies much of the artistic and historical pre-occupations of the Qianlong period. Carved from exceptionally fine and lustrous white stone, with even the minor flaws most cleverly incorporated into the scrollwork, the thinly hollowed supremely challenging yet technically flawless piece is representative of the highest skill of the 18th century craftsman. Furthermore it falls into a group of jade pieces carved with the Qianlong fanggu mark, specifically carved with archaistic designs inspired by archaic bronzes to reflect the concerns of the Qianlong Emperor with drawing moral strength and righteousness from the examples of the ancients.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-underside-with-Qianlong-fanggu-mark.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-29825\" height=\"65\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-underside-with-Qianlong-fanggu-mark-430x65.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-underside-with-Qianlong-fanggu-mark-430x65.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-underside-with-Qianlong-fanggu-mark-150x22.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Imperial-white-jade-hinge-fitting-underside-with-Qianlong-fanggu-mark-200x30.jpg 200w\" title=\"Underside with the Qianlong fanggu mark in the middle\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>The ancient bronze that inspired this piece was described in the 1751 catalog of the imperial bronzes as a \u201cHan Dynasty ornament,\u201d which means they had little idea what it was for either.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Painting-of-Emperor-Qianlong-wearing-ceremonial-armor-1758.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8906\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Painting-of-Emperor-Qianlong-wearing-ceremonial-armor-1758-108x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Painting-of-Emperor-Qianlong-wearing-ceremonial-armor-1758-108x150.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Painting-of-Emperor-Qianlong-wearing-ceremonial-armor-1758-216x300.jpg 216w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Painting-of-Emperor-Qianlong-wearing-ceremonial-armor-1758.jpg 408w\" title=\"Painting of Emperor Qianlong wearing ceremonial armor 1758\" width=\"108\"/></a>The Qianlong Emperor was a passionate collector of art. His agents would buy up entire private collections from people who had fallen in hard times or whose descendants didn\u2019t want to be associated with them because they had taken the wrong side during the wars of the Qing Conquest. There are thousands of jade pieces in the imperial collection and almost all of them were acquired or commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor.</p>\n<p>Although he was an artistic polyglot who welcomed the fusion of Chinese and Western styles (the famous <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24949\" target=\"_blank\">bronze animal heads of the Chinese zodiac</a> were made during his reign), the Qianlong Emperor saw himself first and foremost as the keeper of China\u2019s artistic heritage. His collection of ancient bronzes was unparalleled, as was his collection of antique paintings.

There is another hinged white jade piece similar to this one which is engraved with an imperial poem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The poem appears to refer to the jade piece as a \u2018ruler\u2019 to be used to \u2018compare lengths\u2019 with \u2018precisely fitting workmanship\u2019. This pre-occupation with the idea of measuring is also connected to the idea of the benevolent ruler who is guided well. </p></blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say this was its original purpose. The Han bronze may have had a whole other significance to which the Qianlong Emperor ascribed his own meaning.</p>\n<p>The piece is estimated to sell for \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3300,000 ($333,000 \u2013 $500,000), but the market for Chinese antiquities is insane right now so those numbers could go increase geometrically.

Biltmore Museum Services collections manager Laura Overbey went to Cochran\u2019s home to examine the artifact and bring it back to the great estate in Asheville, North Carolina. She recognized the box from the two distinctive monograms on either side of the \u201cBiltmore House\u201d on the lid as those of Cornelia Vanderbilt and John F. A. Cecil, which marked the box and its contents as originating at their huge society wedding.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cake-maker-stamp.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29812\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cake-maker-stamp-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cake-maker-stamp-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cake-maker-stamp-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cake-maker-stamp-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cake-maker-stamp.jpg 640w\" title=\"Stamp of Washington, D.C. cake maker Rauscher's\" width=\"150\"/></a>As far as she knew, however, there was no cheese gifting at the Vanderbilt-Cecil wedding. It wasn\u2019t until she overheard a couple of conversations that she was able to put the pieces together.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back at Biltmore, one of Overbey\u2019s coworkers happened to be talking about \u201chow a friend had found a piece of Grover Cleveland\u2019s wedding cake\u201d \u2014 and she realized what she likely had in the pretty little box. Even more coincidental, as she walked into the office of her director, Ellen Rickman, to tell her the news, she heard an oral history to which Rickman was listening, about Cornelia\u2019s nuptials.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight as I was coming in the door, this gentleman (on the recording) is saying he remembers getting a small box of fruitcake for the wedding,\u201d Overbey said. Thus it was that an interview done in 1989 helped a collections manager in 2014 to identify a piece of cake from 1924.</p>\n<p>In the interview, an elderly Paul Towe, whose father worked at Biltmore in the 1920s and \u201930s, recalled attending Cornelia\u2019s wedding as a small boy. His sister, Sarah, was a flower girl, and he remembered that \u201ceverybody got a little white box with their name on it with a piece of fruitcake.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-after-ceremony.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29816\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-after-ceremony-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-after-ceremony-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-after-ceremony-200x258.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-after-ceremony-430x555.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-after-ceremony.jpg 793w\" title=\"Cornelia and John leave the church after the ceremony\" width=\"116\"/></a>That would explain why Bonnie Revis had a sliver of the cake, because it was widely distributed to all the staff and attendants, and she was cook from 1924 to 1935 (coincidentally almost exactly the duration of the Vanderbilt-Cecil marriage). Cornelia\u2019s late father George Vanderbilt (grandson of railroad magnate Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt) and her mother Edith Stuyvesant Dresser were deeply involved in the Asheville community and employed hundreds of people at the estate. When Cornelia, only child of George and Edith, married the Honorable John Francis Amherst Cecil, third son of Lord Cecil and the Baroness Amherst of Hackney, direct descendant of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s Lord High Treasurer, the entire town assembled outside All Souls\u2019 Church to watch the couple and 1,000 guests arrive and depart. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-flower-children.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29815\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-flower-children-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-flower-children-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-flower-children-200x258.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-flower-children-430x555.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-John-flower-children.jpg 793w\" title=\"Cornelia and John at the end of the flower arch held up by children of estate workers, Polly Ann Flower in foreground with her back to the camera\" width=\"116\"/></a>Many workers at the Biltmore Estate were guests or actually part of the wedding.

It was made by Rauscher\u2019s, identified by a stamp inside the bottom of the box, a bakery in Washington, D.C. George and Edith had a home on K Street in D.C., and Cornelia was staying there when she met Cecil. He was ten years older than her and an accomplished diplomat. When they met in 1923, he was the first secretary at the British Embassy and part of a group of highly eligible men known in D.C. society as the \u201cBritish Bachelors.\u201d Cornelia and John hit it off right away, announcing their engagement just a few months after they met.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-Vanderbilt-wedding.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29818\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-Vanderbilt-wedding-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-Vanderbilt-wedding-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-Vanderbilt-wedding-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-Vanderbilt-wedding-430x574.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cornelia-Vanderbilt-wedding.jpg 718w\" title=\"Cornelia Vanderbilt's formal bridal portrait at the foot of the Grand Staircase in Biltmore House\" width=\"112\"/></a>John Cecil resigned his position before the wedding, choosing instead to focus on the management of the Biltmore Estate.

She, on the other hand, got married to an English banker in 1949 and moved to England where she spent the rest of her life. John and Cornelia\u2019s sons took over management of the estate after John\u2019s death, George Henry Vanderbilt Cecil running Biltmore Farms (the successful dairy farm branch), his younger brother William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil taking on the Biltmore Estate, including the house and vinyards he planted.

The woman, who was 5\u20192\u2033 tall and between 20 and 35 years old at the time of her death, was wrapped in a linen and wool shroud and buried around 700 A.D. The arid heat of the desert naturally mummified her, preserving some soft tissues like skin and internal organs. The skin of her inner thigh is so well preserved that the ink is still visible to the naked eye, but it\u2019s quite faint. It wasn\u2019t until last year when the mummy was given a CT scan at a London hospital and photographed with infra-red reflectography that British Museum archaeologists were able to identify the tattoo as a monogram of the letters \u039c\u03b9\u03c7\u03b1\u03ae\u03bb, meaning Michael.</p>\n<p>This is an exceptionally rare find. It\u2019s the first tattoo of any kind found from this period in the Nile Valley. Michael was the patron saint of Christian medieval Sudan, so his name is invoked frequently in inscriptions. The monogram, which stacks the letters of Michael\u2019s name so it looks almost like an upside angel, has been found engraved on stele and in graffiti on churches from that time, but this is the first tattoo of the symbol ever discovered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mummy-tattoo-IR.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29798\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 107px) 100vw, 107px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mummy-tattoo-IR-107x150.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mummy-tattoo-IR-107x150.png 107w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mummy-tattoo-IR-200x279.png 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mummy-tattoo-IR-430x600.png 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mummy-tattoo-IR.png 700w\" title='\"Michael\" tattoo under infra-red' width=\"107\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mummy-tatoo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29797\" height=\"84\" light\"=\"\" michael\"=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mummy-tatoo-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mummy-tatoo-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mummy-tatoo-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mummy-tatoo-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mummy-tatoo.jpg 976w\" tatoo=\"\" title=\"\" under=\"\" visible=\"\" width=\"150\"/></a>The purpose of the tattoo is, of course, unknown, since the only person who could tell us has been dead for 1,300 years.

The temple dates to the Roman era. It was first built as a temple to Isis under Augustus but the carvings on the western and eastern exterior walls, 36 on each, were all done during the reign of the emperor Claudius (41-54 A.D.).</p>\n<p>The carvings were first exposed during an archaeological excavation in 2000-2001. Before that they had been covered by a mound of soil that obscured and protected the exterior temple walls, leaving the carvings in excellent condition. In the decade or so since they lost the protection of the mound, the carvings, made on lower grade limestone that is highly susceptible to erosion, have unfortunately been weathered so they\u2019re much harder to make out now. The Swansea-KU Leuven team began recording and translating the exterior wall carvings in 2010.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Claudius-Min-drawing.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29784\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Claudius-Min-drawing-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Claudius-Min-drawing-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Claudius-Min-drawing-200x151.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Claudius-Min-drawing-430x326.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Claudius-Min-drawing.jpg 894w\" title=\"Drawing of the pole-raising ritual carving\" width=\"150\"/></a>It\u2019s scene 123 on the western wall that is the stand-out piece, both in terms of preservation and historical significance. It depicts Claudius doing the ritual of the raising of the pole for Min, the Egyptian god of fertility and power. This ritual is ancient, going back 4,300 years to the Old Kingdom, which we know from the 32 extant scenes of the pole-raising that have been found. What makes this one so special is not just the involvement of Clau-Clau-Claudius (if you haven\u2019t seen <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074006/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>I, Claudius</em></a>, please do so immediately; there will be a test), but the fact that the inscriptions include a precise date when this particular ritual took place. It\u2019s the only one of the 32 that does.</p>\n<p>The scene shows Claudius garbed in pharaonic regalia. He wears a complex crown known as the \u201cRoaring One\u201d made out of three rushes embellished by sun discs and solarized falcons. The rushes are flanked by ostrich feathers and perched on ram horns. He carries two ceremonial staffs in his left hand and a scepter in his right. The accompanying inscription identifies him and dates the ritual:</p>\n<blockquote><p>King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands, Tiberios Klaudios<br/>\nSon of Ra, Lord of the Crowns, Kaisaros Sebastos Germanikos Autokrator<br/>\nRaising the pole of the tent/cult chapel for his father in month 2 of the <em>smw</em>-season (Payni), day 19.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Min stands across from Claudius, facing him. He holds a flail and wears a double feather crown with sun disc. As is customary for this fertility god, he also sports a magnificent erection. Behind him is his cult chapel and between him and Claudius eight men enact the ritual by climbing four poles propped against a central a pole topped by a crescent moon. </p>\n<p>The inscriptions and iconography suggest that by performing this ritual, Claudius assumes the formidable characteristics of Min:</p>\n<blockquote><p> [Words spoken by Min (or Min-Ra)\u2026 Lord of?] Coptos, Lord of Panopolis (Akhmim), who is on top of his stairway,<br/>\n[\u2026] King of the gods, strong sovereign, who captures<br/>\n[\u2026] who roars when he rages, lord of fear,<br/>\n[\u2026] the one who brings into control the warhorses, whose fear is in the Two Lands,<br/>\n[\u2026] about whose beauty one boasts, who inflicts terror/scares away with his strength.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He\u2019s not roaring with rage at Claudius, though, thanks to the pole-raising. By executing the ritual, Claudius keeps the cult of Min alive and asserts his power over \u201cthe (southern) foreign lands\u201d which, according to the inscription, Min gives to him. </p>\n<p>The inclusion of a date indicates that this ritual event actually happened, although Claudius himself was not present in person. He never went to Egypt. A priest probably acted as his proxy, something that was common even in the pharaonic era since the king couldn\u2019t possibly be present for every ritual.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-drawing.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29782\" height=\"114\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-drawing-150x114.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-drawing-150x114.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-drawing-200x152.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-drawing-430x327.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-drawing.jpg 898w\" title=\"Lettuce offering scene drawing\" width=\"150\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29783\" height=\"128\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-150x128.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-150x128.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-200x171.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene-430x369.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Lettuce-scene.jpg 980w\" title=\"Lettuce offering scene\" width=\"150\"/></a>There\u2019s another Claudius-Min ritual carved in the exterior eastern wall.

The Board of Education has so far been unable to locate any records of the production in their archives, but the date can be extrapolated from what we see and hear. The sad fate of that wonderful narrator is a key piece of evidence.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s unclear exactly when the video was produced, but portions of it seem to have been filmed in 1940s, judging by the models of cars and what seems to be a marquee for the 1945 Humphrey Bogart film \u201cConflict.\u201d</p>\n<p>The video was likely released between January 1945 and September 1946, as John Howatt, credited as the board\u2019s business manager, was elected to the post on Jan. 8, 1945, while narrator Johnnie Neblett died on Sept. 15, 1946, according to Chicago Public Schools spokeswoman Lauren Huffman.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The 1945/6 is confirmed by one of the comments on Vimeo points out that you can see the USS Sable aircraft carrier anchored on Lake Michigan.

Over the course of the year there will be <a href=\"http://loirevalley-worldheritage.org/News/Articles/All/Celebration-of-the-500th-anniversary-of-the-death-of-Anne-of-Brittany\" target=\"_blank\">a number of cultural events</a> dedicated to the memory of this erudite and strong-willed duchess who fought her entire life for Breton independence with her body as the final battlefield. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s not entirely metaphoric either. Anne was her father Duke Francis II of Brittany\u2019s only surviving heir. He tried desperately to marry her to someone anti-French to ensure the duchy would not end up annexed by France, but after he lost the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier in 1488, he was forced to agree to a peace treaty that required the French king\u2019s approval of Anne\u2019s marriage. Francis died a month later, making Anne Duchess of Brittany at 11 years old.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tomb_of_Francis_II_Duke_of_Brittany.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29762\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tomb_of_Francis_II_Duke_of_Brittany-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tomb_of_Francis_II_Duke_of_Brittany-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tomb_of_Francis_II_Duke_of_Brittany-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Tomb_of_Francis_II_Duke_of_Brittany-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Effigy of Francis II, Duke of Brittany, on his tomb in Nantes Cathedral\" width=\"150\"/></a>Now obviously she had advisors \u2014 her father\u2019s will left guardianship of her to John of Rieux, Marshal of Brittany, historian and diplomat Philippe, Count of Commines, and Anne\u2019s governess Madame Laval \u2014 but even at so young an age she took the reins of power firmly in her own hands. When Anne of Beaujeau, regent for her brother King Charles VIII of France, took advantage of the child duchess\u2019 perceived weakness and attacked Brittany, Anne reacted decisively. She appointed her most trusted councilors to government positions, convened the States General of Brittany, pawned her own jewelry to raise much-needed funds for the depleted treasury, minted viable coinage out of silver-tipped leather and called on the King of England, Henry VII, to help her fend off the French.</p>\n<p>The English turned out to be slow in sending help, but Austria and Spain sent troops to her aid. Meanwhile, the question of who she would marry became ever more pressing. Like her father, Anne cared first and foremost about which suitor could guarantee Breton independence. She did have her limits, though, and refused to marry Alain I, Lord of Albret, who had fought for Francis II against the French, because she considered him a scary brute (which by all accounts he was). Albret went into a rage at her refusal and sent troops to claim her by force. Anne, still a pre-teen at this point, met Albret\u2019s forces head-on, mounting a horse and leading her archers against them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maximilian-I-HRE-Albrecht-Durer-ca-1519.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29764\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maximilian-I-HRE-Albrecht-Durer-ca-1519-119x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maximilian-I-HRE-Albrecht-Durer-ca-1519-119x150.jpg 119w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maximilian-I-HRE-Albrecht-Durer-ca-1519-200x251.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maximilian-I-HRE-Albrecht-Durer-ca-1519-430x541.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Maximilian-I-HRE-Albrecht-Durer-ca-1519.jpg 848w\" title=\"Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, by Albrecht Durer ca 1519\" width=\"119\"/></a>That wouldn\u2019t be the last time she took to the saddle to confront a bully. When she decided to accept the suit of <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21295\" target=\"_blank\">Maximilian I of Austria</a>, future Holy Roman Emperor, the man her father had wanted her to marry who she considered to be the strongest ally against France, Albret occupied Nantes and handed the castle over to the French. She and a small cadre of loyal barons (John of Rieux and Phillipe de Commines had sided with Albret because they believed he was the only hope for an independent Brittany) and some Spanish and German mercenaries rode up to the walls of Nantes and demanded they allow her entry as their sovereign. After two weeks of negotiations went nowhere, Anne\u2019s party left only to be followed by Rieux and his soldiers. She stared him down too, turning around to face him and excoriate him for his disloyalty. Her bravery was so admired that Rieux let her go.</p>\n<p>The marriage to Maximilian did not solve her problems. France considered it a violation of the treaty since it was done without the approval of the king. Charles VIII besieged the city of Rennes and took it. Austria was of no help because Maximilian was busy fighting in Hungary. With France occupying four of Brittany\u2019s main cities, Brittany\u2019s nobles divided into two factions and money tight, Anne agreed to marry Charles. Since her marriage to Maximilian had been done by proxy (Maximilian sent an envoy to act in his lieu and they did this weird ceremonial thing where he put one bare knee on the bed to symbolize a consummation that never actually happened), it was easily annulled. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Charles_VIII_Ecole_Francaise_16th_c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29765\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Charles_VIII_Ecole_Francaise_16th_c-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Charles_VIII_Ecole_Francaise_16th_c-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Charles_VIII_Ecole_Francaise_16th_c-430x556.jpg 430w\" title=\"Charles VIII of France, Ecole Francaise 16th c.\" width=\"115\"/></a>Marriage to Anne was the means by which Charles planned to finally take Brittany for France, if not in his lifetime then shortly thereafter. He put a clause in the marriage contract ensuring that whichever spouse outlived the other would rule Brittany. Just to cover all his bases, another clause stipulated that if he pre-deceased Anne, she would marry the next king of France, thereby giving France a second bite at the Brittany apple. </p>\n<p>Married at 14, Anne would bear Charles seven children, none of whom survived, before he himself died when she was 21. As per the contract, she was to marry his heir, Louis XII, but he was already married. She told him she\u2019d go through with it if he managed to get his marriage annulled within a year, then returned to Brittany and set about the business of ruling, something Charles had not allowed her to do when they were married. Much to Anne\u2019s chagrin, Louis XII was able to get that annulment from Pope Alexander VI (aka Rodrigo Borgia) in exchange for some French estates for his son Cesare. Thus the Dowager Queen of France became Queen of France for a second time, the only woman ever to bear that distinction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-as-Prudence-on-Francis-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29759\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-as-Prudence-on-Francis-tomb-150x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-as-Prudence-on-Francis-tomb-150x133.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-as-Prudence-on-Francis-tomb-200x177.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-as-Prudence-on-Francis-tomb-430x381.jpg 430w\" title=\"Anne as Prudence on Francis' tomb\" width=\"150\"/></a>Anne of Brittany\u2019s courts were centers of learning and art.

She had at least seven more children with Louis, although only four survived their births and only two of them, daughters Claude and Ren\u00e9e, survived their mother. To her last breath she struggled against the seismic forces driving Brittany into French hands. With none of their male children surviving, Louis had betrothed Claude, Anne\u2019s eldest daughter and heir, to his cousin and the heir to the French throne Francis of Angoul\u00eame. Anne knew that Claude\u2019s inheritance and marriage would sound the death knell of Breton independence, so she left the duchy to her younger daughter Ren\u00e9e in her will, but Louis just ignored it. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Louis-XII-Anne-of-Brittany-tomb-Saint-Denis.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29757\" height=\"134\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Louis-XII-Anne-of-Brittany-tomb-Saint-Denis-150x134.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Louis-XII-Anne-of-Brittany-tomb-Saint-Denis-150x134.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Louis-XII-Anne-of-Brittany-tomb-Saint-Denis-200x179.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Louis-XII-Anne-of-Brittany-tomb-Saint-Denis-430x385.jpg 430w\" title=\"Tomb of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany in Saint Denis\" width=\"150\"/></a>A few months after Anne\u2019s death, Claude and Francis married and a few months after that Louis died. Francis I was crowned on what would have been Anne\u2019s 38th birthday. He made his and Claude\u2019s son heir to the Duchy of Brittany and from then on, it was a province of France.</p>\n<p>After her death, Anne was buried in the Basilica of Saint Denis, as was traditional for French sovereigns, but she left instructions in her will that her heart be removed and sent to Brittany. A beautiful gold reliquary was made to hold her heart, inscribed in old French with the following dedication: \u201cIn this little vessel of fine gold, pure and clean, rests a heart greater than any lady in the world ever had. Anne was her name, twice queen in France, Duchess of the Bretons, royal and sovereign.\u201d It was first placed in her father\u2019s tomb as she had willed and later moved to Saint Pierre Cathedral in Nantes. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-of-Brittany-heart-reliquary.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29754\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 104px) 100vw, 104px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-of-Brittany-heart-reliquary-104x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-of-Brittany-heart-reliquary-104x150.jpg 104w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anne-of-Brittany-heart-reliquary-430x614.jpg 430w\" title=\"Anne of Brittany's gold heart reliquary\" width=\"104\"/></a>The reliquary had a close brush with oblivion during the Revolution as part of the orgy of anti-monarchical destruction. In 1792 Anne\u2019s heart was thrown away like so much trash and the reliquary ordered to be melted down. Thankfully it never happened. The artifact was kept in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale until in 1819 it was returned to Nantes.

Although the shaman, characterized by his long face and holding a handled weapon of some kind that may have been an axe, couldn\u2019t keep the archaeologists out, he did an exceptional job protecting whoever was buried there from being desecrated by looters. Intact shaft tombs are rarely found because the grave goods they contain are highly sought-after artifacts. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Villa-de-Alvarez-dig.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29730\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Villa-de-Alvarez-dig-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Villa-de-Alvarez-dig-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Villa-de-Alvarez-dig-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Villa-de-Alvarez-dig-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"Villa de Alvarez dig\" width=\"150\"/></a>The shaft tomb was found during an archaeological exploration of 10 hectares of land which has unearthed multiple cist burials containing human and canine remains that date to late in the Comala phase of development, 400-600 A.D. Near the cists, archaeologist Marco Zavaleta found three flat stones that were lifted to reveal the vertical well that is the entrance to the shaft tomb. The tunnel is almost five feet deep and leads to a tomb lined with a solid layer of tepetate, a kind of volcanic rock. It\u2019s the rock that dates the burial to earlier in Comala period, between 0 and 500 A.D.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shaman-and-pottery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29733\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shaman-and-pottery-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shaman-and-pottery-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shaman-and-pottery-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shaman-and-pottery-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"Shaman and pottery\" width=\"150\"/></a>Inside the tomb archaeologists found six ceramic pots of varying sizes and shapes and one gourd which were interred as offerings to the gods. The pots will be analyzed for any organic residue or remains, like food or seeds. Standing proudly upright in front of the tomb was the star of the group: a 19-inch shaman figurine. His elongated head is suggestive of intentional cranial deformation, a practice that has been confirmed in skeletal remains from this period. Archaeologist Marco Zavaleta believes the shaman was ritually \u201ckilled\u201d by being deliberately broken before placement in the tomb. That\u2019s why his weapon is incomplete and why his headdress is missing standard elements like a horn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shaman-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-29732\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shaman-det-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shaman-det-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shaman-det-198x300.jpg 198w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shaman-det-430x649.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shaman-det.jpg 1356w\" title=\"Shaman close up\" width=\"99\"/></a>Whoever he was protecting must have been part of the city\u2019s elite. Only the wealthy at the top of the social ladder had the power and money to commission these kinds of elaborate funerary structures, and they had the wherewithal to get people (and animals) to accompany them on their voyage to the afterlife. The skeletal remains of one or two adults were found on either side of the tomb vault, which is about six and a half feet in diameter. They\u2019ve been disturbed, indicating that they were removed from their previous location to make room for another burial. The main burial was found in a lower level of the excavation and is an adult male lying on his back.</p>\n<p>Outside the tomb the partial remains of dogs and children were found, and one infant appears to have been thrown down the well. Animal teeth found scattered inside the tomb may have been part of a necklace the infant was wearing when sacrificed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAn important piece of information in this particular case is the immense presence of children. They were all placed around the tomb. There are practically no adult individuals. We would have to analyse the relationship between the children, the shaman and the dogs, who are protecting and preparing (for burial) but why were these children placed here?\u201d [archaeologist Rosa Maria Flores] said.</p>\n<p>The number of children buried in the tomb was not clear, archaeologists said. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The discovery of the intact tomb has provided University of Colima computer students and teachers with the opportunity to survey the site and create a 3D virtual model of it. Using a computer, a game controller and specialized software that converts video images into photogrammetric data, the team has been able to create a virtual copy of the well, vaulted tomb and artifacts.</p>\n<p>This will be the first intact shaft tomb to have a virtual model, an invaluable educational resource that will allow people to follow the progress of the excavation and examine the tomb structure and distribution of archaeological finds. You can see a preview of the virtual tomb towards the end of this short Spanish-language video on the tomb discovery:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/K2oeJlrmrtk&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Shaman guarded shaft tomb in Mexico for 1500 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29728\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29728#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-29720\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29720\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Stolen Rembrandt found after 15 years\">Stolen Rembrandt found after 15 years</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, March 22nd, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Boy-with-a-Soap-Bubble-Rembrandt-e1395461521603.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-29721\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Boy-with-a-Soap-Bubble-Rembrandt-e1395461521603-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Boy-with-a-Soap-Bubble-Rembrandt-e1395461521603-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Boy-with-a-Soap-Bubble-Rembrandt-e1395461521603-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Boy-with-a-Soap-Bubble-Rembrandt-e1395461521603-430x647.jpg 430w\" title='\"Child with a Soap Bubble,\" attributed to Rembrandt, date unknown' width=\"200\"/></a>Rembrandt has the dubious distinction of being the most stolen old master, with 337 works of his listed on the <a href=\"http://www.artloss.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Art Loss Register</a>\u2018s database of stolen or lost art.

Burglars broke in through the municipal library adjoining the museum while a military parade of tanks and armoured vehicles rumbled by. The alarm went off, but by the time the police arrived, the thieves and <em>Child with a Soap Bubble</em> were gone. </p>\n<p>The date of the theft is almost poetic when you consider that the museum\u2019s extensive collection of art and antiquities was seeded primarily by confiscations from aristocrats during the French Revolution. It\u2019s a small town, but in 1790 Draguignan was made the prefecture (administrative capital) of the department of Var, so many of the goodies confiscated in the area were collected there, ultimately giving the modest town a very impressive museum. The Rembrandt painting was confiscated in 1794 from the Ch\u00e2teau de Valbelle, a medieval castle near the town of Tourves (40 miles west of Draguignan) that was used by the Revolutionary government as a hospital in 1792 and was sacked for its treasures a year later leaving it in ruins today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Curator-at-the-Draguignan-museum-points-to-where-painting-hung.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-29724\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Curator-at-the-Draguignan-museum-points-to-where-painting-hung-200x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Curator-at-the-Draguignan-museum-points-to-where-painting-hung-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Curator-at-the-Draguignan-museum-points-to-where-painting-hung-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Curator-at-the-Draguignan-museum-points-to-where-painting-hung-430x215.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Curator-at-the-Draguignan-museum-points-to-where-painting-hung.jpg 1200w\" title=\"R\u00e9gis Fabre, curator of the Draguignan museum, points to empty space where the painting used to be on the day after its theft, July 15th, 1999\" width=\"200\"/></a>After nearly 15 years with no leads, the Central Office for the Fight against Traffic in Cultural Goods (OCBC) in conjunction with the Nice police found the painting and made two arrests in just one day. On Monday, March 17th, they received a tip that a shady deal was scheduled to go down in a hotel the next day. On Tuesday, March 18th, they arrested two men, one in a building (presumably the hotel), the other in a car. One of them had the painting in his possession.</p>\n<p>The men are 46 and 53 years old.

The museum\u2019s current curator Jeanine Bussi\u00e8resa and her predecessor R\u00e9gis Fabre who was curator at the time of the theft examined the painting to confirm it was the one stolen and they found it in good condition.

Since the painting\u2019s disappearance in 1999, new technologies have developed to authenticate works.

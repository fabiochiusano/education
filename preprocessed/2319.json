His wide eyes are made of inlaid white and black stone. His arms are bent at the elbow, forearms extended and hands clenched in tight fists. He wears an armband above each elbow and bracelets on his wrists adorned with lion heads facing each other. In his right fist he holds the head of a spear; in his left a shaft of wheat. He wears a pectoral piece or necklace shaped like a crescent.</p>\n<p>The statue is almost five feet tall and intact from the waist to the top of his head, but the bottom half is missing. Archaeologists estimate that when legs were attached the complete statue was between 11 and 13 feet tall. He too was a guardian, positioned at the gateway leading to the upper citadel to the royal city, and must have been a highly impressive one at that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Kunulua-statue-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Colossal statue of Suppiluliuma, side\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18563\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Kunulua-statue-side-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Kunulua-statue-side-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Kunulua-statue-side-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Kunulua-statue-side-430x646.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Kunulua-statue-side.jpg 849w\" title=\"Colossal statue of Suppiluliuma, side\" width=\"200\"/></a>It\u2019s a long inscription on the back that identifies him as the king. A raised relief carved in Hieroglyphic Luwian, an Anatolian language used solely in royal seals and monumental inscriptions, extols the military campaigns and many accomplishments of King Suppiluliuma. We don\u2019t know exactly who he was, but he was named after two kings of the Hittite New Kingdom: Suppiluliuma I  (ca. 1344\u20131322 B.C.) who had revived the flagging kingdom with many military successes including wresting Syrian territories from the control of Akhenaten\u2019s weakened Egyptian empire, and Suppiluliuma II (ca. 1207\u20131178 B.C.), the last known king of the Hittite New Kingdom who defeated Cyprus in the first recorded naval battle in history.</p>\n<p>Experts believe this Suppiluliuma fought against the powerful Neo-Assyrian king Shalmaneser III as part of a coalition of Syro-Hittite states in 858 B.C. Shalmaneser\u2019s father Ashurnasirpal II had conquered Kunulua in the 870s B.C. without encountering any resistance whatsoever. Kunulua King Lubarna caved before the first spear was thrown, handing over huge quantities of silver, gold, tin, iron, oxen, sheep, a large female monkey, linen, furniture, female hostages including the king\u2019s own niece, plus numerous infantry and cavalry troops. Suppiluliuma\u2019s victory 15 years or so later was an important vindication for the humiliated state.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/carved-column-base.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Carved column base\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18571\" height=\"231\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/carved-column-base-e1343797116271-200x231.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/carved-column-base-e1343797116271-200x231.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/carved-column-base-e1343797116271-129x150.jpg 129w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/carved-column-base-e1343797116271-430x497.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/carved-column-base-e1343797116271.jpg 577w\" title=\"Carved column base\" width=\"200\"/></a>In the same location, archaeologists found a second sculpture lying on its side next to the colossal statue. This one is a semi-circular column base about three feet tall and nearly three feet in diameter. There\u2019s a winged bull figure carved on the curved side with a sphinx to its left. The flat side is bare, because it was probably originally meant to be placed against a wall.</p>\n<p>Both sculptures appear to have been ritually buried under the central passageway of the citadel gate, as was the lion found last year. The Neo-Assyrians conquered the area in 738 B.C., destroying the monumental gateway of the citadel. They buried the statues and then paved them over, turning the one-time royal citadel into a sacred precinct and its gateway into a courtyard.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Colossal statue of Neo-Hittite warrior king found\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18554\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18554#comments\">12 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-18537\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18537\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Tomb of Mayan prince found in Mexico\">Tomb of Mayan prince found in Mexico</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, July 30th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Uxul-palace-complex-building.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"K2 palace complex building in Uxul, ca. 650 A.D.\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18547\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Uxul-palace-complex-building-200x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Uxul-palace-complex-building-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Uxul-palace-complex-building-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Uxul-palace-complex-building-430x215.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Uxul-palace-complex-building.jpg 800w\" title=\"K2 palace complex building in Uxul, ca. 650 A.D.\" width=\"200\"/></a>University of Bonn archaeologists have <a href=\"http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=122821&amp;CultureCode=en\" target=\"_blank\">discovered the untouched tomb of a local prince</a> in the royal palace complex at Uxul, a Maya site in the Mexican jungle near the border with Guatemala. Most of the 11 known buildings in the complex have been prey to looters looking for valuable ceramics and jewelry. Although there was a looting tunnel leading to this building (called K2) as well, the grave was discovered five feet under the floor and was untouched. It\u2019s the first intact grave the team has discovered in four excavation seasons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tomb-with-skeletons-vessels.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Tomb with skeleton, vessels and plates\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18546\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tomb-with-skeletons-vessels-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tomb-with-skeletons-vessels-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tomb-with-skeletons-vessels-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tomb-with-skeletons-vessels-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/tomb-with-skeletons-vessels.jpg 800w\" title=\"Tomb with skeleton, vessels and plates\" width=\"200\"/></a>The tomb is a single chamber with brick walls and a corbel vault. Inside archaeologists found the skeleton of a young man lying on his back with his arms folded over his stomach, five ceramic cups and four ceramic plates, some of them elaborately decorated with paintings and reliefs. One of the plates decorated in Mayan Codex-Style (a black outline drawing that uses the Mayan hieroglyphics seen in their surviving pre-Columbian books) was found on the young man\u2019s skull. He was probably about 20-25 years old when he died, and one of the cups has an inscription bearing a date of 711 A.D. which is likely to be the year of his death, or at least near to it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Maya-prince-cup-from-Uxul.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Maya prince cup from Uxul\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18548\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Maya-prince-cup-from-Uxul-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Maya-prince-cup-from-Uxul-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Maya-prince-cup-from-Uxul-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Maya-prince-cup-from-Uxul-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Maya prince cup from Uxul\" width=\"200\"/></a>That vessel also bears an inscription labeling it as \u201cthe drinking vessel of the young man/prince.\u201d Since he was found in the largest building yet discovered in Uxul\u2019s royal palace complex, archaeologists feel secure in pronouncing him the latter since a non-royal \u201cyoung man\u201d would not get such prime funerary real estate. The absence of jade jewelry marks him as a minor prince, not directly in line for the throne.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Scientists believe that Uxul, originally a smaller independent kingdom, was inhabited and ruled from time to time by the leaders of the ruling Kaan Dynasty in Calakmul. But the influence subsided after 705 AD, and there is a strong likelihood that a local ruling family came to power for a few generations. At the start of the 9th century, Uxul was almost completely deserted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Uxul palace complex was completed around 650 A.D. when the Kaan (Kaaaaaan!) dynasty had been in control for two decades. Relief panels found last year in the same building where the grave was discovered depict four of the Kaan kings playing the ballgame. The local royal family that took over after the Calakmul dynasty lost power probably still had some dynastic links to the previous rulers.</p>\n<p>The city of Uxul was an important trade hub between the two major Mayan urban centers of El Mirador to the south and Calakmul to the northeast. It had trade links south into Guatemala and north to the Central Mexican Plateau, hence its appeal to its powerful neighbor.</p>\n<p>Located deep in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Uxul is difficult to reach. The sole access is 75 miles of jungle paths, and archaeologists can only dig for two to three months during the dry season. Undaunted, the archaeological team hopes to find more unlooted graves in the K2 palace building that will provide valuable information about the shifting power dynamics of the late Calakmul period.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Tomb of Mayan prince found in Mexico\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18537\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18537#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-18518\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18518\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Roman timber roof in Herculaneum put back together\">Roman timber roof in Herculaneum put back together</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, July 29th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/roof-excavation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Timber and tile roof excavated in Herculaneum\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18528\" height=\"266\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/roof-excavation-200x266.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/roof-excavation-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/roof-excavation-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/roof-excavation-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/roof-excavation.jpg 1594w\" title=\"Timber and tile roof excavated in Herculaneum\" width=\"200\"/></a>In 2010, workers from the <a href=\"http://www.herculaneum.org/hcp-home/eng/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Herculaneum Conservation Project</a> were struggling as they so often do with drainage issues. The crux of the issue is that water in the modern city flows down to what used to be the beach, only Vesuvius saw to it that the shore was pushed hundreds of feet into the sea; so the area of the ancient city that used to be prime beach real estate is constantly and dangerously waterlogged.</p>\n<p>They decided to install some new drainage pipes on the site. Since they\u2019d have to jackhammer their way through at least three feet of hard volcanic rock in order to lay the new pipe, the archaeologists did an initial survey to be sure nothing ancient and man-made would be damaged. They didn\u2019t expect to find anything \u2014 the Roman beach had been thoroughly excavated in the 1980s \u2014 but in a section that hadn\u2019t been explored, they not only found something: they found an entire ancient Roman wooden and tile roof.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/decorated-roof-tile.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Decorated ceiling tile\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18531\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 147px) 100vw, 147px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/decorated-roof-tile-147x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/decorated-roof-tile-147x150.jpg 147w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/decorated-roof-tile-200x203.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/decorated-roof-tile-430x436.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/decorated-roof-tile.jpg 587w\" title=\"Decorated ceiling tile\" width=\"147\"/></a>Preserved by the volcanic rock on one side and the black sand of the beach on the other were massive wooden beams as much as 23 feet long, smaller joists and rafters, decorative panels and terracotta tiles. The tiles were underneath the timbers. They would originally have been the top layer of the roof, which means that the entire structure was ripped off the house, flipped upside down and deposited on the beach by the force of the pyroclastic surge. Unlike many of the other preserved organic materials found in Herculaneum, the timbers were not carbonized. They were smashed into wet sand, then kept safe by subsequent pyroclastic flows that hardened into layers of air-tight rock.</p>\n<p>The wood roof was in such exceptional condition that carpentry marks and joints were clearly visible. They bore glorious testament to Roman carpentry, because even with all those massive timbers and rafters, there isn\u2019t a single nail in the entire structure. There were a few cramp irons employed, but other than that, the structure was supported with joinery, trusses and its own pitch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/House-of-the-Relief-of-Telephus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"House of the Telephus Relief\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18527\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/House-of-the-Relief-of-Telephus-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/House-of-the-Relief-of-Telephus-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/House-of-the-Relief-of-Telephus-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/House-of-the-Relief-of-Telephus-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/House-of-the-Relief-of-Telephus.jpg 1600w\" title=\"House of the Telephus Relief\" width=\"150\"/></a>Archaeologists calculated from its location that the roof must have once topped the <a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/101144288944988019203/HerculaneumConservationProject?gsessionid=TEP2KeW579T3s7DxkkCKjA#5562059071085114226\" target=\"_blank\">Marble Room</a> in the House of the Telephus Relief, one of the largest and richest houses in Herculaneum, probably owned by Marcus Nonius Balbus, praetor, proconsul and patron of the city. Statues and inscriptions dedicated to him litter the entire town, and the house has a private entrance to the baths, donated by Balbus to the city. The house got its name because a marble relief was found in the living room depicting Telephus, the king of Mysia and the son of Hercules who was wounded by Achilles in battle. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Telephus-relief.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Telephus relief\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18525\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Telephus-relief-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Telephus-relief-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Telephus-relief-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Telephus-relief-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Telephus relief\" width=\"150\"/></a>The relief shows Achilles with his mother Tethis on the left, and on the right Achilles scraping the spear that hurt Telephus into the wound in order to heal it, as per the advice of the Delphic Oracle.</p>\n<p>Once the wood parts and tiles were fully excavated last year, archaeologists had 250 pieces to work with, so they decided to do something that hasn\u2019t been done before: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/23/house-telephus-relief-roman\" target=\"_blank\">puzzle together an entire original Roman timber and tile roof</a>. They were able to put tab A into slot B, determining the angle of the pitch from the joinery alone.</p>\n<p>Woodwork panels that once decorated the ceiling also survived, some of them with traces of their original paint and gold leaf. They can tell that it was immensely colorful, even garish by today\u2019s standards. The team is currently working on piecing together the ceiling pattern, which they think matched the colorful marble pattern of the floor.</p>\n<p>The ceiling panels and roof are being kept in a refrigerated container for their preservation. The Herculaneum Conservation Project plans to send the roof to the British Museum for its massive Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibit in March of 2013. The idea is to put the whole thing together inside the exhibit gallery, but transportation of such delicate ancient organic artifacts is tricky, so we\u2019ll see. If all goes as planned, the roof will make its public debut very far from home in London.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Roman timber roof in Herculaneum put back together\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18518\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18518#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-18499\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18499\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Modernism, the child, and a killer scooter\">Modernism, the child, and a killer scooter</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, July 28th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>The Museum of Modern Art in New York City has a new exhibit opening Sunday dedicated to the development of design for children in the 20th century. <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1239\" target=\"_blank\">Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900\u20132000</a> covers everything from furniture to clothes to toys to the suburban Chicago <a href=\"http://www.thefranklloydwrighttour.com/apps/blog/show/6992444-avery-coonley-playhouse-frank-lloyd-wright-1912\" target=\"_blank\">playhouse Frank Lloyd Wright designed</a> as a kindergarten for the daughter of Avery and Queene Ferry Coonley in 1912. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Coonley_Playhouse_1915.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18506\" height=\"140\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Coonley_Playhouse_1915-200x140.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Coonley_Playhouse_1915-200x140.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Coonley_Playhouse_1915-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Coonley_Playhouse_1915-430x301.jpg 430w\" title=\"Coonley Playhouse, 1915\" width=\"200\"/></a>The first chapter of the exhibit catalogue is <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/docs/explore/cotc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">available for free download (pdf)</a> and it makes for fascinating reading. I didn\u2019t realize how much of modernist design was inspired by progressive thought about childhood and children\u2019s education. For instance, that playhouse Wright built for the Coonleys is packed with references to the ideas of <a href=\"http://www.friedrichfroebel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Friedrich Froebel</a>, who invented the whole concept of kindergarten in 1837. Froebel believed that play was how children learned about their environment and how things relate to each other. Toys, therefore, weren\u2019t just something to bust out at recess but were integral to childhood development, hence his \u201cgifts,\u201d toys given to children at various stages starting with <a href=\"http://www.ozpod.com/150/play/ball.html\" target=\"_blank\">colored balls on strings</a>, through to <a href=\"http://www.ozpod.com/150/play/second.html\" target=\"_blank\">shapes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ozpod.com/150/play/cube.html\" target=\"_blank\">cubes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ozpod.com/150/play/fj4.html\" target=\"_blank\">building blocks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ozpod.com/150/play/fgfive.html\" target=\"_blank\">beauty forms</a>, blocks arranged to form increasingly complex geometric patterns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Alma-Buscher-nursery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18501\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Alma-Buscher-nursery-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Alma-Buscher-nursery-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Alma-Buscher-nursery-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Alma-Buscher-nursery-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Alma-Buscher-nursery.jpg 480w\" title=\"Haus am Horn nursery, designed by Alma Buscher, 1923\" width=\"112\"/></a>The avant-garde art movements of the 1920s and 30s also took inspiration from and contributed new visions of childhood. Alma Buscher of the Bauhaus school designed colorful geometric toys and furniture that were entirely different in concept and execution from the miniature adult chairs and tables that characterized earlier childhood environments. The furniture she made for the nursery at the Haus am Horn, a house designed and decorated for the Weimar Bauhaus exhibition in 1923, is something you\u2019ll still find in children\u2019s rooms and classrooms. Her large and colorful building blocks were instant Bauhaus top sellers and remain so to this day.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s one particular item designed in 1933 that caught my eye and captured my heart. It\u2019s the Skippy-Racer scooter, designed by John Rideout and Harold Van Doren for the American National Company in Toledo, Ohio.

Anita Garibaldi, great-granddaughter of Giuseppe, announced the news at a press conference accompanied by Silvano Vinceti, who has made a less than savory career out of digging up the would-be remains of famous Italians like <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/6414\" target=\"_blank\">Caravaggio</a> and <a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/history/mona-lisa-skeleton-120718.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa Gherardini</a>, the model for Mona Lisa.

On his deathbed, he asked that his body be cremated in a simple ceremony in a spot where he once collected fragrant-burning wood. According to Anita, in his will he expressed a desire that his ashes be left for the people of Italy to pick up and disperse all over the country he helped stitch together with his military genius and unflinching dedication to human rights and civil liberties. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bust-of-Garibaldi-June-24-1882.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18493\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bust-of-Garibaldi-June-24-1882-150x96.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bust-of-Garibaldi-June-24-1882-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bust-of-Garibaldi-June-24-1882-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bust-of-Garibaldi-June-24-1882-430x277.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bust-of-Garibaldi-June-24-1882.jpg 1046w\" title=\"Bust of Garibaldi installed on the Capitoline; print published in Illustrated London News June 24, 1882\" width=\"150\"/></a>For many politicians, including Garibaldi\u2019s friend and prominent unification figure in his own right Francesco Crispi, that was far too modest a fate for an Italian hero of Garibaldi\u2019s stature. The government requested that his body be embalmed, probably so it could be transferred in full pomp to the Pantheon or one of the other monuments of nationalist symbolism in Rome. That transfer never happened \u2014 at the end of June a bust of Garibaldi was installed on the Capitoline, right next to the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, with much ceremony \u2014 but the embalming did. Garibaldi\u2019s body was encased in a granite tomb in a small cemetery on his property on Caprera. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/museo_garibaldino_di_caprera-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18475\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/museo_garibaldino_di_caprera-tomb-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/museo_garibaldino_di_caprera-tomb-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/museo_garibaldino_di_caprera-tomb-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/museo_garibaldino_di_caprera-tomb-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Garibaldi tomb, side view\" width=\"150\"/></a>It didn\u2019t go smoothly, though. They had trouble putting the lid on the tomb and it apparently took five attempts before it was finally sealed. That\u2019s where the questions arose about whether Garibaldi\u2019s body was still inside by the time they shut the thing. After exhumation, the DNA of the remains will be compared to that of his direct descendant, Claudio Garibaldi. If it turns out to be someone else buried in that tomb, Anita wants that to be broadcast far and wide so tourists won\u2019t keep getting bamboozled like they have been for the past 130 years or so.</p>\n<p>Should the body prove to be that of the general, the next controversy will be whether to rebury it in the granite tomb, or to comply with Garibaldi\u2019s final wishes. The descendants and Vinceti plan to poll Italians to see what they think should be done. Apparently Anita has been getting death threats over the exhumation, so at least some Italians have expressed their opinion already. The final decision on the disposition of remains in theory belongs with the family, but who knows how this will play out.</p>\n<p>I discovered something rather marvelous about Giuseppe Garibaldi earlier this year. In July of 1861, just four months after the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy and three months after the opening of hostilities at Fort Sumter, Lincoln, through Secretary of State William H. Seward, offered Garibaldi a commission as Major General in the Union Army. <a href=\"http://www.americanheritage.com/content/garibaldi-and-lincoln?page=show\" target=\"_blank\">According to this long and fascinating article</a> on the subject, Seward instructed the Minister to Belgium, Henry Shelton Sanford (founder of the town of Sanford, Florida, which has recently made the ugliest of news due to the killing of Trayvon Martin), to approach Garibaldi with the offer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I wish you to proceed at once and enter into communication with the distinguished Soldier of Freedom. Say to him that this government believes his services in its present contest for the unity and liberty of the American People, would be exceedingly useful, and that, therefore, they are earnestly desired and invited. Tell him that this government believes he will, if possible, accept this call, because it is too certain that the fall of the American Union, if indeed it were possible, would be a disastrous blow to the cause of Human Freedom equally here, in Europe, and throughout the world. Tell him that he will receive a Major-General\u2019s commission in the army of the United States, with its appointments, with the hearty welcome of the American People. Tell him that we have abundant resources, and numbers unlimited at our command, and a nation resolved to remain united and free.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a little pas de deux with King Victor Emmanuel, who was only too happy to extend Garibaldi his permission to go fight the Civil War so he wouldn\u2019t be stirring up trouble at home with his advocating for democracy and universal suffrage, Garibaldi pitched his counteroffer to Sanford. Sanford reported it to Seward:</p>\n<blockquote><p>He said that the only way in which he could render real service, as he ardently desired to do, to the cause of the United States, was as Commander-in-Chief of its forces; that he would only go as such and with the additional contingent power\u2014to be governed by events\u2014of declaring the abolition of slavery. He would be of little use, he said, without the first and, without the second, the war would appear to be like any civil war in which the world at large could have little interest or sympathy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lincoln was not willing to emancipate the slaves so early in the war, nor even to declare it the ultimate aim of the conflict, so that was the end of that. What a marvel of counterfactual history to contemplate, though: Giuseppe Garibaldi, the man who unified a country splintered for 2000 years with 1000 redshirted volunteers, leading the Union Army from the beginning instead of the miserable lineup of incompetents who followed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/reviewofgarabaldibrigadesJuly41861.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18492\" height=\"295\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/reviewofgarabaldibrigadesJuly41861-430x295.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/reviewofgarabaldibrigadesJuly41861-430x295.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/reviewofgarabaldibrigadesJuly41861-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/reviewofgarabaldibrigadesJuly41861-200x137.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/reviewofgarabaldibrigadesJuly41861.jpg 1281w\" title=\"Lincoln and General Winfield Scott review the 39th New York Infantry Regiment, aka the Garibaldi Guards, with their Garibaldi-inspired red flannel shirts and woodcock feather hats\" width=\"430\"/></a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Giuseppe Garibaldi\u2019s body to be exhumed\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18473\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18473#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-18456\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18456\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to First Dynasty solar boat found outside Cairo\">First Dynasty solar boat found outside Cairo</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, July 26th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18466\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-430x647.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat.jpg 680w\" title=\"First Dynasty solar boat discovered at Abu Rawash\" width=\"99\"/></a>A team from the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology excavating the ancient site of Abu Rawash 15 miles northwest of Cairo has <a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/generalnews/news/5000-year-old-pharaonic-solar-boat-discovered/36999/\" target=\"_blank\">unearthed the remains of a solar boat</a> dating to the reign of the First Dynasty pharaoh Den (ca. 2975\u20132935 B.C.). The boat is nearly intact, composed of 11 planks of local wood 20 feet long and five feet wide. The wood is in good condition, thanks to the preservation power of the dry desert environment.</p>\n<p>Pharaoh Den was not actually buried at Abu Rawash. His tomb is in the royal necropolis of Early Dynastic kings at Abydos in Upper Egypt. His seal has been discovered at Abu Rawash, however, which may be how archaeologists were able to date the solar boat to his reign. Abu Rawash is best known as the site of the ruined pyramid of the pharaoh Djedefre, son of and successor to Khufu, builder of the great pyramid at Giza. Djedefre was a king of the Fourth Dynasty who reigned from about 2566 to 2558 B.C., 400 years after Den.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Djedefre-Boat-Pit.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18462\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Djedefre-Boat-Pit-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Djedefre-Boat-Pit-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Djedefre-Boat-Pit-200x252.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Djedefre-Boat-Pit-430x543.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Djedefre-Boat-Pit.jpg 646w\" title=\"Solar boat pit of Pharaoh Djedefre at Abu Rawash\" width=\"118\"/></a>His pyramid complex at Abu Rawash actually includes a solar boat pit, a ditch 115 feet long cut out of the living limestone next to the pyramid, which was intended to hold his solar boat. No boat was found within. Instead, archaeologists recovered thousands of fragments of statues from the pit, which when put together turned out to be sculpted heads of Djedefre, now <a href=\"http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/head-sphinx-king-djedefre\" target=\"_blank\">in the Louvre</a>.</p>\n<p>Although none of the articles I\u2019ve found explicitly state this, I think the boat was probably found in the protodynastic cemetery on a rocky outcropping above the Abu Rawash pyramid site. Called \u201cM\u201d after archaeologist Pierre Montet who first discovered it in 1913, the necropolis contains 25 mid-First Dynasty tombs made out of mud bricks. These tombs belonged to elite members of early Old Kingdom society and have been a rich source of information about the development of monumental pharaonic funerary architecture, artifacts and practices in Lower Egypt. Finding a virtually intact solar boat is therefore extremely significant.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Giza-solar-boat.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18464\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Giza-solar-boat-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Giza-solar-boat-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Giza-solar-boat-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Giza-solar-boat-430x646.jpg 430w\" title=\"Khufu's solar boat at Giza\" width=\"99\"/></a>Solar boats were ritual vessels that were buried near kings to carry their souls to the heavens where their father, the sun god Ra, awaited them. Ra traveled on two boats during the course of his daily duties, the morning boat that carried him across the heavens during the day, and the evening boat that carried him through the underworld at night. There is some debate among Egyptologists as to whether the solar boats were used to carry the pharaoh\u2019s body over water during the funerary procession or whether they were made just to be buried for the pharaoh\u2019s posthumous use. The most glamorous of solar ships, Pharaoh Khufu\u2019s 140-feet-long and 20-feet-wide cedar yacht discovered in a pit at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza in 1954, shows some signs of having been in contact with water, but cedar shavings found in the pit suggest that it was built on site.</p>\n<p>The Abu Rawash boat has been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for conservation. Once it\u2019s in stable condition, it will go on display at the National Museum for Egyptian Civilization which is still under construction. The solar boat is expected to be ready for public display sometime next year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18465\" height=\"283\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-2-430x283.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-2-430x283.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-2-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-2-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Abu-Rawash-solar-boat-2.jpg 950w\" title=\"First Dynasty solar boat at Abu Rawash\" width=\"430\"/></a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"First Dynasty solar boat found outside Cairo\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18456\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18456#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-18435\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/18435\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Medieval Laws of Hywel Dda on display in Wales\">Medieval Laws of Hywel Dda on display in Wales</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, July 25th, 2012</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>In a delightful change of pace from the way these stories usually go, a rare 14th century Welsh manuscript of enormous historical import was sold at auction earlier this month and purchased not by an anonymous private collector, but by a public institution in its country of origin <a href=\"http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=1514&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4974&amp;cHash=c3a6fc497f2685f7388dfd884a20d487\" target=\"_blank\">where it is now on display for all to see</a>. The manuscript is a pocket-sized bound volume of the Laws of Hywel Dda, a 10th century compendium of laws codified by Welsh King Hywel Dda, a.k.a. Hywel the Good, and it was purchased by the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth for $840,000 at a <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/western-manuscripts-miniatures/lot.23.html?sort=lotnum\" target=\"_blank\">Sotheby\u2019s auction in London</a> on July 10th.

The language itself is also extremely rare. There are only 80 manuscripts written in medieval Welsh known to survive. It\u2019s been nearly a century since a medieval Welsh language manuscript was offered for public sale, and this one is the earliest ever sold. </p>\n<p>Experts believe the manuscript was written by a professional scribe for an itinerant lawyer to carry with him and use in his practice. There are handwritten notes indicating the books\u2019 practical use as a reference and living document. Somehow, from 14th century Wales, the manuscript wound up in the hands of the Massachusetts Historical Society of Boston. Researchers have an idea of its winding path, but no explicit evidence.</p>\n<p>The first appearance of the manuscript in the historical record is a reference by antiquarian Edward Llwyd in his 1707 book <em>Archaeologia Britannica</em>. He says the manuscript was discovered in Brecon, South Wales, in the library of town official and barrister William Phillips. William Wotton, the first editor and translator of Welsh laws, used it as a source for his work in 1721. That same year, Phillips died, leaving his library to his daughter Anne and her husband William Scourfield of New Moat, Pembrokeshire. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18447\" height=\"138\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-2-200x138.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-2-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-2-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-2-430x297.jpg 430w\" title='Another page from \"Boston\" manuscript of Laws of Hywel Dda' width=\"200\"/></a>A Morris Scourfield from Narbeth, Pembrokeshire, just eight miles from New Moat, was one of the first people to buy land in the Pennsylvania Welsh community. The last name is rare and his point of origin strongly suggests that Morris was a descendant of William. He or one of his relations most likely brought the manuscript of the Laws of Hywel Dda with them to America in the second half of the 18th century. The Massachusetts Historical Society thinks they received it as a gift in the 19th century, but they don\u2019t have a complete record on the donation.</p>\n<p>The Laws were Wales\u2019 first codified uniform legal system. Many of them focus on restorative principles, establishing monetary values for everything from property to household pets to body parts so that any damage or theft would be resolved by payment. Some of them are somewhat progressive in their approach towards women\u2019s rights, in marked contrast to contemporary laws in Anglo-Saxon and Norman England. For instance, the dowry was the amount of a married couple\u2019s communal property which would belong only to the wife should the couple break up before seven years. The amount was determined solely by her social status. Should they break up after seven years, she was entitled to half of their communal property. Women could own, buy and sell property. Women could not be forced to remain in a marriage they wished to leave.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, women were not allowed to be enlisted as witnesses for or against a man, and they could be legally beaten by their husbands for three reasons: 1) for giving away something that they did not exclusively own, 2) for being caught in adulterous embraces, 3) for wishing a blemish on her husband\u2019s beard. Beards were a big thing with them. They come up repeatedly.</p>\n<p>This unique and fascinating legal system is a key element in Welsh identity, culture and history. Before Hywel\u2019s time, Wales was divided and ruled by a number of kings at a time. Hywel ruled almost the entirety of Wales excepting solely the southeastern regions of Morgannwg and Gwent. His laws were an important unifying factor bringing the country under a single set of administrative rules. When King Edward I of England conquered Wales in 1283, he attempted to eradicate most native legal practices to make the Welsh subject to English law. That this manuscript was commissioned and put to active use 70 years later shows that the Welsh still practiced their way, Longshanks and his heirs be damned.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Peniarth-manuscript-Latin-version-of-Laws-of-Hywel-Dda.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18451\" height=\"282\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Peniarth-manuscript-Latin-version-of-Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-200x282.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Peniarth-manuscript-Latin-version-of-Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-200x282.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Peniarth-manuscript-Latin-version-of-Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Peniarth-manuscript-Latin-version-of-Laws-of-Hywel-Dda-430x607.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Peniarth-manuscript-Latin-version-of-Laws-of-Hywel-Dda.jpg 750w\" title=\"Peniarth manuscript, Latin translation of Laws of Hywel Dda\" width=\"200\"/></a>You see why, therefore, it was of particular importance that this manuscript not wind up in some anonymous collection \u2014 especially a British one \u2014 never to be seen again. The National Library of Wales secured a grant of $723,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to buy the manuscript, and the rest of the money came from the library\u2019s own budget and the Welsh government.</p>\n<p>The Laws of Hywel Dda are on public view at the National Library of Wales\u2019 Hengwrt Room from July 23rd until August 31st. After that, the manuscript will be removed for study, conservation and digitization.

Their goal was to search the deep waters around the uninhabited island for fragments of Earhart\u2019s plane.</p>\n<p>Artifacts, like <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/17095\" target=\"_blank\">a jar that may have once contained a popular 1930s anti-freckle cream</a>, have been discovered on Nikumaroro before that could suggest the presence of a woman on the island before it was settled for a brief period starting in World War II. Also, a recent examination of a grainy picture of the western end of Nikumaroro taken by British Colonial Service officer Eric Bevington in October of 1937 noted a speck that could be nothing at all or it could be a chunk of Lockheed Installation 40650, a landing gear assembly used on the Lockheed Electra Model 10E.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Bevington-October-1937.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18430\" height=\"164\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Bevington-October-1937-200x164.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Bevington-October-1937-200x164.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Bevington-October-1937-150x123.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Bevington-October-1937-430x352.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Bevington-October-1937.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Bevington's October 1937 picture of Nikumaroro with speck of possibilities circled\" width=\"200\"/></a>TIGHAR raised $2.2 million from big ticket sponsors like Lockheed Martin, FedEx and the Discovery Channel (who sent a film crew to document the search for a special that will air on the Discovery Channel August 19th) and from many small donors to fund a deep sea search of the reef slopes of west Nikumaroro. They contracted deep ocean search and recovery specialists Phoenix International to conduct the difficult underwater searches, and the State Department helped facilitate an Antiquities Management Agreement granting TIGHAR an exclusive license to search and recover anything pertaining to the Earhart disappearance within the boundaries of the Republic of Kiribati.</p>\n<p>The expedition was supposed to spend 10 days searching the mile-deep waters around Nikumaroro, but the technology they brought to accomplish the feat \u2014 including remote operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles and multi-beam sonar \u2014 malfunctioned, and the precipitous vertical cliffs full of nooks and crannies that characterize the underwater environment to be explored proved even more of a challenge than expected. After five days, they decided to cut their losses and head back to Hawaii carrying a boat full of sonar data and high definition video but nary a single fragment of a Lockheed Electra Model 10E. The <a href=\"http://tighar.org/Projects/Earhart/Niku7/niku7dailies3.html#n719\" target=\"_blank\">daily report from July 19th</a> describes the team\u2019s plight:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After discussion and analysis of the results so far, they have decided that there is very little point in extending the trip. The problem is the nature of the reef slope: a vertical cliff from 110 feet down to 250 feet, with a shelf that runs along that contour from Nessie to Norwich City. [Nessie is the name they gave to a certain location on Nikumaroro\u2019s reef. The SS <em>Norwich City</em> is a British steamer which ran aground on the reef in 1929.] The airplane could have come to rest there briefly and lost pieces, but they have not found anything at all on that ledge.</p>\n<p>From there the cliff goes almost vertically down to 1,000 \u2013 1,200 feet, with another ledge. They will spend the rest of today searching that area. That is where the Norwich City wreckage came to rest, so maybe that\u2019s where the airplane stopped.</p>\n<p>But the question of searching for an airplane in this environment is even more basic than \u201cwhat ledge\u201d or \u201chow far down.\u201d Given what we now know about this place, is it reasonable to think that an airplane which sank here 75 years ago is findable? The environment is incredibly difficult, with nooks and crannies and caves and projections; it would be easy to go over and over and over the same territory for weeks and still not really cover it all. The aircraft could have floated away, as well.</p>\n<p>So for the time they have left, they will focus on the ledges. Nothing could stick to the cliff walls, they are far too steep for anything to stick; and besides, if you get something (like a tether) caught, you can cause an avalanche (they did) and lose your ROV (they almost did).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once the research vessel gets back to Hawaii, TIGHAR will go through the masses of data they\u2019ve assembled. There\u2019s still a chance they might find something pertinent somewhere in the sonar and video information even if they haven\u2019t found the smoking Lockheed gun they were hoping to find. Keep your eye on the <a href=\"http://tighar.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TIGHAR website</a> for future announcements about the collected data, and tune to the Discovery Channel August 19th for the documentary.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/earhart-google-doodle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18432\" height=\"72\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/earhart-google-doodle-150x72.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/earhart-google-doodle-150x72.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/earhart-google-doodle-200x96.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/earhart-google-doodle.jpg 429w\" title=\"Amelia Earhart Google Doodle\" width=\"150\"/></a>To close on less of a bummer note, Google celebrated Amelia\u2019s 115th birthday Tuesday with a neat Doodle and a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/amelia-earharts-115th-birthday\" target=\"_blank\">lovely tribute</a> written by Mark Roesler, the attorney for the Earhart estate.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even as an adventurous dreamer, Amelia still knew that making a lasting legacy involved an element of risk.

When they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others.\u201d The message she leaves behind is especially evident to me: start living your life. Start setting aside your fears. Start believing it is acceptable to fail, knowing if you did not fail, you did not try.

His speech related almost wholly to the greatness of the man whose clothes he was wearing. \u2026</p>\n<p>The great war bonnets and war clothing went to the three nephews. A dozen watches were among the gifts, three fine guns and an endless array of blankets. One of the three buffalo robes was given to Three Knives, or Professor Meany.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So presumably this shirt passed into the hands of one of Chief Joseph\u2019s nephews in 1905, but there is no record of it after that for another 90 years. Its prominent presence in national iconography notwithstanding, the shirt disappeared into the market and was purchased by a collector at an Indian relic show some time in the 1990s. Neither the seller nor buyer had any idea of who had worn this shirt and when. It was sold purely as an exquisite Native American craft in excellent condition. That collector then sold it to another collector who researched the piece thoroughly and was able to identify it as the shirt worn by Chief Joseph in the 1877 picture and the 1878 oil painting. Experts confirmed that it could not have been a later forgery based on the images. The crafts and materials simply cannot be duplicated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Nez-Perce-war-shirt-sold-at-Sothebys.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18400\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Nez-Perce-war-shirt-sold-at-Sothebys-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Nez-Perce-war-shirt-sold-at-Sothebys-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Nez-Perce-war-shirt-sold-at-Sothebys-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Nez-Perce-war-shirt-sold-at-Sothebys-430x282.jpg 430w\" title=\"Nez Perce war shirt attributed to Chief Joseph sold at Sotheby's in May\" width=\"150\"/></a>Pictorial evidence is the best evidence there is for the provenance of an object like this. Another war shirt attributed to Chief Joseph <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/american-indian-n08861/lot.86.html?sort=lotnum\" target=\"_blank\">sold at Sotheby\u2019s this May for $482,500</a> because even though there was an impressive paper trail and oral history linking the shirt step by step to Chief Joseph\u2019s cousin Peo-Peo-Tholekt who is said to have received it at the 1905 potlatch, there is no direct evidence that it was ever worn by the chief. One picture is worth a thousand words and $400,000, I suppose.</p>\n<p>The picture in question marks an incredibly sad period in Chief Joseph\u2019s life and in the miserably awful history of the United States\u2019 dealings with the Native Americans. </p>\n<p>In 1855, Joseph\u2019s father known as Chief Joseph the Elder and a council of other Nez Perce chiefs signed a treaty with the US establishing a 7.7 million acre reservation covering traditional tribal lands in Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Among them was the Wallowa Valley, the ancestral land of Joseph\u2019s tribe. In 1863, under pressure from settlers and gold rushers, some of the Nez Perce tribes signed a new treaty establishing a 780,000 acre reservation which did not include the Wallowa Valley. Joseph the Elder refused to sign, as did other chiefs, this creating a rift between the \u201ctreaty\u201d and \u201cnon-treaty\u201d Nez Perce peoples.</p>\n<p>On his deathbed in 1871, Chief Joseph the Elder told his son \u201cThis country holds your father\u2019s body. Never sell the bones of your father and your mother.\u201d Chief Joseph promised. He never fought the white settlers or the US government with weapons and bloodshed, but he struggled at council after council to ensure his people remained in the Wallowa Valley. Treaties were made that were of course broken whenever the US felt like it. Finally in 1877, Army General Oliver Howard gave Chief Joseph an ultimatum: move out of the valley to the Idaho reservation or we\u2019ll consider it an act of war.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Flight_of_the_Nez_Perce-1877-map.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18407\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Flight_of_the_Nez_Perce-1877-map-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Flight_of_the_Nez_Perce-1877-map-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Flight_of_the_Nez_Perce-1877-map-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Flight_of_the_Nez_Perce-1877-map-430x281.jpg 430w\" title=\"1877 Flight of the Nez Perce\" width=\"150\"/></a>Then began a massive flight. The Nez Perce, pursued by the US Army, first fled east hoping the Crow nation would allow them to settle on their lands. The Crow did not, so Chief Joseph\u2019s people moved north hoping to cross the border into Canada. They almost made it. Just 40 miles from the border near Snake Creek in the Bear Paw Mountains of Montana Territory, Chief Joseph and the US Army fought a five day battle. Freezing, starving, his warrior ranks decimated, Chief Joseph surrendered to General Howard. Chief Joseph\u2019s speech, ostensibly recorded as is but very possibly embellished by Lieutenant Charles Erskine Scott Wood, has gone down in history:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tell General Howard I know his heart. What he told me before, I have it in my heart. I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed; Looking Glass is dead, Too-hul-hul-sote is dead. The old men are all dead. It is the young men who say yes or no. He who led on the young men is dead. It is cold, and we have no blankets; the little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are\u2014perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children, and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired; my heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The 600 or so surviving Nez Perce were forced to march 400 miles to Fort Keogh, Montana Territory, where they arrived on October 13th, 1877. It was there that post photographer John F. Fouch took the first picture of Chief Joseph ever taken. He was wearing the war shirt as he sat for the picture. From the <a href=\"http://cdaartauction.com/2012/lot/17359\" target=\"_blank\">auction website</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-by-John-Fouch-1877.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18403\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-by-John-Fouch-1877-103x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-by-John-Fouch-1877-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-by-John-Fouch-1877-200x290.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-by-John-Fouch-1877-430x624.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-by-John-Fouch-1877.jpg 789w\" title=\"Chief Joseph, picture by John Fouch, October 1877\" width=\"103\"/></a>Joseph is seated in the photo and his hands appear frostbitten. Yet, his hair is pushed up in a proud warrior pompadour and he is dressed resplendent in his shirt. Examination of details in the photo leaves no question that the shirt in the Fouch photo is one and the same as the shirt here under discussion. Note and compare the varying lengths of quill wrappings on the hair locks under the neck flap, the short fringe cuts at the end of the sleeves, and the alignment of bead decoration on the neck flap, shoulder and sleeve strips. (Color values of the orthochromatic film used in the 1870\u2019s do not always appear as they do in the later panchromatic film.) Several of the red wool wrapped ermine skin fringes have been secured with pericardium and match up from photo to shirt, especially on Joseph\u2019s left shoulder. </p></blockquote>\n<p>After their stay in Fort Keogh, General William Tecumseh Sherman sent Joseph and 400 of his people to the prisoner of war camp in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. At Leavenworth, painter Cyrenius Hall made his portrait of Chief Joseph, again wearing the shirt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief_Joseph_Cyrenius-Hall-1878.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18405\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 127px) 100vw, 127px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief_Joseph_Cyrenius-Hall-1878-127x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief_Joseph_Cyrenius-Hall-1878-127x150.jpg 127w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief_Joseph_Cyrenius-Hall-1878-200x235.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief_Joseph_Cyrenius-Hall-1878-430x507.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief_Joseph_Cyrenius-Hall-1878.jpg 1356w\" title=\"Chief Joseph portrait by Cyrenius Hall, 1878\" width=\"127\"/></a>The Nez Perce were kept prisoner at Fort Leavenworth for eight months, then moved to Indian Territory in what is today Oklahoma. They lived there (in a manner of speaking; many died there) for seven years. During this time, Chief Joseph tirelessly fought for them to be allowed to return to their ancestral lands, personally pleading their case before presidents, politicians, intellectuals and in the press. <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-stamp-1968.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18402\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 95px) 100vw, 95px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-stamp-1968-e1343112489496-95x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-stamp-1968-e1343112489496-95x150.jpg 95w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-stamp-1968-e1343112489496-191x300.jpg 191w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-stamp-1968-e1343112489496-430x674.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chief-Joseph-stamp-1968-e1343112489496.jpg 472w\" title=\"1968 Chief Joseph stamp \" width=\"95\"/></a>Read his riveting account of the history of his people and the patronizing, stupid introduction to it in \u201c<a href=\"http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nora;cc=nora;idno=nora0128-4;node=nora0128-4%3A7;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=420;page=root;size=100\" target=\"_blank\">An Indian\u2019s Views of Indian Affairs</a>\u201d from the <em>North American Review</em> of April 1879.

This year, a team of divers, researchers and a documentary film crew returned to the <em>Mars</em> to explore it in depth during the first two weeks of July. They found <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.se/41982/20120712/\" target=\"_blank\">three silver coins from 1563</a>, the year before the <em>Mars</em> sank in a naval battle off the northern tip of the island of Oland in the Baltic Sea. The coins are Swedish silver dalers bearing the image of King Eric XIV (reigned 1560-1568) in the royal regalia and his motto \u201cDeus dat cui vult,\u201d meaning God gives to whom He wishes. </p>\n<p>The discovery of these particular coins is more evidence that the wreck is of the <em>Mars</em>, not just because the dating is so on point. The daler wasn\u2019t an internal Swedish trade currency. That was the mark, which went into a devaluation spiral during the Nordic Seven Years\u2019 War (1563\u201370), the war between Sweden-Finland and Denmark-L\u00fcbeck that the <em>Mars</em> was fighting in when it went down. The silver daler was an international coin minted in Sweden-Finland from 1534 until 1873. Much like the earlier and more widespread <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/14157\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish pieces of eight</a>, the daler retained its silver weight and purity and was thus accepted elsewhere in the world. As the story has it, Admiral Jakob Bagge had 200,000 silver dalers with him on the <em>Mars</em> to use hiring mercenaries. </p>\n<p>The diving team expects there are many more dalers on the wreck, but the cold, darkness and depth of the site make exploring it extremely time consuming. Professional divers have to carry a special mixture of gasses in their oxygen tanks to avoid the bends, and it still takes them about two hours to rise the 230 feet from the wreck on the sea floor to the surface. They can\u2019t stay down there for long, even in the peak of the summer, before it gets too cold to stand. </p>\n<p>Despite these strictures, researchers have been able to document the general map of the wreck site. Because of the dramatic way the <em>Mars</em> went down \u2014 according to contemporary eye-witness reports, the ship exploded, sending the main mast shooting straight up into the sky like an arrow \u2014 there are artifacts scattered as far as 500 feet from the central wreck. East of the wreck divers have spotted debris that could be the famous mast, but they haven\u2019t investigated it yet.</p>\n<p>Despite the explosion, the <em>Mars</em> is still intact in large parts. The massive wood boards still have visible cut marks left by the axes of the carpenters, and traces of white paint are visible in some places. The port hull is almost entirely intact; heavy cannons still stick out of rows of cannon ports. The starboard side has collapsed outwards, exposing the guts of the ship. Divers have swum into the stern and examined an area they think was the admiral\u2019s quarters. </p>\n<p>Some human skeletal remains have also been found. The <em>Mars</em> carried a crew of about 670 people, 350 sailors and the rest soldiers. Most of these were enlisted men rather than mercenaries.  </p>\n<p>There are cannons all over the sea floor. Documentary sources differ on how many cannons the <em>Mars</em> was equipped with, but the smallest number is 107, most of them muzzle-loading bronze cannons. The largest estimate puts the number at 173. Swedish naval artillery was key to their military strength. They had fewer troops, but their cast bronze cannons shot harder and farther than the Danish chamber-loaded iron cannons. The Danish fleet aimed to board, while the numerically inferior Swedes sought to avoid hand-to-hand combat and focus on distance artillery shelling.</p>\n<p>Under Admiral Bagge, these tactics were highly effective. In fact, they were effective on May 30th, 1564, when the battle of Oland began. The Swedish ships showered the Danish-L\u00fcbeckian navy with cannon fire. The Danish flagship <em>Fortuna</em> alone was hit by 167 projectiles. After the first day, the Danes decided that the next day, they had to board the <em>Mars</em> at all costs or the battle would be lost.</p>\n<p>Come the dawn of May 31st, most of the Swedish ships had dispersed, leaving the <em>Mars</em> with little support. Bagge went on the attack anyway \u2014 he was already a legend in his own time for his skill and courage \u2014 chasing the Danish fleet north with only the <em>Mars</em>, the <em>Elephant</em> and the <em>Swan</em>. It almost worked, but then the wind turned, giving some of the L\u00fcbeckian ships a chance to get close to the <em>Mars</em>. </p>\n<p>Initial boarding attempts were repulsed by the <em>Mars\u2019</em> artillery, but then the ship caught fire, either due to a cannon exploding or from bombs and grenades lobbed by the L\u00fcbeckians. In hand-to-hand combat, Bagge\u2019s troops were defeated by the superior numbers of the enemy and the fire on his ship. He and a hundred crew members surrendered and were transferred to a L\u00fcbeckian ship. Several hundred L\u00fcbeckians swarmed the <em>Mars</em> to plunder it. The fire was still raging, however, and while the boarders were looting, the powder kegs exploded. As many as 1000 men were left on board when the explosion took the <em>Mars</em> to the bottom of the sea.</p>\n<p>Admiral Bagge was kept prisoner in Copenhagen from 1564 to 1571. A year after the war was over, he was finally released and returned to Stockholm where he was given a title, an estate and a cushy job at the Royal Palace, a position he held until his death in 1577.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.deepsea.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Sea Productions</a> film crew is capturing 3D and high definition film of the site which will be released as a documentary in the near future.

The fledgling industry got a boost in 1978 when Jimmy Carter loosened federal restrictions on homebrewing, allowing a generation of hobbyists to pursue their passion for full-flavored beers as a profession. By the end of the \u201980s, the number of American breweries had jumped from under 100 to nearly 250, though microbrewers were still an infinitesimally small fraction of the market. Budweiser, which sold nearly 50 million barrels in 1988\u200a\u2014\u200aa high water mark\u200a\u2014\u200ahad little interest in the fringe beardos selling weird beer a barrel at a time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f47\" name=\"2f47\">By the mid-\u201990s, however, even Anheuser-Busch\u2019s most loyal distributors (the local, independent businesses that breweries are required by law to work with) were asking the company to add microbrews to its portfolio. Distributors were asking because retailers\u200a\u2014\u200asupermarkets, liquor stores, and bars across the country\u200a\u2014\u200awere asking.

Between 2014 and 2017, ABI went on a shopping spree, buying up eight more craft breweries: 10 Barrel, Elysian (Seattle, Washington), Golden Road (Los Angeles, California), Four Peaks (Tempe, Arizona), Breckenridge (Colorado), Devils Backbone (Roseland, Virginia), Karbach (Houston, Texas), and Wicked Weed (Asheville, North Carolina).

This so-called \u201ccraftwashing\u201d technique evokes a whole range of emotions in true-blue independent brewers. Plenty of sneering disdain\u200a\u2014\u200abut some genuine gloom, too.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a43b\" name=\"a43b\">\u201cWhen Anheuser-Busch [InBev] goes out of their way to hide the fact that these breweries had any association to the company that owns and runs them, it\u2019s just crummy,\u201d said Tom McCormick, the executive director of the California Craft Brewers Association. As a fixture in the Golden State\u2019s craft brewing community for three decades, he views macrobrewers\u2019 present interest in the category as \u201camazing\u201d proof positive that he and his fellow revolutionaries were onto something. \u201dBack in the eighties, we had no idea what [craft beer] would become. We were in it because we loved it,\u201d he said. Now, that labor of love is being overrun with companies that, in his estimation, \u201cdon\u2019t care about anything but the money.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a1b1\" name=\"a1b1\">\u201cIt sucks,\u201d agreed Dick Cantwell, who co-founded Elysian in 1995 and cast the sole vote against its sale to ABI. Nowadays, he\u2019s brewing again, this time at San Francisco\u2019s Magnolia Brewing Co. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit demoralizing to find that they have managed to kind of hit us where we live.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"31b5\" name=\"31b5\">But while it\u2019s created anguish and anger within the industry, average drinkers might not even care. And that\u2019s where ABI\u2019s timing appears to be acute. When Tim Schoen took his Pacific-Northwest reconnoiter in the \u201990s, craft beer was all \u201chopheads and hippies,\u201d said Schoen, who today is the founder and CEO of Brew Hub, a contract-brewing company based in Lakeland, Florida. Craft beer was a subculture, a niche back then. \u201cWell, fast forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lawyer, there\u2019s an accountant, there\u2019s a janitor drinking craft beer.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5e2\" name=\"f5e2\">That growing appeal with mainstream American drinkers proved to be a double-edged sword for craft brewers. It brought legitimacy, stature, and financial success for many of them. But it also brought a wave of drinkers more interested in good beer than the anti-corporate ideology from whence it came. On the way from cultural battle flag to mainstream beer category, craft beer became more popular, but less special\u200a\u2014\u200aand that made it vulnerable.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e73\" name=\"7e73\">After Wicked Weed\u2019s sale to ABI was announced in June 2017, nearly 50 craft breweries pulled out of the Asheville brewery\u2019s popular annual Funkitorium Invitational festival in protest, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/ab-inbev-buyout-has-forced-wicked-weed-cancel-its-annual-funky-beer-festival\" href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/ab-inbev-buyout-has-forced-wicked-weed-cancel-its-annual-funky-beer-festival\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">forcing the cancellation</a> of the event. Some in the craft beer community claimed a moral victory, but true victory in the battle against Big Beer was more elusive than ever. ABI now had a freer hand than ever to wield the weapons\u200a\u2014\u200ainnovative beers, colorful brewers, and local breweries\u200a\u2014\u200aonce used against it, to shore up its portfolio, neutralize its competitors, and, of course, sell more beer.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"2f59\" name=\"2f59\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Stage 2: Supercharge production</strong></h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"7e1b\" name=\"7e1b\">People in the beer business use the term \u201cliquid\u201d as a way of discussing the beer itself, separate from all the non-liquid stuff it takes to sell beer, like packaging, advertising, shipping, and so on. Like many independent brewers, ABI\u2019s acquired craft brands tend be pretty good at making \u201cliquid\u201d that drinkers want. But ABI is really good at the rest. \u201cThey make beer more efficiently than anybody in the world,\u201d Koch, who now serves as chairman of Boston Beer Company (Sam Adams\u2019 parent corporation), told me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2508\" name=\"2508\">After every acquisition, there was a settling out period, where a tiny brewing company adjusted to life under the banner of the beer world\u2019s biggest behemoth. The transitions were never seamless, but after the staff shakeouts, once the backlash had died down and the companies were sufficiently integrated, these ABI-backed craft breweries were in formidable positions. The could supercharge production of its craft brands to a degree that was previously unimaginable in the business.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"542b\" name=\"542b\">Even for large independent brewers, lining up additional capacity or introducing a new package can be fraught with logistical hurdles.

When Gill needs to brew more Wolf Pup than Golden Road has capacity for, she calls an ABI intermediary to coordinate a \u201ccross-brew\u201d at another of the company\u2019s facilities.

better margins, which mean lower prices. Golden Road\u2019s national sales (in both dollars and volume) grew by over 55 percent through December 2018, according to Chris Shepard\u2019s analysis of data from the market research firm IRI. Much of that growth, he said, is due to Golden Road using 15-packs for Wolf Pup and Mango Cart. This is a potential bellwether. If value packaging like 15-packs becomes the new normal in craft beer\u200a\u2014\u200aand by the looks of things, it will\u200a\u2014\u200aABI \u201ccan push craft beer pricing down and hurt a lot of people,\u201d said Mitaro from the Brewers Advisory Group. \u201cIn the end you\u2019re gonna be selling 15 cans for the price you were selling 12.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e5e\" name=\"3e5e\">And if you\u2019re not\u200a\u2014\u200aif you hold the line and sell 12 cans for the same price ABI is selling 15, said Sonia Marciano, a professor at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business who has studied ABI\u2019s business practices: \u201cWhat do you say to a customer? Why should they buy you?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"79fa\" name=\"79fa\">That is, if your beer even makes it to shelves in the first place. ABI\u2019s \u201cgo-to market\u201d machine is a marvel that gives it remarkable influence over how and where its brands are sold\u200a\u2014\u200aand whether other brewers\u2019 stuff is sold at all. \u201cIt just takes up space,\u201d said Matt Hartman, co-founder of independent craft distributor Remarkable Liquids, about ABI\u2019s craft expansion. That means the company can box out rivals from retail shelves, tap towers, even entire stadium concessions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6329\" name=\"6329\">As the linchpin between producers and retailers in the United States\u2019 peculiar post-Prohibition booze-selling system, distribution is as crucial to brewers\u2019 success as their beer\u200a\u2014\u200aif not more so. Beer distributors are supposed to be independent so no one supplier or retailer can control access to markets full of thirsty drinkers. But since 1980, the number of traditional beer distributors has decreased from over 4,500 to around 3,000, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.nbwa.org/sites/default/files/NBWA-Beer-Industry-Fast-Facts-2014.pdf\" href=\"https://www.nbwa.org/sites/default/files/NBWA-Beer-Industry-Fast-Facts-2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to the National Beer Wholesaler Association</a>. This benefits big brewers like ABI. The fewer access points to market there are, the more sway macrobrewers have over those that remain. That is, if they don\u2019t already own them outright. In his book, Noel reported that ABI has actually bought up 18 distributorships in states where it\u2019s legal to do so.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"785f\" name=\"785f\">And lo: ABI has \u201can absolute hammerlock on distribution,\u201d said the American Antitrust Institute\u2019s Moss. She testified before the U.S. Senate against ABI\u2019s $100 billion acquisition of SABMiller in 2015 (which was ultimately approved), so she knows\u200a\u2014\u200aand how well\u200a\u2014\u200athe company throws its weight around in the market when left unchecked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e971\" name=\"e971\">As the biggest supplier in the portfolio of virtually every distributor it works with, ABI is able to flex its muscle in lots of ways. As Anat Baron, producer and host of 2009\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Beer Wars </em>and a former executive at Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade, put it in a recent phone call, \u201cHe who controls access controls the game.\u201d</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"d91b\" name=\"d91b\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Stage 3: Win the propaganda war</strong></h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"b861\" name=\"b861\">In today\u2019s beer aisle, hearts and minds are as important as shelf space and tap handles. To truly win out, Big Beer has to do more than simply crush Small Beer. It has to convince the American drinking public that there\u2019s no difference between the two. This is where ABI has perhaps been most shrewd.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3b8e\" name=\"3b8e\">In 2016, the company <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines/2017/6/2/ratebeer-zx-ventures-acquisition-minority-stake-anheuser-busch-inbev\" href=\"https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines/2017/6/2/ratebeer-zx-ventures-acquisition-minority-stake-anheuser-busch-inbev\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">took a 49-percent stake</a> in RateBeer.com, a popular online beer-ranking forum, and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/news/northern-brewer-purchased-anheuser-busch-inbev/\" href=\"https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/news/northern-brewer-purchased-anheuser-busch-inbev/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">outright bought Northern Brewer</a>, a homebrewing e-commerce platform.

He\u2019s quick to point out that the site\u2019s editorial voice is contractually protected from the influence of its majority investor. And a small disclosure about the company\u2019s stake accompanies every story <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">October</em> publishes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6c2d\" name=\"6c2d\">Investments like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">October</em> give ABI a platform to promote its vision for a post-craft future\u200a\u2014\u200aa future that favors its brands\u2019 position in the market. In the coming age, \u201cbeer-positive, bring the industry together-type thinking\u201d will carry the day, said Meg Lagesse, the director of communications for ABI\u2019s craft business unit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"44b8\" name=\"44b8\">To help foster that new age, Lagesse helped the company launch Elevate Beer, a program through which independent brewers can take safety seminars and use the expensive quality-control labs at ABI\u2019s acquired breweries for free; and beer journalists can download free stock photos that portray people of color and women drinking ABI\u2019s craft beer for their articles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e2f4\" name=\"e2f4\">Lagesse also worked with Raspatello to weave ABI\u2019s \u201cbeer positive\u201d gospel into the 2018 production of OctFest, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">October</em>\u2019s beer, food, and music festival held on NYC\u2019s Governors Island. On his personal blog, Josh Noel reported that 35 of the 86 breweries showcased were partly or wholly owned by ABI. Lagesse confirmed this count but disputed the suggestion that the company had \u201ccraftwashed\u201d its involvement in the festival. (Like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">October</em> itself, the festival\u2019s site featured a small disclosure of ABI\u2019s involvement.)</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"d693\" name=\"d693\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px;

In June 2017, the Brewers Association <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.brewersassociation.org/staff-voices/independence-matters-introducing-the-independent-craft-brewer-seal/\" href=\"https://www.brewersassociation.org/staff-voices/independence-matters-introducing-the-independent-craft-brewer-seal/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched the Seal of Independence</a>, a graphic independent breweries can put on their beer labels and marketing materials to tell drinkers that they are, in internet parlance, not owned. To date, over 4,000 breweries have adopted the seal, which is off limits to those that have significant investment or outside ownership.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"64e1\" name=\"64e1\">Julia Herz, the Brewers Association\u2019s craft program director, touts the seal\u2019s widespread adoption\u200a\u2014\u200aand social media engagement on the corresponding #SeekTheSeal campaign\u200a\u2014\u200aas evidence that the campaign is having an effect (though there are no sales figures yet backing up the claim). Calagione calls the seal \u201cthe most powerful and potent weapon that the craft brewing community has\u201d in the ongoing battle to identify Big Beer\u2019s acquired brands to drinkers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"245f\" name=\"245f\">However, while the seal is fairly straightforward, the definition of independence is not. The Brewers Association\u2019s definition of independence dictates no more than 25 percent of the company can be controlled by another entity. Several leading craft breweries, including Calagione\u2019s Dogfish Head, have sold minority stakes below this threshold to private investors.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c349\" name=\"c349\">\u201cABI is well aware of this danger, which is why it is so touchy about the \u2018independence\u2019 argument,\u201d said Jeff Alworth, founding editor of the popular blog Beervana.

According to IRI sales data through December 2018, Goose Island\u2019s volume and dollar sales are both down around 10 percent. Bourbon County Brand Stout, the brewery\u2019s once-a-year barrel-aged release, remains coveted by craft beer insiders, but the rest of the brewery\u2019s beers are having a tough time maintaining traction.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0860\" name=\"0860\">Now a nationally distributed brand, Goose Island has run out of new markets to enter. Once ABI has scooped up the low-hanging fruit with its craft acquisitions, will it stretch for higher branches? Or just move on to the next tree (say, CBD-infused beverages) to find returns for its shareholders?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"43e4\" name=\"43e4\">Todd Ahsmann, Goose Island\u2019s current president, rejected the idea that ABI was pulling away from Goose Island. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t need to be a successful business next year, or next quarter,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we definitely have time to develop.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4027\" name=\"4027\">He points to Goose Island\u2019s barrel program (\u201cnot as immediately as big as people thought, but we\u2019re sticking to it\u201d) as evidence that ABI will invest in its acquired brewers, even if a payoff doesn\u2019t materialize right away. With ABI\u2019s backing, Ahsmann said, its acquired breweries can champion the craft segment as its growth slows.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e48\" name=\"7e48\">At the corporate level, ABI says the same thing, insisting it\u2019s committed to turning over a new leaf and growing the segment collaboratively\u200a\u2014\u200arather than milking it until returns peter out. \u201cWe are, of course, concerned as everybody,\u201d said Mika Michaelis, the new president of the company\u2019s U.S. craft business unit. \u201cThat\u2019s where we have to step up and together find a better way to move the category.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f8d4\" name=\"f8d4\">But ABI\u2019s most vocal critics aren\u2019t quite sure of what that means or what would happen to America\u2019s 7,000 craft breweries if everyone joins the post-craft world or what ABI is even driving at.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"28c9\" name=\"28c9\">\u201cIt seems like they\u2019re making gains in the craft segment enough to kind of satisfy them\u201d for now, Luke said. \u201cBut once that growth stops for them\u2026 I mean, they always have to grow.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"d7eb\" name=\"d7eb\">He paused, considering what would follow. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my biggest

By the end of the \u201980s, the number of American breweries had jumped from under 100 to nearly 250, though microbrewers were still an infinitesimally small fraction of the market.

Craft beer was a subculture, a niche back then. \u201cWell, fast forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lawyer, there\u2019s an accountant, there\u2019s a janitor drinking craft beer.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f5e2\\\" id=\\\"f5e2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThat growing appeal with mainstream American drinkers proved to be a double-edged sword for craft brewers. It brought legitimacy, stature, and financial success for many of them. But it also brought a wave of drinkers more interested in good beer than the anti-corporate ideology from whence it came.

Golden Road\u2019s national sales (in both dollars and volume) grew by over 55 percent through December 2018, according to Chris Shepard\u2019s analysis of data from the market research firm IRI. Much of that growth, he said, is due to Golden Road using 15-packs for Wolf Pup and Mango Cart. This is a potential bellwether.

ABI\u2019s \u201cgo-to market\u201d machine is a marvel that gives it remarkable influence over how and where its brands are sold\u200a\u2014\u200aand whether other brewers\u2019 stuff is sold at all. \u201cIt just takes up space,\u201d said Matt Hartman, co-founder of independent craft distributor Remarkable Liquids, about ABI\u2019s craft expansion.

Beer distributors are supposed to be independent so no one supplier or retailer can control access to markets full of thirsty drinkers. But since 1980, the number of traditional beer distributors has decreased from over 4,500 to around 3,000, \\x3ca href=\\\"https://www.nbwa.org/sites/default/files/NBWA-Beer-Industry-Fast-Facts-2014.pdf\\\" data-href=\\\"https://www.nbwa.org/sites/default/files/NBWA-Beer-Industry-Fast-Facts-2014.pdf\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3eaccording to the National Beer Wholesaler Association\\x3c/a\\x3e. This benefits big brewers like ABI. The fewer access points to market there are, the more sway macrobrewers have over those that remain. That is, if they don\u2019t already own them outright. In his book, Noel reported that ABI has actually bought up 18 distributorships in states where it\u2019s legal to do so.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"785f\\\" id=\\\"785f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAnd lo: ABI has \u201can absolute hammerlock on distribution,\u201d said the American Antitrust Institute\u2019s Moss.

The fledgling industry got a boost in 1978 when Jimmy Carter loosened federal restrictions on homebrewing, allowing a generation of hobbyists to pursue their passion for full-flavored beers as a profession. By the end of the \u201980s, the number of American breweries had jumped from under 100 to nearly 250, though microbrewers were still an infinitesimally small fraction of the market. Budweiser, which sold nearly 50 million barrels in 1988\u200a\u2014\u200aa high water mark\u200a\u2014\u200ahad little interest in the fringe beardos selling weird beer a barrel at a time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f47\" name=\"2f47\">By the mid-\u201990s, however, even Anheuser-Busch\u2019s most loyal distributors (the local, independent businesses that breweries are required by law to work with) were asking the company to add microbrews to its portfolio. Distributors were asking because retailers\u200a\u2014\u200asupermarkets, liquor stores, and bars across the country\u200a\u2014\u200awere asking.

Between 2014 and 2017, ABI went on a shopping spree, buying up eight more craft breweries: 10 Barrel, Elysian (Seattle, Washington), Golden Road (Los Angeles, California), Four Peaks (Tempe, Arizona), Breckenridge (Colorado), Devils Backbone (Roseland, Virginia), Karbach (Houston, Texas), and Wicked Weed (Asheville, North Carolina).

Jim Koch, founder of the Boston Beer Company (makers of Samuel Adams) and an elder statesman of the craft brewing industry, took to calling them \u201ccaptive craft\u201d brands.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"9aa5\" name=\"9aa5\">From coast to coast, the company could compete directly with craft brewers on all the things that had brought drinkers to those breweries in the first\u00a0place.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"4fd7\" name=\"4fd7\">Company representatives insisted there was no overarching strategy to its shopping spree.

This so-called \u201ccraftwashing\u201d technique evokes a whole range of emotions in true-blue independent brewers. Plenty of sneering disdain\u200a\u2014\u200abut some genuine gloom, too.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a43b\" name=\"a43b\">\u201cWhen Anheuser-Busch [InBev] goes out of their way to hide the fact that these breweries had any association to the company that owns and runs them, it\u2019s just crummy,\u201d said Tom McCormick, the executive director of the California Craft Brewers Association. As a fixture in the Golden State\u2019s craft brewing community for three decades, he views macrobrewers\u2019 present interest in the category as \u201camazing\u201d proof positive that he and his fellow revolutionaries were onto something. \u201dBack in the eighties, we had no idea what [craft beer] would become. We were in it because we loved it,\u201d he said. Now, that labor of love is being overrun with companies that, in his estimation, \u201cdon\u2019t care about anything but the money.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a1b1\" name=\"a1b1\">\u201cIt sucks,\u201d agreed Dick Cantwell, who co-founded Elysian in 1995 and cast the sole vote against its sale to ABI. Nowadays, he\u2019s brewing again, this time at San Francisco\u2019s Magnolia Brewing Co. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit demoralizing to find that they have managed to kind of hit us where we live.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"31b5\" name=\"31b5\">But while it\u2019s created anguish and anger within the industry, average drinkers might not even care. And that\u2019s where ABI\u2019s timing appears to be acute. When Tim Schoen took his Pacific-Northwest reconnoiter in the \u201990s, craft beer was all \u201chopheads and hippies,\u201d said Schoen, who today is the founder and CEO of Brew Hub, a contract-brewing company based in Lakeland, Florida. Craft beer was a subculture, a niche back then. \u201cWell, fast forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lawyer, there\u2019s an accountant, there\u2019s a janitor drinking craft beer.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5e2\" name=\"f5e2\">That growing appeal with mainstream American drinkers proved to be a double-edged sword for craft brewers. It brought legitimacy, stature, and financial success for many of them. But it also brought a wave of drinkers more interested in good beer than the anti-corporate ideology from whence it came. On the way from cultural battle flag to mainstream beer category, craft beer became more popular, but less special\u200a\u2014\u200aand that made it vulnerable.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e73\" name=\"7e73\">After Wicked Weed\u2019s sale to ABI was announced in June 2017, nearly 50 craft breweries pulled out of the Asheville brewery\u2019s popular annual Funkitorium Invitational festival in protest, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/ab-inbev-buyout-has-forced-wicked-weed-cancel-its-annual-funky-beer-festival\" href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/ab-inbev-buyout-has-forced-wicked-weed-cancel-its-annual-funky-beer-festival\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">forcing the cancellation</a> of the event. Some in the craft beer community claimed a moral victory, but true victory in the battle against Big Beer was more elusive than ever. ABI now had a freer hand than ever to wield the weapons\u200a\u2014\u200ainnovative beers, colorful brewers, and local breweries\u200a\u2014\u200aonce used against it, to shore up its portfolio, neutralize its competitors, and, of course, sell more beer.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"2f59\" name=\"2f59\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Stage 2: Supercharge production</strong></h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"7e1b\" name=\"7e1b\">People in the beer business use the term \u201cliquid\u201d as a way of discussing the beer itself, separate from all the non-liquid stuff it takes to sell beer, like packaging, advertising, shipping, and so on. Like many independent brewers, ABI\u2019s acquired craft brands tend be pretty good at making \u201cliquid\u201d that drinkers want. But ABI is really good at the rest. \u201cThey make beer more efficiently than anybody in the world,\u201d Koch, who now serves as chairman of Boston Beer Company (Sam Adams\u2019 parent corporation), told me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2508\" name=\"2508\">After every acquisition, there was a settling out period, where a tiny brewing company adjusted to life under the banner of the beer world\u2019s biggest behemoth. The transitions were never seamless, but after the staff shakeouts, once the backlash had died down and the companies were sufficiently integrated, these ABI-backed craft breweries were in formidable positions. The could supercharge production of its craft brands to a degree that was previously unimaginable in the business.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"542b\" name=\"542b\">Even for large independent brewers, lining up additional capacity or introducing a new package can be fraught with logistical hurdles. For ABI, it\u2019s business as\u00a0usual.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"b35d\" name=\"b35d\">Consider Golden Road, the Los Angeles craft brewery ABI bought in 2015.

When Gill needs to brew more Wolf Pup than Golden Road has capacity for, she calls an ABI intermediary to coordinate a \u201ccross-brew\u201d at another of the company\u2019s facilities. When supermarkets ask Golden Road to make 15-packs of Mango Cart, another hot beer in its roster, Gill picks up the phone, and ABI\u2019s vast logistics apparatus springs into action.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"440b\" name=\"440b\">This all happens at a scale that would be staggering to most independent brewers. \u201cThey understand that we\u2019re not going to ask them to do something if we know it\u2019s going to be under 10,000 barrels annually,\u201d said Gill of ABI.

better margins, which mean lower prices. Golden Road\u2019s national sales (in both dollars and volume) grew by over 55 percent through December 2018, according to Chris Shepard\u2019s analysis of data from the market research firm IRI. Much of that growth, he said, is due to Golden Road using 15-packs for Wolf Pup and Mango Cart. This is a potential bellwether. If value packaging like 15-packs becomes the new normal in craft beer\u200a\u2014\u200aand by the looks of things, it will\u200a\u2014\u200aABI \u201ccan push craft beer pricing down and hurt a lot of people,\u201d said Mitaro from the Brewers Advisory Group. \u201cIn the end you\u2019re gonna be selling 15 cans for the price you were selling 12.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e5e\" name=\"3e5e\">And if you\u2019re not\u200a\u2014\u200aif you hold the line and sell 12 cans for the same price ABI is selling 15, said Sonia Marciano, a professor at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business who has studied ABI\u2019s business practices: \u201cWhat do you say to a customer? Why should they buy you?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"79fa\" name=\"79fa\">That is, if your beer even makes it to shelves in the first place. ABI\u2019s \u201cgo-to market\u201d machine is a marvel that gives it remarkable influence over how and where its brands are sold\u200a\u2014\u200aand whether other brewers\u2019 stuff is sold at all. \u201cIt just takes up space,\u201d said Matt Hartman, co-founder of independent craft distributor Remarkable Liquids, about ABI\u2019s craft expansion. That means the company can box out rivals from retail shelves, tap towers, even entire stadium concessions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6329\" name=\"6329\">As the linchpin between producers and retailers in the United States\u2019 peculiar post-Prohibition booze-selling system, distribution is as crucial to brewers\u2019 success as their beer\u200a\u2014\u200aif not more so. Beer distributors are supposed to be independent so no one supplier or retailer can control access to markets full of thirsty drinkers. But since 1980, the number of traditional beer distributors has decreased from over 4,500 to around 3,000, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.nbwa.org/sites/default/files/NBWA-Beer-Industry-Fast-Facts-2014.pdf\" href=\"https://www.nbwa.org/sites/default/files/NBWA-Beer-Industry-Fast-Facts-2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to the National Beer Wholesaler Association</a>. This benefits big brewers like ABI. The fewer access points to market there are, the more sway macrobrewers have over those that remain. That is, if they don\u2019t already own them outright. In his book, Noel reported that ABI has actually bought up 18 distributorships in states where it\u2019s legal to do so.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"785f\" name=\"785f\">And lo: ABI has \u201can absolute hammerlock on distribution,\u201d said the American Antitrust Institute\u2019s Moss. She testified before the U.S. Senate against ABI\u2019s $100 billion acquisition of SABMiller in 2015 (which was ultimately approved), so she knows\u200a\u2014\u200aand how well\u200a\u2014\u200athe company throws its weight around in the market when left unchecked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e971\" name=\"e971\">As the biggest supplier in the portfolio of virtually every distributor it works with, ABI is able to flex its muscle in lots of ways. As Anat Baron, producer and host of 2009\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Beer Wars </em>and a former executive at Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade, put it in a recent phone call, \u201cHe who controls access controls the game.\u201d</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"d91b\" name=\"d91b\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Stage 3: Win the propaganda war</strong></h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"b861\" name=\"b861\">In today\u2019s beer aisle, hearts and minds are as important as shelf space and tap handles. To truly win out, Big Beer has to do more than simply crush Small Beer. It has to convince the American drinking public that there\u2019s no difference between the two. This is where ABI has perhaps been most shrewd.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3b8e\" name=\"3b8e\">In 2016, the company <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines/2017/6/2/ratebeer-zx-ventures-acquisition-minority-stake-anheuser-busch-inbev\" href=\"https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines/2017/6/2/ratebeer-zx-ventures-acquisition-minority-stake-anheuser-busch-inbev\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">took a 49-percent stake</a> in RateBeer.com, a popular online beer-ranking forum, and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/news/northern-brewer-purchased-anheuser-busch-inbev/\" href=\"https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/news/northern-brewer-purchased-anheuser-busch-inbev/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">outright bought Northern Brewer</a>, a homebrewing e-commerce platform.

He\u2019s quick to point out that the site\u2019s editorial voice is contractually protected from the influence of its majority investor. And a small disclosure about the company\u2019s stake accompanies every story <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">October</em> publishes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6c2d\" name=\"6c2d\">Investments like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">October</em> give ABI a platform to promote its vision for a post-craft future\u200a\u2014\u200aa future that favors its brands\u2019 position in the market. In the coming age, \u201cbeer-positive, bring the industry together-type thinking\u201d will carry the day, said Meg Lagesse, the director of communications for ABI\u2019s craft business unit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"44b8\" name=\"44b8\">To help foster that new age, Lagesse helped the company launch Elevate Beer, a program through which independent brewers can take safety seminars and use the expensive quality-control labs at ABI\u2019s acquired breweries for free; and beer journalists can download free stock photos that portray people of color and women drinking ABI\u2019s craft beer for their articles.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e2f4\" name=\"e2f4\">Lagesse also worked with Raspatello to weave ABI\u2019s \u201cbeer positive\u201d gospel into the 2018 production of OctFest, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">October</em>\u2019s beer, food, and music festival held on NYC\u2019s Governors Island. On his personal blog, Josh Noel reported that 35 of the 86 breweries showcased were partly or wholly owned by ABI. Lagesse confirmed this count but disputed the suggestion that the company had \u201ccraftwashed\u201d its involvement in the festival. (Like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">October</em> itself, the festival\u2019s site featured a small disclosure of ABI\u2019s involvement.)</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"d693\" name=\"d693\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px;

Cloudburst Brewing, the tiny craft brewery he founded two years earlier in Seattle, had just won a bronze medal at the 2018 Great American Beer Festival in Denver. It was recognition on craft beer\u2019s biggest stage\u200a\u2014\u200abasically the Oscars of beer\u200a\u2014\u200abut Luke, a lanky brewing virtuoso with a shoulder-length mane and a righteous beard, wasn\u2019t content to bask. As the cameras clicked, he unbuttoned his plaid shirt to reveal another shirt beneath it that read in big, red block letters, \u201cFUCK A-B INBEV.\u201dThere was a quick chuckle in the crowd. Luke left the stage, and the ceremony rolled on.In one sense, this was nothing new. A generation of independent brewers built craft beer partly by vilifying Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI), the world\u2019s biggest beer company, formed in 2008 when the Belgian-Brazilian juggernaut InBev purchased St. Louis\u2019 Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. It was good for business, a form of commercialized dissent. People could stick it to The Man\u200a\u2014\u200athose soulless and tasteless swill-peddlers\u200a\u2014\u200ajust by drinking beer they liked. Drinkers and brewers alike started using words like \u201cmovement,\u201d \u201crenaissance,\u201d \u201crebellion,\u201d and \u201crevolution\u201d to describe America\u2019s craft brewing culture. Quality and experimentation skyrocketed like never before. Microbreweries appeared in every state in America.Today, there are 7,000 small, independent breweries in the country\u200a\u2014\u200athe most since pre-Prohibition days\u200a\u2014\u200aand craft beer is available on airplanes, in ballparks, and everywhere in between. And you might think, based on that, that this democratic uprising has given way to a new world order; that the people have spoken; that Small Beer has won.You would be wrong.For the past decade, Big Beer has been systematically buying up the craft breweries they couldn\u2019t beat, and ABI has bought the most\u200a\u2014\u200a10 in all that were snapped up in a six-year shopping spree that touched virtually every major beer market in the country. A few months before Luke and his shirt arrived in Denver, sales among ABI\u2019s acquired craft breweries eclipsed those of the country\u2019s largest independents. Based on the industry\u2019s benchmark retail sales metric, the world\u2019s biggest beer company, long the Goliath to craft brewers\u2019 David, had become the world\u2019s biggest craft beer company as well.The transformation comes at a pivotal moment for the $26 billion U.S. craft beer market. Growth is slowing, people are drinking less, and wine and spirits are gaining market share. With its unprecedented prominence in a category formed to oppose it, ABI is hastening American drinkers into a \u201cpost-craft\u201d future in which macrobrewers make award-winning microbrews, drinkers don\u2019t care who owns their breweries, and, amid the ruins, the once-ruthless ABI stands as the great unifier. It\u2019s an ambitious vision for craft beer\u2019s future that threatens to smother the revolutionary spirit that gave us craft beer in the first place\u200a\u2014\u200anot to mention the revolutionaries themselves. If ABI can continue to consolidate its hold on the segment, Diana Moss of the American Antitrust Institute told me, \u201cI fear for the craft brewers of America.\u201dFrom pastime to revolutionCraft beer was born in the mid-1960s, when an heir to the Maytag appliance fortune bought an erstwhile San Francisco brewery called Anchor and began marketing a full-flavored, malty \u201csteam\u201d beer as its flagship. The fledgling industry got a boost in 1978 when Jimmy Carter loosened federal restrictions on homebrewing, allowing a generation of hobbyists to pursue their passion for full-flavored beers as a profession. By the end of the \u201980s, the number of American breweries had jumped from under 100 to nearly 250, though microbrewers were still an infinitesimally small fraction of the market. Budweiser, which sold nearly 50 million barrels in 1988\u200a\u2014\u200aa high water mark\u200a\u2014\u200ahad little interest in the fringe beardos selling weird beer a barrel at a time.By the mid-\u201990s, however, even Anheuser-Busch\u2019s most loyal distributors (the local, independent businesses that breweries are required by law to work with) were asking the company to add microbrews to its portfolio. Distributors were asking because retailers\u200a\u2014\u200asupermarkets, liquor stores, and bars across the country\u200a\u2014\u200awere asking. Drinkers wanted to try one of those new-fangled \u201cmicrobrews\u201d they\u2019d been hearing about, and if Anheuser-Busch didn\u2019t brew them, distributors would have to start working with breweries that did.There was a culture war then raging against the machine, and drinkers took up craft beer as a battle\u00a0flag.Ceding this ground to other breweries, even then-tiny ones like Samuel Adams and Sierra Nevada, was anathema to Anheuser-Busch. So in 1994, Anheuser-Busch sent Tim Schoen, a three-decade company veteran, on a recon trip to the Pacific Northwest\u200a\u2014\u200athen, as now, a craft-brewing hotbed\u200a\u2014\u200ato figure out what they were missing. He came back with bad news.\u201cThe authenticity of craft is really something that the big guys could not duplicate,\u201d Schoen told me. There was a culture war then raging against the machine, and drinkers took up craft beer as a battle flag. They drank it because it tasted good, but they identified with it because it was cool.Schoen tried to build an answer to craft beer from within the company, launching look-alike brands that had little apparent connection to Anheuser-Busch, aping Sierra Nevada with Pacific Ridge and Shiner Bock with ZiegenBock. It was a begrudging admission in St. Louis that microbrewing was no mere fad.It did not go well. Aside from some infamous concoctions like Tequiza (a quickly killed blue agave and lime flavored lager), it wasn\u2019t really the brewers\u2019 fault. \u201cWe came out with some really good beers, and none of them really gained any significant traction,\u201d said Mitch Steele, who worked on the craft beer skunkworks team at Anheuser-Busch in the \u201990s and is now the brewmaster of Atlanta\u2019s New Realm Brewing. While flavors could be cloned, the anti-corporate spirit could not. The craft beer aisle was like the staff cabins in Dirty Dancing. Tequiza was Steve Buscemi in the \u201cHow do you do, fellow kids\u201d meme.For a time, Anheuser-Busch seemed to be flailing. \u201cA war was being fought every day for shelf space and tap handles, and Anheuser-Busch, for once, didn\u2019t have the weapons to win,\u201d wrote Josh Noel, a reporter at the Chicago Tribune, in his 2018 book Barrel-Aged Stout and Selling Out.Some of the other macrobrewers fared better. Blue Moon, Coors\u2019 in-house crafty brand launched in 1995, was growing at a 25-percent clip through the first three years of the new decade. Leinenkugel, acquired by Miller in 1988, saw similar growth.Anheuser-Busch tried to arm itself in kind, contorting its premium Michelob brand into a dizzying array of craft-esque line extensions, from honey lagers to pumpkin spice ales, and launching Shock Top in 2006. But the company had also started investing in craft brewing in the \u201990s, taking minority stakes in Washington State\u2019s Red Hook in 1994 and Oregon\u2019s Widmer Brothers in 1997. Those buy-ins were met with some grousing and contempt from the close-knit craft brewing community, but it wasn\u2019t until Anheuser-Busch acquired 42 percent of Chicago\u2019s beloved Goose Island in 2006 (under Widmer\u2019s name, to deflect criticism) that things boiled over.The Brewers Association\u200a\u2014\u200aformed in 2005 as craft brewing\u2019s trade organization\u200a\u2014\u200atook action, ejecting all three breweries from its ranks. The \u201cexcommunications,\u201d as Noel called them, were received with mixed feelings. Some members of the craft community were glad to draw a line in the sand. Others were sorry to turn their backs on their peers.Keen observers, however, could see that more was at stake. \u201cThe move gave Goose Island the skeleton key of beer sales: access to Anheuser-Busch\u2019s distribution network,\u201d wrote journalist Nicholas Day in 2006 for the Chicago Reader. The imagery would prove apt throughout the next decade, as Anheuser-Busch InBev opened door after door for its acquired breweries, leapfrogging them ahead of their former revolutionary comrades and setting in motion a multistage plan to turn the tide in the craft beer revolution.Stage 1: Co-opt key partisansIn July 2008, when InBev acquired Anheuser-Busch to become ABI, craft beer sales totaled less than 5 percent of the U.S. beer market. But then (as now) craft beer was one of the few segments still growing. So once the dust had settled on the merger, ABI sized up craft beer\u2019s significance in the increasingly fragmented U.S. beer market and decided something needed to be done.Not that the company had much of a choice. The U.S. numbers were troubling. Once-kingly Budweiser was down double-digits from its late-\u201980s zenith. Bud Light was bleeding a couple points a year. \u201cWith their domestic brands declining so much, it was only natural\u201d that ABI would take another run at craft beer, said Mike Mitaro, an industry veteran and founder of Brewers Advisory Group, an independent consultancy.Only this time, instead of doubling down on what it was bad at\u200a\u2014\u200acreating authentic craft brands\u200a\u2014\u200aABI leaned into what it was good at: being a giant corporation. \u201cInBev has always operated by acquisition,\u201d said Maureen Ogle, beer historian and author of 2007\u2019s Ambitious Brew. \u201cSo that\u2019s what they did.\u201dThe rest of Chicago\u2019s Goose Island went first, in 2011. Then Blue Point, a Long Island brewery, in 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, ABI went on a shopping spree, buying up eight more craft breweries: 10 Barrel, Elysian (Seattle, Washington), Golden Road (Los Angeles, California), Four Peaks (Tempe, Arizona), Breckenridge (Colorado), Devils Backbone (Roseland, Virginia), Karbach (Houston, Texas), and Wicked Weed (Asheville, North Carolina). The craft beer community erupted with scorn at each successive purchase, labeling the craft brewers sellouts, scabs, and traitors to the movement. Jim Koch, founder of the Boston Beer Company (makers of Samuel Adams) and an elder statesman of the craft brewing industry, took to calling them \u201ccaptive craft\u201d brands.From coast to coast, the company could compete directly with craft brewers on all the things that had brought drinkers to those breweries in the first\u00a0place.Company representatives insisted there was no overarching strategy to its shopping spree. But every acquisition pulled ABI\u2019s hidden strategy into sharper focus: The company was acquiring craft proxies in the country\u2019s most important beer markets, geographically encircling the nation\u2019s brewers and the drinkers they served.After completing its push into the U.S. South, buying Devil\u2019s Backbone, Karbach, and Wicked Weed, ABI had a foothold in every major beer market in America. From coast to coast, the company could compete directly with craft brewers on all the things that had brought drinkers to those breweries in the first place: from founders\u2019 funky backstories, to community ties and grassroots aesthetics, right down to the beers themselves, often with drinkers being none the wiser about who was signing the checks.\u201cThere\u2019s just too much of a lack of transparency on who really owns and runs these brands that are being marketed as if they come from these indie local craft breweries,\u201d said Dogfish Head\u2019s Sam Calagione in a recent phone call. This so-called \u201ccraftwashing\u201d technique evokes a whole range of emotions in true-blue independent brewers. Plenty of sneering disdain\u200a\u2014\u200abut some genuine gloom, too.\u201cWhen Anheuser-Busch [InBev] goes out of their way to hide the fact that these breweries had any association to the company that owns and runs them, it\u2019s just crummy,\u201d said Tom McCormick, the executive director of the California Craft Brewers Association. As a fixture in the Golden State\u2019s craft brewing community for three decades, he views macrobrewers\u2019 present interest in the category as \u201camazing\u201d proof positive that he and his fellow revolutionaries were onto something. \u201dBack in the eighties, we had no idea what [craft beer] would become. We were in it because we loved it,\u201d he said. Now, that labor of love is being overrun with companies that, in his estimation, \u201cdon\u2019t care about anything but the money.\u201d\u201cIt sucks,\u201d agreed Dick Cantwell, who co-founded Elysian in 1995 and cast the sole vote against its sale to ABI. Nowadays, he\u2019s brewing again, this time at San Francisco\u2019s Magnolia Brewing Co. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit demoralizing to find that they have managed to kind of hit us where we live.\u201dBut while it\u2019s created anguish and anger within the industry, average drinkers might not even care. And that\u2019s where ABI\u2019s timing appears to be acute. When Tim Schoen took his Pacific-Northwest reconnoiter in the \u201990s, craft beer was all \u201chopheads and hippies,\u201d said Schoen, who today is the founder and CEO of Brew Hub, a contract-brewing company based in Lakeland, Florida. Craft beer was a subculture, a niche back then. \u201cWell, fast forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lawyer, there\u2019s an accountant, there\u2019s a janitor drinking craft beer.\u201dThat growing appeal with mainstream American drinkers proved to be a double-edged sword for craft brewers. It brought legitimacy, stature, and financial success for many of them. But it also brought a wave of drinkers more interested in good beer than the anti-corporate ideology from whence it came. On the way from cultural battle flag to mainstream beer category, craft beer became more popular, but less special\u200a\u2014\u200aand that made it vulnerable.After Wicked Weed\u2019s sale to ABI was announced in June 2017, nearly 50 craft breweries pulled out of the Asheville brewery\u2019s popular annual Funkitorium Invitational festival in protest, forcing the cancellation of the event. Some in the craft beer community claimed a moral victory, but true victory in the battle against Big Beer was more elusive than ever. ABI now had a freer hand than ever to wield the weapons\u200a\u2014\u200ainnovative beers, colorful brewers, and local breweries\u200a\u2014\u200aonce used against it, to shore up its portfolio, neutralize its competitors, and, of course, sell more beer.Stage 2: Supercharge productionPeople in the beer business use the term \u201cliquid\u201d as a way of discussing the beer itself, separate from all the non-liquid stuff it takes to sell beer, like packaging, advertising, shipping, and so on. Like many independent brewers, ABI\u2019s acquired craft brands tend be pretty good at making \u201cliquid\u201d that drinkers want. But ABI is really good at the rest. \u201cThey make beer more efficiently than anybody in the world,\u201d Koch, who now serves as chairman of Boston Beer Company (Sam Adams\u2019 parent corporation), told me.After every acquisition, there was a settling out period, where a tiny brewing company adjusted to life under the banner of the beer world\u2019s biggest behemoth. The transitions were never seamless, but after the staff shakeouts, once the backlash had died down and the companies were sufficiently integrated, these ABI-backed craft breweries were in formidable positions. The could supercharge production of its craft brands to a degree that was previously unimaginable in the business.Even for large independent brewers, lining up additional capacity or introducing a new package can be fraught with logistical hurdles. For ABI, it\u2019s business as\u00a0usual.Consider Golden Road, the Los Angeles craft brewery ABI bought in 2015. Joining ABI, said cofounder Meg Gill in a recent phone call, has freed her up to focus on brewing \u201creally solid, amazing liquid.\u201d When something sparks\u200a\u2014\u200alike last year\u2019s Wolf Pup, a session IPA, and Mango Cart, a fruited wheat beer\u200a\u2014\u200aABI is there to pour gas on the fire. When Gill needs to brew more Wolf Pup than Golden Road has capacity for, she calls an ABI intermediary to coordinate a \u201ccross-brew\u201d at another of the company\u2019s facilities. When supermarkets ask Golden Road to make 15-packs of Mango Cart, another hot beer in its roster, Gill picks up the phone, and ABI\u2019s vast logistics apparatus springs into action.This all happens at a scale that would be staggering to most independent brewers. \u201cThey understand that we\u2019re not going to ask them to do something if we know it\u2019s going to be under 10,000 barrels annually,\u201d said Gill of ABI. That figure is for a single beer; around 95 percent of all independent breweries produce less than 10,000 barrels annually, across all their beers, according to an estimate from Brewers Association chief economist Bart Watson. Even for large independent brewers, lining up additional capacity or introducing a new package can be fraught with logistical hurdles. For ABI, it\u2019s business as usual.According to Gill, Golden Road currently brews less than 50 percent of its liquid at its own facility, and that portion will be even lower next year. \u201cI\u2019m very glad that we chose this route,\u201d she said, reflecting on the support she gets from her brewery\u2019s \u201cstrategic partner.\u201d From top left, clockwise: Meg Gill, co-founder and president of Golden Road Brewing; a brewer sets up a brite tank to clean at Golden Road Brewery in Glendale, California; John Dunne, a brewer, checks a 329 Lager beer at Golden Road Brewing; a Hangar 24 mixed with GRB Valentin (Photos: Gary Friedman and Gina Ferrazzi/LA Times via\u00a0Getty) In beer, higher volumes mean better margins, which mean lower prices. Golden Road\u2019s national sales (in both dollars and volume) grew by over 55 percent through December 2018, according to Chris Shepard\u2019s analysis of data from the market research firm IRI. Much of that growth, he said, is due to Golden Road using 15-packs for Wolf Pup and Mango Cart. This is a potential bellwether. If value packaging like 15-packs becomes the new normal in craft beer\u200a\u2014\u200aand by the looks of things, it will\u200a\u2014\u200aABI \u201ccan push craft beer pricing down and hurt a lot of people,\u201d said Mitaro from the Brewers Advisory Group. \u201cIn the end you\u2019re gonna be selling 15 cans for the price you were selling 12.\u201dAnd if you\u2019re not\u200a\u2014\u200aif you hold the line and sell 12 cans for the same price ABI is selling 15, said Sonia Marciano, a professor at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business who has studied ABI\u2019s business practices: \u201cWhat do you say to a customer? Why should they buy you?\u201dThat is, if your beer even makes it to shelves in the first place. ABI\u2019s \u201cgo-to market\u201d machine is a marvel that gives it remarkable influence over how and where its brands are sold\u200a\u2014\u200aand whether other brewers\u2019 stuff is sold at all. \u201cIt just takes up space,\u201d said Matt Hartman, co-founder of independent craft distributor Remarkable Liquids, about ABI\u2019s craft expansion. That means the company can box out rivals from retail shelves, tap towers, even entire stadium concessions.As the linchpin between producers and retailers in the United States\u2019 peculiar post-Prohibition booze-selling system, distribution is as crucial to brewers\u2019 success as their beer\u200a\u2014\u200aif not more so. Beer distributors are supposed to be independent so no one supplier or retailer can control access to markets full of thirsty drinkers. But since 1980, the number of traditional beer distributors has decreased from over 4,500 to around 3,000, according to the National Beer Wholesaler Association. This benefits big brewers like ABI. The fewer access points to market there are, the more sway macrobrewers have over those that remain. That is, if they don\u2019t already own them outright. In his book, Noel reported that ABI has actually bought up 18 distributorships in states where it\u2019s legal to do so.And lo: ABI has \u201can absolute hammerlock on distribution,\u201d said the American Antitrust Institute\u2019s Moss. She testified before the U.S. Senate against ABI\u2019s $100 billion acquisition of SABMiller in 2015 (which was ultimately approved), so she knows\u200a\u2014\u200aand how well\u200a\u2014\u200athe company throws its weight around in the market when left unchecked.As the biggest supplier in the portfolio of virtually every distributor it works with, ABI is able to flex its muscle in lots of ways. As Anat Baron, producer and host of 2009\u2019s Beer Wars and a former executive at Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade, put it in a recent phone call, \u201cHe who controls access controls the game.\u201dStage 3: Win the propaganda warIn today\u2019s beer aisle, hearts and minds are as important as shelf space and tap handles. To truly win out, Big Beer has to do more than simply crush Small Beer. It has to convince the American drinking public that there\u2019s no difference between the two. This is where ABI has perhaps been most shrewd.In 2016, the company took a 49-percent stake in RateBeer.com, a popular online beer-ranking forum, and outright bought Northern Brewer, a homebrewing e-commerce platform. With those investments, ABI acquired two properties dear to beer geeks and tapped into a trove of precious consumer data indicating the stuff the craft beer community cared about the most. (Just to note it: ABI bought the other 51 percent of RateBeer this year.)Also in 2016, the company launched a partnership with publisher Conde Nast to create a full-blown digital publication about beer culture called October. \u201cIt\u2019s a love letter to beer,\u201d said Mike Raspatello, a former festival producer who serves as the venture\u2019s president. He\u2019s quick to point out that the site\u2019s editorial voice is contractually protected from the influence of its majority investor. And a small disclosure about the company\u2019s stake accompanies every story October publishes.Investments like October give ABI a platform to promote its vision for a post-craft future\u200a\u2014\u200aa future that favors its brands\u2019 position in the market. In the coming age, \u201cbeer-positive, bring the industry together-type thinking\u201d will carry the day, said Meg Lagesse, the director of communications for ABI\u2019s craft business unit.To help foster that new age, Lagesse helped the company launch Elevate Beer, a program through which independent brewers can take safety seminars and use the expensive quality-control labs at ABI\u2019s acquired breweries for free; and beer journalists can download free stock photos that portray people of color and women drinking ABI\u2019s craft beer for their articles.Lagesse also worked with Raspatello to weave ABI\u2019s \u201cbeer positive\u201d gospel into the 2018 production of OctFest, October\u2019s beer, food, and music festival held on NYC\u2019s Governors Island. On his personal blog, Josh Noel reported that 35 of the 86 breweries showcased were partly or wholly owned by ABI. Lagesse confirmed this count but disputed the suggestion that the company had \u201ccraftwashed\u201d its involvement in the festival. (Like October itself, the festival\u2019s site featured a small disclosure of ABI\u2019s involvement.) From top, left to right: The Flaming Lips performs onstage at OctFest 2018 (Taylor Hill/Getty); Camden beer is served; GrowlerWerks was one of the craft beers available at OctFest; a festivalgoer attending OctFest holds up beer in an \u2018October\u2019 branded glass (Mike Pont/Getty) \u201cI think before, when the landscape was different, craft brewers were a little afraid to say they [were] a part of ABI because of negative reactions they would get,\u201d said Lagesse, who began her beer career at Goose Island in 2015. \u201cI think the consumers have become more okay with it.\u201dAnd as ABI increasingly muddles the definition of craft beer, the company has also begun to deploy a new tactic in its battle against craft brewers: ridicule.Cloudburst Brewing\u2019s Luke knows better than most how ABI works this angle. In February 2015, he hosted a party at his house in Seattle to watch the Seahawks take on the New England Patriots. Luke wanted the party to be \u201ckind of a safe space\u201d for Elysian brewers and friends to unwind after a chaotic, emotional week in which they got word that their brewery had been sold to ABI.It wasn\u2019t in the cards. In the third quarter, Budweiser premiered a new ad called \u201cBrewed the Hard Way.\u201d It positioned the King of Beers as the red-meat antidote to all the namby-pamby craft brews out there. Bud was \u201cnot brewed to be fussed over,\u201d the commercial blared, specifically singling out \u201cpumpkin peach ale\u201d as the apotheosis of everything real beer, manly beer\u200a\u2014\u200aAmerican beer\u200a\u2014\u200astood for.Elysian made a pumpkin peach ale. Elysian co-founder Cantwell, who had hired Luke in 2011, left the room. \u201cMaybe to scream in the yard,\u201d speculated Luke, who left Elysian shortly after the acquisition to open Cloudburst.This \u201cshut up and drink your beer\u201d attitude is even trickling down to some of ABI\u2019s craft holdings as\u00a0well.\u201cWe barely noticed that the Seahawks lost,\u201d Cantwell recalled. \u201cIt was such a \u2018fuck you.\u2019\u201d Whether the ad was intended to \u201cfoster class warfare,\u201d as he suggests, or just to shore up the company\u2019s flagship lagers as the everyman choice, ABI has continued the crusade. There was the 2016 Super Bowl spot called \u201cNot Backing Down,\u201d which celebrated Budweiser with pointed block-caps proclamations like \u201cNOT A HOBBY\u201d and \u201cNOT A FRUIT CUP.\u201d And then came Bud Light\u2019s popular \u201dDilly Dilly\u201d campaign, launched in 2017, which sometimes mines a similar vein. In those spots, an everyman king punishes preening, aristocratic beer geeks for doting on their brews. Bud Light bravely stands \u201cfor the many, not the few,\u201d the slogan claims.(If this all sounds familiar\u200a\u2014\u200aa flailing but still powerful leader inciting a rank-and-file base against perceived elites by vilifying certain socio-cultural stereotypes\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019ll be unsurprised to learn that vendors on e-commerce platforms like eBay and TeeSpring are selling MAGA/Dilly Dilly mash-up merchandise for enthusiasts of both.)This \u201cshut up and drink your beer\u201d attitude is even trickling down to some of ABI\u2019s craft holdings as well. \u201cFriendly tip,\u201d read the side of some recent Goose IPA six-packs. \u201cYour mouth is for drinking IPA, not talking about drinking IPA.\u201dIn an effort to counterpunch, craft brewers have tried to refocus the conversation from how the IPA tastes to who owns the brewery it comes from. In June 2017, the Brewers Association launched the Seal of Independence, a graphic independent breweries can put on their beer labels and marketing materials to tell drinkers that they are, in internet parlance, not owned. To date, over 4,000 breweries have adopted the seal, which is off limits to those that have significant investment or outside ownership.Julia Herz, the Brewers Association\u2019s craft program director, touts the seal\u2019s widespread adoption\u200a\u2014\u200aand social media engagement on the corresponding #SeekTheSeal campaign\u200a\u2014\u200aas evidence that the campaign is having an effect (though there are no sales figures yet backing up the claim). Calagione calls the seal \u201cthe most powerful and potent weapon that the craft brewing community has\u201d in the ongoing battle to identify Big Beer\u2019s acquired brands to drinkers.However, while the seal is fairly straightforward, the definition of independence is not. The Brewers Association\u2019s definition of independence dictates no more than 25 percent of the company can be controlled by another entity. Several leading craft breweries, including Calagione\u2019s Dogfish Head, have sold minority stakes below this threshold to private investors.\u201cABI is well aware of this danger, which is why it is so touchy about the \u2018independence\u2019 argument,\u201d said Jeff Alworth, founding editor of the popular blog Beervana. He pointed in particular to a 2017 video released by ABI\u2019s craft-beer business unit, in which representatives from its acquired breweries\u200a\u2014\u200amany of them founders who happily stayed on post-sale\u200a\u2014\u200aspeak ill of the Seal of Independence campaign.Whether you view this sort of thing as traitorous capitulation or pragmatic dealing really depends on what you think craft beer is. Is it a cultural movement? Or is it just, well, a liquid?\u201cTheir mission is kind of to say, well, \u2018What is craft beer? It doesn\u2019t really mean anything anyway,\u2019\u201d said Cloudburst\u2019s Luke. \u201cSo it\u2019s diluting the difference between a true small independently owned brewery and their brands.\u201dLife after the revolutionNational sales data shows nearly all of ABI\u2019s acquired breweries up double digits in volume and dollar sales through 2018, and breweries that faced the most negative reactions when selling to ABI seemed to be thriving the most under its wing: Wicked Weed grew its sales over 90 percent in dollars and a whopping 140 percent in volume, according to IRI data through December 2018.\u201cWithin AB, there aren\u2019t commercial strategies of like, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s an enemy out there,\u2019\u201d said Gill, whose 2018 numbers at Golden Road were also gobsmacking. The success of ABI\u2019s acquired breweries, she says, lies in their focus on beer rather than ideological battles. \u201cThere is no negative space when you\u2019re in AB[I]. The only negative space is the haters outside of it.\u201dHaters aside, a deeper negative space looms. Craft beer is still a relatively small piece of ABI\u2019s portfolio. Elsewhere in its business, the company faces stiff headwinds: It\u2019s buried in debt, its stock fell nearly 40 percent in 2018, and its credit was recently downgraded. People just aren\u2019t drinking as much beer these days, and when they do, they don\u2019t reach for ABI\u2019s core brands. Michelob Ultra is a bright spot, but it won\u2019t cancel out Bud and Bud Light\u2019s slumps.To figure out whether ABI is for real about craft beer, keep an eye on Goose\u00a0Island.These problems are dogging the whole beer industry, but they\u2019re particularly vexing for the world\u2019s biggest brewery. Throw in the slowdown in the maturing craft market, and industry observers wonder how long ABI\u2019s self-appointed role as the segment\u2019s \u201cbeer positive\u201d vanguard will last\u200a\u2014\u200aand what consequences smaller brewers face once the salad days are truly gone.\u201cThe brewer in me has more anxiety about the intentions of today\u2019s ABI\u201d than yesterday\u2019s Anheuser-Busch, said Dogfish Head\u2019s Calagione. The old company\u2019s leaders were fierce competitors, but at least they were \u201cbeer people first and business people second,\u201d he said. \u201cContrast that to ABI today, and it\u2019s abundantly clear that quarterly shareholder profits are more important than the health of the American beer industry.\u201dTo figure out whether ABI is for real about craft beer, keep an eye on Goose Island. As the first prize in ABI\u2019s sprint to the craft throne, the Chicago brewery may be a bellwether for whether the company will invest in its craft brands once their post-acquisition momentum has given way to tougher sledding. Goose Island\u2019s India Pale Ale is pictured with Budweiser. Chicago-based Fulton Street Brewery LLC, the maker of Goose Island beers, was acquired by Anheuser-Busch in 2011. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Goose Island had a difficult 2018. According to IRI sales data through December 2018, Goose Island\u2019s volume and dollar sales are both down around 10 percent. Bourbon County Brand Stout, the brewery\u2019s once-a-year barrel-aged release, remains coveted by craft beer insiders, but the rest of the brewery\u2019s beers are having a tough time maintaining traction.Now a nationally distributed brand, Goose Island has run out of new markets to enter. Once ABI has scooped up the low-hanging fruit with its craft acquisitions, will it stretch for higher branches? Or just move on to the next tree (say, CBD-infused beverages) to find returns for its shareholders?Todd Ahsmann, Goose Island\u2019s current president, rejected the idea that ABI was pulling away from Goose Island. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t need to be a successful business next year, or next quarter,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we definitely have time to develop.\u201dHe points to Goose Island\u2019s barrel program (\u201cnot as immediately as big as people thought, but we\u2019re sticking to it\u201d) as evidence that ABI will invest in its acquired brewers, even if a payoff doesn\u2019t materialize right away. With ABI\u2019s backing, Ahsmann said, its acquired breweries can champion the craft segment as its growth slows.At the corporate level, ABI says the same thing, insisting it\u2019s committed to turning over a new leaf and growing the segment collaboratively\u200a\u2014\u200arather than milking it until returns peter out. \u201cWe are, of course, concerned as everybody,\u201d said Mika Michaelis, the new president of the company\u2019s U.S. craft business unit. \u201cThat\u2019s where we have to step up and together find a better way to move the category.\u201dBut ABI\u2019s most vocal critics aren\u2019t quite sure of what that means or what would happen to America\u2019s 7,000 craft breweries if everyone joins the post-craft world or what ABI is even driving at.\u201cIt seems like they\u2019re making gains in the craft segment enough to kind of satisfy them\u201d for now, Luke said. \u201cBut once that growth stops for them\u2026 I mean, they always have to grow.\u201dHe paused, considering what would follow. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my biggest fear.\u201d", "read_time": 1553.3999999999999, "title_html": "<h1 class=\"elevate-h1 u-marginBottom12 u-md-marginBottom8\">How the World\u2019s Biggest Brewer Killed the Craft Beer Buzz</h1>"}

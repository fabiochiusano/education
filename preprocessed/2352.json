The circular stone, 12 feet in diameter and weighing more than 24 tons, was originally painted in brilliant red, blue, yellow and white. Archaeologists believe it was placed on top of the main platform of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City), perhaps initially intended to be a sacrificial altar but then erected vertically when the massive stone cracked so it was no longer the thick drum-shape of traditional altars. </p>\n<p>It is a world-famous icon of Aztec sculpture, but there are competing theories on what the imagery carved onto the stone represents. According to the <a href=\"http://www.mna.inah.gob.mx/coleccion/pieza-243/ficha-basica.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum of Anthropology</a>, at the center of the monolith is the face of the solar deity Tonatiuh inside the glyph \u201collin\u201d meaning \u201cmovement.\u201d He holds a human heart in each hand and his tongue is the stone knife used for sacrifices. Four squares around his face contain the glyphs for the four previous cycles of creation and destruction. Concentric rings surrounding the central figure contain multiple calendar glyphs: the first ring has the glyphs for 20 of the 260 days in the Aztec calendar, the second features small boxes that may represent the 52 years of an Aztec century.

The Sun Stone was toppled and dumped carved side up on the Z\u00f3calo, the main square of Mexico City. A few decades later, Archbishop Alonso de Mont\u00fafar, the second Archbishop of Mexico, ordered the stone, which he considered an evil, satanic influence on the city\u2019s residents, flipped carved side down and buried. There it remained entirely forgotten until December 17th, 1790, when it was unearthed less than two feet under the surface by workers repaving the square. They propped it upright next to the find spot.</p>\n<p>Mexican astronomer, anthropologist, historian and writer Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama documented the find. He commissioned Francisco de Ag\u00fcera to make a highly accurate and detailed drawing of the Sun Stone, the first known image of it ever made. In 1792, Le\u00f3n y Gama published <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/descripcionhistr00leny#page/n9/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Descripci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica y cronol\u00f3gica de las dos piedras que con ocasi\u00f3n del nuevo empedrado que se esta formando en la plaza principal de M\u00e9xico, se hallaron en ella el a\u00f1o de 1790</em></a> [Historical and Chronological Description of the Two Stones that were Discovered in 1790 in the Main Square of Mexico City] about the discovery of the stone and the statue of the Aztec earth goddess Coatlicue. It was Le\u00f3n y Gama who, recognizing the calendar glyphs, interpreted the monolith as a timekeeping device, a giant sundial to mark astronomical events like solstices. His view dominated the scholarship for close to a hundred years. Even today the piece is commonly called the Aztec Calendar Stone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cathedral-with-Sun-Stone-William-Henry-Jackson-1880s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34091\" height=\"156\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cathedral-with-Sun-Stone-William-Henry-Jackson-1880s-200x156.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cathedral-with-Sun-Stone-William-Henry-Jackson-1880s-200x156.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cathedral-with-Sun-Stone-William-Henry-Jackson-1880s-150x117.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cathedral-with-Sun-Stone-William-Henry-Jackson-1880s-430x337.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cathedral with Aztec Sun Stone bottom left, colorized photograph by William Henry Jackson, 1880s\" width=\"200\"/></a>It was Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama who rescued the stone from further disrespect. The Viceroy of New Spain and the Church wanted to use the stone as a step leading up to the entrance of the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary, the church built in the shadow of the Templo Mayor ruins 20 years or so after Archbishop Alonso de Mont\u00fafar had ordered the Sun Stone buried for its satanism. Letting parishioners stomp their dirty shoes all over a sacred Aztec artifact would have been a satisfying symbol of the triumph of Christianity over paganism. It also would have been a conservation disaster. Le\u00f3n y Gama persuaded Viceroy Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, that since the stone wasn\u2019t really a pagan idol like the statue of Coatlicue, but rather a calendar, it should be properly displayed, not trampled. The stone placed on the exterior wall of the Cathedral\u2019s southwest tower where it became a popular attraction known as \u201cMontezuma\u2019s Clock.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-Monoliths-at-the-former-National-Museum-1880s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-34089\" height=\"129\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-Monoliths-at-the-former-National-Museum-1880s-200x129.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-Monoliths-at-the-former-National-Museum-1880s-200x129.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-Monoliths-at-the-former-National-Museum-1880s-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-Monoliths-at-the-former-National-Museum-1880s-430x277.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-Monoliths-at-the-former-National-Museum-1880s.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Sun Stone in the Gallery of Monoliths at the National Museum, 1887\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Aztec Sun Stone stayed on the Cathedral until 1882 when it was moved along custom-built tracks two blocks to the new National Museum. Three years after that it moved the museum\u2019s Gallery of Monoliths. In 1964, the Sun Stone was moved one last time, to the newly built National Museum of Anthropology. Now the museum can celebrate its own 50 year anniversary, the 50th anniversary of the Sun Stone\u2019s final move and the 224th anniversary of the stone\u2019s rediscovery all at the same time.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"224th anniversary of Aztec Sun Stone\u2019s rediscovery\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34073\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34073#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-34080\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34080\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Year in History Blog History\">The Year in History Blog History</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, December 30th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>And so another year ends and a new one dawns.

I had a wonderful time digging through the period newspaper articles about the controversy that exploded at the end of 1907 over the prospect of women being allowed to smoke in the public rooms of the trendy Fifth Avenue French restaurant Caf\u00e9 Martin. The story has everything: women\u2019s rights, European sophisticates versus US pearl-clutchers, a deeply corrupt politician who had knocked up at least a half-dozen dance hall girls and would soon die of syphilis lecturing women about moral behavior, and best of all, a fantasy vision of a bar filled with liberated ladies doing naughty things under the shadow of a free fudge and almonds buffet. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Courage-expels-dragon-from-castle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-29758\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Courage-expels-dragon-from-castle-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Courage-expels-dragon-from-castle-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Courage-expels-dragon-from-castle-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Courage-expels-dragon-from-castle-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Courage-expels-dragon-from-castle.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Courage expels dragon from castle, tomb of Duke Francis II of Brittany\" width=\"112\"/></a>Not as playful but perhaps even more compelling was the life story of Anne of Brittany explored on the occasion of the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29750\" target=\"_blank\">500th anniversary of her death</a>. She was so young when she had to lead men-at-arms and hurtle head-first into political gamesmanship with kings and emperors to save the independence of her homeland. The only woman to ever be queen of France twice, from the age of 14 until her death at 36, she was pregnant at least 14 times with only two daughters surviving. Between all that, she somehow she found the time to rule her duchy and introduce the art and philosophy of Renaissance humanism to France. The tomb she commissioned for her father, Duke Francis II, was the first work in the Renaissance style done in France, and since I didn\u2019t post this in the original entry, I\u2019m taking the opportunity now to glory in the phenomenal carving of the allegory of Courage defeating the dragon of Evil/Discord which as attacked the tower of Good/Conscience.

Two women standing on a jetty seeing off a party in the rowboat on a summer evening at sundown is a wistful, melancholic scene. Make it high noon and the romantic theme of separation is distinctly less emphatic.</p>\n<p>The artist painted the lake, which was then outside the old city of Copenhagen in a liminal suburb between the city and the rural country, with the express goal of getting it into the yearly exhibit of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. Rumor had it the Danish King was interested in acquiring the painting for the Royal Picture Gallery (now absorbed into the National Gallery of Denmark), and indeed, after the landscape was exhibited at the Royal Academy show in 1839, it was purchased by the monarch. <em>View of Lake Sortedam</em> was the first painting by Christen K\u00f8bke in the Royal Picture Gallery.</p>\n<p>That proved to be the pinnacle of his career during his lifetime. At the end of 1838, flush with a travel stipend from the Royal Academy, he traveled to Italy. Upon his return in 1840, he abandoned the romantic nationalism of his earlier work in favor of scenes based on sketches from his travels. These were not well received. He submitted one of those Italian landscapes in his application to become of a member of the Academy in 1846 and was rejected. Two years later he died of pneumonia at the age of just 37.</p>\n<p>The importance of <em>View of Lake Sortedam</em>, in terms of subject matter, execution and period, was not recognized for more than a century after his death. In 1841 the King had the painting moved to his private apartment in Christiansborg Castle where it remained for 25 years. It only went on public view in 1864 when it was returned to the Royal Picture Gallery. When the National Gallery was established in 1896, <em>Lake Sortedam</em> moved there with the rest of the Royal Collection of Paintings, but as recently as the 1970s it was hanging above a door, not a location commensurate with its significance. </p>\n<p>In the 1980s, art historians began to recognize the piece was one of Christen K\u00f8bke\u2019s most important paintings and it took a prominent place in exhibition of the artist\u2019s work at home and abroad. It is now considered one of the signature Danish Golden Age paintings in the collection.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/behind-frame.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34070\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/behind-frame-150x148.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/behind-frame-150x148.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/behind-frame-200x198.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/behind-frame-430x426.jpg 430w\" title=\" (a) Detail of the bottom edge of the water where the paint has been protected from the light by the frame. (b) Detail of the right-hand edge of the sky where the paint has been protected from the light by the frame.\" width=\"150\"/></a>With little attention paid to it for a century and a half after it was painted, <em>View of Lake Sortedam</em> changed without people noticing it. The contrast between the pale blue of the sky and the red of the lake had caused some art historians to wonder if it was a natural phenomenon \u2014 the sun setting out of frame to the right could make the lake red while the sky was still light \u2014 or if perhaps the color had shifted over time.</p>\n<p>Conservators at the SMK took small samples of paint from the lake and sky both in areas where they had been protected from the sun and exposed to it. The samples were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy to identify the chemical components of the paints K\u00f8bke used.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The colours have changed due to a chemical reaction in the blue pigment, which is known as Prussian blue. The colour changes have been exacerbated by 176 years of exposure to light. </p>\n<p>The sky has become paler and lighter. And the lake, which was painted using a mixture of red, blue, and white pigments, was originally a bluish grey. Now, however, it has taken on a reddish, purplish hue. The frame in which the work is set has protected the original colours out at the very edge \u2013 and this difference in colour piqued the conservator\u2019s curiosity.</p>\n<p>Kasper Monrad, senior researcher at the SMK, states that this new discovery completely changes how we should look at this painting. Up until this point the work was believed to be a romantic sunset scene. In the mid-1830s K\u00f8bke painted many romantic artworks \u2013 and this work has been regarded as part of that group.  In light of the new knowledge \u2013 that the scene actually shows a bright summer\u2019s day \u2013 the work must be regarded as far less romantic in scope.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/View-of-Sortedam-Lake-by-Christen-K\u00f8bke-1838-color-change.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-34067\" height=\"312\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/View-of-Sortedam-Lake-by-Christen-K\u00f8bke-1838-color-change-430x312.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/View-of-Sortedam-Lake-by-Christen-K\u00f8bke-1838-color-change-430x312.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/View-of-Sortedam-Lake-by-Christen-K\u00f8bke-1838-color-change-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/View-of-Sortedam-Lake-by-Christen-K\u00f8bke-1838-color-change-200x145.jpg 200w\" title='\"View of Lake Sortedam\" with rendering of original colors left, current colors right' width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"K\u00f8bke\u2019s romantic sunset is actually a sunny day\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34066\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34066#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-34050\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34050\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Charlottenburg Palace\u2019s New Wing reopens after restoration\">Charlottenburg Palace\u2019s New Wing reopens after restoration</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, December 28th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neuer_fluegel_1_01.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-34051\" height=\"127\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neuer_fluegel_1_01-200x127.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neuer_fluegel_1_01-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neuer_fluegel_1_01-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/neuer_fluegel_1_01-430x274.jpg 430w\" title=\"Charlottenburg Palace facade restored\" width=\"200\"/></a>Charlottenburg Palace, home of King Frederick the Great\u2019s first court after he ascended the throne in 1740, <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/20141223/royal-palace-restored-to-glory-after-45m-refit\" target=\"_blank\">reopened on December 26th after two years of renovations</a>. It started out as a small private retreat in Lietzow, a village a mile or so west of Berlin, commissioned in 1695 by Electress Sophie Charlotte, sister of British King George I and wife of Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. In 1701, Frederick would declare himself \u201cKing Frederick I in Prussia\u201d (the \u201cin\u201d was to assure the Holy Roman Emperor that his aspirations to kingship would not bleed across the boundaries of the empire into his role as Prince-elector of Brandenburg). </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sophie-Charlotte-Queen-of-Prussia.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34061\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sophie-Charlotte-Queen-of-Prussia-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sophie-Charlotte-Queen-of-Prussia-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sophie-Charlotte-Queen-of-Prussia-430x571.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sophie-Charlotte-Queen-of-Prussia.jpg 1434w\" title=\"Sophie Charlotte, Queen in Prussia\" width=\"112\"/></a>Once her husband\u2019s promotion made her a queen, Sophie Charlotte hired Swedish builder Johann Friedrich Eosander to expand her little country retreat into a Baroque palace modeled after Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles. There she collected poets, painters, scholars, theologians and musicians around her, creating a vibrant cultural community at her Lietzow court. She died unexpectedly of pneumonia in 1705. She was just 36 years old. In her honor, Frederick renamed the palace and the town that grew up around it Charlottenburg. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Amber-Room-in-Catherine-Palace-1931.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34063\" height=\"141\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Amber-Room-in-Catherine-Palace-1931-150x141.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Amber-Room-in-Catherine-Palace-1931-150x141.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Amber-Room-in-Catherine-Palace-1931-200x188.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Amber-Room-in-Catherine-Palace-1931-430x404.jpg 430w\" title=\"Amber Room in Catherine Palace, Tsarskoe Selo, 1931\" width=\"150\"/></a>Charlottenburg Palace was the original home of the fabled <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/183\" target=\"_blank\">Amber Room</a>. It was designed by Andreas Schl\u00fcter, the German baroque sculptor and architect who helped complete the palace after Johann Arnold Nering died in 1695, and built by Danish amber master craftsman Gottfried Wolfram. Frederick I commissioned it in 1701 in the afterglow of his coronation in K\u00f6nigsberg, a Baltic port city that had been famous for its amber artistry since the Middle Ages. K\u00f6nigsberg amber of every shade was pieced together into mosaic panels that were installed on the walls of a small game parlour in Charlottenburg Palace. Construction took a decade, from 1701 to 1711. </p>\n<p>Tsar Peter the Great remarked on the room\u2019s beauty during a visit to the palace. Recalling the tsar\u2019s appreciation, in 1716 King Frederick William I of Prussia gave the room to Peter as a diplomatic gift marking Brandenburg-Prussia\u2019s 1715 alliance with Russia against Sweden in the Great Northern War. He received \u201c55 very tall Russian soldiers\u201d in return. Frederick William shared little of his parents\u2019 interest in the arts; expanding Prussia\u2019s military was his thing, which is why he was more than willing to strip the amber off the walls to seal a military alliance and secure an elite cadre of leggy troops.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Frederick-the-Great-as-Crown-Prince-by-Antoine-Pesne-ca-1740.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34062\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Frederick-the-Great-as-Crown-Prince-by-Antoine-Pesne-ca-1740-121x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Frederick-the-Great-as-Crown-Prince-by-Antoine-Pesne-ca-1740-121x150.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Frederick-the-Great-as-Crown-Prince-by-Antoine-Pesne-ca-1740-430x528.jpg 430w\" title=\"Frederick the Great as Crown Prince by Antoine Pesne, ca. 1740\" width=\"121\"/></a>Charlottenburg, palace and town, were neglected under Frederick William\u2019s reign. He stopped all building projects and even tried to revoke the town\u2019s charter, although he did use the palace to receive state visitors and host grand family affairs. It wasn\u2019t until his son Frederick II of Prussia, later dubbed Frederick the Great, came to the throne in 1740 that Charlottenburg was returned to its former prominence. Construction resumed and Frederick commissioned the Superintendent of all the Royal Palaces, Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, to build a new east wing following Eosander\u2019s design from four decades before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Embarkation-for-Cythera-by-Antoine-Watteau-1718-9.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34059\" height=\"98\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Embarkation-for-Cythera-by-Antoine-Watteau-1718-9-150x98.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Embarkation-for-Cythera-by-Antoine-Watteau-1718-9-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Embarkation-for-Cythera-by-Antoine-Watteau-1718-9-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Embarkation-for-Cythera-by-Antoine-Watteau-1718-9-430x281.jpg 430w\" title='\"Embarkation for Cythera\" by Antoine Watteau, 1718-9, in Charlottenburg Palace collection' width=\"150\"/></a>The New Wing was lavishly appointed in rococo style. Rooms included the First and Second apartments of the King, the White Hall, the Banqueting Hall, the Golden Gallery and the Throne Room. Frederick housed his extensive collection of French paintings in the palace and later kings added a collection of marble and plaster sculptures that are excellent illustrations of the development of Berlin sculpture heavily influenced by classical Greece and Rome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/F0019491_vkopie-Ausdruck-A4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34057\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/F0019491_vkopie-Ausdruck-A4-109x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/F0019491_vkopie-Ausdruck-A4-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/F0019491_vkopie-Ausdruck-A4-200x273.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/F0019491_vkopie-Ausdruck-A4-430x588.jpg 430w\" title=\"The White Hall banquet hall after restoration\" width=\"109\"/></a>The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids in 1943 and 1945. After the war it was rebuilt, unlike many other war-damaged palaces, making it the largest surviving Hohenzollern residence in Berlin. There were additional renovations in the 1950s and 60s, but the systems installed then are now outdated, inefficient and not in compliance with energy consumption, accessibility and fire safety regulations. In 2008, a major program of refurbishment began to address all the issues of Charlottenburg Palace in a comprehensive manner. The program has been divided into 10 parts so that visitors can continue to enjoy much of the palace even as work makes some areas inaccessible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skulpturen1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34055\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skulpturen1-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skulpturen1-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skulpturen1-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skulpturen1-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sculpture collection in the New Wing vestibule\" width=\"150\"/></a>It\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.spsg.de/aktuelles/ausstellung/neuer-fluegel-im-schloss-charlottenburg/\" target=\"_blank\">the restoration of the New Wing</a> that has just ended and while some of the biggest upgrades are unseen \u2014 new insulation between roof and ceiling, new climate control systems for the White Hall and Golden Gallery, a basement full of new fire monitoring technology \u2014 the entire envelope of the building has been carefully restored, from plaster and masonry elements of the fa\u00e7ade to the windows, doors, wrought iron railings, external paint and roof tiles.

From that kernel the collection grew over the course of a year into a <a href=\"http://content.met.police.uk/Article/The-Crime-Museum/1400015334971/historicalarchives\" target=\"_blank\">permanent museum of evidence from a range of crimes</a> housed in the Met\u2019s headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place whose back entrance, No. 1 Great Scotland Yard, became a metonym for the force itself.</p>\n<p>For the first two years of its existence there are no records of the museum having any special visitors. It performed an educational function training police and Inspector Neame made certain it stuck to its purview. When a reporter from <em>The Observer</em> newspaper asked to be granted access to the museum, Neame refused spurring the reporter to print an article dubbing it \u201cthe Black Museum.\u201d The first officially recorded visitors were police bigwigs in October of 1877. After that, the museum\u2019s visitors book records a parade of celebrities including Gilbert and Sullivan, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Harry Houdini, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, all keen to take a gander at the first museum dedicated to the tools of crime and its perpetrators. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Black-Museum-nooses-used-to-hang-criminals.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34031\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Black-Museum-nooses-used-to-hang-criminals-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Black-Museum-nooses-used-to-hang-criminals-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Black-Museum-nooses-used-to-hang-criminals-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Black-Museum-nooses-used-to-hang-criminals-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Black-Museum-nooses-used-to-hang-criminals.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Nooses used to hang convicted murders on display at Scotland Yard's Black Museum\" width=\"112\"/></a>As Scotland Yard (figurative) moved from Scotland Yard (literal), first to the other end of Whitehall Place in 1890 and then to Victoria Street in 1967, the museum moved with it. The current iteration dates to 1981 and is on the first floor of New Scotland Yard on Victoria Street. It has two rooms.

Conserving this compelling artifact was an incredibly hard task, starting with the act of removing it from the ship.

It was heavily concreted, part of a hardened mass of iron corrosion salts, marine life and sediment that formed over the 141 years the wreck spent under 220 feet of salt water. The concretion had grown into the woven fiber of fabric, and removing the textile from so firm an embrace required painstakingly precise use of hand and pneumatic chisels. It took days of work just to dislodge it. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ultrasonic-dental-scaling-tools-to-remove-marine-concretion.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-34010\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ultrasonic-dental-scaling-tools-to-remove-marine-concretion-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ultrasonic-dental-scaling-tools-to-remove-marine-concretion-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ultrasonic-dental-scaling-tools-to-remove-marine-concretion-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ultrasonic-dental-scaling-tools-to-remove-marine-concretion-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ultrasonic-dental-scaling-tools-to-remove-marine-concretion.jpg 1550w\" title=\"Conservator uses ultrasonic dental scaling tools to remove marine concretion\" width=\"200\"/></a>That was just the beginning. We have very few textiles recovered from shipwrecks as they tend to decay quickly in the ocean water, so there isn\u2019t exactly a manual of how to go about preserving a Civil War-era wool coat pried out of the jaws of an iron-clad gun turret. Conservators next placed it in a long, leisurely fresh water bath to slowly leach the ocean minerals out of the fabric. It would take many, many more baths over the next decade plus. In between soakings, conservators worked on cleaning the concretions still on the surface and interior of the coat using ultrasonic dental scalers. Then they worked on removing the rust stains. </p>\n<p>They found that although the very fine merino-type wool was still in surprisingly pliable condition, the cotton threads that had stitched the sections together were long gone. Add to that the stress from the wreck and ocean living and the garment had come apart into 180 pieces. An estimated 85-90% of it had survived but far from intact, and there was no chance it could be completely stitched back together because the fabric was just too fragile. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Button-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34007\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Button-det-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Button-det-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Button-det-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Button-det-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Button-det.jpg 1550w\" title=\"Button detail\" width=\"200\"/></a>Textile conservators Colleen Callahan and Newbold Richardson reached out to the museum and conservation community to see if anybody could recognize the garment from the pieces.

It was an inside job: the thief was the parish priest, don Staurenghi. He had noble (by his standards) motives for running what proved to be a very effective, long-lasting scam. The church needed money to build an oratory, so he took it upon himself to secure funding by selling the church\u2019s Renaissance gem to an old friend from his hometown of Verolanuova who happened to be the town magistrate. </p>\n<p>To ensure their backdoor shenanigans weren\u2019t found out, the magistrate hired painter and restorer Giambattista Bertelli (who not coincidentally was also from Verolanuova) to make a copy of the painting to hang in the church. He made no bones about the nature of the gig. Bertelli was explicitly told that he had to do a really good job because his work was going to be passed off as Moretto\u2019s in the parish church and it was imperative that nobody notice the switcheroo. From October 19th until October 28th of 1944, Bertelli had the original in his studio (he would decades later note that it\u2019s much easier to forge a painting when you have the original in your workspace) while he painted the copy on a 500-year-old canvas he\u2019d sourced specifically for the job in Milan. </p>\n<p>His copy of course included a later modification of Moretto\u2019s design overpainting the Host with the three nails of the crucifixion. That iconographic alteration was the distinguishing feature of the Padernello version. While the apocryphal <em>Faith</em> deceived the faithful in church, in 1969 the original was restored to Moretto\u2019s original image of the Eucharist. I\u2019ll give you one guess who the restorer was. If you guessed Giambattista Bertelli, congratulations. Truly you have a dizzying intellect. Or you just figured out that to run a con without a false step for decades, you\u2019ve got to dance with them that brung you. Over time the copy disappeared too and the fact that the church had ever had one of Moretto\u2019s <em>Faith</em> paintings faded from memory. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Castle-of-Padernello.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-34001\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Castle-of-Padernello-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Castle-of-Padernello-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Castle-of-Padernello-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Castle-of-Padernello-430x291.jpg 430w\" title=\"Castle of Padernello\" width=\"200\"/></a>The first clue to unlock the mystery was found in 1998, 54 years after the theft, in the Castle of Padernello. A group of volunteers dedicated to the conservation of the castle were cleaning up a pile of trash in an area that had been inhabited by the family of the Counts Salvadego until the 60s when they came across a \u201csantino\u201d (a card with holy imagery, often of a saint, that was traditionally printed to hand out on the more important days of the liturgical calendar) bearing a picture of <em>Faith</em>. It was labelled \u201c<em>Faith</em>, parish of Padernello.\u201d This was evidence that one of the six Moretto <em>Faith</em> paintings had once hung in the parish church. </p>\n<p>Historian Gian Mario Andrico set to researching the whereabouts of the original. He found that the santino card had been printed by don Staurenghi for Easter of 1945, months after the copy was in place with no one the wiser (I\u2019m rather in awe of his shamelessness). A few of the old timers remembered that the painting had once hung in the chapel with the baptismal font. Then Andrico tracked down Giambattista Bertelli. Proud of his meticulously maintained records documenting his involvement in this fraud (and since I\u2019d wager his co-conspirators were dead and buried by then), Bertelli cheerfully spilled the beans.</p>\n<p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.castellodipadernello.it%2Fnews%2Fitem%2F263-un-moretto-nel-castello-di-padernello&amp;edit-text=\" target=\"_blank\">the Castle hosted an exhibition</a> entitled <em>Moretto, Faith, The Return</em> that told the story of the purloined painting and displayed another version of it from a private collection. The Carabinieri used the catalogue from this exhibition as the starting point for an official investigation this year. It only took them a few months to locate the long-lost work along with a black-and-white photograph of it from the late 1960s. The magistrate had sold it to an antiques dealer who in turn sold it to the businessman in Brescia. </p>\n<p>The art squad searched the church and found an altarpiece painting on the theme of the Sacred Heart that when viewed against the light showed anomalous elements. To ensure they had located the Padernello <em>Faith</em> instead of another version by the master or a copy, the police took the sequestered <em>Faith</em>, the black-and-white photograph and the altarpiece an to the laboratory of the Physics department of the State University of Milan for analysis. Infrared reflectography confirmed that the photograph was of the painting found in the apartment with it and that it was Moretto\u2019s original. X-ray imaging found that the altarpiece had painted over a large cross that matched the one held by the allegorical Faith.

It was found by Cambridge doctoral student Giovanni Varelli who was looking through the British Library\u2019s manuscript collections for medieval musical notations. On the last page of Harley 3019, a four-part composite manuscript written in northwest Germany in the early 10th century, Varelli found an inscription that he recognized as Paleofrankish notation, a style that predates the invention of the stave and of which few manuscripts have survived. </p>\n<p>Written on the blank space underneath the conclusion of the hagiography of the late 4th century Saint Maternianus, 6th Bishop of Reims, the inscription consists of two short antiphons (responsory chants): one antiphon honoring St. Boniface martyr and one <em>Rex caelestium terrestrium</em>, praising God as king of heaven and earth. Above the four lines of the antiphons are a series of symbols, vertical lines topped with horizontal dashes with circles on the bottom. An expert in early music notation, Varelli realized that the symbols represented the two melodies of the first chant. The dashes are the main melody of the chant; the circles are a second lower melody to accompany the first. Their placement along the vertical lines indicates the pitch. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Notation-det.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33991\" height=\"78\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Notation-det-200x78.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Notation-det-200x78.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Notation-det-150x59.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Notation-det-430x169.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Notation-det.jpg 1230w\" title=\"Organum notation detail\" width=\"200\"/></a>A chant with a second melody either above or below it in pitch is known as an organum, an early form of polyphonic music. Although two- and three-part polyphony is discussed in theoretical treatises on musical theory in the 9th and 10th century, this manuscript is the earliest known instance of polyphony as part of a performance tradition rather than something explored in theory. Before this discovery, the earliest known organa were collected in a manuscript called the Winchester Troper, written around the year 1000. </p>\n<blockquote><p>As well as its age, the piece is also significant because it deviates from the convention laid out in treatises at the time. This suggests that even at this embryonic stage, composers were experimenting with form and breaking the rules of polyphony almost at the same time as they were being written.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting here is that we are looking at the birth of polyphonic music and we are not seeing what we expected,\u201d Varelli said.</p>\n<p>\u201cTypically, polyphonic music is seen as having developed from a set of fixed rules and almost mechanical practice. This changes how we understand that development precisely because whoever wrote it was breaking those rules. It shows that music at this time was in a state of flux and development, the conventions were less rules to be followed, than a starting point from which one might explore new compositional paths.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The manuscript is part of the Harley Collection, the library of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, and his son, Edward Harley. 2nd Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, which was rapidly assembled from firesales abroad and in London in the first half of the 18th century. Edward\u2019s widow and daughter sold the entire library \u2014 more than 7,000 manuscripts, 14,000 charters and 500 rolls \u2014 to the nation for \u00a310,000, a steal even then. The acquistion required an act of Parliament, namely the British Museum Act of 1753, the same act that paid Sir Hans Sloane\u2019s heirs \u00a320,000 for his collection of 71,000 objects consisting of books, manuscripts and natural history specimens, antiquities, coins, prints, drawings and ethnographic material to make them the kernel of the country\u2019s first public museum. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Piece-in-modern-notation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33993\" height=\"103\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Piece-in-modern-notation-150x103.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Piece-in-modern-notation-150x103.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Piece-in-modern-notation-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Piece-in-modern-notation-430x296.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Piece-in-modern-notation.jpg 800w\" title=\"Chant in modern notation\" width=\"150\"/></a>Harley 3019 made no particular impression on the curators of the newly minted British Museum. The weird writing at the end of the manuscipt was so insignificant to them, in fact, that they slapped the \u201cMuseum Britannicum\u201d stamp right on top of it.

Sweden had a 90% literacy rate in 1850, one of the highest in the world, so a larger than usual proportion of the farmers and labourers who sought out a new life in the prairies and cities of the Midwest could read and write. As a result, more than 600 Swedish-language newspapers were established in the United States, second only in number to the German-language press. Initially it was religious newsletters tied to a particular church or denomination that gained a foothold in the immigrant communities, but after the Civil War the Swedish secular press flourished. These newspapers were vital sources of news from the motherland and around the world, information on how to acclimate to their new country (recipes for unfamiliar foods, English language lessons, tackling political issues, etc.). </p>\n<p>Most of the Swedish papers are now available only in libraries, historical societies and institutions of higher learning, either in microfilm/microfiche format or in large bound volumes of paper issues. Come next year, that will change.

They reached out to the National Swedish Library and the project took off. (Relevant side-note: The American Swedish Institute is housed in a beautiful French chateau-style 1903 mansion in downtown Minneapolis that once belonged to Swan Turnblad, owner and publisher of the Swedish-language weekly <em>Svenska Amerikanska Posten</em>, peak circulation 40,000. After his wife died in 1929, Turnblad donated the mansion, the <em>Posten</em> and the <em>Posten</em>\u2018s office building to the American Institute for Swedish Art, Literature and Science, today known as the American Swedish Institute. The paper went out of business in 1940.) </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Minnesota Historical Society has been in the business of digitizing newspapers for nearly a decade, said Jennifer Jones, director of library and collections. Its digitized newspaper collection includes such defunct papers as the St. Paul Globe and Minneapolis Journal, and African-American and Ojibwe-language publications. Collecting and preserving newspapers is part of the society\u2019s mission, mandated by state law requiring all newspapers that publish public notices to archive their publications.</p>\n<p>The Royal Swedish Library has completed the digitization of about two dozen Swedish-American newspapers, Jones said. The national library has collected virtually everything printed in the Swedish language since 1661, and had original copies, which are superior to drawing from microfilm in the digitizing process.</p>\n<p>The Historical Society, Jones said, is now taking the lead on the final phase of the project: making those images easily accessible.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince we have all the background in making that successful, we can build on that,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe real challenge for us is trying to find a way to make something written in Swedish usable for people in the United States.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Peggy-Korsmo-Kennon-of-the-American-Swedish-Institute-with-a-bound-volume-of-the-Svenska-Amerikanska-Posten.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33970\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Peggy-Korsmo-Kennon-of-the-American-Swedish-Institute-with-a-bound-volume-of-the-Svenska-Amerikanska-Posten-200x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Peggy-Korsmo-Kennon-of-the-American-Swedish-Institute-with-a-bound-volume-of-the-Svenska-Amerikanska-Posten-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Peggy-Korsmo-Kennon-of-the-American-Swedish-Institute-with-a-bound-volume-of-the-Svenska-Amerikanska-Posten-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Peggy-Korsmo-Kennon-of-the-American-Swedish-Institute-with-a-bound-volume-of-the-Svenska-Amerikanska-Posten-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Peggy Korsmo-Kennon of the American Swedish Institute with a bound volume of the Svenska Amerikanska Posten.

The idea is to make these invaluable resources on the history and developement of Swedish immigrant communities in the United States accessible to everyone, so they\u2019re working on a solution that will provide more accurate English translations of the papers. </p>\n<p>After six years of work, the digitization project is almost done. The plan is to launch the database next year. At first it will be made available to genealogists, researchers, people of Swedish descent looking for information about their families. In 2016, it will be opened to the general public, hopefully with the translation issues resolved.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"US Swedish-language newspapers digitized\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33968\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33968#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-33961\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33961\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 17th c. mourning ring declared treasure\">17th c. mourning ring declared treasure</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, December 22nd, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mourning-ring-treasure.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-33962\" height=\"333\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mourning-ring-treasure-430x333.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mourning-ring-treasure-430x333.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mourning-ring-treasure-150x116.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mourning-ring-treasure-200x154.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mourning-ring-treasure.jpg 991w\" title=\"Gold mourning ring, 17th c., declared treasure\" width=\"430\"/></a></center><br/>\nA mourning ring discovered by a metal detectorist in a field in Pennard, Swansea, Wales, <a href=\"http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Swansea-man-set-finder-s-fee-discovering-300-year/story-25751098-detail/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">was officially declared treasure</a> by a Swansea Coroners Court on Monday. According to the terms of the 1996 Treasure Act, any artifact that is at least 10% precious metal by weight and at least 300 years old is treasure and thus property of the Crown. The ring is 81% gold and 9% silver, and although experts were unable to give it a precise date, the decoration strongly suggests it\u2019s from the 17th century. The outside of the ring in engraved with a cross-hatch or trellis pattern inlaid with black enamel. The inside is inscribed \u201cprepared bee to follow me,\u201d a common expression in 17th century mourning jewelry. The double-e spelling of \u201cbee\u201d is characteristic of the second half of the 1600s. </p>\n<p>The finder is 71-year-old Ron Pitman who unearthed the ring in October of 2010 in a field used to grow corn. All the farming activity on the field left the ring just five inches below the surface. Now that the piece has been declared treasure, Pitman and the landowners (the Layton family) will split a finder\u2019s fee in the amount of its market value as determined by a committee of experts at the <a href=\"http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff/\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum in Cardiff</a>. A local museum will be given the first opportunity to pay the fee and keep the ring. The <a href=\"http://www.swanseamuseum.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Swansea Museum</a> has already expressed interest. </p>\n<p>The late 17th century saw a great boom in mourning jewelry thanks to the Great Plague of London (1665-6). Indeed, one of the rings experts used as a comparison in their assessment because of its nearly identical inscription \u2014 \u201cPrepared bee to followe me\u201d \u2014 dates to 1667. It would see a whole new surge in popularity 1861, inspired by Queen Victoria\u2019s perpetual mourning for her husband Prince Albert. In the 19th century mourning jewelry would expand from the slender blackened rings of the 1600s to a wide variety of pieces \u2014 brooches, lockets, pendants, miniatures, rings with glass or gemstone windows in which a lock of hair of the deceased could be kept and much more. </p>\n<p>If you\u2019re at all interested in the history of mourning jewelry and art, run, don\u2019t walk, to Hayden Peters\u2019 exceptional blog <a href=\"http://artofmourning.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Mourning</a>. He\u2019s a jewelry historian with an extensive collection of mourning pieces that he writes about, using the jewels and art as a prism through which to explore personal and societal approaches to loss and grief. His blog is a consistently fascinating, touching and beautiful read.

Anthropology in Mexico City\" width=\"200\"/></a>On Wednesday, December 17th, Mexico City celebrated the 224th anniversary of the rediscovery of the Aztec Sun Stone, the basalt monolith carved under the reign of Moctezuma II just a few years before the Spanish conquest. The circular stone, 12 feet in diameter and weighing more than 24 tons, was originally painted in brilliant red, blue, yellow and white. Archaeologists believe it was placed on top of the main platform of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City), perhaps initially intended to be a sacrificial altar but then erected vertically when the massive stone cracked so it was no longer the thick drum-shape of traditional altars. </p>\n<p>It is a world-famous icon of Aztec sculpture, but there are competing theories on what the imagery carved onto the stone represents. According to the <a href=\"http://www.mna.inah.gob.mx/coleccion/pieza-243/ficha-basica.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum of Anthropology</a>, at the center of the monolith is the face of the solar deity Tonatiuh inside the glyph \u201collin\u201d meaning \u201cmovement.\u201d He holds a human heart in each hand and his tongue is the stone knife used for sacrifices. Four squares around his face contain the glyphs for the four previous cycles of creation and destruction. Concentric rings surrounding the central figure contain multiple calendar glyphs: the first ring has the glyphs for 20 of the 260 days in the Aztec calendar, the second features small boxes that may represent the 52 years of an Aztec century.

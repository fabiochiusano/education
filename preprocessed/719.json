The ink on parchment manuscript was signed by the Pope and 13 cardinals, among them Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, recently appointed Cardinal-Deacon of the titular church of St. Nicola in Carcere and future Pope Nicholas III. Accompanying the parchment is the lead seal (<em>bulla</em> in Latin, which gives the decree its name) at the end of a tassel of blue ribbon and red and yellow silk cords. It\u2019s no longer attached to the document, but it\u2019s otherwise in excellent condition.</p>\n<p>The bull is a beautiful document. It\u2019s 2 by 1.8 feet in dimension and penned in a glorious hand on sheepskin or calfskin parchment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Highlights include the first line, which boasts elongated letters referred to as <em>litterae elongatae</em>. Meanwhile, a circular Papal monogram called a rota (Latin for \u201cwheel\u201d) features a cross \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 likely penned by the Pope himself. Every sentence ends in a particular rhythmical cadence called cursus, similar in effect to a poem.</p></blockquote>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Papal-bull-beginning-Don-Erhardt.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Detail of first line.

Pope Innocent IV was on the run from Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, <em>stupor mundi</em>, whose troops were besieging Rome. He escaped through Liguria reaching Lyons, which was conveniently located just outside of Frederick\u2019s territory, in December of 1244 and in the beginning of the new year called an ecumenical council for June. Although Frederick sent three representatives of his own, many of the prelates from his German and Sicilian territories were too intimidated to attend. Turmoil in the east kept many others away. In the end attendants were primarily from France and Spain.</p>\n<p>On the agenda at this council was the dignity of the Church (the rule that cardinals had to wear red hats was first promulgated at Lyons), reconquest of the Holy Land, dealing with the Mongol Empire\u2019s invasions of eastern and central Europe, and last but most certainly not least, addressing the conflict between papacy and empire. On July 17th, the council issued the bull <a href=\"http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum13.htm#Bull of excommunication\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ad Apostolicae Dignitatis Apicem</em></a> which excommunicated and deposed Emperor Frederick II on the grounds that he\u2019d broken oaths he made to the Church, forcibly detained delegates on their way to an earlier council and was probably a heretic anyway, complete with a harem, eunuchs and Saracen guards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bulla-front-Don-Erhardt.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Papal seal reverse.

Image by Don Erhardt.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The bull at the UBC Library was issued on July 30th, three days after the pope excommunicated and deposed the Holy Roman Emperor. It confirmed the benefices and properties of the Poor Clares in the church of Saint Michael in Trento, placing them under the direct protection of the Holy See. As minor an issue as this may seem compared to the excommunication of an emperor, it was all part of the rich tapestry of flipping Frederick the bird.</p>\n<p>In 1027 Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II had established the Bishopric of Trent, an area roughly equivalent to the modern autonomous region of Trentino, as an ecclesiastical principality. Conrad deemed bishops less likely to cause trouble than German princes and Trentino was strategically important because two transalpine Roman roads connecting what is today southern Germany to northern Italy crossed through it. The Bishops were strong allies of the Emperor against local lords for two centuries. In 1236, Frederick II deposed the bishops and reclaimed direct imperial authority over Trento, appointing his personal friend Ezzelino III da Romano as viceroy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Abbess Palmeria of the Poor Clares had received the church of Saint Michael in Trento and its associated benefices from Bishop Gerald Oscasali in 1229. In 1237, the year after Frederick deposed the Bishop of Trent, Pope Gregory IX wrote to the secular authorities in Trento to complain about them harassing the sisters and levying taxes on donations to the convent. By placing the Saint Michael convent under the protection of the Holy See, the 1245 Papal bull was drawing yet another line in the sand between Church and State: this is ours and your laws/taxes/claims don\u2019t apply.</p>\n<p>As an aside, the question of donations was a thorny one from a religious perspective as well, since whether the Poor Clares could own property was a raging debate. Clare herself was still alive and not yet a saint when all this was going down. There was no Rule yet. The Clares lived according to strictures drawn up by Gregory when he was bishop. Innocent IV\u2019s bull asserted their right to financial self-sufficiency, to possessions, one of a series of similar decisions from a number of popes that would materially alter the original brief of the mendicant orders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"British Columbia library acquires 13th c.

The grave goods and associated burial rites indicate the interred were of relatively low social status, which means at least some of the poorer Altai nomads had access to quite high level health care. The types of graves and funerary rituals are all different, suggesting the subjects came from diverse cultural groups. One of the skulls was excavated from mound three at the Bikeh III burial ground. It belonged to a male between 50 and 60 years old and dates to the 5th\u20134th centuries B.C. A second skull, excavated from a cyst grave in Kyzyl-Dzhar IV mound two, is that of a woman who died at around 30 years of age. The last is from an undercut, timber-frame grave in Kyzyl Dzhar V mound three and is the skull of a man aged 40-45. Both date to around the 4th-3rd centuries B.C.</p>\n<p>Using multi-slice computer tomography scans, researchers first examined the skulls in minute detail to identify any damage or defect that led to the surgeries and to analyze the methods and tools used by the ancient surgeons.</p>\n<p>T<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Male-skull-Kyzyl-Dzhar-V.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Skull from Kyzyl-Dzhar-V, 40-year-old man, 4th-3rd c.

This was not a dangerous or painful condition at this point in his life and there\u2019s no sign of trauma or tumors, so it\u2019s not obvious why surgical intervention was attempted. Whatever was ailing him, it didn\u2019t leave tell-tale signs on the cranium. The skull of the woman bears evidence of severe trauma: fractures in the right temporal bone and at the base of the middle cranial fossa, possibly caused by a fall from a height. The skull of the 40-year-old man indicates he suffered significant head trauma causing damage to his left temporal and parietal bones. That injury resulted in a hematoma \u2014 bleeding in the brain that forms a clot \u2014 which would have inflicted a variety of painful symptoms including headaches, vomiting and difficulty moving his right limbs.</p>\n<p>Both men had pieces of their left parietal bone removed. The older gentleman\u2019s skull has a semi-oval hole that is 45 by 52 mm (1.8 by 2 inches) at the outer perimeter with an inner hole of 22 by 34 mm (.87 by 1.34 inches). The younger fellow\u2019s skull has a round hole that is 63 mm by 64 mm (2.5 inches) on the outside, 40 mm by 41 mm (1.6 inches) on the inside. The young woman\u2019s skull has an irregular round trepanation hole in the back of the parietal bones centered on the sagittal suture. It\u2019s 39 mm by 36 mm (1.5 by 1.4 inches) on the outside, 23 mm by 16 mm (.9 by .6 inches) on the inside. The inner and outer measurements are a result of a two-stage process: first a larger surface layer of bone was cut out with a sharp tool leaving a thin layer of skull, then a hole was cut into the thinned out bone with short, frequent movements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Woman-skull-Kyzyk-Dzhar-IV.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Skull from Kyzyk-Dzhar-IV, 30-year-old woman, 4th-3rd c.\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34606\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Woman-skull-Kyzyk-Dzhar-IV-142x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Woman-skull-Kyzyk-Dzhar-IV-142x150.jpg 142w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Woman-skull-Kyzyk-Dzhar-IV-430x451.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Woman-skull-Kyzyk-Dzhar-IV.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Skull from Kyzyk-Dzhar-IV, 30-year-old woman, 4th-3rd c.\" width=\"142\"/></a>The men\u2019s skulls both have extensive bone regrowth at the surgical sites, which means they survived and went on to live for years after the operation. The woman was not so lucky. She died either during surgery or right after it, and little wonder since her surgeon did an atrocious job. The surgeons who operated on the men cut holes that were just large enough to address the problem (remove the hematoma from the younger man; possibly remove parasites from the older one) and at a safe distance from the sagittal sinus, into which all the major veins from the top of the skull open. The woman\u2019s trepanation hole is right above the superior sagittal sinus, so it\u2019s a fair assumption that she died from massive bleeding.</p>\n<p>The two successful surgeries were performed with distinct finesse by knowledgable surgeons. They may have developed this knowledge independently, perhaps developed from expertise in embalming, from the fast and thorough butchering of stock and game that a nomadic existence requires, or from making objects out of animal bone, a craft that was extensively practiced by the Altai nomads in the 5th century. There\u2019s also a chance they may have had contact with western medical practices during war, trade or travel. Hippocrates wrote the treatise <em>On Head Injuries</em> in the 5th or early 4th century B.C. which specifically addressed the importance of avoiding the blood geyser areas of the brain when digging holes into the skull.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Knives-saw-Minusinsk-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Knives (a-e) and saw (f) from Minusinsk Museum\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34612\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Knives-saw-Minusinsk-Museum-122x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Knives-saw-Minusinsk-Museum-122x150.jpg 122w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Knives-saw-Minusinsk-Museum-200x245.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Knives-saw-Minusinsk-Museum-430x528.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Knives-saw-Minusinsk-Museum.jpg 717w\" title=\"Knives (a-e) and saw (f) from Minusinsk Museum\" width=\"122\"/></a>Since even with today\u2019s technology scraping or cutting or grinding bone leaves particles from the tool on the bone, the team tested the new bone growth on the two men who survived the operation for material that would identify which kind of tool was used. X-ray fluorescence and mass-spectrometric analyses discovered particles of copper and tin, which means the skulls were cut with a bronze instrument. The lack of arsenic further narrows it down to stannic bronze which at the time of the burials was being used in the Minusinsk Basin. The Martyanov Museum in Minusinsk has a large collection of stannic bronze tools \u2014 knives, saws, lancets, tweezers, probes \u2014 that archaeologists have posited had a surgical purpose. Unfortunately they were not excavated in context (looters sold them to the museum in the late 19th, early 20th century), so it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a date of manufacture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Experimental-knife.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Experimental brass knife\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34613\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Experimental-knife-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Experimental-knife-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Experimental-knife-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Experimental-knife-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Experimental-knife.jpg 718w\" title=\"Experimental brass knife\" width=\"150\"/></a>Neurosurgeon Dr. Aleksei Krivoshapkin first tried to use one of the blades from the museum on a skull, but it was too soft and couldn\u2019t get purchase on the bone.

The tacks are made of an unknown metal and are corroded to a green color. </p>\n<p>When researchers first examined the niche with an endoscope microcamera, they saw bone material, but they appeared to be a mix of at least 10 different individuals, including the remains of at least one infant. The mixture of skeletal remains and their position at the foot of the enclosure suggested this was not a primary burial but the result of a reinterral.

Earlier that morning the press had been allowed into the crypt to take pictures and observe the CSI-style team at work (<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34549\" target=\"_blank\">hence this story</a>). There was some excitement at the time when a group of researchers gathered around one of the gravesites found 4.8 meters under the floor which was outlined by a perimeter of bricks. Those remains turned out to be those of a young child under seven years of age at time of death.</p>\n<p>It was Sunday when the team realized upon close examination of the coffin pieces that while moisture and insects had caused the coffin to fall to pieces, a significant piece from the head of the wooden casket had survived. Because sometimes in life luck happens, that piece had the initials tacked into it.</p>\n<p>As suggestive as this find is, it doesn\u2019t allow anything like a conclusion right now. There could have been another individual with the initials M.C. buried in the convent crypt. It could have been Cervantes\u2019 coffin but his bones may have been lost in transit. It could be his coffin and his bones but we\u2019ll never know because the remains are insufficient to determine identity. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Forensic-team-in-crypt.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34594\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Forensic-team-in-crypt-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Forensic-team-in-crypt-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Forensic-team-in-crypt-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Forensic-team-in-crypt-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Forensic-team-in-crypt.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Forensic team separating out bones in the crypt\" width=\"200\"/></a>The forensic anthropologists are now separating out all the bones exhumed from the niche. First the bones of children, which are easily distinguished from those of adults, will be isolated from the pile. Then the team will arrange the rest by sex and examine any adult male remains for indications that they once formed the endoskeletal structure of the great writer of the Spanish Golden Age: atrophy in the metacarpals of the left hand and bullet wounds in the chest from shots Cervantes took at the Battle of Lepanto, advanced tooth loss, kyphosis (aka, a hunchback) brought on by severe arthritis.</p>\n<p>In addition to osteological evidence, researchers are also looking at the coffin itself to see if its consistent with the coffin that would have held Cervantes. The wood can be radiocarbon dated, or maybe even tree-ring dated if their luck holds, and textile fragments amidst the decaying organic material may be identifiable as part of the Franciscan religious habit in which Cervantes, who joined the Third Order of St. Francis shortly before his death, was buried. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Coffin initialed \u201cM.C.\u201d found in Cervantes search\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34589\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34589#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-34572\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34572\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Spain planned to invade Australia with an armada\">Spain planned to invade Australia with an armada</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, January 28th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Documents discovered in the archives of the Spanish navy reveal that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11369341/Spain-planned-to-invade-the-British-colony-in-Australia-in-1790s-with-100-vessel-armada.html\" target=\"_blank\">Spain planned to invade the nascent British colony in Australia</a> in the mid-1790s.

The convicts started coming right away, as the prisoner transport system to Britain\u2019s colonies had been painfully cut off since 1776 by the Revolutionary War and subsequent independence. By 1792, there were more than 4,000 convicts populating Sydney, but since food was scarce and disease was rife, they would not have been able to put up much of a fight against a Spanish armada. Any Spanish victory would likely have been of short duration, however, as Britain had a much stronger navy and army and could have reclaimed the colony with minimal effort.</p>\n<p>Spain\u2019s concern was that a British colony in the Pacific would be a grave threat to the crown\u2019s holdings in South America and the Philippines, a concern first articulated by Spanish naval officer Francisco Mu\u00f1oz y San Clemente only months after the colony was founded. He reported that the convict colonists would be well positioned to act as privateers and harry Spanish shipping between the Philippines and the Americas. Once it had developed a full naval presence, the Australia colony would be able to launch a full-scale invasion of Spain\u2019s holdings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alessandro-Malaspina-Anonymous.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Alessandro Malaspina, Anonymous, ca. 1800\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34573\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alessandro-Malaspina-Anonymous-109x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alessandro-Malaspina-Anonymous-109x150.jpg 109w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alessandro-Malaspina-Anonymous-200x273.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alessandro-Malaspina-Anonymous-430x587.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Alessandro-Malaspina-Anonymous.jpg 896w\" title=\"Alessandro Malaspina, Anonymous, ca. 1800\" width=\"109\"/></a>That same year, 1788, Italian nobleman, explorer and Spanish naval officer Alessandro Malaspina and Jos\u00e9 de Bustamante y Guerra proposed a Pacific expedition modeled after Cook\u2019s. The government approved the expedition and each man had a corvette custom-built for the voyage.

Over the next five years, they traveled from the east coast of South America around Cape Horn to the west coast and up north to Mexico, then detoured to Alaska on orders to search yet again for the mythical Northwest Passage. From Alaska they went back to Mexico, then west to Manila and south to Doubtful Sound on New Zealand\u2019s South Island.

Port Jackson was indeed a danger to Spain\u2019s overseas possessions because </p>\n<blockquote><p>with the greatest ease a crossing of two or three months through healthy climates, and a secure navigation, could bring to our defenceless coasts two or three thousand castaway bandits to serve interpolated with an excellent body of regular troops. It would not be surprising that in this case \u2014 the women also sharing the risks as well as the sensual pleasures of the men \u2014 the history of the invasions of the Huns and Alans in the most fertile provinces of Europe would be revived in our surprised colonies. \u2026 The pen trembles to record the image, however distant, of such disorders.</p></blockquote>\n<p>All those prostitutes, forgers and pickpockets wouldn\u2019t just band up with the regular troops to make a formidable invasion force, but then they\u2019d settle down and have lots of reproductive sex just like those German barbarian ancestors of the British monarch did. </p>\n<p>Despite the trembling of his pen, Malaspina did not advocate a military response to this threat. He believed the worst case scenario could be prevented by opening trade between Chile, the Philippines and Sydney. Why fight lusty convicts when you can do business with them and make it very much in their interest not to interrupt the flow of Chilean beef and Philippine spices? Malaspina had witnessed firsthand how hard-scrabble an existence the colonists eked out. They had little livestock, pulled their own carts and plows, and rarely ate meat. Spanish products would prove addictive, he thought, and instead of spending money trying to squash the colony, the crown would profit handsomely while achieving its ultimate goal of defanging the Australian menace.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Godoy-as-General-Francisco-de-Goya-1801.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='\"Godoy as General\" by Francisco de Goya, 1801' class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-34580\" height=\"134\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Godoy-as-General-Francisco-de-Goya-1801-200x134.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Godoy-as-General-Francisco-de-Goya-1801-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Godoy-as-General-Francisco-de-Goya-1801-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Godoy-as-General-Francisco-de-Goya-1801-430x289.jpg 430w\" title='\"Godoy as General\" by Francisco de Goya, 1801' width=\"200\"/></a>From Port Jackson, Malaspina and Bustamante made one last stop \u2014 Tonga \u2014 before returning to Cadiz in September of 1794. King Charles IV and Manuel de Godoy, the king\u2019s prime minister and puppet master (and probably the queen\u2019s lover), welcomed Malaspina back, promoting him to fleet-brigadier for his efforts. The good vibes didn\u2019t last. In late 1795 Malaspina was caught conspiring to overthrow Godoy and the next year was tried for plotting against the state. Although the trial did not result in a conviction, in April of 1796 Charles IV stripped him of his naval rank and sent him to jail in the fortress of San Ant\u00f3n in La Coru\u00f1a, Galicia, where he remained imprisoned until 1802.</p>\n<p>Bustamante did not share in his colleague\u2019s disgrace. He was promoted to navy brigadier after their return and remained in the crown\u2019s good graces. In 1795, Spain was compelled to declare war on Great Britain by its ally France. Even if Malaspina hadn\u2019t gotten on Godoy\u2019s shitlist, his proposal for a mercantile approach to Australia wasn\u2019t suited to the new circumstances. Instead, in 1796 Bustamante was appointed governor of Paraguay and Commander General of the fleet of R\u00edo de la Plata, in charge of the military defense of Spain\u2019s South American colonies, and, as we now know, a pre-emptive military attack on Port Jackson.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The archival documents show that Jose de Bustamante y Guerra, the deputy commander of the Spanish expedition, subsequently proposed an invasion of the colony to King Carlos IV and his ministers. The government sent Bustamante to a new military post at Montevideo in Uruguay and he began to build a small fleet of attack vessels.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the military and naval commander, Bustamante was tasked to both defend South America from an anticipated British invasion, and to take the fight to the British in the Pacific,\u201d Mr Maxworthy said.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charles-IV-of-Spain-and-his-Family-Goya-1800.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='\"Charles IV of Spain and his Family\" by Goya, 1800.

When Godoy switched allegiance to Great Britain after Trafalgar and then back to France after Napoleon\u2019s defeat of Prussia in 1807, it made King Charles IV look like even more of a weakling than everyone (including court painter Francisco de Goya who consistently depicted him as a rotund, confused country squire better suited to hunting than absolute rule) already thought he was.</p>\n<p>Charles\u2019 son Ferdinand favored an alliance with Britain and after one attempted coup by the Crown Prince and several riots by his supporters, on March 19th, 1808, King Carlos IV abdicated in favor of his son who became King Ferdinand VII.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Spain planned to invade Australia with an armada\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34572\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34572#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-34556\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34556\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Samuel Morse the artist\">Samuel Morse the artist</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, January 27th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Samuel-Morse-Self-portrait-1812.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34561\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Samuel-Morse-Self-portrait-1812-125x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Samuel-Morse-Self-portrait-1812-125x150.jpg 125w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Samuel-Morse-Self-portrait-1812-200x239.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Samuel-Morse-Self-portrait-1812-430x514.jpg 430w\" title=\"Samuel Morse Self-portrait, 1812\" width=\"125\"/></a>Before Samuel Morse developed the code that bears his name and patented the electromagnetic telegraph, he was a painter and a successful one at that. His teacher, Washington Allston, known today primarily for his Romantic landscapes, took the 20-year-old Samuel to study painting in England in 1811. In London he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Arts where instruction was focused on copying the works of the Renaissance Old Masters, drawing casts of ancient sculptures and live figure drawing. Morse\u2019s works from this period were heavily influenced by the likes of Michelangelo and Raphael and were often mythological in theme, like 1812\u2019s <a href=\"http://ecatalogue.art.yale.edu/detail.htm?objectId=224\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dying Hercules</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Morse and Allston spent four years in England as the War of 1812 raged. When Morse returned to the United States in 1815, he made a name for himself as a portrait painter, receiving commissions from wealthy socialites and dignitaries like former President John Adams and Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette. He hit the road again in 1830, traveling through Italy, Switzerland and France to learn from observing the original works of the Old Masters he had studied copies of in London.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Marquis-de-Lafayette-1825-6.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34562\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 98px) 100vw, 98px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Marquis-de-Lafayette-1825-6-98x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Marquis-de-Lafayette-1825-6-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Marquis-de-Lafayette-1825-6-196x300.jpg 196w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Marquis-de-Lafayette-1825-6-430x656.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Marquis-de-Lafayette-1825-6.jpg 1257w\" title=\"Marquis de Lafayette by Samuel Morse, 1825-6\" width=\"98\"/></a>When he was in Paris in September of 1831, Morse conceived a monumental painting of the Salon Carr\u00e9 in the Louvre that would include dozens of the museum\u2019s masterpieces. The works aren\u2019t actually arranged in the one room when he painted them; this was a gallery picture, a fantasy arrangement of art in a single scene. Morse\u2019s <em>Gallery of the Louvre</em> is the only major example of a gallery picture in American art history. </p>\n<p>He squeezed 38 paintings and two sculptures from the Louvre collection into the six-by-nine-foot canvas, plus additional figures of museum visitors and copyists. Anthony Van Dyck and Titian have the most works on display with four apiece. Other artists represented are Tintoretto, Veronese, Leonardo da Vinci, Rubens, Poussin, Raphael, Rembrandt, Reni, Watteau, Correggio and Caravaggio. <a href=\"http://www.terraamericanart.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Key_to_People_and_Art_in_Samuel_Morse_Gallery_of_the_Louvre.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Click here (pdf)</a> for a complete key to all the works and people in the painting.  </p>\n<p>He worked assiduously between September of 1831 and August of 1832 to copy the works he wished to include, some of which were positioned high on the walls. He built a moveable scaffold and lugged it around the vast halls of the Louvre so he could be at eye level with his subjects. Morse painting on his scaffold became something of a tourist draw in its own right. He also had to do a fair amount of math in composing this work. He had to calculate the proper scale and to figure out how they should be arranged on the canvas. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-the-Louvre-by-Samuel-F.-B.-Morse-1831\u201333.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-34559\" height=\"136\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-the-Louvre-by-Samuel-F.-B.-Morse-1831\u201333-200x136.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-the-Louvre-by-Samuel-F.-B.-Morse-1831\u201333-200x136.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-the-Louvre-by-Samuel-F.-B.-Morse-1831\u201333-150x102.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gallery-of-the-Louvre-by-Samuel-F.-B.-Morse-1831\u201333-430x292.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gallery of the Louvre by Samuel F.

The trio in the back left corner are Morse\u2019s good friend James Fenimore Cooper (who he hoped would buy the completed work) and Cooper\u2019s wife and daughter. The woman sketching an art work in the center of the composition is Morse\u2019s daughter, Susan Walker Morse. The man behind her giving her pointers is Morse himself. That sweet scene was symbolic of his purpose in creating this piece: to teach American artists and audiences about the important works of European art. He was also underscoring the value of a great public museum of art to artists and regular people, an institution that the United States lacked. </p>\n<p>(Philadelphia\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.pafa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</a> was founded in 1805 by artist and collector Charles Willson Peale, among others, but its collection at the time was casts of ancient sculptures. Coincidentally, the first major acquisition of the museum was a work by none other than Washington Allston: his monumental 1816 work <a href=\"http://www.pafa.org/museum/The-Collection-Greenfield-American-Art-Resource/Tour-the-Collection/Category/Collection-Detail/985/mkey--1/view--True/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Dead Man Restored to Life by Touching the Bones of the Prophet Elisha</em></a>. They had to mortgage the building to buy it. </p>\n<p>The first public art museum in the United States was the <a href=\"http://thewadsworth.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Wadsworth Atheneum</a>, founded in 1842 by Daniel Wadsworth, a great patrons of the arts, who seeded the new museum with many works from his personal collection.)</p>\n<p>When the Louvre closed its doors for its yearly August vacation, Morse rolled up the canvas and packed it until his return to the United States in late 1832. He applied the finishing touches to the painting in late 1833 and exhibited the finished work in New York and New Haven. Morse hoped it would be a sensation, drawing huge crowds to pay the price of admission and securing him a much-desired commission for a painting in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. It was not. The exhibitions lost money, and within a few years Morse had given up painting to focus on the telegraph.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Daniel-Terra-with-Gallery-of-the-Louvre.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34558\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Daniel-Terra-with-Gallery-of-the-Louvre-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Daniel-Terra-with-Gallery-of-the-Louvre-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Daniel-Terra-with-Gallery-of-the-Louvre-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Daniel-Terra-with-Gallery-of-the-Louvre-430x285.jpg 430w\" title=\"Daniel Terra with Gallery of the Louvre\" width=\"200\"/></a>It was purchased for much less than Morse had hoped in 1834 by George Hyde Clarke for his neoclassical mansion Hyde Hall in Ostego County, New York. After Clarke\u2019s death, <em>Gallery of the Louvre</em> was purchased by former mayor of Albany John Townsend. From him it passed to his daughter Julia Townsend Munroe of Syracuse, New York. She loaned it to Syracuse University in 1884 and then donated it to the university in 1892. Ninety years later, Morse\u2019s dream finally came true. Chicago businessman, art collector and founder of the Terra Foundation for American Art museum, Daniel J. Terra, Ronald Reagan\u2019s Ambassador at Large for Cultural Affairs, bought <em>Gallery of the Louvre</em> from Syracuse University for $3.25 million, at that time the highest price ever paid for a piece of American art. It\u2019s been at the Terra Foundation ever since. </p>\n<p>In 2010 <em>Gallery of the Louvre</em> underwent a six-month conservation by experts in American painting restoration Lance Mayer and Gay Myers. They discovered that Morse was as inventive in his painting as he was in communication technology, sometimes to their chagrin. He mixed varnish and oil paint together instead of painting with oils and then sealing the canvas with varnish. This was problematic for the conservators because varnish discolors. When it\u2019s a layer on top of the paint, it can be removed with appropriate solvents that won\u2019t damage the oil paint beneath. When conservators did a solvent test on <em>Gallery of the Louvre</em>, they found that all of them damaged the combined varnish and paint. </p>\n<p>The Terra Foundation documented the conservation with a video, <em>A New Look: Samuel F. B. Morse\u2019s \u201cGallery of the Louvre\u201d</em>, which is not available online in its entirety but there are six clips from it below.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/I3Of6rQoXUE?list=PL8B4264B7E8816952&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>The conservation was successful, bringing out details that had become obscured over time. After it was complete, the painting was subject of three symposia \u2014 at the Yale University Art Gallery in April of 2011, the National Gallery in April of 2012 and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in April of 2013 \u2014 which generated scholarly essays on the work by art historians, professors, curators and conservators. Those essays have been <a href=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300207613\" target=\"_blank\">published in a book</a> that is a companion piece to a new traveling exhibition of the painting, <a href=\"http://www.terraamericanart.org/2014/10/02/terra-foundation-announces-national-tour-and-published-anthology-of-american-masterpiece/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Samuel F.

Cervantes was buried in the convent in 1616, and while the location of the grave was known at the time, when the convent was enlarged in 1673 the burials were left unmarked. Hoping to be able to provide a memorial marker worthy of Spain\u2019s greatest writer and a locus for literary pilgrims to pay their respects, historian Fernando de Prado raised funds from the city of Madrid and private donors to sweep the convent for possible burial sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Excavating-the-crypt.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34550\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Excavating-the-crypt-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Excavating-the-crypt-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Excavating-the-crypt-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Excavating-the-crypt-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Crypt underneath the transept of church of Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid, archaeologists in the corner excavating\" width=\"200\"/></a>The initial GPR sweeps detected anomalies consistent with graves in three spots in the crypt under the transept of the convent church. Historical records indicate there were at least two other people buried in the same area where Cervantes was interred, making the discovery of three graves particularly noteworthy. In a poetic twist, the space had been rented to a publishing company for years, so before the team could examine it they had to remove piles of old books and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. </p>\n<p>Now a team of archaeologists and forensic anthropologists <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2015-01-spain-author-cervantes-key-phase.html\" target=\"_blank\">has broken ground in the crypt</a>. The small crypt has been turned into a lab for the time being, with up to 20 experts working in it at the same time (there are 30 people in the team). They will examine the human skeletal remains for evidence that points to Cervantes.</p>\n<p>Because Cervantes has no living descendants, even if DNA is recoverable from the skeletal remains, comparisons will be tricky if not impossible. His sister Luisa de Cervantes was buried in a marked grave in a convent 20 miles out of Madrid so there\u2019s a chance her remains might provide a means for comparative DNA analysis, but there\u2019s no guarantee the convent will allow her bones to be exhumed and even if it does, there\u2019s no guarantee a testable sample of 400-year-old DNA can be extracted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bones-exhumed-from-cryptjpg.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-34551\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bones-exhumed-from-cryptjpg-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bones-exhumed-from-cryptjpg-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bones-exhumed-from-cryptjpg-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bones-exhumed-from-cryptjpg-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Team examines bones exhumed from crypt\" width=\"200\"/></a>Researchers will most likely have to rely on physical evidence like the marks of wounds he received while fighting aboard the galley <em>Marquesa</em> during the Battle of Lepanto on October 7th, 1571. He was shot twice in the chest and once in the left arm. The bullet to his arm broke both radius and ulna and severed a nerve. He was a young man of 24 when he was wounded; he never used his left hand again. Should they find a left arm bearing signs of having been shot, broken and atrophied from 45 years of disuse, this will be strong evidence that they\u2019ve found the remains of the author. </p>\n<p>Cervantes asked to be buried in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians because he had a profound connection to them. The convent\u2019s order, the Order of the Most Holy Trinity for the Redemption of the Captives, was founded in the 12th century to help ransom Christians taken captive during the crusades or by non-Christian pirates. When Cervantes and his younger brother were captured by Algerian pirates in 1575, the Order of the Most Holy Trinity helped his family raise the ransom to free them after five years of slavery in Algiers. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Archaeologists-excavate-the-crypt.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-34552\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Archaeologists-excavate-the-crypt-200x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Archaeologists-excavate-the-crypt-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Archaeologists-excavate-the-crypt-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Archaeologists-excavate-the-crypt-430x215.jpg 430w\" title=\"Team excavates crypt floor, plastered-over niches numbered on the left wall\" width=\"200\"/></a>Since the convent was a small, poor one, few people chose to be buried there. Cervantes\u2019 debt of gratitude to the order inspired his choice. Given the small number of burials, what are the odds there will be the remains of a completely different person, also an adult male of around 70 years old at time of death, with the same injuries? Last year the figures bandied about were a dozen to 15 people buried in the convent, but the crypt has about 36 burial niches in the wall. That corresponds to the number of chaplains the convent has had over the centuries before the niches in the north wall were plastered over. The thin layer of plaster, already peeling, will be removed. Any writing on the niche doors identifying who was buried there will be documented and endoscopic cameras will be threaded through holes to examine the remains. </p>\n<p>The real hope is in the three grave sites under the terracotta tile floor, but if they prove fruitless, there are four other possible locations about two meters under the floor of the church that the GPR sweep indicated as possible grave sites.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Were Cervantes\u2019 bones under piles of old books?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34549\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34549#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-34502\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34502\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Mons Meg leaves Edinburgh Castle for tune-up\">Mons Meg leaves Edinburgh Castle for tune-up</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, January 25th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-by-crane.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Mons Meg lifted by crane from Edinburgh Castle\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34506\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-by-crane-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-by-crane-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-by-crane-200x122.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-by-crane-430x263.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-by-crane.jpg 1002w\" title=\"Mons Meg lifted by crane from Edinburgh Castle\" width=\"150\"/></a>Mons Meg, the six-ton 15th century cannon that guards the parapets of <a href=\"http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Edinburgh Castle</a>, has <a href=\"http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/news/news_article.htm?articleid=45438\" target=\"_blank\">left her post for the first time in 30 years</a>. Before dawn on Monday, January 19th, a crew of specialists strapped Meg up so she could be gingerly lifted out of her carriage by a crane, loaded onto a flatbed truck and transported to an off-site facility where Historic Scotland experts will give her a thorough examination and do necessary conservation work. The oak and iron carriage that has been supporting her since 1934 also went along for the ride.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a neat timelapse of Mons Meg being lifted off her carriage while dawn breaks:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/1JSXrKNG9PU&amp;w=430]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Richard Welander, Head of Collections for Historic Scotland said: \u201cMons Meg undergoes regular \u2018health checks\u2019 each year and is lifted off its carriage every five years for a closer inspection.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis time it\u2019s getting a major service, which means it must leave the castle for the first time for 30 years. The last time Mons Meg left was in March 1985, when she went to the Royal Armouries research establishment in Kent for a short technical examination.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be using state-of-the-art equipment to examine the cannon and carriage inside and out, to assess their condition. Then we\u2019ll commence with treatment and restoration, which is a delicate and specialist task.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Mons Meg lifted off her carriage\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34505\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-150x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-lifted-430x280.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mons Meg lifted off her carriage\" width=\"150\"/></a>There have been a great many technological advances since the last time Mons Meg got the full treatment. Historic Scotland conservators will laser-scan the cannon and create a 3D model to reveal issues not visible to the naked eye. The current paint will be stripped using a pressure wash system and bead blasting. That will expose the iron surface for proper conservation. Once Meg is cleaned and dried, she will be re-coated in protective paint.</p>\n<p>Historic Scotland is hoping their conservation analysis will also shed some light on the history of the cannon. Much legend has grown up around her over the centuries, so this is an exciting opportunity to fill in a few blanks. Mons Meg was made in 1449 for Phillip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, to present as a gift to King James II of Scotland, Phillip\u2019s grand-nephew by marriage. (James\u2019 queen consort was Mary of Guelders, daughter of Catherine of Cleves, whose mother Marie of Burgundy was Phillip\u2019s elder sister.) It was constructed by Phillip\u2019s artillery master Jehan Cambier in Mons, County of Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), out of iron staves clamped together by iron hoops. Its massive 20-inch barrel, still one of the largest cannon calibre in the world, could fire 330-pound balls up to two miles. </p>\n<p>James II took delivery of Mons Meg, known at the time just by variants of \u201cMons,\u201d in 1454. Sixteen years later, he had the giant cannon transported 50 miles south to aid in the siege of Roxburgh Castle, one of the last remaining English strongholds in Scotland. The Scottish forces were successful \u2014 they ultimately took the castle once and for all \u2014 but James was killed in action when one of his own bombards (not Meg) exploded. His wife Mary ordered Roxburgh Castle razed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-Annals.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='Print of Mons Meg in 1681 from the \"Domestic Annals of Scotland\" by Robert Chambers' class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-34504\" height=\"89\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-Annals-150x89.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-Annals-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-Annals-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-Annals-430x257.jpg 430w\" title='Print of Mons Meg in 1681 from the \"Domestic Annals of Scotland\" by Robert Chambers' width=\"150\"/></a>The records of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland note an expenditure of 18 shillings on July 10th, 1489, to have \u201cMonss\u201d carried by command of King James IV, James II\u2019s grandson, to besiege Dumbarton. There James IV deployed Meg\u2019s might against an insurrection led by Matthew Stewart, Earl of Lennox, and Robert Lyle, Lord Lyle. That venture was less successful. The siege was broken by a negotiated surrender of the rebellious lords on condition that a new Parliament be convened.</p>\n<p>James used Mons Meg again in 1497 at the siege of Norham Castle in northern England. Meg did her part \u2014 the castle took a lot of damage \u2014 but the two-week siege ended when English reinforcements arrived.</p>\n<p>Meg was kept in fighting condition for a few more decades. Her last military service was in James V\u2019s navy, after which, from the 1540s or so, she was retired from active engagement but was fired on important ceremonial occasions like the signing of the treaty of marriage between five-year-old Mary, Queen of Scots, and three-year-old Francis, Dauphin of France, in July 1558. She was fired for the last time on October 14th, 1681. Here\u2019s a description of the event from the <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/domesticannalsof02chamuoft#page/n417/mode/2up\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Domestic Annals of Scotland</em></a> (1859) by Robert Chambers. The quote within the quote is from <em>Historical Notices of Scottish Affairs</em> (1848) by Sir John Lauder of Fountainhall.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Duke of York paying a visit to the Castle of Edinburgh, the huge cannon called Mons Meg was fired in his honour. The charge, which was done by an English cannoneer, had probably been too large, for it caused the piece to burst. This \u201csome foolishly called a bad omen. The Scots resented it extremely, thinking the Englishman might of malice have done it purposely, they having no cannon in all England so big as she.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am trying really hard not to snicker at the obvious phallic competition inherent in this struggle. Trying and failing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-burst-hoop-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Mons Meg's burst hoop still visible just ahead of back wheel\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34507\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-burst-hoop-side-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-burst-hoop-side-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-burst-hoop-side-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mons-Meg-burst-hoop-side-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mons Meg's burst hoop still visible just ahead of back wheel\" width=\"150\"/></a>With the burst hoop exposing her internal staves, Mons Meg could never be fired again. She still starred in several tugs of war between England and Scotland, though. In the wake of the Jacobite rebellion, in 1754 Mons Meg, now rusted, busted and sitting on the ground without even the dignity of a carriage, was confiscated along with other weapons to keep them out of reach of potential rebels. She was moved to the Tower of London, but she didn\u2019t go quietly. The Tower records list a demand for compensation from the owner of the ship that brought her to London for damage to the vessel and mooring rope.</p>\n<p>In 1829, George IV had Mons Meg returned to Edinburgh as a result of a campaign by Sir Walter Scott and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Scott believed fervently in a <a href=\"http://www.kirkcudbright.co/historyarticle.asp?ID=191&amp;p=29&amp;g=5\" target=\"_blank\">legendary Galloway origin story for Mons Meg</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When James the Second arrived with an army at Carlingwark, to besiege the Castle of Threave, the McLellans presented him with the piece of ordnance now called \u2018Mons Meg.\u2019 The first discharge of this great gun is said to have consisted of a peck of powder and a granite ball nearly as heavy as a Galloway cow. This ball is believed, in its course through the Castle of Threave, to have carried away the hand of Margaret de Douglas, commonly called the Fair Maid of Galloway, as she sat at table with her lord, and was in the act of raising the wine-cup to her lips. Old people still maintain that the vengeance of God was thereby evidently manifested, in destroying the hand which had been given in wedlock to two brothers, and that even while the lawful spouse of the first was alive.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even without having amputated Margaret de Douglas\u2019 hand, Mons Meg was and is still beloved. She was escorted back to Edinburgh Castle in 1829 by three cavalry troops and a regiment of foot, and remains today a great favorite with visitors to Edinburgh Castle.</p>\n<p>The conservation is expected to be complete and Mons Meg back in place outside St. Margaret\u2019s Chapel by the end of February.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mons Meg leaves Edinburgh Castle for tune-up\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34502\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34502#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-34508\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/34508\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Tut\u2019s beard glued back on like a bad craft project\">Tut\u2019s beard glued back on like a bad craft project</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, January 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tutankhamun-mask-side-view.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Tutankhamun funerary mask before beard glue debacle\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34510\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tutankhamun-mask-side-view-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tutankhamun-mask-side-view-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tutankhamun-mask-side-view-200x248.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tutankhamun-mask-side-view-430x533.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tutankhamun-mask-side-view.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Tutankhamun funerary mask before beard glue debacle\" width=\"120\"/></a>The <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/beard-egypts-king-tut-hastily-glued-back-epoxy-055013973.html\" target=\"_blank\">AP reported on Thursday</a> that the false beard on the gold funerary mask of Tutankhamun, probably the single most recognizable ancient artifact in the world, had come off and was reattached with a sloppy mess of irreversible epoxy glue. Cited in the article are three conservators at the Cairo Museum, all unnamed due to fear of reprisals, who had different stories about what happened to the beard \u2014 it was either knocked off when the mask was mishandled during cleaning of the display case or deliberately taken off because it was loose \u2014 but agreed that it was reattached hastily with epoxy.</p>\n<p>By their accounts, museum officials ordered the beard reattached as quickly as possible because obviously it\u2019s a massive tourist draw and they didn\u2019t want it taken off display for any length of time. Epoxy dries almost instantly while a cautious conservation approach would use an adhesive that dries slowly over the course of at least 24 hours so adjustments could be made if necessary. It would also be reversible to allow future conservators to remove it if necessary without damage to the artifact.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cUnfortunately he used a very irreversible material \u2014 epoxy has a very high property for attaching and is used on metal or stone but I think it wasn\u2019t suitable for an outstanding object like Tutankhamun\u2019s golden mask,\u201d one conservator said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe mask should have been taken to the conservation lab but they were in a rush to get it displayed quickly again and used this quick drying, irreversible material,\u201d the conservator added.</p>\n<p>The conservator said there is now a visible gap between the face and the beard. \u201cNow you can see a layer of transparent yellow.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are also visible scratches. A conservator says he witnessed a colleague scrape dried epoxy from the mask with a spatula leaving scratches on the gold.

I suspect they were the first to break the news because they have boots on the ground, so to speak. (Before the AP, that is. There were rumblings in the Egyptian press <a href=\"http://www.thecairopost.com/news/129424/travel-antiquities/reports-tutankhamen-mask-damaged-false-antiquities-minister\" target=\"_blank\">as early as November</a> that conservators had sent a memo to the Antiquities Minister demanding \u201cimmediate investigations regarding the odd appearance of the mask after the restoration work it encountered in August.\u201d) They sent reporters to the museum on a tip about the botched repair. Al-Araby reporters found the lighting in the room unusually dim but they were able to detect despite the penumbra that there was a thick line of glue visible and scratches on the left side of the mask. Their sources told them that the mask was damaged during cleaning in October, not August, and that the beard was reattached in the conservation lab, not in front of visitors.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the worst part:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Glued-beard.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Photograph of the funerary mask taken January 23, 2015, by AFP photographer Mohamed El-Shahed\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34520\" height=\"97\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Glued-beard-150x97.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Glued-beard-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Glued-beard-200x130.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Glued-beard-430x280.jpg 430w\" title=\"Photograph of the funerary mask taken January 23, 2015, by AFP photographer Mohamed El-Shahed\" width=\"150\"/></a>\u201cAfter the expert restorer Abd al-Latif glued on the false beard it was obvious that it no longer appeared the same.

When she first unearthed the bust of a togate, bearded figure, the metal detectorist thought it was a modern piece because it was so finely crafted and in such good condition. It wasn\u2019t until she showed it to experts at the National Museum of Denmark that it was properly identified as a Roman bronze from the 1st century A.D.</p>\n<p>The figure is small at just 4.5 centimeters (1.8 inches) high and depicts Silenus, the tutor and boon companion of Bacchus. Silenus is portrayed as an old man, bald and bearded, with thick lips and a squashed nose. He is the wisest of the god\u2019s followers and, appropriately, also the drunkest, so drunk that he is usually shown riding a mule or being supported by satyrs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Pair-of-bronze-fulcrum-1-c.-A.D.-e1421980880395.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Pair of bronze fulcra, 1st c.

Usually made of bronze, <em>fulcra</em> were richly decorated, inlaid with precious metals and/or ivory. Each end of the fulcrum culminated in a sculpted figure. Satyrs and sileni were popular for one end, while the other end was often topped with the head of a donkey or mule, a reference to Silenus\u2019 preferred form of transportation. The British Museum has a <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/p/pair_bronze_headrest_supports.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">beautiful pair of intact <em>fulcra</em></a> with satyrs and mules on the ends. You can see how the Falster Silenus\u2019 turned position matches the satyrs\u2019.</p>\n<p>Originating in Greece, the <em>lectus</em> reached its peak of popularity in the early Roman Empire. No wealthy person\u2019s <em>triclinium</em> (dining room) was complete without three <em>lecti</em> arranged in a U shape at right angles to each other. In fact, the \u201ctri\u201d in <em>triclinium</em> is a reference to the three <em>lecti</em>. The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore has a <a href=\"http://art.thewalters.org/detail/29041/banquet-couch/\" target=\"_blank\">complete set of bronze <em>lectus</em> fittings</a> from the late Republic, early Empire that they have put together with modern wood elements so you can see the architecture of the frame.

That\u2019s unlikely to have been the case with the Falster Silenus. It probably was separated from its bed long before it wound its way into the soil of Denmark. The Roman furniture fittings that have been discovered in Denmark thus far appear to have been individual objects rather than part of a larger piece, brought to the area as art works or war booty.</p>\n<p>The number of Roman finds in the Danish islands south of Zealand may indicate an active trade network moving goods from southern Europe to Denmark, and there is some documentary support for contact during the early empire. In a <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/5*.html\" target=\"_blank\">passage from the <em>Res Gestae Divi Augusti</em></a>, an autobiographical summary written by Augustus during his lifetime for use on funerary inscriptions after his death, he dispatched ships to the peninsula of Jutland and established friendly relations with the locals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My fleet sailed from the mouth of the Rhine eastward as far as the lands of the Cimbri to which, up to that time, no Roman had ever penetrated either by land or by sea, and the Cimbri and Charydes and Semnones and other peoples of the Germans of that same region through their envoys sought my friendship and that of the Roman people.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Fulcrum</em> fittings weren\u2019t a big part of that friendship, though.

They had some success at creating virtual models of the scrolls, revealing how dense and wavy the layers were and unwrapping them to their full length using image algorithms, but the lettering was a tough nut to crack because the carbonization made it all but impossible for the scanner to differentiate between the carbon-based ink and the papyrus. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a video of the EDUCE team scanning a Herculaneum scroll in 2010.

The research team, led by Vito Mocella of the Italian National Research Council, took a fragment from an unwrapped scroll and one intact scroll from the Institut de France to Grenoble where the European Synchrotron particle collider lives. The high-energy beams from the synchrotron reflect back from the ever-so-slightly raised letters (carbon-based ink doesn\u2019t soak into papyrus; it sits on top of it) at a different phase than they do from the papyrus. researchers measured the phase difference and were able to recreate the letters.</p>\n<p>This video gives a quick glimpse into the scanning process, but you can\u2019t really discern the letter here either because the actual identification is done after the scan. </p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/JlWJ68DJGM0&amp;w=430]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mocella and his team show that they were able to make out two previously unreadable sequences of capital letters from a hidden layer of the unrolled scroll fragment. The team interprets them as Greek words: \u03a0\u0399\u03a0\u03a4\u039f\u0399\u0395, meaning \u201cwould fall\u201d, and \u0395\u0399\u03a0\u039f\u0399, meaning \u201cwould say\u201d. Even more exciting for scholars, the team was able to pick out writing on the still-rolled scroll, eventually finding all 24 letters of the Greek alphabet at various points on the tightly bundled document. </p>\n<p>Even though the current scans are mostly a proof of concept, the work suggests that there will soon be a way to read the full works on the rolled scrolls, the team says. \u201cWe plan to improve the technique,\u201d says Mocella. \u201cNext spring we have an allowance to spend more time at the Grenoble synchrotron, where we can test a number of approaches and try to discern the exact chemical composition of the ink. That will help us improve the energy setting of the beam for our scan.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Scanning-scrolls.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34480\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Scanning-scrolls-150x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Scanning-scrolls-150x131.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Scanning-scrolls-200x174.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Scanning-scrolls-430x375.jpg 430w\" title=\"Resarcher team with Herculaneum scrolls\" width=\"150\"/></a>They\u2019ll also collaborate with University of Kentucky computer scientist Dr. Brent Seales who spearheaded the EDUCE project. His work in mapping out the physical structure of the scrolls will be invaluable in helping place the letters in their proper order so the texts can actually be read rather than individual letters identified. </p>\n<p>This is an important breakthrough for exploring other kinds of historical texts as well, like medieval palimpsests that have inaccessible writing in the binding or between glued pages, but if it does prove effective in reading Herculaneum\u2019s carbonized scrolls, it could strike a motherlode of ancient sources.

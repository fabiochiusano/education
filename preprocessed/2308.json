{"content": "Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica (CA) plans to publish a book on his firm\u2019s approach to online campaigning, and its role in the U.S. election. In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch he says the book will \u201ctalk about our methodology and our approach to communications\u201d in technical terms, and go into how the firm is using psychographics in its campaigns online. The book, with the working title \u201cMad Men To Maths Men,\u201d (in reference to the hit TV drama) will be coming out in Germany first, and later internationally. In an extensive interview with TechCrunch, published here , Nix goes into depth about his company\u2019s position on data, the U.S. election, its ties with the Trump campaign and addresses its alleged ties with Russia. He says that \u201cold school\u201d traditional creative-led agencies \u201chave got it coming\u201d and that they will be swept away by a data-led approach, replaced by \u201chighly targeted, very personalized advertising, and that has to be data-driven. That\u2019s not instead of creativity, that\u2019s using data to augment creativity. Data first then creativity, it\u2019s linear,\u201d he says. He says that ahead of the U.S. election CA had \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Americans fill out a survey and merged that with as many publicly available data points on 230 million Americans. And that \u201ceveryday we have teams looking for new data sets.\u201d He admits CA used psychographic targeting of Americans \u201call through the 2014 midterms\u201d and all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. \u201cBut when we got to Trump\u2019s campaign\u2026 we just didn\u2019t have the time to roll out that survey.\u201d He says the Trump campaign, when CA joined it, was just too small and had no infrastructure. However, he did admit that \u201cthere\u2019s psychographic data that\u2019s baked-in to legacy models that we built before because we\u2019re not reinventing the wheel.\u201d And there was no \u201clong form quantitive psychographics survey\u201d done for the Trump campaign. Nix does not address claims that the company harvested Facebook data before its terms of service started to be shrunk, but that their data was built on surveys of 100,000 people or more. He also repeats the claim that they helped raise a \u201csmall dollar\u201d funding for Trump amounting to $27 million. Of this, he says \u201cI think it was extremely pivotal [to the campaign] because when Trump won the nomination he had very, very little money.\u201d He says CA was hired by Trump\u2019s campaign because no other usual suppliers to Republican candidates would touch the controversial candidate, and that CA saw a big business opportunity in his campaign. The thinking was that even if Trump had lost, they would have made a name for themselves in the U.S., and if they helped win the campaign they\u2019d be famous. It was a risk worth taking. It also meant that CA ended up taking over every aspect of the Trump campaign from data analytics, research, digital, TV and handling donations. \u201cOvernight [the contract] went from being originally just data, to end to end,\u201d says Nix. \u201cIt was an easy bet to make. It was a win-win. I couldn\u2019t see the downside. I thought even if Trump didn\u2019t prevail, if he didn\u2019t win the election\u2026 We\u2019re a British firm that was trying to break into the most competitive political market in the world.\u201d He says criticisms of them and their methods have tended to come from jealous competitors. \u201cYou see three quotes\u2026 they\u2019re all from people whose business you\u2019ve stolen. They\u2019re saying things like we came across \u201cCambridge Analytica. It\u2019s All snake oil\u201d [and it\u2019s from] our biggest rival.\u201d He dismissed characterization of CA\u2019s campaigns as being \u2018dark advertising\u2019: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of that we\u2019re doing which are innovative. And there are some things which is \u2018best practice\u2019 digital advertising, best practice communications which we\u2019re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.\u201d He says attacks on CA are mostly by \u201cthe liberal press\u201d supporting Hilary Clinton: \u201cHilary simply cannot come to terms with it. She\u2019s a woman in denial. The liberal press [characterized Cambridge Analytica] as witchcraft, \u201cthey cheat, it is voodoo!\u201d and now it\u2019s Russia\u2019s fault! They just cannot accept the fact that Hillary was such an unpopular, such a divisive candidate. She failed to mobilize her base and people didn\u2019t fundamentally trust her. Rather than looking in the mirror, they much prefer to beat up Cambridge [Analytica] beat up Trump, beat up anyone else. Anything but accept the fact that their candidate wasn\u2019t what the people wanted to vote for.\u201d Nix plans to publish a book on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s approach to online campaigning, and its role in the U.S. election. He says the book will \u201ctalk about our methodology and our approach to communications.\u201d It will also talk in \u201cquite technical terms\u201d about how communication is changing, what how technology is impacting that. It will feature case studies \u201cwith a lot of real examples of artwork and targeting and psychographics and so forth to illustrate them.\u201d The book will be coming out in Germany first, with a German publisher, after which it will be published in the U.K. and internationally. The working title is \u201cMad men to maths men\u201d. On Brexit, he categorically denies CA had any involvement. CA \u201cdid not work on Brexit,\u201d he says. Claims in the media to the contrary were wrong and based on the \u2018liberal media\u2019s\u2019 denial that the UK wanted to leave the EU. He says the rumour has come about because they were approached by \u201cby a number of different campaigns, pro and against, to discuss whether there might be a role for us on Brexit\u2026 We had a number of discussions. Obviously, these discussions made their way into the public forum but we meet with hundreds of companies every year and talk about business opportunities. That doesn\u2019t mean you engage with them doesn\u2019t mean you contract with them and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean that you work for them.\u201d He says stories by The Guardian that CA worked on pro-Brexit campaigns were based on \u201cone or two data points\u201d that they \u201cthen created an entire narrative around that that was pure fiction.\u201d He says CA has worked on political campaigns in African countries but does not comment on \u201clive campaigns.\u201d He says the firm \u201cworked in Kenya in 2013 on the last election for Kenyatta, but would not comment if CA has worked for Kenyatta in this year\u2019s controversial election. However, he does say that \u201cI think that the court\u2019s decision [to re-run the election] was a dreadful decision. I think that it is going to result in dreadful bloodshed, horrific violence. If Kenyatta for any reason doesn\u2019t win this election then his supporters are going to feel robbed. And if Odinga\u2019s people don\u2019t, they\u2019re going to feel that he\u2019s cheated again because that\u2019s the perception that Odinga is put out into the public domain. I can\u2019t see this ending well. I think just for the sake of Kenya, for peace in the region, I think it\u2019s a dreadful decision.\u201d He says \u201cwe\u2019ve never been asked directly\u201d if they had worked on a campaign for the Russian government or via third-party actors connected to them, such as for the Trump campaign or any other. He says: \u201cNo one of authority has leveled any direct criticisms to us and, certainly, no one has suggested that we\u2019d been or alleged that we\u2019d been involved as far as I\u2019m aware. We\u2019re not under investigation by anyone. We are helping wherever we can with the understandings of the campaign, like everyone else in the campaign, but there\u2019s no investigation into Cambridge.\u201d \u201cWe never worked in Russia. We never worked for Russia. I want to be careful, but I don\u2019t think we have any Russian employees in our company whatsoever. We just don\u2019t have business in Russia. We have no involvement with Russia, never have done.\u201d He declines to talk about reports that CA is bankrolled by shadowy hedge-fund owner Robert Mercer, who has been accused of pulling the strings on many aspects of the campaigns against Hilary Clinton and against other Trump opponents. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speak about any of our investors or board members at all because we don\u2019t.\u201d He denies that the company\u2019s \u201cpolitical ideology [is] influenced by other people in the company\u2019 at whatever level. \u201cWe leave our personal ideologies at the door\u2026 We only work for mainstream political parties.\u201d He says CA works on campaigns for both left and right-wing parties internationally. He accuses the tech community of being overly Left-leaning, which, he says, effectively became a business opportunity for firms servicing the Right wing of politics. \u201cBecause of the dearth of talent, the Republicans were getting murdered in the tech arms race. That was the commercial opportunity, that was the one we sought to address\u2026 Had it been the other way around it might have been a different story.\u201d Deflecting a question about whether they worked for the Pentagon he says \u201cwe\u2019ve worked for global militaries all over the world.\u201d He predicted that IoT is going to \u201ctotally radicalize\u201d the data market: \u201cAs the internet of things grows, as we have sensors on everything: cars, fridges, TVs then data is going to become ubiquitous.\u201d He also thinks \u201cpeople are going to start taking control of their data much more. There is going to be more reciprocity in the way that people share their data with companies like my own and other marketing agencies.\u201d And that much of it will be \u201cself-regulated through the blockchain\u2026 millennials\u2026 understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says.", "title_html": "<h1 class=\"article__title\">The CEO of Cambridge Analytica plans a book on its methods, and the

In <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/cambridge-analytica-ceo-talks-to-techcrunch-about-trump-hilary-and-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an exclusive interview</a> with TechCrunch he says the book will \u201ctalk about our methodology and our approach to communications\u201d in technical terms, and go into how the firm is using psychographics in its campaigns online.</p>\n<p>The book, with the working title \u201cMad Men To Maths Men,\u201d (in reference to the hit TV drama) will be coming out in Germany first, and later internationally.</p>\n<p>In an extensive interview with TechCrunch, <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/cambridge-analytica-ceo-talks-to-techcrunch-about-trump-hilary-and-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published here</a>, Nix goes into depth about his company\u2019s position on data, the U.S. election, its ties with the Trump campaign and addresses its alleged ties with Russia.</p>\n<p>He says that \u201cold school\u201d traditional creative-led agencies \u201chave got it coming\u201d and that they will be swept away by a data-led approach, replaced by \u201chighly targeted, very personalized advertising, and that has to be data-driven. That\u2019s not instead of creativity, that\u2019s using data to augment creativity. Data first then creativity, it\u2019s linear,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>He says that ahead of the U.S. election CA had \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Americans fill out a survey and merged that with as many publicly available data points on 230 million Americans. And that \u201ceveryday we have teams looking for new data sets.\u201d</p>\n<p>He admits CA used psychographic targeting of Americans \u201call through the 2014 midterms\u201d and all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. \u201cBut when we got to Trump\u2019s campaign\u2026 we just didn\u2019t have the time to roll out that survey.\u201d He says the Trump campaign, when CA joined it, was just too small and had no infrastructure.</p>\n<p>However, he did admit that \u201cthere\u2019s psychographic data that\u2019s baked-in to legacy models that we built before because we\u2019re not reinventing the wheel.\u201d And there was no \u201clong form quantitive psychographics survey\u201d done for the Trump campaign.</p>\n<p>Nix does not address claims that the company harvested Facebook data before its terms of service started to be shrunk, but that their data was built on surveys of 100,000 people or more.</p>\n<p>He also repeats the claim that they helped raise a \u201csmall dollar\u201d funding for Trump amounting to $27 million. Of this, he says \u201cI think it was extremely pivotal [to the campaign] because when Trump won the nomination he had very, very little money.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says CA was hired by Trump\u2019s campaign because no other usual suppliers to Republican candidates would touch the controversial candidate, and that CA saw a big business opportunity in his campaign. The thinking was that even if Trump had lost, they would have made a name for themselves in the U.S., and if they helped win the campaign they\u2019d be famous. It was a risk worth taking.</p>\n<p>It also meant that CA ended up taking over every aspect of the Trump campaign from data analytics, research, digital, TV and handling donations. \u201cOvernight [the contract] went from being originally just data, to end to end,\u201d says Nix.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was an easy bet to make. It was a win-win. I couldn\u2019t see the downside. I thought even if Trump didn\u2019t prevail, if he didn\u2019t win the election\u2026 We\u2019re a British firm that was trying to break into the most competitive political market in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says criticisms of them and their methods have tended to come from jealous competitors.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see three quotes\u2026 they\u2019re all from people whose business you\u2019ve stolen. They\u2019re saying things like we came across \u201cCambridge Analytica. It\u2019s All snake oil\u201d [and it\u2019s from] our biggest rival.\u201d</p>\n<p>He dismissed characterization of CA\u2019s campaigns as being \u2018dark advertising\u2019: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of that we\u2019re doing which are innovative. And there are some things which is \u2018best practice\u2019 digital advertising, best practice communications which we\u2019re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says attacks on CA are mostly by \u201cthe liberal press\u201d supporting Hilary Clinton: \u201cHilary simply cannot come to terms with it. She\u2019s a woman in denial. The liberal press [characterized Cambridge Analytica] as witchcraft, \u201cthey cheat, it is voodoo!\u201d and now it\u2019s Russia\u2019s fault! They just cannot accept the fact that Hillary was such an unpopular, such a divisive candidate. She failed to mobilize her base and people didn\u2019t fundamentally trust her. Rather than looking in the mirror, they much prefer to beat up Cambridge [Analytica] beat up Trump, beat up anyone else. Anything but accept the fact that their candidate wasn\u2019t what the people wanted to vote for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nix plans to publish a book on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s approach to online campaigning, and its role in the U.S. election.</p>\n<p>He says the book will \u201ctalk about our methodology and our approach to communications.\u201d It will also talk in \u201cquite technical terms\u201d about how communication is changing, what how technology is impacting that. It will feature case studies \u201cwith a lot of real examples of artwork and targeting and psychographics and so forth to illustrate them.\u201d</p>\n<p>The book will be coming out in Germany first, with a German publisher, after which it will be published in the U.K. and internationally. The working title is \u201cMad men to maths men\u201d.</p>\n<p>On Brexit, he categorically denies CA had any involvement. CA \u201cdid not work on Brexit,\u201d he says. Claims in the media to the contrary were wrong and based on the \u2018liberal media\u2019s\u2019 denial that the UK wanted to leave the EU. He says the rumour has come about because they were approached by \u201cby a number of different campaigns, pro and against, to discuss whether there might be a role for us on Brexit\u2026 We had a number of discussions. Obviously, these discussions made their way into the public forum but we meet with hundreds of companies every year and talk about business opportunities. That doesn\u2019t mean you engage with them doesn\u2019t mean you contract with them and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean that you work for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says stories by The Guardian that CA worked on pro-Brexit campaigns were based on \u201cone or two data points\u201d that they \u201cthen created an entire narrative around that that was pure fiction.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says CA has worked on political campaigns in African countries but does not comment on \u201clive campaigns.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says the firm \u201cworked in Kenya in 2013 on the last election for Kenyatta, but would not comment if CA has worked for Kenyatta in this year\u2019s controversial election.</p>\n<p>However, he does say that \u201cI think that the court\u2019s decision [to re-run the election] was a dreadful decision. I think that it is going to result in dreadful bloodshed, horrific violence. If Kenyatta for any reason doesn\u2019t win this election then his supporters are going to feel robbed. And if Odinga\u2019s people don\u2019t, they\u2019re going to feel that he\u2019s cheated again because that\u2019s the perception that Odinga is put out into the public domain. I can\u2019t see this ending well. I think just for the sake of Kenya, for peace in the region, I think it\u2019s a dreadful decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says \u201cwe\u2019ve never been asked directly\u201d if they had worked on a campaign for the Russian government or via third-party actors connected to them, such as for the Trump campaign or any other.</p>\n<p>He says: \u201cNo one of authority has leveled any direct criticisms to us and, certainly, no one has suggested that we\u2019d been or alleged that we\u2019d been involved as far as I\u2019m aware. We\u2019re not under investigation by anyone. We are helping wherever we can with the understandings of the campaign, like everyone else in the campaign, but there\u2019s no investigation into Cambridge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe never worked in Russia. We never worked for Russia. I want to be careful, but I don\u2019t think we have any Russian employees in our company whatsoever. We just don\u2019t have business in Russia. We have no involvement with Russia, never have done.\u201d</p>\n<p>He declines to talk about reports that CA is bankrolled by shadowy hedge-fund owner Robert Mercer, who has been accused of pulling the strings on many aspects of the campaigns against Hilary Clinton and against other Trump opponents.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to speak about any of our investors or board members at all because we don\u2019t.\u201d He denies that the company\u2019s \u201cpolitical ideology [is] influenced by other people in the company\u2019 at whatever level. \u201cWe leave our personal ideologies at the door\u2026 We only work for mainstream political parties.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says CA works on campaigns for both left and right-wing parties internationally.</p>\n<p>He accuses the tech community of being overly Left-leaning, which, he says, effectively became a business opportunity for firms servicing the Right wing of politics. \u201cBecause of the dearth of talent, the Republicans were getting murdered in the tech arms race. That was the commercial opportunity, that was the one we sought to address\u2026 Had it been the other way around it might have been a different story.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deflecting a question about whether they worked for the Pentagon he says \u201cwe\u2019ve worked for global militaries all over the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>He predicted that IoT is going to \u201ctotally radicalize\u201d the data market: \u201cAs the internet of things grows, as we have sensors on everything: cars, fridges, TVs then data is going to become ubiquitous.\u201d He also thinks \u201cpeople are going to start taking control of their data much more. There is going to be more reciprocity in the way that people share their data with companies like my own and other marketing agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that much of it will be \u201cself-regulated through the blockchain\u2026 millennials\u2026 understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n<input class=\"shortlink\" readonly=\"\" title=\"Article Shortlink\" type=\"text\" value=\"\"/>\n</footer>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div><!-- end React-root duplication div -->\n</div><!--end #root-->\n<noscript style=\"display:none;\">\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&amp;ev=PageView&amp;noscript=1\" width=\"1\"/>\n</noscript>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t// Configure the PARSELY window global to disable auto-tracking.\n\t\t// Must load before the Parse.ly script itself.\n\t\twindow.PARSELY = {\n\t\t\tautotrack: false,\n\t\t\tonload:    this.onload,\n\t\t};\n\t</script>\n<script data-parsely-site=\"techcrunch.com\" id=\"parsely-cfg\" src=\"//d1z2jf7jlzjs58.cloudfront.net/keys/techcrunch.com/p.js\"></script>\n<!-- JSON-LD -->\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n\t\t{\"@context\":\"http:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"TechCrunch\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"imageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/themes\\/techcrunch-2017\\/images\\/logo-json-ld.png\",\"width\":\"600\",\"height\":\"60\"}},\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2017\\/11\\/06\\/the-ceo-of-cambridge-analytica-plans-a-book-on-its-methods-and-the-us-election\\/\"},\"headline\":\"The CEO of Cambridge Analytica plans a book on its methods, and the US election\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/11\\/img_3462.jpg?w=480\",\"width\":480,\"height\":640},\"datePublished\":\"2017-11-06T15:08:45+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2017-11-08T00:47:15+00:00\",\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Mike Butcher\"}],\"description\":\"Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica (CA) plans to publish a book on his firm\\u2019s approach to online campaigning, and its role in the U.S. election.

That&#8217;s not instead of creativity, that&#8217;s using data to augment creativity. Data first then creativity, it\\u2019s linear,\\u201d he says.<\\/p>\\n<p>He says that ahead of the U.S. election CA had \\u201chundreds of thousands\\u201d of Americans fill out a survey and merged that with as many publicly available data points on 230 million Americans. And that \\u201ceveryday we have teams looking for new data sets.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He admits CA used psychographic targeting of Americans \\u201call through the 2014 midterms\\u201d and all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. \\u201cBut when we got to Trump&#8217;s campaign\\u2026 we just didn&#8217;t have the time to roll out that survey.\\u201d He says the Trump campaign, when CA joined it, was just too small and had no infrastructure.<\\/p>\\n<p>However, he did admit that \\u201cthere&#8217;s psychographic data that&#8217;s baked-in to legacy models that we built before because we\\u2019re not reinventing the wheel.&#8221; And there was no \\u201clong form quantitive psychographics survey\\u201d done for the Trump campaign.<\\/p>\\n<p>Nix does not address claims that the company harvested Facebook data before its terms of service started to be shrunk, but that their data was built on surveys of 100,000 people or more.<\\/p>\\n<p>He also repeats the claim that they helped raise a \\u201csmall dollar\\u201d funding for Trump amounting to $27 million. Of this, he says \\u201cI think it was extremely pivotal [to the campaign] because when Trump won the nomination he had very, very little money.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He says CA was hired by Trump&#8217;s campaign because no other usual suppliers to Republican candidates would touch the controversial candidate, and that CA saw a big business opportunity in his campaign. The thinking was that even if Trump had lost, they would have made a name for themselves in the U.S., and if they helped win the campaign they\\u2019d be famous. It was a risk worth taking.<\\/p>\\n<p>It also meant that CA ended up taking over every aspect of the Trump campaign from data analytics, research, digital, TV and handling donations. \\u201cOvernight [the contract] went from being originally just data, to end to end,\\u201d says Nix.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was an easy bet to make. It was a win-win. I couldn&#8217;t see the downside. I thought even if Trump didn&#8217;t prevail, if he didn&#8217;t win the election&#8230; We&#8217;re a British firm that was trying to break into the most competitive political market in the world.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He says criticisms of them and their methods have tended to come from jealous competitors.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou see three quotes&#8230; they&#8217;re all from people whose business you&#8217;ve stolen. They&#8217;re saying things like we came across \\u201cCambridge Analytica. It\\u2019s All snake oil\\u201d [and it\\u2019s from] our biggest rival.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He dismissed characterization of CA\\u2019s campaigns as being \\u2018dark advertising\\u2019: \\u201cI\\u2019m very proud of that we&#8217;re doing which are innovative. And there are some things which is &#8216;best practice&#8217; digital advertising, best practice communications which we\\u2019re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He says attacks on CA are mostly by \\u201cthe liberal press\\u201d supporting Hilary Clinton: \\u201cHilary simply cannot come to terms with it. She&#8217;s a woman in denial. The liberal press [characterized Cambridge Analytica] as witchcraft, &#8220;they cheat, it is voodoo!\\u201d and now it&#8217;s Russia&#8217;s fault! They just cannot accept the fact that Hillary was such an unpopular, such a divisive candidate. She failed to mobilize her base and people didn&#8217;t fundamentally trust her. Rather than looking in the mirror, they much prefer to beat up Cambridge [Analytica] beat up Trump, beat up anyone else. Anything but accept the fact that their candidate wasn&#8217;t what the people wanted to vote for.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Nix plans to publish a book on Cambridge Analytica\\u2019s approach to online campaigning, and its role in the U.S. election.<\\/p>\\n<p>He says the book will \\u201ctalk about our methodology and our approach to communications.\\u201d It will also talk in \\u201cquite technical terms\\u201d about how communication is changing, what how technology is impacting that. It will feature case studies \\u201cwith a lot of real examples of artwork and targeting and psychographics and so forth to illustrate them.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The book will be coming out in Germany first, with a German publisher, after which it will be published in the U.K. and internationally. The working title is \\u201cMad men to maths men\\u201d.<\\/p>\\n<p>On Brexit, he categorically denies CA had any involvement. CA \\u201cdid not work on Brexit,\\u201d he says. Claims in the media to the contrary were wrong and based on the \\u2018liberal media\\u2019s\\u2019 denial that the UK wanted to leave the EU. He says the rumour has come about because they were approached by \\u201cby a number of different campaigns, pro and against, to discuss whether there might be a role for us on Brexit\\u2026 We had a number of discussions. Obviously, these discussions made their way into the public forum but we meet with hundreds of companies every year and talk about business opportunities. That doesn&#8217;t mean you engage with them doesn&#8217;t mean you contract with them and it certainly doesn&#8217;t mean that you work for them.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He says stories by The Guardian that CA worked on pro-Brexit campaigns were based on \\u201cone or two data points\\u201d that they \\u201cthen created an entire narrative around that that was pure fiction.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>He says CA has worked on political campaigns in African countries but does not comment on \\u201clive campaigns.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He says the firm \\u201cworked in Kenya in 2013 on the last election for Kenyatta, but would not comment if CA has worked for Kenyatta in this year\\u2019s controversial election.<\\/p>\\n<p>However, he does say that \\u201cI think that the court&#8217;s decision [to re-run the election] was a dreadful decision. I think that it is going to result in dreadful bloodshed, horrific violence. If Kenyatta for any reason doesn&#8217;t win this election then his supporters are going to feel robbed. And if Odinga\\u2019s people don\\u2019t, they&#8217;re going to feel that he&#8217;s cheated again because that&#8217;s the perception that Odinga is put out into the public domain. I can&#8217;t see this ending well. I think just for the sake of Kenya, for peace in the region, I think it&#8217;s a dreadful decision.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He says \\u201cwe\\u2019ve never been asked directly\\u201d if they had worked on a campaign for the Russian government or via third-party actors connected to them, such as for the Trump campaign or any other.<\\/p>\\n<p>He says: \\u201cNo one of authority has leveled any direct criticisms to us and, certainly, no one has suggested that we&#8217;d been or alleged that we\\u2019d been involved as far as I&#8217;m aware. We\\u2019re not under investigation by anyone. We are helping wherever we can with the understandings of the campaign, like everyone else in the campaign, but there&#8217;s no investigation into Cambridge.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe never worked in Russia. We never worked for Russia. I want to be careful, but I don&#8217;t think we have any Russian employees in our company whatsoever. We just don&#8217;t have business in Russia. We have no involvement with Russia, never have done.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He declines to talk about reports that CA is bankrolled by shadowy hedge-fund owner Robert Mercer, who has been accused of pulling the strings on many aspects of the campaigns against Hilary Clinton and against other Trump opponents.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to speak about any of our investors or board members at all because we don\\u2019t.\\u201d He denies that the company\\u2019s \\u201cpolitical ideology [is] influenced by other people in the company\\u2019 at whatever level. \\u201cWe leave our personal ideologies at the door\\u2026 We only work for mainstream political parties.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He says CA works on campaigns for both left and right-wing parties internationally.<\\/p>\\n<p>He accuses the tech community of being overly Left-leaning, which, he says, effectively became a business opportunity for firms servicing the Right wing of politics. \\u201cBecause of the dearth of talent, the Republicans were getting murdered in the tech arms race. That was the commercial opportunity, that was the one we sought to address\\u2026 Had it been the other way around it might have been a different story.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Deflecting a question about whether they worked for the Pentagon he says \\u201cwe&#8217;ve worked for global militaries all over the world.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He predicted that IoT is going to \\u201ctotally radicalize\\u201d the data market: \\u201cAs the internet of things grows, as we have sensors on everything: cars, fridges, TVs then data is going to become ubiquitous.\\u201d He also thinks \\u201cpeople are going to start taking control of their data much more. There is going to be more reciprocity in the way that people share their data with companies like my own and other marketing agencies.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>And that much of it will be \\u201cself-regulated through the blockchain\\u2026 millennials\\u2026 understand what&#8217;s going on,\\u201d he says.<\\/p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica (CA) plans to publish a book on his firm\\u2019s approach to online campaigning, and its role in the U.S. election.

477.29999999999995, "content_html": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Alexander Nix, the CEO of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"cambridge-analytica\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge Analytica <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> (CA) plans to publish a book on his firm\u2019s approach to online campaigning, and its role in the U.S. election. In <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/cambridge-analytica-ceo-talks-to-techcrunch-about-trump-hilary-and-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an exclusive interview</a> with TechCrunch he says the book will \u201ctalk about our methodology and our approach to communications\u201d in technical terms, and go into how the firm is using psychographics in its campaigns online.</p> <p>The book, with the working title \u201cMad Men To Maths Men,\u201d (in reference to the hit TV drama) will be coming out in Germany first, and later internationally.</p> <p>In an extensive interview with TechCrunch, <a href=\"https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/cambridge-analytica-ceo-talks-to-techcrunch-about-trump-hilary-and-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published here</a>, Nix goes into depth about his company\u2019s position on data, the U.S. election, its ties with the Trump campaign and addresses its alleged ties with Russia.</p> <p>He says that \u201cold school\u201d traditional creative-led agencies \u201chave got it coming\u201d and that they will be swept away by a data-led approach, replaced by \u201chighly targeted, very personalized advertising, and that has to be data-driven. That\u2019s not instead of creativity, that\u2019s using data to augment creativity. Data first then creativity, it\u2019s linear,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He says that ahead of the U.S. election CA had \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Americans fill out a survey and merged that with as many publicly available data points on 230 million Americans. And that \u201ceveryday we have teams looking for new data sets.\u201d</p> <p>He admits CA used psychographic targeting of Americans \u201call through the 2014 midterms\u201d and all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. \u201cBut when we got to Trump\u2019s campaign\u2026 we just didn\u2019t have the time to roll out that survey.\u201d He says the Trump campaign, when CA joined it, was just too small and had no infrastructure.</p> <p>However, he did admit that \u201cthere\u2019s psychographic data that\u2019s baked-in to legacy models that we built before because we\u2019re not reinventing the wheel.\u201d And there was no \u201clong form quantitive psychographics survey\u201d done for the Trump campaign.</p> <p>Nix does not address claims that the company harvested Facebook data before its terms of service started to be shrunk, but that their data was built on surveys of 100,000 people or more.</p> <p>He also repeats the claim that they helped raise a \u201csmall dollar\u201d funding for Trump amounting to $27 million. Of this, he says \u201cI think it was extremely pivotal [to the campaign] because when Trump won the nomination he had very, very little money.\u201d</p> <p>He says CA was hired by Trump\u2019s campaign because no other usual suppliers to Republican candidates would touch the controversial candidate, and that CA saw a big business opportunity in his campaign. The thinking was that even if Trump had lost, they would have made a name for themselves in the U.S., and if they helped win the campaign they\u2019d be famous. It was a risk worth taking.</p> <p>It also meant that CA ended up taking over every aspect of the Trump campaign from data analytics, research, digital, TV and handling donations. \u201cOvernight [the contract] went from being originally just data, to end to end,\u201d says Nix.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an easy bet to make. It was a win-win. I couldn\u2019t see the downside. I thought even if Trump didn\u2019t prevail, if he didn\u2019t win the election\u2026 We\u2019re a British firm that was trying to break into the most competitive political market in the world.\u201d</p> <p>He says criticisms of them and their methods have tended to come from jealous competitors.</p> <p>\u201cYou see three quotes\u2026 they\u2019re all from people whose business you\u2019ve stolen. They\u2019re saying things like we came across \u201cCambridge Analytica. It\u2019s All snake oil\u201d [and it\u2019s from] our biggest rival.\u201d</p> <p>He dismissed characterization of CA\u2019s campaigns as being \u2018dark advertising\u2019: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of that we\u2019re doing which are innovative. And there are some things which is \u2018best practice\u2019 digital advertising, best practice communications which we\u2019re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.\u201d</p> <p>He says attacks on CA are mostly by \u201cthe liberal press\u201d supporting Hilary Clinton: \u201cHilary simply cannot come to terms with it. She\u2019s a woman in denial. The liberal press [characterized Cambridge Analytica] as witchcraft, \u201cthey cheat, it is voodoo!\u201d and now it\u2019s Russia\u2019s fault! They just cannot accept the fact that Hillary was such an unpopular, such a divisive candidate. She failed to mobilize her base and people didn\u2019t fundamentally trust her. Rather than looking in the mirror, they much prefer to beat up Cambridge [Analytica] beat up Trump, beat up anyone else. Anything but accept the fact that their candidate wasn\u2019t what the people wanted to vote for.\u201d</p> <p>Nix plans to publish a book on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s approach to online campaigning, and its role in the U.S. election.</p> <p>He says the book will \u201ctalk about our methodology and our approach to communications.\u201d It will also talk in \u201cquite technical terms\u201d about how communication is changing, what how technology is impacting that. It will feature case studies \u201cwith a lot of real examples of artwork and targeting and psychographics and so forth to illustrate them.\u201d</p> <p>The book will be coming out in Germany first, with a German publisher, after which it will be published in the U.K. and internationally. The working title is \u201cMad men to maths men\u201d.</p> <p>On Brexit, he categorically denies CA had any involvement. CA \u201cdid not work on Brexit,\u201d he says. Claims in the media to the contrary were wrong and based on the \u2018liberal media\u2019s\u2019 denial that the UK wanted to leave the EU. He says the rumour has come about because they were approached by \u201cby a number of different campaigns, pro and against, to discuss whether there might be a role for us on Brexit\u2026 We had a number of discussions. Obviously, these discussions made their way into the public forum but we meet with hundreds of companies every year and talk about business opportunities. That doesn\u2019t mean you engage with them doesn\u2019t mean you contract with them and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean that you work for them.\u201d</p> <p>He says stories by The Guardian that CA worked on pro-Brexit campaigns were based on \u201cone or two data points\u201d that they \u201cthen created an entire narrative around that that was pure fiction.\u201d</p> <p>He says CA has worked on political campaigns in African countries but does not comment on \u201clive campaigns.\u201d</p> <p>He says the firm \u201cworked in Kenya in 2013 on the last election for Kenyatta, but would not comment if CA has worked for Kenyatta in this year\u2019s controversial election.</p> <p>However, he does say that \u201cI think that the court\u2019s decision [to re-run the election] was a dreadful decision. I think that it is going to result in dreadful bloodshed, horrific violence. If Kenyatta for any reason doesn\u2019t win this election then his supporters are going to feel robbed. And if Odinga\u2019s people don\u2019t, they\u2019re going to feel that he\u2019s cheated again because that\u2019s the perception that Odinga is put out into the public domain. I can\u2019t see this ending well. I think just for the sake of Kenya, for peace in the region, I think it\u2019s a dreadful decision.\u201d</p> <p>He says \u201cwe\u2019ve never been asked directly\u201d if they had worked on a campaign for the Russian government or via third-party actors connected to them, such as for the Trump campaign or any other.</p> <p>He says: \u201cNo one of authority has leveled any direct criticisms to us and, certainly, no one has suggested that we\u2019d been or alleged that we\u2019d been involved as far as I\u2019m aware. We\u2019re not under investigation by anyone. We are helping wherever we can with the understandings of the campaign, like everyone else in the campaign, but there\u2019s no investigation into Cambridge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe never worked in Russia. We never worked for Russia. I want to be careful, but I don\u2019t think we have any Russian employees in our company whatsoever. We just don\u2019t have business in Russia. We have no involvement with Russia, never have done.\u201d</p> <p>He declines to talk about reports that CA is bankrolled by shadowy hedge-fund owner Robert Mercer, who has been accused of pulling the strings on many aspects of the campaigns against Hilary Clinton and against other Trump opponents.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to speak about any of our investors or board members at all because we don\u2019t.\u201d He denies that the company\u2019s \u201cpolitical ideology [is] influenced by other people in the company\u2019 at whatever level. \u201cWe leave our personal ideologies at the door\u2026 We only work for mainstream political parties.\u201d</p> <p>He says CA works on campaigns for both left and right-wing parties internationally.</p> <p>He accuses the tech community of being overly Left-leaning, which, he says, effectively became a business opportunity for firms servicing the Right wing of politics. \u201cBecause of the dearth of talent, the Republicans were getting murdered in the tech arms race. That was the commercial opportunity, that was the one we sought to address\u2026 Had it been the other way around it might have been a different story.\u201d</p> <p>Deflecting a question about whether they worked for the Pentagon he says \u201cwe\u2019ve worked for global militaries all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>He predicted that IoT is going to \u201ctotally radicalize\u201d the data market: \u201cAs the internet of things grows, as we have sensors on everything: cars, fridges, TVs then data is going to become ubiquitous.\u201d He also thinks \u201cpeople are going to start taking control of their data much more. There is going to be more reciprocity in the way that people share their data with companies like my own and other marketing agencies.\u201d</p> <p>And that much of it will be \u201cself-regulated through the blockchain\u2026 millennials\u2026 understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says.</p> ", "website": "techcrunch"}

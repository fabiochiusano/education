The clay vessel dates to around 3,000 B.C. and was buried in a prehistoric barrow discovered on the site of a future housing development. Because it was clear to the naked eye that there were archaeological features on site, a terrace on the north side of the River Aire, developers Barratt Homes engaged Prospect Archaeology (PA) to organize a seven-week excavation before construction began. PA brought in contractors Archaeological Services WYAS (ASWYAS) to evaluate and excavate the site. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47883\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 84px) 100vw, 84px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-84x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-84x150.jpg 84w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-169x300.jpg 169w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-430x764.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead.jpg 1152w\" title=\"Neolithic leaf-shapred flint arrowhead.

The clay vessel dates to around 3,000 B.C. and was buried in a prehistoric barrow discovered on the site of a future housing development. Because it was clear to the naked eye that there were archaeological features on site, a terrace on the north side of the River Aire, developers Barratt Homes engaged Prospect Archaeology (PA) to organize a seven-week excavation before construction began. PA brought in contractors Archaeological Services WYAS (ASWYAS) to evaluate and excavate the site. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47883\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 84px) 100vw, 84px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-84x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-84x150.jpg 84w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-169x300.jpg 169w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead-430x764.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flint-arrowhead.jpg 1152w\" title=\"Neolithic leaf-shapred flint arrowhead. Photo courtesy the West Yorkshire Historic Environment Record.\" width=\"84\"/></a>The ASWYAS team began with a geophysical scan of the property. The magnetometer picked up anomalous features consistent with Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age burials. Excavation confirmed the results of the scan. Just under the surface of the terrace was a prehistoric barrow bounded by a double ditch. Few artifacts and remains were discovered, but the ones that were are notable. Among the few flints unearthed was a Neolithic leaf-shaped arrowhead, a later flint blade and most significantly, a complete collared clay urn. The artifacts, size and design of the barrow indicates it was first created around 5,000 to 4,500 years ago in the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age.</p>\n<p>The barrow is only part of a larger complex. About 100 meters (330 feet) from the barrow is squared space enclosed by ditches is probably a mortuary enclosure, used in funerary rites that culminated in the barrow burial. On the outside of the barrow\u2019s outermost ditch archaeologists found a pit alignment \u2014 a lined up series of pits that delimit an area in the same way boundary ditches do \u2014 that dates to the Iron Age, 1,500 years after the barrow was first made. Pit alignments are still somewhat mysterious. Archaeologists aren\u2019t sure if they were dug that way in haste \u2014 some were later dug out into full-on ditches \u2014 or if there was a deliberate purpose to the pit design. Soil samples have been taken from the bottom of the pits so that they can be dated and analyzed for more information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Neolithic-cinerary-urn.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47882\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 84px) 100vw, 84px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Neolithic-cinerary-urn-84x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Neolithic-cinerary-urn-84x150.jpg 84w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Neolithic-cinerary-urn-169x300.jpg 169w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Neolithic-cinerary-urn-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Neolithic-cinerary-urn-430x764.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Neolithic-cinerary-urn.jpg 1152w\" title=\"Neolithic cinerary urn.

These types of vessels are believed to have been used primarily for burial or other ritual purposes. The Silsden pot falls into line with its brethren. It was found buried in a pit near the center point of the round barrow. Archaeologists believe it was the primary burial, the reason the barrow was built. This pot was not the only burial found in the barrow. Other pottery vessels that may contain human remains and a later cremation burial were unearthed from the barrow and its associated ditches. That means the barrow was recognized and used reverently for hundreds of years well into the Bronze Age. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Urn-raised-intact-for-lab-excavation.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47879\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 84px) 100vw, 84px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Urn-raised-intact-for-lab-excavation-84x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Urn-raised-intact-for-lab-excavation-84x150.jpg 84w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Urn-raised-intact-for-lab-excavation-169x300.jpg 169w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Urn-raised-intact-for-lab-excavation-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Urn-raised-intact-for-lab-excavation-430x764.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Urn-raised-intact-for-lab-excavation.jpg 1152w\" title=\"Urn raised intact for excavation in laboratory conditions. Photo courtesy the West Yorkshire Historic Environment Record.\" width=\"84\"/></a>To ensure its precious contents, which may still contain human remains, were not disturbed or worse, carried away by a stiff breeze, during excavation in situ, the main pot was wrapped on site and raised intact so it could be transported safely to the conservation lab and excavated in a contained and controlled environment. After excavation, conservation and study, the funeral urn will probably go on display at the Cliffe Castle Museum.</p>\n<p>The excavation of the Silsden site also found later remains, mainly evidence of agricultural usage like field ditches, ridge and furrow cultivation from the Middle Ages, and relatively new features added in the 18th and 19th centuries. One of them in particular deserves a spotlight dance: a dry stone wall built to mark a boundary line or enclose a field. It is a real beauty and I feel compelled to give it a vigorous, even vehement, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/B01o2xtJwgk\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Foster Kane clap</a>. I love a great dry stone wall, and apparently Yorkshire is crisscrossed with them, like a great patchwork quilt with masonry seams. The craft is still very much alive, with <a href=\"https://www.ydswg.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">drystone walling associations</a> and training programs to ensure there will be a new generation of builders keeping the tradition, and any historic walls in need of repair, standing proud.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drystone-wall-18th-19th-c.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-47878\" height=\"287\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drystone-wall-18th-19th-c-430x287.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drystone-wall-18th-19th-c-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drystone-wall-18th-19th-c-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drystone-wall-18th-19th-c-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drystone-wall-18th-19th-c-768x512.jpg 768w\" title=\"Drystone wall, 18th-19th c.

Photo by Piotr Alagierski.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Archaeologist Piotr Alagierski was enjoying his vacation, taking a leisurely Sunday stroll through a farmed field in the southeastern Poland village of Kosina when he came across <a href=\"http://scienceinpoland.pap.pl/en/news/news,414644,podkarpackie--unique-figurine-from-7-thousand-years-ago-discovered-in-arable-field.html\" target=\"_blank\">a small clay figurine</a>. Just seven centimeters (2.8 inches) long, the little man was missing some of his parts. Only his head, torso and one arm or hand remain. What was left of him was enough for Alagierski to conclude that the fired clay piece is a Neolithic figurine that may be as much as 7,000 years old.</p>\n<p>If that age is confirmed, it will make the figurine one of the oldest depictions of a human ever found in Poland and an object of national significance. Even among the few pieces from this period that have been found, he is extremely rare. The others have the voluptuous bodies and exaggerated sex characteristics frequently seen in prehistoric mother figures. All the detail in these types of figures tends to be centered on the breasts, belly and genitalia, not on facial features or adornments. The Kosina figurine takes a different approach.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe style in which the figurine was made is surprising. It resembles similar figurines from Slovakia and Romania\u201d \u2013 explained [Piotr Alagierski].

There is a visible indentation on the chest, probably representing a garment, probably a tunic. A necklace is visible on the neck\u201d \u2013 the archaeologist described. Contrary to the few figurines from this period previously found in Poland, this one does not have prominent sex features.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the field around the figurine I also noticed large quantities of fragments of ceramic vessels and obsidian, volcanic glass, which is produced by the instantaneous cooling of the lava. This material is also known from the areas of Poland\u2019s neighboring countries: Ukraine and Slovakia\u201d \u2013 Alagierski described in an interview with PAP.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Clay-figurine-left-side.-Photo-by-Piotr-Alagierski.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Clay-figurine-left-side.-Photo-by-Piotr-Alagierski-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Clay-figurine-left-side.-Photo-by-Piotr-Alagierski-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Clay-figurine-left-side.-Photo-by-Piotr-Alagierski-200x260.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Clay-figurine-left-side.-Photo-by-Piotr-Alagierski-430x559.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Clay-figurine-left-side.-Photo-by-Piotr-Alagierski.jpg 738w\" title=\"Clay figurine, left side.

That\u2019s what he\u2019s basing the date of the figurine on \u2014 that there was a farm on the site from early in the shift to agriculture, and that the figurine is contemporaneous with said settlement \u2014 which seems tenuous to me so early in the investigation.</p>\n<p>We may get some firmer answers soon. Alagierski plans to excavate the site to find material evidence of the settlement and to flesh out the context in which the figurine was discovered. The figurine itself will also be studied. Researchers will run a series of chemical analyses that will determine where the clay came from. Given the objects and materials Alagierski saw in the field, it\u2019s possible that the clay may not have been local, but rather from north of the Carpathians, which would suggest either population movements or trade with neighbors to the north.</p>\n<p>The figurine is now in the custody of the Regional Office for the Protection of Monuments in Rzeszow.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Archaeologist on vacation finds ancient figurine\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47867\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47867#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-47836\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47836\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Wood beams, furniture preserved by fire found in Rome\">Wood beams, furniture preserved by fire found in Rome</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, June 28th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Villa-walls-at-the-bottom-of-the-dig-pit.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47850\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 84px) 100vw, 84px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Villa-walls-at-the-bottom-of-the-dig-pit-84x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Villa-walls-at-the-bottom-of-the-dig-pit-84x150.jpg 84w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Villa-walls-at-the-bottom-of-the-dig-pit-169x300.jpg 169w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Villa-walls-at-the-bottom-of-the-dig-pit-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Villa-walls-at-the-bottom-of-the-dig-pit-430x764.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Villa-walls-at-the-bottom-of-the-dig-pit.jpg 1125w\" title=\"3rd c. brickwork walls at the bottom of the 33-foot-deep pit.

The latest discovery is an <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Subway-digging-uncovers-Pompeii-like-scene-in-11247366.php#photo-13151587\" target=\"_blank\">early 3rd century villa that collapsed in a fire</a>. The intense heat of the blaze charred wooden beams and the collapse of the structure on top of them helped preserved the organic remains for 1,800 years. </p>\n<p>Organic remains preserved by instant carbonization have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, but those cities succumbed to a cataclysmic volcanic eruption that froze everything in time. Buildings burned down in Rome all the time, some fires spreading rapidly throughout the city like the Great Fire of 64 A.D. over which Nero is said to have sung mournfully about the destruction of Troy, some relatively contained either by (rudimentary) firefighting measures or by a fortuitous separation between buildings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sections-of-floor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47845\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sections-of-floor-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sections-of-floor-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sections-of-floor-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sections-of-floor-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sections-of-floor-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sections of concrete and mosaic floor.

Even though the tightly-packed, wood-heavy ancient city was subject to regular conflagrations, most of the evidence for them in the archaeological record consists of marks, dark spots indicating charring. Thousands of years of battling the water table and Tiber floods and construction over construction have made Rome a tough environment for the preservation of wood, textiles and organics of any type. The discovery of fire-preserved wood from a villa in the city is therefore an extremely exciting find.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mosaic-floor-blackened-by-fire.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47849\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mosaic-floor-blackened-by-fire-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mosaic-floor-blackened-by-fire-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mosaic-floor-blackened-by-fire-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mosaic-floor-blackened-by-fire-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mosaic-floor-blackened-by-fire-430x242.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mosaic floor and carbonized wooden beams.

Today the Jelling complex consists of two large burial mounds, two monumental runestones and a small church built on the site of three earlier wooden churches going back 1,000 years. The combination of tumuli, runestones and church capture the transition from the traditional Norse religion to Christianity. King Gorm the Old, the first king of Denmark, dedicated the smaller and older of the runestones. The inscription translates to: \u201cKing Gormr made this monument in memory of Thyrv\u00e9, his wife, Denmark\u2019s adornment.\u201d His son Harald Bluetooth had the second, much larger stone raised and its runic inscription reads: \u201cKing Harald bade this monument be made in memory of Gorm his father and Thyra his mother, that Harald who won for himself all Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christians.\u201d </p>\n<p>Within the perimeter of Jelling, the massive cultural shift from the reign of Gorm (936- ca. 958) to that of Harald (958\u2013 ca. 986) is documented in language, funerary and religious architecture. That\u2019s why the Jelling mounds, runestones and church are <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/697\" target=\"_blank\">on the UNESCO World Heritage List</a> and why the site is one of the most important in Danish history. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Archaeologists-excavate-Harald-Bluetooth-palisade-at-Jelling..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47833\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Archaeologists-excavate-Harald-Bluetooth-palisade-at-Jelling.-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Archaeologists-excavate-Harald-Bluetooth-palisade-at-Jelling.-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Archaeologists-excavate-Harald-Bluetooth-palisade-at-Jelling.-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Archaeologists-excavate-Harald-Bluetooth-palisade-at-Jelling.-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Archaeologists-excavate-Harald-Bluetooth-palisade-at-Jelling.-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"Traces of palisade in excavation of northeast corner. Photo courtesy Vejle museums.\" width=\"150\"/></a>In 2006, archaeologists were able to explore a previously inaccessible area: the bed of a pond across from Gorm\u2019s Mound. Before a planned renovation, the pond was pumped dry giving archaeologists the opportunity to excavate the mucky bottom looking for remains of the large wooden stockade that once encircled the royal estate at Jelling. Postholes from the stockade had been found before, but no physical remains. The stockade was known to have intersected part of what is now the pond, and therefore there was a chance the thick clay and mud on the bottom of the pond had preserved the organic remains of the stockade\u2019s timbers. Viking-era reports suggested there had been a body of water in the area when the stockade was built, so conditions for preservation of wood may have existed on site since the 10th century.</p>\n<p>Excavation along what was believed to be the stockade line hit the jackpot almost immediately. Just over two feet under the pond bed surface, archaeologists unearthed four large oak posts. Radiocarbon dating of samples taken from three of posts found that all samples were approximately 1,000 years old. In later excavations (2012-3), archaeologists found vertical stakes also made of oak. They are 4-5 inches thick and were driven directly into the clay of the pond bed two-by-two. There was no ditch dug into the soil first as in evidence elsewhere along the palisade line. This could only have been accomplished if the site was already watery when the stockade was built in the 10th century by Harald Bluetooth who greatly enhanced the Jelling defenses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3D-reconstruction-of-the-royal-estate-at-Jelling.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47830\" height=\"113\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3D-reconstruction-of-the-royal-estate-at-Jelling-150x113.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3D-reconstruction-of-the-royal-estate-at-Jelling-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3D-reconstruction-of-the-royal-estate-at-Jelling-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3D-reconstruction-of-the-royal-estate-at-Jelling-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3D-reconstruction-of-the-royal-estate-at-Jelling-430x323.jpg 430w\" title=\"3D reconstruction of the stockade around the royal estate at Jelling.

There\u2019s evidence of some sort of superstructure at the top of the fence, perhaps a parapet for defenders to patrol. It is by far the largest Viking fenced-in space ever discovered in Denmark or Scandinavia. It\u2019s also the only kite-shaped palisade known. The discovery of the timbers has been a boon to research on the architecture and layout of Jelling. Excavations also unearthed evidence of three different longhouses and a boat burial, although no boat remains have survived.</p>\n<p>So far, the oak posts and vertical stakes are all of the physical remains archaeologists have found of the stockade. One of their dearest wishes came true when they found a timber large enough among the thick, square planks to be dated with dendrochronological examination (i.e., tree ring counting). The wood posts and stakes were recovered from the pond site and transported to the National Museum\u2019s Conservation Department in Brede. They were dendrochronologically dated to between 958 and 985 A.D., with 968 A.D. the likeliest year for the felling of the oak tree. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jelling-palisade-in-situ.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Vertical oak planks from the defensive stockade at Jelling, 10th century.

After four years, the timbers have been stabilized and will go on display starting June 29th at the <a href=\"http://en.natmus.dk/museums/kongernes-jelling-home-of-the-viking-kings/\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum\u2019s Jelling branch</a>. The exhibition will explain to visitors the challenges in building such a huge structure in Jelling a thousand years ago. Just securing enough large oak trees for a palisade a mile long would have been enormously difficult; cutting them down, processing them and carrying them to Jelling added exponentially to the level of difficulty.</p>\n<p>The surviving wood planks and posts will be displayed in custom cases, protected from light, heat, fluctuating moisture levels, humans and the wide variety of damaging microorganisms we take with us wherever we go. All except for one small fragment from the palisade that would have disappeared compared to the larger pieces behind the glass. Curators therefore decided to allow guests to touch a piece of a 10th century Viking stockade that once enclosed the royal compound of kings Gorm and Harald. Since it was Harald Bluetooth who ordered this stockade built, it\u2019s eminently possibly that he even touched that same sliver of wood that Jelling visitors will now get to touch.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Touch a 1,000-year-old Viking palisade\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47826\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47826#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-47816\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47816\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Original 1953 Disneyland concept map sells for $708,000\">Original 1953 Disneyland concept map sells for $708,000</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, June 26th, 2017</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Disneyland-map.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-47817\" height=\"252\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Disneyland-map-430x252.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Disneyland-map-430x252.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Disneyland-map-150x88.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Disneyland-map-200x117.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Disneyland-map-768x450.jpg 768w\" title=\"Original 1953 Disneyland presentation map by by Walt Disney and artist Herb Ryman.

Walt Disney\u2019s idea for a theme park nestled in the orange groves of Anaheim, California, sounded like a cockamamie scheme to most money people and Walt and his brother Roy were repeatedly turned down. Walt was so convinced this was a winning idea that he refinanced his home to raise money for the enterprise, but it wasn\u2019t anywhere near enough. Construction of Disneyland would cost $17 million and to convinced financial types to invest that kind of money, Walt realized he needed to create a visual representation of his idea so they could get it without having to use their limited imaginations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Walt-unveils-early-rendering-of-the-park-on-the-premiere-of-his-new-ABC-show-Disneyland.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47821\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Walt-unveils-early-rendering-of-the-park-on-the-premiere-of-his-new-ABC-show-Disneyland-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Walt-unveils-early-rendering-of-the-park-on-the-premiere-of-his-new-ABC-show-Disneyland-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Walt-unveils-early-rendering-of-the-park-on-the-premiere-of-his-new-ABC-show-Disneyland-200x147.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Walt-unveils-early-rendering-of-the-park-on-the-premiere-of-his-new-ABC-show-Disneyland-768x564.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Walt-unveils-early-rendering-of-the-park-on-the-premiere-of-his-new-ABC-show-Disneyland-430x316.jpg 430w\" title='Walt unveils early rendering of the park by Disney artist Peter Ellenshaw on the premiere of his new ABC show \"Disneyland\" on October 27, 1954.' width=\"150\"/></a>On September 26th and 27th, 1953, the weekend before Roy Disney\u2019s pitch meeting with ABC executives in New York City, Walt Disney and Herb Ryman sealed themselves in to a room at Disney Studio a drew up a map. Disney told Ryman what to draw, and Ryman penciled his boss\u2019 vision on a sheet of vellum. He then transferred the drawing to more durable paper and hand-inked and colored it. The map was mounted on a three-fold presentation board and Roy Disney hustled it off to New York to present Walt\u2019s vision to the ABC people. It worked. In exchange for a Disney-produced TV series to be aired on the network, ABC agreed to finance the construction of Disneyland, still the biggest network deal in history adjusted for inflation. (Disney bought all of ABC\u2019s shares of Disneyland in 1960 and 36 years later bought ABC itself.)</p>\n<p>In October, Roy brought the map back to California where it was used throughout 1953 and 1954 to show designers, investors, engineers and artists what Walt had in mind. It was altered several times in 1954 \u2014 lines darkened, colors added, new cars hooked up to the train, the scroll gussied up \u2014 and was repeatedly featured in the advanced publicity materials from September 19th, 1954, until the park\u2019s opening on July 15th, 1955.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t keep up with the planning, though. Land of Tomorrow on the map became Tomorrowland in the park. Frontier Country became Frontierland. Lilliputian Land never happened at all. Sleeping Beauty Castle, the center point of Disneyland, is way at the back of the park in the concept map. The train station and Main Street square do match up with the real Disneyland.</p>\n<p>Even though the map had been essential to securing the funding for Walt Disney\u2019s brainchild and in promoting it in the months before its opening, Walt gave it away without hesitation before the park was even completed. The lucky recipient was one Grenade Curran, a show business veteran and jack of all trades who worked at Walt Disney Studios.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grenade-Curran.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47823\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grenade-Curran-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grenade-Curran-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grenade-Curran-200x243.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grenade-Curran-768x933.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Grenade-Curran-430x523.jpg 430w\" title=\"Grenade Curran. Photo courtesy Grenade in Hollywood.\" width=\"123\"/></a>Grenade\u2019s father was Charles Curran, an adept with the hand-held camera who became both Clark Gable\u2019s and Roy Rogers\u2019 personal cameraman. His mother had been an MGM dancer in her youth and had a very successful later career in the studio\u2019s scenic art department. With an uncle and cousin in the business as well, Grenade grew up on the backlots of Hollywood. He was buddies with some of the most famous actors of all time and their children. From the time he was a baby, he was in front of the camera in commercials and movies. As an adult, he followed in his mother\u2019s proverbial footsteps and worked as a background dancer in classic MGM musicals like <em>Singin\u2019 in the Rain</em>, <em>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</em> and <em>The Band Wagon</em>. Over his decades in the business, he also worked behind the camera, touching every aspect of production from wardrobe to set design to direction. </p>\n<p>In 1954 he got his first job with Walt Disney Studios working as a safety diver on <em>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</em> starring Kirk Douglas. Several other behind-the-scenes jobs followed in Disney pictures and television shows. Walt Disney knew Curran\u2019s family and he took a liking to Grenade, not the least because of his undeniably kickass first name. So even though he was just a regular production guy, not an executive, animator or an artist, Grenade found himself in the middle of historic events thanks to that jocular rapport he had with Disney. </p>\n<p>After the deal was struck in New York, Walt Disney showed Grenade the first check from ABC and the check the mortgage company gave him when he refinanced his home. Grenade also saw the map, witnessing artists make changes and additions at Disney\u2019s command. In March of 1955, Grenade asked him what he planned to do with the map and then boldly asked if he could have it. Walt said yes and Grenade Curran became the proud owner of the first map of Disneyland.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Crowds-at-the-main-entrance-to-Disneyland-on-opening-day.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47820\" height=\"79\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Crowds-at-the-main-entrance-to-Disneyland-on-opening-day-150x79.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Crowds-at-the-main-entrance-to-Disneyland-on-opening-day-150x79.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Crowds-at-the-main-entrance-to-Disneyland-on-opening-day-200x105.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Crowds-at-the-main-entrance-to-Disneyland-on-opening-day-768x403.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Crowds-at-the-main-entrance-to-Disneyland-on-opening-day-430x226.jpg 430w\" title=\"Crowds at the main entrance to Disneyland on opening day, July 17, 1955.

The park, which was still under construction as of that morning, wasn\u2019t even remotely ready for the 50,000 people who clamored to ride the teacups, moon over Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle and squeal with delighted horrors through Snow White\u2019s haunted forest. The asphalt on the streets melted in the 100 degree Anaheim heat. The toilets backed up. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. And yet, the massive failure of the opening day was also proof that Disneyland was a major draw, would make all of its costs back lickety-split and basically turn out to be a license to print money.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/niqcRpVSAW0\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Curran knew when he got the map that it was significant as a piece of history and a unique example of Walt Disney\u2019s creativity and his team\u2019s artistry. When Disneyland\u2019s success birthed a myriad theme parks all over the world, he realized the map marked the beginning of a global cultural phenomenon. He kept it for 25 years before selling it to avid Disney collector Ron Clark. Clark has had it in a vault ever since. The map went on display for the first time in more than 60 years earlier this month at the auction preview. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Auctioneer-Mike-Van-Eaton-with-map.-Photo-by-Damian-Dovarganes-AP.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47818\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Auctioneer-Mike-Van-Eaton-with-map.-Photo-by-Damian-Dovarganes-AP-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Auctioneer-Mike-Van-Eaton-with-map.-Photo-by-Damian-Dovarganes-AP-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Auctioneer-Mike-Van-Eaton-with-map.-Photo-by-Damian-Dovarganes-AP-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Auctioneer-Mike-Van-Eaton-with-map.-Photo-by-Damian-Dovarganes-AP-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Auctioneer-Mike-Van-Eaton-with-map.-Photo-by-Damian-Dovarganes-AP-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Auctioneer Mike Van Eaton with map.

It was an accidental find. The police were looking for smuggled Chinese art, antiquities and mummies but instead found around 75 Nazi objects in a room at the end of a secret passageway whose entrance was hidden behind a bookshelf. The collection is varied but appears to be of very high end material \u2014 magnifying glasses, telescopes, firearms, medals, an award from Krupp, a Reichsadler (imperial eagle) manufactured by Carl Eickhorn of Solingen, busts and reliefs of Hitler, a presentation dagger with carved antler handle and swastika medallion, swastika-branded toys like board games and harmonicas to help raise good Nazi children. It is the largest collection of Nazi tat ever found in Argentina.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue-of-Reichsadler.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47811\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue-of-Reichsadler-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue-of-Reichsadler-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue-of-Reichsadler-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue-of-Reichsadler-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue-of-Reichsadler-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Members of the federal police carry statue of the Reichsadler at the Interpol headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Friday, June 16, 2017.

The monster/doctor Josef Mengele who used Auschwitz inmates as guinea pigs in his sickening and usually fatal experiments lived in Buenos Aires for more than a decade from 1949 until 1960. Adolf Eichmann, one of the main architects of the Holocaust who was \u201cjust following orders,\u201d was captured by Mossad agents in Buenos Aires in 1960, tried in Israel, convicted and executed. The home where the secret trove was found is in Beccar, a northern suburb of Buenos Aires. Both Mengele and Eichmann lived in Beccar during their sojourns in the Argentinian capital.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nazi-branded-toys-for-children.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47809\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nazi-branded-toys-for-children-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nazi-branded-toys-for-children-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nazi-branded-toys-for-children-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nazi-branded-toys-for-children-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nazi-branded-toys-for-children-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Box with harmonicas for good Nazi children.

All the authorities will say about this individual is that he is a collector who claims to have acquired the Nazi memorabilia in a single purchase 25 years ago from an Argentinian national. He has an eclectic group of 17 different collections, including a collection of erotica which features highly decorative Russian dildos from the Tsarist era. The collector has yet to be charged for any crime, but he is accused of smuggling (charges unrelated to the Nazi artifacts) and is being investigated for illegal sale of Nazi propaganda.

It\u2019s the first funerary complex found in Nicaragua with such a density of burials in the same small area. The ancient cemetery site hasn\u2019t been populated in modern times, which is damn good luck because there\u2019s no way these delicate remains and ceramics would have survived major construction just a few feet underground, but centuries ago the indigenous people who lived in what is now Managua settled there because of the ample sources of water from a nearby lake and rivers.</p>\n<p>Other objects from the period have been found in Masaya and Granada, about 20 miles southeast of Managua, and in Rivas, about 56 miles south of the capital. Archaeologists hope this historic find will shed new light on the population and culture of the region.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Small-pot-found-at-Pre-Columbian-cemetery.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47796\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Small-pot-found-at-Pre-Columbian-cemetery-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Small-pot-found-at-Pre-Columbian-cemetery-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Small-pot-found-at-Pre-Columbian-cemetery-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Small-pot-found-at-Pre-Columbian-cemetery-768x514.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Small-pot-found-at-Pre-Columbian-cemetery-430x288.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Small-pot-found-at-Pre-Columbian-cemetery.jpg 1359w\" title=\"Small pot found at Pre-Columbian cemetery.

The Colchester circus was built in the 2nd century A.D. as a venue for chariot racing. It is the only Roman circus ever discovered in the UK and it\u2019s the only one ever found north of the Alps. Its characteristic U-shaped arena was 450 meters (1476 feet) long had eight starting gates plus a monumental archway at the flat end of the U. There were three tiers of bleachers around the arena with one large entrance passage at the curved end and multiple other passageways through which the estimated 8,000 spectactors attending the races could enter and leave the stands. These entrances/exits were known as <em>vomitoria</em> in Latin because of the crowds that spewed forth from them. Some were also used by the staff for the quick removal of mangled bodies, human and equine, and chariots from the arena floor.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.thecolchesterarchaeologist.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Colchester Archaeological Trust</a> (CAT), which <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/4998\" target=\"_blank\">raised funds to save the circus</a> from being buried under a housing development and then even more funds to buy the adjacent Victorian barracks to expand the excavation and build a new visitor\u2019s center, has been excavating the site for more than a decade and still don\u2019t know precisely how many passageways the circus had. They estimate there were 12 of them. The newly discovered vomitorium is only the fifth unearthed so far and it is the best preserved of the five. Six Roman feet (5.8 feet) wide, it has a north-south orientation and led from outside the arena to the southern stands. Archaeologists thought the passageway in this section was about 20 feet east of the one they found, so the discovery came as a surprise. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/View-of-hoof.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47785\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/View-of-hoof-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/View-of-hoof-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/View-of-hoof-200x200.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/View-of-hoof-768x767.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/View-of-hoof-430x429.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/View-of-hoof.jpg 1065w\" title=\"Four views of the small hoof bone. Photo courtesy the Colchester Archaeological Trust.\" width=\"150\"/></a>Another happy surprise was a small but significant find: a small hoof bone. Just 6 cm (2.4 inches) wide, 3.5 cm (1.4 inches) high and 4.2 cm (1.7 inches) deep, it\u2019s the coffin bone, aka the distal phalanx, the core of the hoof. Its diminutive size \u2014 comparable to a large Shetland pony\u2019s \u2014 suggests it came from a small female horse or a pony. The clean symmetrical shape and lack of wear indicates this was a young horse, but there is evidence of arthritis which would not be present in a young horse unless it was subjected to major physical strain. The sharp turns and hard running of the chariot races \u2014 each race required competitors to do 14 turns around the central <em>spina</em> and breakneck speed \u2014 would certainly qualify. </p>\n<p>The bone was found inside the passageway.

The town\u2019s pivotal role in the opening salvos of the War of Independence, the Battles of Lexington and Concord, is represented by, among other treasures, the lantern Paul Revere had hung in the steeple of Boston\u2019s Old North Church to warn the colonial militia that the British regulars were coming by land, and the Amos Barrett powder horn which was used at the Battle of Concord on April 19th, 1775.</p>\n<p>Concord is just as prominent in 19th century literary history. Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose father was raised in Concord, moved there in 1835 and his circle of Transcendentalist writers and thinkers grew around him. The likes of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Louisa May Alcott wrote seminal works as part of Emerson\u2019s Concord crew. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Henry-David-Thoreau-in-an-ambrotype-portrait-from-1861-by-Edward-Sidney-Dunshee.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-47775\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Henry-David-Thoreau-in-an-ambrotype-portrait-from-1861-by-Edward-Sidney-Dunshee-123x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Henry-David-Thoreau-in-an-ambrotype-portrait-from-1861-by-Edward-Sidney-Dunshee-123x150.jpg 123w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Henry-David-Thoreau-in-an-ambrotype-portrait-from-1861-by-Edward-Sidney-Dunshee-200x244.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Henry-David-Thoreau-in-an-ambrotype-portrait-from-1861-by-Edward-Sidney-Dunshee-768x936.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Henry-David-Thoreau-in-an-ambrotype-portrait-from-1861-by-Edward-Sidney-Dunshee-430x524.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Henry-David-Thoreau-in-an-ambrotype-portrait-from-1861-by-Edward-Sidney-Dunshee.jpg 1199w\" title=\"Last known photograph of Henry David Thoreau, ambrotype portrait by Edward Sidney Dunshee, 1861. Photo courtesy the Concord Museum.\" width=\"123\"/></a>It\u2019s Henry David Thoreau, however, who left his greatest mark on Concord and its museum. He was one of Emerson\u2019s circle, but he didn\u2019t follow him to Concord; Thoreau was a native Concordian, the son of a local pencil maker father and committed abolitionist mother. Their family home was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Walden Pond, where he lived in a little cottage for two years and wrote his seminal work <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/waldenorlifeinwo00thoruoft\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Walden</em></a> is in Concord. He wrote <a href=\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper2/thoreau/civil.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Civil Disobedience</em></a> after spending a night in Concord jail for refusing to pay taxes in protest of slavery.</p>\n<p>Unlike Emerson\u2019s, Thoreau\u2019s writings were largely dismissed during his lifetime, especially his political essays which would have such a profound influence on world-changing figures like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. His writings on natural history, primarily <em>Walden</em>, got more attention, but they received mixed reviews at best. Even though his friend and literary luminary Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered the eulogy at his funeral after he died of tuberculosis in 1862, Thoreau didn\u2019t even get his own individual obituary. It was lumped in with a group of other people who had recently died.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Inscribed-Leaf-1868-Sophia-E.-Thoreau-Concord-Museum.-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47773\" height=\"134\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Inscribed-Leaf-1868-Sophia-E.-Thoreau-Concord-Museum.--150x134.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Inscribed-Leaf-1868-Sophia-E.-Thoreau-Concord-Museum.--150x134.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Inscribed-Leaf-1868-Sophia-E.-Thoreau-Concord-Museum.--200x179.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Inscribed-Leaf-1868-Sophia-E.-Thoreau-Concord-Museum.--768x687.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Inscribed-Leaf-1868-Sophia-E.-Thoreau-Concord-Museum.--430x384.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Inscribed-Leaf-1868-Sophia-E.-Thoreau-Concord-Museum.-.jpg 1000w\" title=\"Pressed and inscribed in ink by Sophia Thoreau, the large leaf has verses from the poetry of Henry David and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

They had been very close \u2014 Thoreau was no social butterfly and could be a cantankerous cuss even with his close friends, but he was a loving and warm sibling \u2014 and enjoyed their shared interest in naturalism. He recorded several times in his journals that she had discovered botanical specimens he\u2019d never seen before. Her particular skill was in pressing and attaching plants to a backing sheet with strips of paper that were entirely invisible once she was done. They were so good that a professional like Louis Agassiz, Harvard\u2019s first professor of botany, acquired some of Sophia\u2019s specimens. Several of her specimens now in the Concord Museum include tributes to great authors including Emerson, Shakespeare, and of course her beloved brother. She wrote verses from their poetry in ink on pressed leaves.</p>\n<p>Their bond and love of nature is sweetly illustrated in <a href=\"https://blogthoreau.blogspot.com/2005/05/thoreaus-journal-22-may-1853.html\" target=\"_blank\">this passage from Thoreau\u2019s journal dated May 22, 1853</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When yesterday Sophia and I were rowing past Mr. Prichard\u2019s land, where the river is bordered by a row of elms and low willows, at 6 P.M., we heard a singular note of distress as if it were from a catbird \u2014 a loud, vibrating, catbird sort of note, as if the catbird\u2019s mew were imitated by a smart vibrating spring. Blackbirds and others were flitting about, apparently attracted by it. At first, thinking it was merely some peevish catbird or red-wing, I was disregarding it, but on second thought turned the bows to the shore, looking into the trees as well as over the shore, thinking some bird might be in distress, caught by a snake or in a forked twig. The hovering birds dispersed at my approach; the note of distress sounded louder and nearer as I approached the shore covered with low osiers. The sound came from the ground, not from the trees. I saw a little black animal making haste to meet the boat under the osiers. A young muskrat? a mink? No, it was a little dot of a kitten. It was scarcely six inches long from the face to the base \u2014 or I might as well say the tip \u2014 of the tail, for the latter was a short, sharp pyramid, perfectly perpendicular but not swelled in the least. It was a very handsome and precocious kitten, in perfectly good condition, its breadth being considerably more than one third of its length. Leaving its mewing, it came scrambling over the stones as fast as its weak legs would permit straight to me. I took it up and dropped it into the boat, but while I was pushing off it ran to Sophia, who held it while we rowed homeward. Evidently it had not been weaned \u2014 was smaller than we remembered that kittens ever were \u2014 almost infinitely small; yet it had hailed a boat, its life being in danger, and saved itself. Its performance, considering its age and amount of experience, was more wonderful than that of any young mathematician or musician that I have read of.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Page-from-Thoreau-journal.-Morgan-Library..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Page from Thoreau's journal.

One of the oldest prosthetic devices known (its precise age is unclear and there\u2019s some overlap with the date range of the cartonnage <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=170683&amp;partId=1\" target=\"_blank\">Greville Chester toe</a>), the Cairo toe is the oldest prosthetic discovered in situ, albeit disturbed from its original placement.</p>\n<p>The wooden prosthetic toe was discovered in 2000 in a burial chamber in the necropolis of Sheikh \u2018Abd el-Qurna near Luxor. It was one of multiple burials found in tomb TT95, one of five rock-cut tombs built into the eastward facing hillside of Sheikh \u2018Abd el-Qurna. The tomb complex was built in the 15th century B.C. by order of Mery, High Priest of Amun under Amenhotep II (r. 1427\u20131401 B.C.), to hold the remains of his immediate family. Construction of the elaborate funerary chapel appears to have been interrupted by a cave-in, but the complex continued to be used for burials through the Late Period (4th century B.C.) and was adapted for use as housing in the Late Roman era. People lived in the complex off and on well into the 20th century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newsimage289421.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-47763\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newsimage289421-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newsimage289421-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newsimage289421-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newsimage289421-768x430.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newsimage289421-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/newsimage289421.jpg 958w\" title=\"View of the excavation area in the cemetery of Sheikh \u00b4Abd el-Qurna.

It dates to the Third Intermediate Period (1069 B.C.- 664 B.C.) and had been extensive looted over the centuries. The mummified remains of a 50-to 60-year-old woman named Tabaketenmut, the daughter of a high priest who lived between 950 and 710 B.C., were found disarticulated in the fill of the shaft. The front half of the right foot was discovered intact with a wooden toe prosthesis connected to a well-healed amputation site with leather laces. </p>\n<p>Egyptians made artificial parts for burial purposes, but this toe showed signs of having been of practical use during the woman\u2019s lifetime. The prosthetic\u2019s design was mechanically advanced and made for movement, not a cosmetic piece meant to adorn a dead body. It was made of three pieces of wood carved to precisely conform to the shape of the foot. The wood parts had holes drilled along the boundaries and leather string threaded through them and around the side of the foot, keeping the prosthetic securely attached while allowing articulated movement. It also has signs of wear that suggests its long-term use. </p>\n<p>The toe is part of the collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Last fall, Egyptologists from the University of Basel started a new project to re-examine and thoroughly document all the remains and objects discovered in the TT95 tomb complex. The toe and the partial foot to which it was attached were part of this study.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prosthetic-toe-of-Tabaketenmut-in-Cairo-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-39944\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prosthetic-toe-of-Tabaketenmut-in-Cairo-Museum-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prosthetic-toe-of-Tabaketenmut-in-Cairo-Museum-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prosthetic-toe-of-Tabaketenmut-in-Cairo-Museum-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Prosthetic-toe-of-Tabaketenmut-in-Cairo-Museum-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Prosthetic toe of Tabaketenmut in the Cairo Museum. Photo courtesy the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.\" width=\"200\"/></a>The international team investigated the one-of-a-kind prosthesis using modern microscopy, X-ray technology, and computer tomography. They were able to show that the wooden toe was refitted several times to the foot of its owner, a priest\u2019s daughter. The researchers also newly classified the used materials and identified the method with which the highly developed prosthesis was produced and utilized. Experts from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo \u2013 where the prosthetic device was brought to after it had been found \u2013 and the Institute of Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich were also involved in this study.</p>\n<p>The artificial toe from the early first millennium BC testifies to the skills of an artisan who was very familiar with the human physiognomy. The technical know-how can be seen particularly well in the mobility of the prosthetic extension and the robust structure of the belt strap. The fact that the prosthesis was made in such a laborious and meticulous manner indicates that the owner valued a natural look, aesthetics and wearing comfort and that she was able to count on highly qualified specialists to provide this.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"A new look at an ancient Egyptian prosthetic toe\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47762\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/47762#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2017/06/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

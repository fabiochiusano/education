It has me thinking about the extent to which we ought, or ought not, defer to ethical experts when we are otherwise inclined to disagree with their conclusions.<p>\n\nTo illustrate the idea of firsthand intuitive insight, Sosa gives two examples.  One concerns mathematics.  Consider a student who learns that the Pythagorean theorem is true without learning its proof.  This student knows that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 but doesn't have any insight into <i>why </i>it's true.  Contrast this student with one who masters the proof and consequently does understand why it's true.  The second student, but not the first, has firsthand intuitive insight.  Sosa's other example is in ethics.  One child bullies another.  Her mother, seeing the act and seeing the grief in the face of the other child, tells the bullying child that she should apologize.  The child might defer to her mother's ethical judgment, sincerely concluding she really should apologize, but without understanding why what she has done is bad enough to require apology.  Alternatively, she might come to genuinely notice the other child's grief and more fully understand how her bullying was inappropriate, and thus gain firsthand intuitive insight into the need for apology.  (I worry that firsthand intuitive insight is a bit of a slippery concept, but I don't think I can do more with it here.)<p>\n<b>Sosa argues that a central aim of much of philosophy is firsthand intuitive insight of this sort.</b>  In the sciences and in history, it's often enough just to know that some fact is true (that helium has two protons, that the Qin Dynasty fell in 206 BCE).  On such matters, we happily defer to experts.  In philosophy, we're less likely to accept a truth without having our own personal, firsthand intuitive insight.  Expert metaphysicians might almost universally agree that barstool-shaped-aggregates but not barstools themselves supervene on collections of particles arranged barstoolwise.  Expert ethicists might almost universally agree that a straightforward pleasure-maximizing utilitarian ethics would require radical revision of ordinary moral judgments.  But we're not inclined to just take them at their word.  We want to understand for ourselves how it is so.<p>\n\nThis seems right.  And yet, there's a bit of a puzzle in it, if we think that it's important that our ethical opinions be <i>correct</i>.  (Yes, I'm assuming that ethics is a domain in which there are correct and incorrect opinions.)  What should we do when the majority of philosophical experts think P, but your own (apparent) firsthand intuitive insight suggests not-P?  If you care about correctness above all, maybe you should defer to the experts, despite your lack of understanding.  But Sosa appears to think, as I suspect many of us do, that often the right course instead is to stand <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disagreement/#SteaView\">steadfast</a>, continuing to judge according to your own best independent reasoning.<p>\n\nBorrowing an example from <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40658407\">Sarah McGrath's work on moral deference</a>, consider the case of vegetarianism.  Based on <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHTMB-4\">some of my work</a>, I think that probably the majority of professional ethicists in the United States believe that it is normally morally wrong to eat the meat of factory-farmed animals.  This might also be true <a href=\"https://osf.io/35r48/\">in German-speaking countries</a>.  Impressionistically, most of the philosophers I know who have given the issue serious and detailed consideration come to endorse vegetarianism, including two of the most prominent ethicists currently alive, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061711305/animal-liberation/\">Peter Singer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198753853\">Christine Korsgaard</a>.  Now suppose that you haven't given the matter nearly as much thought as they have, but you have given it some thought.  You're inclined still to think that eating meat is okay, and you can maybe mount one or two plausible-seeming defenses of your view.  Should you defer to their ethical expertise?<p>\n\nSosa compares philosophical reasoning with archery.  You not only want to hit the target (the truth), you want to do so by the exercise of your own skill (your own intuitive insight), rather than by having an expert guide your hand (deference to experts).  I agree that ideally this is so.  It's nice when you have have both truth and intuitive insight!  But when the aim of hitting the target conflicts with the aim of doing so by your own intuitive insight, your preference should depend on the stakes.  If it's an archery contest, you don't want the coach's help: The most important thing is the test of your own skill.  But if you're a subsistence hunter who needs dinner, then you probably ought to take any help you can get, if the target looks like it's about to escape.  And isn't ethics (outside the classroom, at least) more like subsistence hunting than like an archery contest?  <b>What should matter most is whether you actually come to the right moral conclusion about eating meat (or whatever) not whether you get there by your own insight.</b>  Excessive emphasis on the individual's need for intuitive insight, at the cost of truth or correctness, risks turning ethics into a kind of sport.<p>\n\nSo maybe, then, you should defer to the majority of ethical experts, and conclude that it is normally wrong to eat factory-farmed meat, even if that conclusion doesn't accord with your own best attempts at insight?<p>\n\nWhile I'm tempted to say this, I simultaneously feel pulled in Sosa's direction -- and perhaps I should defer to his expertise as one of the world's leading epistemologists!  There's something I like about non-deference in philosophy, and our prizing of people's standing fast in their own best judgments, even in the teeth of disagreement by better-informed experts.  So here are four brief defenses of non-deference.  I fear none of them is quite sufficient.  But maybe in combination they will take us somewhere?<p>\n<b>(1.) The \"experts\" might not be experts.</b>  This is McGrath's defense of non-deference in ethics.  Despite their seeming expertise, great ethicists have often been horribly wrong in the past.  See Aristotle on slavery, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html\">Kant on bastards, masturbation, homosexuality, wives, and servants</a>, the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/02/german-and-english-philosophers-in-1914.html\">consensus of philosophers in favor of World War I</a>, and ethicists' <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">seeming inability</a> to reason better even about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a> than non-ethicists.<p>\n<b>(2.) Firsthand intuitive insight might be highly intrinsically valuable.</b>  I'm a big believer in the intrinsic value of knowledge (including <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrinsicSelfK.htm\">self-knowledge</a>).  One of the most amazing and important things about life on Earth is that sometimes we bags of mostly water can stop and reflect on some of the biggest, most puzzling questions that there are.  An important component of the intrinsic value of philosophical reflection is the real understanding that comes with firsthand intuitive insight, or seeming insight, or partial insight -- our ability to reach our <i>own</i> philosophical judgments instead of simply deferring to experts.  This might be valuable enough to merit some substantial loss of ethical correctness to preserve it.<p>\n<b>(3.) The philosophical community might profit from diversity of moral opinion, even if individuals with unusual views are likely to be incorrect.</b>  The philosophical community as a whole might, over time, be more likely to converge upon correct ethical views if it fosters diversity of opinion.  If we all defer to whoever seems to be most expert, we might reach consensus too fast on a wrong, or at least a narrow and partial, ethical view.  Compare <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-Thomas-Kuhn/dp/0226458083\">Kuhn</a> and <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/4575.html\">Longino</a> on the value of diversity in scientific opinion: Intellectual communities need stubborn defenders of unlikely views, even if those stubborn folks are probably wrong -- since sometimes they have an important piece of the truth that others are missing.<p>\n<b>(4.) Proper moral motivation might require acting from one's own insight rather than from moral deference.</b>  The bully who apologizes out of deference gives, I think, a less perfect apology than the bully who has firsthand intuitive insight into the need to apologize.  Maybe in some cases, being motivated by one's own intuitive insight is so morally important that it's better to do the ethically wrong thing on the basis of your imperfect but non-deferential insight than to do the ethically right thing deferentially.<p>\n\nAs I said, none of these defenses of non-deference seems quite enough on its own.  Even if the experts <i>might </i>be wrong (Point 1), from a bird's-eye perspective it seems like our best guess should be that they're not.  And the considerations in Points 2-4 seem plausibly to be only secondary from the perspective of the person who wants really to have ethically correct views by which to guide her behavior.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ethical-experts-bloomfield-township\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>", "title": "\nShould You Defer to Ethical Experts?\n", "url": "https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics", "content": "Ernest Sosa gave a lovely and fascinating talk yesterday at UC Riverside on the importance of \"firsthand intuitive insight\" in philosophy.

fascinating talk yesterday at UC Riverside on the importance of \"firsthand intuitive insight\" in philosophy.  It has me thinking about the extent to which we ought, or ought not, defer to ethical experts when we are otherwise inclined to disagree with their conclusions.<p>\n\nTo illustrate the idea of firsthand intuitive insight, Sosa gives two examples.  One concerns mathematics.  Consider a student who learns that the Pythagorean theorem is true without learning its proof.  This student knows that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 but doesn't have any insight into <i>why </i>it's true.  Contrast this student with one who masters the proof and consequently does understand why it's true.  The second student, but not the first, has firsthand intuitive insight.  Sosa's other example is in ethics.  One child bullies another.  Her mother, seeing the act and seeing the grief in the face of the other child, tells the bullying child that she should apologize.  The child might defer to her mother's ethical judgment, sincerely concluding she really should apologize, but without understanding why what she has done is bad enough to require apology.  Alternatively, she might come to genuinely notice the other child's grief and more fully understand how her bullying was inappropriate, and thus gain firsthand intuitive insight into the need for apology.  (I worry that firsthand intuitive insight is a bit of a slippery concept, but I don't think I can do more with it here.)<p>\n<b>Sosa argues that a central aim of much of philosophy is firsthand intuitive insight of this sort.</b>  In the sciences and in history, it's often enough just to know that some fact is true (that helium has two protons, that the Qin Dynasty fell in 206 BCE).  On such matters, we happily defer to experts.  In philosophy, we're less likely to accept a truth without having our own personal, firsthand intuitive insight.  Expert metaphysicians might almost universally agree that barstool-shaped-aggregates but not barstools themselves supervene on collections of particles arranged barstoolwise.  Expert ethicists might almost universally agree that a straightforward pleasure-maximizing utilitarian ethics would require radical revision of ordinary moral judgments.  But we're not inclined to just take them at their word.  We want to understand for ourselves how it is so.<p>\n\nThis seems right.  And yet, there's a bit of a puzzle in it, if we think that it's important that our ethical opinions be <i>correct</i>.  (Yes, I'm assuming that ethics is a domain in which there are correct and incorrect opinions.)  What should we do when the majority of philosophical experts think P, but your own (apparent) firsthand intuitive insight suggests not-P?  If you care about correctness above all, maybe you should defer to the experts, despite your lack of understanding.  But Sosa appears to think, as I suspect many of us do, that often the right course instead is to stand <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disagreement/#SteaView\">steadfast</a>, continuing to judge according to your own best independent reasoning.<p>\n\nBorrowing an example from <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40658407\">Sarah McGrath's work on moral deference</a>, consider the case of vegetarianism.  Based on <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHTMB-4\">some of my work</a>, I think that probably the majority of professional ethicists in the United States believe that it is normally morally wrong to eat the meat of factory-farmed animals.  This might also be true <a href=\"https://osf.io/35r48/\">in German-speaking countries</a>.  Impressionistically, most of the philosophers I know who have given the issue serious and detailed consideration come to endorse vegetarianism, including two of the most prominent ethicists currently alive, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061711305/animal-liberation/\">Peter Singer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198753853\">Christine Korsgaard</a>.  Now suppose that you haven't given the matter nearly as much thought as they have, but you have given it some thought.  You're inclined still to think that eating meat is okay, and you can maybe mount one or two plausible-seeming defenses of your view.  Should you defer to their ethical expertise?<p>\n\nSosa compares philosophical reasoning with archery.  You not only want to hit the target (the truth), you want to do so by the exercise of your own skill (your own intuitive insight), rather than by having an expert guide your hand (deference to experts).  I agree that ideally this is so.  It's nice when you have have both truth and intuitive insight!  But when the aim of hitting the target conflicts with the aim of doing so by your own intuitive insight, your preference should depend on the stakes.  If it's an archery contest, you don't want the coach's help: The most important thing is the test of your own skill.  But if you're a subsistence hunter who needs dinner, then you probably ought to take any help you can get, if the target looks like it's about to escape.  And isn't ethics (outside the classroom, at least) more like subsistence hunting than like an archery contest?  <b>What should matter most is whether you actually come to the right moral conclusion about eating meat (or whatever) not whether you get there by your own insight.</b>  Excessive emphasis on the individual's need for intuitive insight, at the cost of truth or correctness, risks turning ethics into a kind of sport.<p>\n\nSo maybe, then, you should defer to the majority of ethical experts, and conclude that it is normally wrong to eat factory-farmed meat, even if that conclusion doesn't accord with your own best attempts at insight?<p>\n\nWhile I'm tempted to say this, I simultaneously feel pulled in Sosa's direction -- and perhaps I should defer to his expertise as one of the world's leading epistemologists!  There's something I like about non-deference in philosophy, and our prizing of people's standing fast in their own best judgments, even in the teeth of disagreement by better-informed experts.  So here are four brief defenses of non-deference.  I fear none of them is quite sufficient.  But maybe in combination they will take us somewhere?<p>\n<b>(1.) The \"experts\" might not be experts.</b>  This is McGrath's defense of non-deference in ethics.  Despite their seeming expertise, great ethicists have often been horribly wrong in the past.  See Aristotle on slavery, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html\">Kant on bastards, masturbation, homosexuality, wives, and servants</a>, the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/02/german-and-english-philosophers-in-1914.html\">consensus of philosophers in favor of World War I</a>, and ethicists' <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">seeming inability</a> to reason better even about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a> than non-ethicists.<p>\n<b>(2.) Firsthand intuitive insight might be highly intrinsically valuable.</b>  I'm a big believer in the intrinsic value of knowledge (including <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrinsicSelfK.htm\">self-knowledge</a>).  One of the most amazing and important things about life on Earth is that sometimes we bags of mostly water can stop and reflect on some of the biggest, most puzzling questions that there are.  An important component of the intrinsic value of philosophical reflection is the real understanding that comes with firsthand intuitive insight, or seeming insight, or partial insight -- our ability to reach our <i>own</i> philosophical judgments instead of simply deferring to experts.  This might be valuable enough to merit some substantial loss of ethical correctness to preserve it.<p>\n<b>(3.) The philosophical community might profit from diversity of moral opinion, even if individuals with unusual views are likely to be incorrect.</b>  The philosophical community as a whole might, over time, be more likely to converge upon correct ethical views if it fosters diversity of opinion.  If we all defer to whoever seems to be most expert, we might reach consensus too fast on a wrong, or at least a narrow and partial, ethical view.  Compare <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-Thomas-Kuhn/dp/0226458083\">Kuhn</a> and <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/4575.html\">Longino</a> on the value of diversity in scientific opinion: Intellectual communities need stubborn defenders of unlikely views, even if those stubborn folks are probably wrong -- since sometimes they have an important piece of the truth that others are missing.<p>\n<b>(4.) Proper moral motivation might require acting from one's own insight rather than from moral deference.</b>  The bully who apologizes out of deference gives, I think, a less perfect apology than the bully who has firsthand intuitive insight into the need to apologize.  Maybe in some cases, being motivated by one's own intuitive insight is so morally important that it's better to do the ethically wrong thing on the basis of your imperfect but non-deferential insight than to do the ethically right thing deferentially.<p>\n\nAs I said, none of these defenses of non-deference seems quite enough on its own.  Even if the experts <i>might </i>be wrong (Point 1), from a bird's-eye perspective it seems like our best guess should be that they're not.  And the considerations in Points 2-4 seem plausibly to be only secondary from the perspective of the person who wants really to have ethically correct views by which to guide her behavior.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ethical-experts-bloomfield-township\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/03/should-you-defer-to-ethical-experts.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2019-03-15T09:58:00-07:00\">9:58 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7827613721931262080\" onclick=\"\">17\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, February 15, 2019</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"9205395215810015131\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/02/studying-ethics-should-influence-your.html\">Studying Ethics Should Influence Your Behavior (But It Doesn't Seem to)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Some academic disciplines have direct relevance to day-to-day life.  Studying these disciplines, you might think, would have an influence on one's practical behavior.  Studying nutritional health, it seems plausible to suppose, would have an influence of some sort on  your food choices.  Studying the stock market would likely have an influence on your investment strategies.  Studying parenting styles in developmental psychology would have an influence on your parenting decisions.  The effects might not be huge: A scholar of nutrition might not be able to entirely sacrifice Twinkies.  A scholar of parenting styles might sometimes lose her temper in ways she knows from her research to be counterproductive.  But it would be strange if studying such topics had <i>no effect whatsoever</i> -- if there were a perfect isolation between one's research on nutrition, investment, or parenting and one's personal food choices, investments, and approaches to parenting.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYjk48qxfr0/XGbygfbEuqI/AAAAAAAABdU/gekmizqHK0crGsPu_Dvhmi2gFbOXfwqMwCLcBGAs/s1600/DoctorSmokeCrop.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"407\" data-original-width=\"626\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYjk48qxfr0/XGbygfbEuqI/AAAAAAAABdU/gekmizqHK0crGsPu_Dvhmi2gFbOXfwqMwCLcBGAs/s320/DoctorSmokeCrop.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[A doctor doing what doctors <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/12/11/1167/1748983\">in fact don't do very much of</a>.]<p>\n\nOther academic topics have tenuous connections at best to practical matters of day-to-day life: studying the first second of the Big Bang, or mereological approaches to objecthood, or tortoise-shell divination in ancient China. Of course, studying such things <i>could </i>have behavioral effects.  Maybe immersion in Big Bang cosmology inspires one to a broader, less parochial worldview.  But I don't think we should particularly expect that or think something is strange if it doesn't.  It's not strange for a cosmologist to be parochial in the same way it would be for an anti-trans-fat health researcher to not attempt to reduce her own trans-fat intake.<p>\n\nEthics seems clearly to be in the category of academic disciplines that are directly relevant to scholars' day-to-day lives.  Not every sub-issue of every sub-specialization of ethics is so, of course.  Some ethical questions are highly abstract or concern matters irrelevant to the immediate choices of the scholars' lives; but few ethicists spend all of their energy on issues of that sort.  Issues like our obligations to the poor, the ethics of honesty and kindness, animal rights and environmentalism, prejudice, structural injustices in our society, the proper weighing of selfish concerns against the demands of others, the question of how much to abide by laws or directives with which you disagree -- all seem directly relevant to our lives.  It would be odd if devoting a substantial part of one's career to thinking about such issues had no influence of any sort on one's day-to-day behavior.<p>\n\nAnd yet it's not clear to me that studying ethics does have any influence on day-to-day behavior.  <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">Across a wide range of studies</a>, my collaborators and I have found no convincing evidence of systematic behavioral differences between ethicists and non-ethicists of similar social background.  Also, impressionistically, in my personal interactions with professional ethicists, my sense is that they behave overall similarly to non-ethicists.  Furthermore, there's <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsClasses.htm\">little evidence that university-level ethics classes influence students' behavior</a> either.<p>\n\nMaybe studying ethics does sometimes have a practical effect.  It would, in my mind, be stunning if studying ethics never had any influence of any sort on one's behavioral choices!  But the effects, if any, are subtle and difficult to detect empirically.<p>\n\nWhy this should be so is an underappreciated puzzle.<p>\n\nThe easiest answers -- \"academic ethics is all abstract and impractical\", \"ethics is all post-hoc rationalization of what you were going to do anyway\", \"our immoral desires are so compelling that no amount of rational thought could lead us to act otherwise\" -- don't withstand critical scrutiny as fully adequate answers (although each may have some element of truth).<p>\n\nFor several of my imperfect attempts to resolve this puzzle, see:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PowerReason.htm\">The Moral Behavior of Ethicists and the Power of Reason</a>\" (with Joshua Rust), <i>Advances in Experimental Moral Psychology</i> (ed.

One simple explanation (favored, for example, by Jon Haidt in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777\">his discussion</a> of Eric's work) is that philosophical moral reflection has little to no influence on people's moral behavior.  However, Eric and his frequent collaborator Joshua Rust have been hesitant to draw that conclusion without more empirical evidence (see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PowerReason.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">here</a> for possible alternative explanations).<p>\n\nMeanwhile, Eric's PhD student Chris was growing interested in the power of narratives to change behavior.  So we decided to collaborate on a project to compare the influence of narrative and argument on charitable giving.<p>\n<i>Design<p></p></i>\n\nFor our argument, we chose an argument constructed by philosopher Peter Singer with the aim of convincing ordinary readers to donate to charity.  The argument was originally written for a paper in draft by Luke Buckland, Matthew Lindauer, David Rodriguez-Arias, and Carissa Veliz.  (Thanks to them and to Peter Singer for sharing this argument with us.)  We supplemented Singer's argument with some additional clarificatory text.  It's a typical Singer-style argument, emphasizing that people have a duty to prevent death and suffering due to extreme poverty by donating money that they would otherwise spend on luxuries, and that our physical distance from those who are suffering does not excuse us from the obligation to help.<p>\n\nFor our narrative, we chose a true story, about the same word-length as the argument, about a family rescued from slavery by a charitable donation, which we adapted from the website of a charitable organization.<p>\n\nParticipants were 918 MTurk workers in the United States.  We divided them into four conditions: (1.) narrative only, (2.) argument only, (3.) narrative + argument, and (4.) control (who received a similar-length text from a middle-school physics textbook).  Participants were then asked to rate, on a 7-point scale, how much they agreed or disagreed with statements about the ethics of donation and their own motivation to donate (e.g., \"It is morally good to give money to charities that help those in extreme poverty\", \"Currently I feel motivated to give money to a charity that helps people in extreme poverty\").  In Experiment 1, we then asked them a hypothetical question about how much they would give to a charity if we offered them a bonus of $10.  In Experiment 2, we replaced the hypothetical-donation language with a lottery choice.  We'll report only on Experiment 2 here, but the results of Experiment 1 were very similar.<p>\n\nHere is the exact language for the lottery choice:\n<blockquote>Upon completion of this study, 10% of participants in this study will receive an additional $10. You have the option to donate some portion of this $10 to one of six well-known charities that have been shown to effectively fight suffering due to extreme poverty. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, the portion you decide to keep will appear as a bonus credited to your Mechanical Turk worker account, and the portion you decide to donate will be given to the charity you pick from the list below. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, how much of your additional $10 would you like to donate?</blockquote><p>\n\nParticipants then ticked a number on a scale from $0 to $10 in dollar intervals, indicating how much they would donate if they won the $10. \n (A big thanks to <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, especially Jon Behar, for funding this study!)<p>\n\nFinally, we asked questions designed to measure \"narrative transportation\" (i.e., how immersive and moving they found the narrative, or argument, or physics text), adapted from <a href=\"http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/the_role_of_transportation_in_the_persuasiveness_of_public_narratives.pdf\">Green and Brock 2000</a>.<p>\n\nWe thought we'd share some preliminary results.  We emphasize that these results are only preliminary.  Later, we'll want to double-check our numbers, confirm that we got the exclusions exactly right, etc.  (We have a preregistration at <a href=\"https://osf.io/\">Open Science Foundation</a>, but we haven't made it public yet.)<p>\n<i>Results<p></p></i>\n\nMean amount donated, by condition:<p>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NK7SVwP8u9c/W_LzoL_PQ1I/AAAAAAAABOU/VvH0S_R31Ak4n7gsETTXDNNgOl6alO7OACLcBGAs/s1600/MeanDonation-181119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"288\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NK7SVwP8u9c/W_LzoL_PQ1I/AAAAAAAABOU/VvH0S_R31Ak4n7gsETTXDNNgOl6alO7OACLcBGAs/s320/MeanDonation-181119.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n\n(Apologies for blurry image.  Click to enhance.  Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.)<p>\n\nStatistically, the conditions are different (ANOVA [913,3], F=4.99, p = .002).  In planned, pre-registered one-tailed t-tests, we found that the narrative and narrative+argument conditions generated more donation than the control condition (p = .02, .001) but the argument condition did not (p = .48).  Similarly in a multiple regression analysis we found that being in one of the narrative conditions (narrative only or narrative+argument) predicted donation amount but being in one of the argumentative conditions was not statistically significantly predictive.  <b>In other words, exposure to a Singer-style philosophical argument had no statistically detectable effect on charitable giving, but exposure to a narrative about a family rescued from slavery did have a detectable effect.</b>  This was also true in Experiment 1, concerning hypothetical donation.<p>\n\nThe results were even clearer for the measure of ethical opinion and motivation to donate, which was scored on a scale from 5 to 35, based on 5 questions:\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8TXqt8z9z5s/W_L55fVT4LI/AAAAAAAABOw/vXI947okp5UC89WSqOcww4kkyusTeYrKQCLcBGAs/s1600/CharityMotivation-181119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"392\" data-original-width=\"485\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8TXqt8z9z5s/W_L55fVT4LI/AAAAAAAABOw/vXI947okp5UC89WSqOcww4kkyusTeYrKQCLcBGAs/s320/CharityMotivation-181119.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n\nIt's not a huge effect size -- about 2 points on the scale -- but it's easier to see how the results for argument and control are similar to each other and different from the results for narrative and narrative+argument, which are also similar to each other (ANOVA [913,3], F=10.8, p &lt; .001; one-tailed t vs. control condition: argument p = .71, narrative p &lt; .001, nar+arg p &lt; .001). \n Similarly to the lottery donation results, a regression analysis of reported motivation and moral opinion finds being in a narrative condition predictive and being in an argument condition non-predictive.<p>\n\nAs expected, we also found that participants reported more narrative transportation in the narrative and narrative+argument conditions than in the other conditions (ANOVA, p &lt; .001) and that narrative transport, amount given, and motivation to give were mutually correlated (transport-amount given, r = .24; transport-motivation, r = .40, motivation-amount given, r = .50; all p's &lt; .001).<p>\n<i>Conclusion<p></p></i>\n<b>We regard this as preliminary evidence that exposure to at least one type of narrative influences charitable giving, motivation, and opinion, while exposure to one common type of philosophical argument has little if any influence.</b><p>\n\nIn our teaching, we also seem to find that Singer-style arguments have little effect on moral opinion or motivation to donate.  In another series of studies (collaborative with Peter Singer and Brad Cokelet), which we hope to be able to report on soon, professors and TAs at UC Riverside taught lower-division philosophy students philosophical arguments for charitable donation and for vegetarianism.  In subsequent questionnaires, students' self-reported attitudes toward charity don't appear to have been much influenced by the arguments, but their self-reported attitudes toward vegetarianism do appear to have been influenced.<p>\n\nThis is not to deny that <i>some</i> people are influenced to donate by Singer's arguments.  Eric believes that he has been, for example.  But the effect might be weak or uncommon or not effectively produced by brief exposures.<p>\n\nIn follow-up research, we plan to see if we find similar results with different types of arguments and narratives, and we hope to zero in on what underlying factors are at work behind these effects.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/narrative-but-not-philosophical.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-11-21T08:13:00-08:00\">8:13 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2869116372983638922\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, August 16, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2462920664380020251\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/08/to-reduce-risk-of-moral-catastrophes.html\">To Reduce the Risk of Moral Catastrophes, Should Society Hire Lots of Philosophers?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>In June, I wrote a post arguing that future generations might find our generation <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/will-future-generations-find-us.html\">especially morally loathsome</a>, even if we don't ourselves feel like we are morally that bad.  (By \"we\" I mean typical highly educated, middle-class people in Western democracies.) <b> We might be committing morally grievous wrongs</b> -- atrocities on par with the wrong that we now see in race-based slavery or the Holocaust or bloody wars of conquest -- <b>without (most of us) recognizing how morally terrible we're being.</b><p>\n\nIn <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10214679985105858\">Facebook discussion</a>, Kian MW pointed me to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10677-015-9567-7\">a fascinating article</a> by Evan G. Williams, which makes a similar point and adds the further thought, bound to be attractive to many philosophers, that <b>the proper response to such a concern is to hire lots of philosophers</b>.<p>\n\nOkay, hiring lots of philosophers isn't the <i>only </i>remedy Williams suggests, and he doesn't phrase his recommendation in quite that way.  What he says with that we need to dedicate substantial societal resources to (1) identifying our moral wrongdoing and to (2) creating social structures to implement major changes in light of those moral discoveries.  Identifying our moral wrongdoing will require progress, Williams says, both in moral theory and in related applied fields.  (For example, progress in animal ethics requires progress both in moral theory and in relevant parts of biology.)  Williams' call for dedicating substantial resources toward making progress in moral theory <i>seems </i>like a call for society to hire many more philosophers, though I suppose there are a variety of ways that he could disavow that implication if he cared to do so.<p>\n\nThe annual U.S. military budget is about $700 billion.  Suppose that President Trump and his allies in Congress, inspired by Williams' article, decided to divert 2% of U.S military spending toward identifying our society's moral wrongdoing, with half of that 2% going to ethicists and the other half to other relevant disciplines.  Assuming that the annual cost of employing a philosopher is $150,000 (about half salary, about half benefits and indirect costs), the resulting <b>$7 billion could hire about 50,000 ethicists.</b><p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nat5KmrBiQM/W3R4WJCqE2I/AAAAAAAABAI/ZKxHsUxK9fMNn-du_e2GfinlxGV6EL3GACLcBGAs/s1600/EmptyChairsPhilosophy.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"357\" data-original-width=\"635\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nat5KmrBiQM/W3R4WJCqE2I/AAAAAAAABAI/ZKxHsUxK9fMNn-du_e2GfinlxGV6EL3GACLcBGAs/s320/EmptyChairsPhilosophy.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[With 50,000 more ethicists, <a href=\"http://observer.com/2017/07/why-the-us-doesnt-understand-chinese-thought-and-must-xenophobia-confucius-xo-jinping-higher-education/\">these empty chairs</a> could be filled!]<p>\n\nTwo percent of the military budget seems like a small expenditure to substantially reduce the risk that we unwittingly perpetrate the moral equivalent of institutionalized slavery or the Holocaust, don't you think?   A B2 bomber costs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit\">about $1-$2 billion</a>.  The U.S. government might want to consider a few bomber-for-philosopher swaps.<p>\n\nI write this partly in jest of course, but also partly seriously.  If society invested more in moral philosophy -- and it needn't be a whole lot more, compared to the size of military budgets -- and if society took the results of that investment seriously, giving its philosophers prestige, attention, and policy influence, we might be morally far better off as a people.<p>\n\nWe <i>might</i>.  But I also think about <b>the ancient Athenians, the ancient Chinese, and the early 20th-century Germans.</b>  Despite the flourishing of philosophy in these times and places, the cultures did not appear to avoid moral catastrophe: The ancient Athenians were slave-owners who engaged in military conquest and genocide (perhaps even more than their neighbors, if we're grading on a curve), the flourishing of philosophy in ancient China coincided with the moral catastrophe of the period of the Warring States, and the Germans perpetrated the Holocaust and helped initiate World War II (with some of the greatest philosophers, including Heidegger and Frege, on the nationalistic, anti-Semitic, political right).<p>\n\nNow maybe these societies would have produced even worse moral catastrophes if philosophers had not also been flourishing in them, but I see no particular reason to think so.  <b>If there's a correlation between the flourishing of philosophy and the perpetration of social evil, the relationship appears to be, if anything, <i>positive</i>.</b>  This observation fits with my general concerns about the <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-often-do-ethics-professors-call-their-mothers\">not-very-moral behavior of professional ethicists</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">philosophers' apparent skill at post-hoc rationalization</a>.<p>\n\nI'm not sure how skeptical to be.  I hesitate to suggest that a massive infusion of social capital into philosophical ethics <i>couldn't</i> have a large positive impact on the moral choices we as a society make.  It might be truly awesome and transformative, if done in the right way.  But what would be the right way?<p>\n\n[photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.bryanvannorden.com/\">Bryan Van Norden</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/08/to-reduce-risk-of-moral-catastrophes.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-08-16T07:24:00-07:00\">7:24 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2462920664380020251\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, July 06, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8145253730318932116\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/how-to-create-immensely-valuable-new.html\">How to Create Immensely Valuable New Worlds by Donning Your Sunglasses</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_Ou2O4qud4Y/Wz-Wvf84M8I/AAAAAAAAA7I/G0wfT4D0iOonB5bcFDaiCY7gcNLvWug_gCLcBGAs/s1600/Vagnini_022617_1130_Sunglasses_How_To_Choose_lg.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_Ou2O4qud4Y/Wz-Wvf84M8I/AAAAAAAAA7I/G0wfT4D0iOonB5bcFDaiCY7gcNLvWug_gCLcBGAs/s320/Vagnini_022617_1130_Sunglasses_How_To_Choose_lg.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n[A satisfied REI customer, creating whole gobs of new worlds.]<p>\n\nOne world is good, so two is better, right?<p>\n\n(If you think one world is bad and two are worse, just invert the reflections below.)<p>\n\nHere's one way to look at it: Run a universe, or a world, from beginning to end, sum up all the good stuff, subtract all the bad stuff, and note the (hopefully positive) total.  Now consider, from your end-of-the-universe God's-eye point of view: Should you launch another world similar to the previous one?  Well, of course you should!  There would be even more good stuff, and a higher positive total, after that second world has been run.  Similar considerations suggest that two good worlds running in parallel would also be better than a single good world.<p>\n\n(To avoid problems with summing infinitudes, let's assume finite worlds with finite value.  For some complexities regarding the value or disvalue of repetition specifically see <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/04/duplicating-universe.html\">this earlier post</a>.)<p>\n\nNow on some interpretations of quantum mechanics, every time there's a quantum event with different possible outcomes, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/\">all of the outcomes occur, each in a different world</a>.  Such \"many world\" interpretations often describe the world as \"splitting\" into two worlds -- one world in which Outcome A occurs and one in which Outcome B occurs.  You too, the observer, will split: One copy of you goes into World A, observing Outcome A, and the other goes into World B, observing Outcome B.<p>\n\nIn a classic article on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, Bryce S. DeWitt writes:<p><blockquote>\nThis universe is constantly splitting into a stupendous number of branches, all resulting from the measurementlike interactions between its myriads of components. Moreover, every quantum transition taking place on every star, in every galaxy, in every remote\ncorner of the universe is splitting our local world on earth into myriads of copies of itself.... I still recall vividly the shock I experienced on first encountering this multiworld concept. The idea of 10^100+ slightly imperfect copies of oneself all constantly splitting into further copies, which ultimately become unrecognizable.... (<a href=\"http://cqi.inf.usi.ch/qic/deWitt1970.pdf\">DeWitt 1970</a>, p. 33).</blockquote><p>\n\nNotice that on DeWitt's portrayal, there are a finite but large number of worlds: 10^100+.  <b>Now here's the normative question I want to consider: Is there positive value -- would it be ethically or prudentially or aesthetically <i>good</i> -- to increase the amount of splitting, so that there are more worlds rather than fewer?</b><p>\n\nOn the face of it, it seems that, yes, it would be good if there were more worlds.  If each world independently considered is good, then plausibly more worlds is better.  Suppose World W has positive value V.  Suppose now that it splits into two worlds that are very similar but not identical: W1 with value V1 and W2 with value V2.  If we assume V1 ~= V2 ~= V and that the value of worlds is additive, then after the split the whole W1+W2 is approximately twice the value of W.  We have doubled the amount of value that the cosmos as a whole contains!<p>\n\nNow you might object in one of three ways:<p>\n\n(1.) You might <i>reject the whole splitting-worlds interpretation</i>.  Fair enough!  But then you're not really playing the game.  I'm interested in thinking about the normative consequences assuming that the world does split as DeWitt describes.<p>\n\n(2.) You might <i>reject the assumption that V1 ~= V</i>.  For example, you might think that after splitting, each world has only approximately <i>half</i> the value that the world before the split had, so that V1 + V2 ~= V.  Then no value would be gained by splitting.  A tempting thought, perhaps.  But why would splitting make a world half as valuable?  It's not clear.  One consequence of this view is that our world, constantly splitting, would be constantly halving in value, so that its value is plummeting by orders of magnitude every second.  Hmmm, that seems no less bizarre than the idea that splitting doubles the value of cosmos.  Now if you thought that the other worlds <i>already existed </i>before the split, then you might reject V1 ~= V, since the subset of worlds in V1 would be about half (or whatever) of the total number of worlds in V.  But the whole idea of splitting worlds is not that the worlds already existed.  It's that they are <i>created</i>.  So we're talking about whether creating a new valuable world adds value to the cosmos as a whole.  Pending a good argument otherwise, it seems like it should.<p>\n\n(3.) You might <i>reject additivity</i>.  You might say that although V1 ~= V2 ~= V, you can't simply sum V1 and V2 to get ~= 2V.  I can feel the pull of this idea.  If the worlds were strictly identical, you might say \"well, there's no point in duplicating everything again\"!  But (a.) The worlds are not strictly identical, and in fact (given <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory\">chaos theory</a>) they might diverge increasingly over time.  And (b.) Duplication plausibly adds value when worlds are temporally separated (at the end of the universe, it seems like not re-running the thing again would involve omitting possible future pleasures that future inhabitants of the world would have), and side-by-side splitting wouldn't seem to be very normatively different in principle.<p>\n\nOkay, let's pretend you're convinced.  When new worlds arise through quantum mechanical splitting, that's terrific.  Whole realms of value are added!  The value of the cosmos as a whole approximately doubles.  Now, <b>accepting this, is there anything you should do differently?</b><p>\n\nConsider the following possible principle:<p>\n<i>Conservation of Splitting.</i>  Over any time interval t, the world will split N times, no matter what you do.<p>\n\nAs far as I can see, there's no reason to accept Conservation of Splitting.  It seems like you can create situations in which there would be relatively more splitting or relatively less splitting.  You can run more quantum mechanical experiments or fewer.  You can make more quantum mechanical measurements or fewer.  And if you run more experiments and make more measurements, there will be more splitting, and thus more worlds.<p>\n\nFor example, that pair of polarized sunglasses you have, sitting in that dark sunglass case in that dark drawer?  When a photon passes or fails to pass through a polarized lens, that's a quantum mechanical event -- a chance event, which, on this interpretation, results in a splitting of worlds.  In some worlds the photon goes through; in others it does not.  You could take those sunglasses out of the drawer.  You could go to the beach and wear them in the sun.  Many more photons will pass through those lenses!  Maybe about 10^18 more photons per second.  If each of those photons has an independent quantum chance of passing or not passing through those lenses, splitting the world, then you're creating 2^10^18 new worlds per second just by sitting on the beach -- worlds that would not have been created had the sunglasses remained cased in the drawer.  Think of all the value you're adding to the cosmos!<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\">Effective altruism</a> is a movement that recommends using reason and evidence to do the most good you can do.  Normally, effective altruists recommend doing things like donating money to charities that effectively help to alleviate suffering due to poverty.  But the value of saving one life has to be tiny compared to the value of creating 2^10^18 new universes per second!  So instead of staying indoors in the shade, writing a check to the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, maybe you'd do better to spend the day at the beach.<p>\n\nEven if you have only a 0.001% credence that the splitting worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is true, the expected utility of sitting on the beach might far exceed that of donating to poverty relief.<p>\n\nI know that it doesn't seem intuitively very plausible that going to the beach is far morally better than donating money to effective, life-saving charities, but <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/\">consequentialist</a> philosophers are often willing to admit what's ethically best might not match our intuitions about what's ethically best.<p>\n\nPS: I feel so bad about making this argument that I just donated to Oxfam.<p>\n\n--------------------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated Posts:<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/04/duplicating-universe.html\">Duplicating the Universe</a> (Apr 29, 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/05/goldfish-pool-immortality.html\">Goldfish Pool Immortality</a> (May 30, 2014)<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-robots-and-monsters-might-break.html\">How Robots and Monsters Might Break Human Moral Systems</a> (Feb. 3, 2015)<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/sunglasses.html\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/how-to-create-immensely-valuable-new.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-07-06T09:42:00-07:00\">9:42 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=8145253730318932116\" onclick=\"\">11\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/cosmology\" rel=\"tag\">cosmology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/crazyism\" rel=\"tag\">crazyism</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, June 29, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7274983487992563100\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/will-future-generations-find-us.html\">Will Future Generations Find Us Especially Morally Loathsome?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Ethical norms change.  Although reading Confucius doesn't feel like encountering some wholly bizarre, alien moral system, some ethical ideas do differ dramatically over time and between cultures.  Genocide and civilian-slaughtering aggressive warfare are now widely considered to be among the evilest things people can do, yet they appear to be celebrated in the Bible (especially Deuteronomy and Joshua) and we still name children after Alexander \"the Great\".  Many seemingly careful thinkers, including notoriously Aristotle and Locke, wrote justifications of slavery.  Much of the world has only recently opened its eyes to the historically common oppression of women, homosexuals, low-status workers, people with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.<p>\n\nWe probably haven't reached the end of moral change.  In a few centuries, people might look back on our current norms with the same mix of appreciation and condemnation that we now look back on ethical norms common in Warring States China and Early Modern Europe.<p>\n\nIndeed, future generations might find our generation to be <i>especially vividly</i> loathsome, since we are the first generation creating an extensive video record of our day-to-day activities.<p>\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to know, in the abstract, that Rousseau fathered five children with a lover he regarded as too dull-witted to be worth attempting to formally educate, and that he demanded against her protests that their children be sent to (possibly very <a href=\"http://www.pobronson.com/factbook/pages/204.html\">high mortality</a>) orphanages [see esp. <i>Confessions,</i> Book VII].   It would be quite another if we had baby pictures and video of Rousseau's interactions with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se.  It's one thing to know, in the abstract, that Aristotle had a wife and a life of privilege.  It would be quite another to watch video of him proudly enacting sexist and classist values we now find vile.  Future generations that detest our sexual practices, or our consumerism, or our casual destruction of the environment, or our neglect of the sick and elderly, might be especially horrified to view these practices in vivid detail.<p>\n\nBy \"we\" and \"our\" practices and values, I mean the typical practices and values of highly educated readers from early 21st-century democracies -- the notional readership of this blog.  Maybe climate change proves to be catastrophic: Crops fail, low-lying cities are flooded, a billion desperate people are displaced or malnourished and tossed into war.  Looking back on video of a philosopher of our era proudly stepping out of his shiny, privately-owned minivan, across his beautiful irrigated lawn in the summer heat, into his large chilly air-conditioned house, maybe wearing a leather hat, maybe sharing McDonald's ice-cream cones with his kids -- looking back, that is, on what I (of course this is me) think of as a lovely family moment -- might this seem to some future Bangladeshi philosopher as vividly disgusting as I suspect I would find Aristotle's treatment of Greek slaves?<p>\n\n#<p>\n\nIf we are currently at the moral pinnacle, any change in future values will be a change for the worse.  Future generations might condemn our mixing of the races, for example.  They might be disgusted to see pictures of interracial couples walking together in public and raising their mixed-race children.  Or they might condemn us for clothing customs that they come to view as obscene.  However, I feel comfortable saying that they'd be wrong to condemn us, if those were the reasons why.<p>\n\nBut it seems unlikely that we are at the pinnacle; and thus it seems likely that future generations might have some excellent moral reason to condemn us.  More likely than our being at the moral pinnacle, it seems to me, is that either (a.) there has been a slow trajectory toward better values over the centuries (as <a href=\"https://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature\">argued by Steven Pinker</a>) and that the trajectory will continue, or alternatively that (b.) shifts in value are more or less a random walk up, down, and sideways, in which case it would be unlikely chance if we happened to be at the peak right now.  I am assuming here the same kind of non-relativism that most people assume in condemning Nazism and in thinking that it constitutes genuine moral progress to recognize the equal moral status of women and men.<p>\n\n(To someone who endorses most of the widely-shared values of their group it is almost just analytically the case that they will see their group's values as the peak.  Suppose you endorse the mainstream values in your group -- values A, B, C, D, E, and F.  Elsewhere, the mainstream values might instead be A, not-B, D, E, F and G, or A, C, not-D, not-E, H and I.  Of course it will seem to you that you're the group that got it right -- exactly A, B, C, D, E, and F!  It will seem to you that changes from past values have been good, and the likely future rejection of your values will be mistaken.  This is basically the old man's \"kids these days!\" complaint, writ large.)<p>\n\nI worry then, that we might be in a situation similar to Aristotle's: horribly wrong (most of us) on some really important moral issues, though it doesn't <i>feel </i>like we're wrong, and although we think we are applying our excellent minds excellently to the matter, with wisdom and good sense.  I worry that we, or I, might be using philosophy to justify the 21st-century college-educated North American's moral equivalent of keeping slaves, oppressing women, and launching genocidal war.<p>\n\nIs there some way of gaining insight into this possibility?  Some way to get a temperature reading, so to speak, on our unrecognized evil?<p>\n\nHere's one thing I don't think will work: Rely on the ethical reasoning of the highest status philosophers in our society.  If you've read any of my work on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html\">Kant's applied ethics</a>, German <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/12/nazi-philosophers.html\">philosophers' failure to reject Nazism</a>, and <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-often-do-ethics-professors-call-their-mothers\">the morality of ethics professors</a>, you'll know why I say this.<p>\n\n#<p>\n\nI'd suggest, or at least I'd hope, that if future generations rightly condemn us, it won't be for something we'd find incomprehensible.  It won't be because we sometimes chose blue shirts over red ones or because we like to smile at children.  It will be for things that we already have an inkling might be wrong, and which some people do already condemn as wrong.  As Michele Moody-Adams emphasizes in her discussion of slavery and cultural relativism (<a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674007949\">Moody-Adams 1997</a>, ch. 2), in every slave culture there were always <i>some </i>voices condemning the injustice of slavery -- among them, typically, the slaves themselves -- and it required a kind of affected ignorance to disregard those voices.  As a clue to our own evil, we might look to minority moral opinions in our own culture.<p>\n\nI tend to disagree with those minority opinions.  I tend to think that the behavior of my social group is more or less fine, or at least <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">forgivably mediocre</a>.  If someone advances a minority ethical view I disagree with, I'm philosopher enough to concoct some superficially plausible defenses.  What I worry is that a properly situated observer might recognize those defenses to be no better than <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-1935-preface-to-kant-studien.html\">Hans Heyse's defense of Nazism</a> or <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html\">Kant's critique of masturbation</a>.<p>\n\nMoody-Adams suggests that we can begin to transcend our cultural and historical moral boundaries though moral reflection and moral imagination.  In the epilogue of her 1997 book, she finds hope in the kind of moral reflection that involves self-scrutiny, vivid imagination, a wide-ranging contact with other disciplines and traditions, a recognition of minority voices, and serious engagement with the concrete details of everyday moral inquiry.<p>\n\nHey, that sounds pretty good!  I'll put, or try to put, my hopes there too.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/will-future-generations-find-us.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-06-29T07:06:00-07:00\">7:06 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7274983487992563100\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, April 26, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4508376693689617069\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/04/three-ways-your-ethics-class-might.html\">Three Ways Your Ethics Class Might Backfire</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>... if your aim is to encourage students to actually act better.  (Of course, this might not be among your aims.)<p>\n\n(This post was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/janet.stemwedel/posts/10155146470001710\">Janet Stemwedel's Facebook/Twitter post</a> about students cheating in her ethics class, and subsequent discussion.)<p>\n<b>1. Creating the appearance that every pro has an equally good con.</b> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Postures_of_the_Mind.html?id=WjxRAAAAYAAJ\">Annette Baier</a> is among those who have emphasized this risk.  A typical philosophical teaching style is to present both sides of every major topic discussed, in a more-or-less even-handed way.  We tell students that they are welcome to defend either the pro or the con, and we encourage contrarian students who challenge the reasoning and conclusions of the assigned authors.  This even-handed debate-like format might lead some students to think that, in ethical reasoning, there are no right or wrong answers to be found, just interminable back and forth.  Probably this attitude will have little effect on students' practical choices outside of the classroom; but if it does have an effect, it might be to weaken their sense that ethical principles that they might otherwise have acted on are as sound and indisputable as they would previously have thought.<p>\n<b>2. Improving one's skill at moral rationalization.</b>  Suppose you want to do X -- <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsBooks.htm\">steal a library book</a>, for example.  Of course, you wouldn't do that.  It's wrong!  But wait.  Remember that ethics class you took?  Maybe you can construct a utilitarian defense of stealing the book.  No one would miss it that much, and you'd benefit greatly from keeping it.  The institution has much more money than you do, and can easily replace it.  Stealing the book would maximize human happiness!  (Especially yours.)  Such reasoning is <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">rationalization, in the pejorative sense of that term</a>, if your reasoning is basically just a biased search for reasons in support of the self-serving conclusion you'd like to reach.  If you're tempted to do something morally wrong, skill at philosophical reasoning, and knowledge of a diverse range of possibly relevant moral principles, might enable you to better construct superficially attractive arguments that free you to feel okay doing the bad thing that you might otherwise have unreflectively avoided.<p>\n<b>3. Giving the sense that unethical behavior is pervasive.</b>  I've argued that people mostly aim for <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">moral mediocrity</a>.  They aim, that is, not to be morally good by absolute standards but rather to be about as morally good as their peers, not especially better, not especially worse.  If so, then changes in your perception of what is typical behavior among your peers can cause you to calibrate your own behavior up or down.  If most people litter, or cheat, or selfishly screw over their co-workers, then it doesn't seem so bad if you do too, at least a little.  (Conversely, if you learn that almost everyone around you is honorable and true, that can inspire you not to want to be the one schmuck.)  Some ethics classes, perhaps especially business ethics classes, focus on case studies of grossly unethical behavior.  This company did this bad thing, this other company did this other bad thing, still another company did this other horrible thing....  Without a complementary range of inspirational examples of morally laudable behavior by other companies, students might get the sense that the world is even fuller of malfeasance than they had previously thought, leading them to calibrate their sense of mediocrity down.  If so many other people do so many bad things, then it hardly matters (perhaps even it's only fair) if I fudge a bit on my expense report.<p>\n\nDo ethics classes actually have any of these backfire effects?  I think we really have no idea.  The issue remains almost entirely unstudied in any rigorous, empirical way.<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2013/09/15\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"568\" data-original-width=\"839\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ly8zy3LKXlM/WuHxUhBPpdI/AAAAAAAAAzI/dzOLwsTNbFcLy_v6G_f97QcBsIjd69irwCLcBGAs/s400/CalvinHobbesCheating.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2013/09/15\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/04/three-ways-your-ethics-class-might.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-04-26T08:48:00-07:00\">8:48 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4508376693689617069\" onclick=\"\">1 comments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, December 01, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4323464961763813519\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/aiming-for-moral-mediocrity.html\">Aiming for Moral Mediocrity</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I've been working on this essay off and on for years, \"Aiming for Moral Mediocrity\".  I think I've finally pounded it into circulating shape and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">I'm ready for feedback</a>.<p>\n\nI have an empirical thesis and a normative thesis.  The empirical thesis is that <b>most people aim to be <i>morally mediocre</i></b>.  They aim to be about as morally good as their peers, not especially better, not especially worse.  This mediocrity has two aspects.  It is peer-relative rather than absolute, and it is middling rather than extreme.  We do not aim to be good, or non-bad, or to act permissibly rather than impermissibly, by fixed moral standards.  Rather, we notice the typical behavior of people we regard as our peers and we aim to behave broadly within that range.  We -- most of us -- look around, notice how others are acting, then calibrate toward so-so.<p>\n\nThis empirical thesis is, I think, plausible on the face of it.  It also receives some support from two recent subliteratures in social psychology and behavioral economics.<p>\n\nOne is the literature on <i>following the (im-)moral crowd</i>.  I'm thinking especially of the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini\">Robert B. Cialdini</a> and <a href=\"https://philosophy.sas.upenn.edu/people/cristina-bicchieri\">Cristina Bicchieri</a>.  Cialdini argues that \"injunctive norms\" (that is, social or moral admonitions) most effectively promote norm-compliant behavior when they align with \"descriptive norms\" (that is, facts about how people actually behave).  People are <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prestos/Downloads/DC/pdfs/Krupka_Oct13_Cialdinietal1990.pdf\">less likely to litter</a> when they see others being neat, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/586910\">more likely to reuse their hotel towels</a> when they learn that others also do so, and <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x\">more likely to reduce their household energy consumption</a> when they see that they are using more than their neighbors.  Bicchieri argues that people are <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.621/abstract\">more likely to be selfish in \"dictator games\"</a> when they are led to believe that earlier participants had mostly been selfish and that <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/norms-in-the-wild-9780190622053?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">convincing communities to adopt new health practices</a> like family planning and indoor toilet use typically requires persuading people that their neighbors will also comply.  It appears that <b>people are more likely to abide by social or moral norms if they believe that others are also doing so.</b><p>\n\nThe other relevant literature concerns <i>moral self-licensing</i>.  A number of studies suggest that after having performed good acts, people are likely to behave less morally well than after performing a bad or neutral act.  For example, <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610363538\">after having done something good for the environment</a>, people might tend to make more selfish choices in a dictator game.  Even just recalling recent ethical behavior might <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21402752\">reduce people's intentions to donate blood, money, and time</a>.  The idea is that people are more motivated to behave well when their previous bad behavior is salient and less motivated to behave well when their previous good behavior is salient.  They appear to calibrate toward some middle state.<p>\n\nOne alternative hypothesis is that people aim not for mediocrity but rather for something better than that, though short of sainthood.  Phenomenologically, that might be how it seems to people.  Most people think that they are somewhat above average in moral traits like honesty and fairness (<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616673878\">Tappin and McKay 2017</a>); and maybe then people mostly think that they should more or less stay the course.  An eminent ethicist once told me he was aiming for a moral \"B+\".  However, I suspect that<b> most of us who like to think of ourselves as aiming for substantially above-average moral goodness aren't really willing to put in the work and sacrifice required</b>.  A close examination of how we actually calibrate our behavior will reveal us wiggling and veering toward a lower target.  (Compare the undergraduate who says they're \"aiming for B+\" in a class but who wouldn't be willing to put in more work if they received a C on the first exam.  It's probably better to say that they are <i>hoping</i> for a B+ than that they are <i>aiming</i> for one.)<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n\nMy normative thesis is that <b>it's morally mediocre to aim for moral mediocrity</b>.  Generally speaking, it's somewhat morally bad, but not terribly bad, to aim for the moral middle.<p>\n\nIn defending this view, I'm mostly concerned to rebut the charge that it's perfectly morally fine to aim for mediocrity.  Two common excuses, which I think wither upon critical scrutiny, are the Happy Coincidence Defense and The-Most-You-Can-Do Sweet Spot.  <b>The Happy Coincidence Defense is an attractive rationalization strategy that attempts to justify doing what you prefer to do by arguing that it's also for the moral best</b> -- for example, that taking this expensive vacation now is really the morally best choice because you owe it to you family, and it will refresh you for your very important work, and....  <b>The Most-You-Can-Do Sweet Spot is a similarly attractive rationalization strategy that relies on the idea that if you tried to be any morally better than you in fact are, you would end up being morally worse</b> -- because you would collapse along the way, maybe, or you would become sanctimonious and intolerant, or you would lose the energy and joie de vivre on which your good deeds depend, or....  Of course it can sometimes be true that by Happy Coincidence your preferences align with the moral best or that you are already precisely in The-Most-You-Can-Do Sweet Spot.  But this reasoning is suspicious when deployed repeatedly to justify otherwise seemingly mediocre moral choices.<p>\n\nAnother normative objection is the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/11/is-it-perfectly-fine-to-aim-to-be.html\">Fairness Objection</a>, which I discussed on the blog last month.  Since (by stipulation) most of your peers aren't making the sacrifices necessary for peer-relative moral excellence, it's unfair for you to be blamed for also declining to make such sacrifices.  If the average person in your financial condition gives X% to charity, for example, it would be unfair to blame you for not giving more.  If your colleagues down the hall cheat, shirk, lie, and flake X amount of the time, it's only fair that you should get to do the same.<p>\n<b>The simplest response to the Fairness Objection is to appeal to absolute moral standards.</b>  Although <i>some</i> norms are peer-relative, so that they become morally optional if most of your peers fail to comply with them, other norms aren't like that.  A Nazi death camp guard is wrong to kill Jews even if that is normal behavior among his peers.  More moderately, sexism, racism, ableism, elitism, and so forth are wrong and blameworthy, even if they are common among your peers (though blame is probably also partly mitigated if you are less biased than average).  If you're an insurance adjuster who denies or slow-walks important health benefits on shaky grounds because you guess the person won't sue, the fact that other insurance adjusters might do the same in your place is again at best only partly mitigating.  It would likely be unfair to blame you <i>more</i> than your peers are blamed; but if you violate absolute moral standards you deserve <i>some</i> blame, regardless of your peers' behavior.<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------<p>\n\nFull length version of the paper <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">here</a>.<p>\n\nAs always, comments welcome either by email to me or in the comments field of this post.

I would contrast aiming with <i>settling</i>, which does not necessarily involve calibrating down if one is above target.  (For example, if you're <i>aiming </i>for a B, then you should work harder if you get a C on the first exam and ease up if you get an A on the first exam.  If you're willing to <i>settle </i>for a B, then you won't necessarily ease up if you happen fortunately to be headed toward an A.)<p>\n\nI believe that most people <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/10/on-aiming-for-moral-mediocrity.html\">aim to be morally mediocre</a>, even if they don't explicitly conceptualize themselves that way.  <b>Most people look at their peers' moral behavior, then calibrate toward so-so,</b> wanting neither to be among the morally best (with the self-sacrifice that seems to involve) nor among the morally worst.  But maybe \"mediocre\" is too loaded a word, with its negative connotations?  Maybe it's perfectly fine, not at all blameworthy, to aim for the moral middle?<p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n\nHere's one reason you might think so:<p>\n<b>The Fairness Argument.<p></p></b>\n<b>Let's assume (of course it's disputable) that being among the morally best, relative to your peers, normally involves substantial self-sacrifice.</b>  It's morally better to donate large amounts to worthy charities than to donate small amounts.  It's morally better to be generous rather than stingy with one's time in helping colleagues, neighbors, and distant relatives who might not be your favorite people.  It's morally better to meet your deadlines than to inconvenience others by running late.  It's morally better to have a small carbon footprint than a medium-size or large one.  It's morally better not to lie, cheat, and fudge in all the small (and sometimes large) ways that people tend to do.<p>\n\nTo be near the moral maximum in every respect would be practically impossible near-sainthood; but we non-saints could still presumably be somewhat better in many of these ways.  We just choose not to be better, because we'd rather not make the sacrifices involved.  (See <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/04/the-happy-coincidence-defense-and-most.html\">The Happy Coincidence Defense and The-Most-I-Can-Do Sweet Spot</a> for my discussion of a couple of ways of insisting that you couldn't be morally better than you in fact are.)<p>\n<b>\nSince (by stipulation) most of your peers aren't making the sacrifices necessary for peer-relative moral excellence, it's unfair for you to be blamed for also declining to do so.</b>  If the average person in your financial condition gives 3% of their income to charity, then it would be unfair to blame you for not giving more.  If your colleagues down the hall cheat, shirk, fib, and flake X amount of the time, it's only fair that you get to do the same.  Fairness requires that we demand no more than average moral sacrifice from the average person.  Thus, there's nothing wrong with aiming to be only a middling member of the moral community -- approximately as selfish, dishonest, and unreliable as everyone else.<p></p></p></p></p>\n<b>Two Replies to the Fairness Argument.</b><p>\n<b>(1.) <i>Absolute standards.</i>  Some actions are morally bad, even if the majority of your peers are doing them.</b>  As an extreme example, consider a Nazi death camp guard in 1941, who is somewhat kinder to the inmates and less enthusiastic about killing than the average death camp guard, but who still participates in and benefits from the system.  \"Hey, at least I'm better than average!\" is a poor excuse.  More moderately, most people (I believe) regularly exhibit small to moderate degrees of sexism, racism, ableism, and preferential treatment of the conventionally beautiful.  Even though most people do this, one remains criticizable for it -- that you're typical or average in your degree of bias is at most a mitigator of blame, not a full excuser from blame.  So although some putative norms might become morally optional (or \"supererogatory\") if most of your peers fail to comply, others don't show that structure.  With respect to some norms, aiming for mediocrity is not perfectly fine.<p>\n<b>(2.) <i>The seeming-absurdity of trade offs between norm types.</i></b>  Most of us see ourselves as having areas of moral strength and weakness.  Maybe you're a warm-hearted fellow, but flakier than average about responding to important emails.  Maybe you know you tend to be rude and grumpy to strangers, but you're an unusually active volunteer for good causes in your community.  My psychological conjecture is that, in implicitly guiding our own behavior, we tend to treat these tradeoffs as exculpatory or <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00263.x/abstract\">licensing</a>: You forgive yourself for the one in light of the other.  You let your excellence in one area justify lowering your aims in another, so that averaging the two, you come out somewhere in the middle.  (In these examples, I'm assuming that you didn't spend so much time and energy on the one that the other becomes unfeasible.  It's not that you spent hours helping your colleague so that you simply couldn't get to your email.)<p>\n\nAlthough this is tempting reasoning when you're motivated to see yourself (or someone else) positively, a more neutral judge might tend to find it strange: \"It's fine that I insulted that cashier, because this afternoon I'm volunteering for river clean-up.\"  \"I'm not criticizable for neglecting Cameron's urgent email because this morning I greeted Monica and Britney kindly, filling the office with good vibes.\" <b> Although non-consciously or semi-consciously we tend to cut ourselves slack in one area when we think about our excellence in others, when the specifics of such tradeoffs are brought to light, they often don't stand scrutiny.</b><p></p></p></p></p>\n<b>\nConclusion.<p></p></b>\n\nIt's not perfectly fine to aim merely for the moral middle.  Your peers tend to be somewhat morally criticizable; and if you aim to be the same, you too are somewhat morally criticizable for doing so.  The Fairness Argument doesn't work as a general rule (though it may work in some cases).  If you're not aiming for moral excellence, you are somewhat morally blameworthy for your low moral aspirations.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/license/526748750\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/11/is-it-perfectly-fine-to-aim-to-be.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-11-09T10:56:00-08:00\">10:56 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2528983524368340210\" onclick=\"\">17\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, August 24, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7492281222522182068\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/am-i-type-or-token-guest-post-by-henry.html\">Am I a Type or a Token?

So it\u2019s in this spirit of openness to wild ideas I\u2019d like to throw out one of my own longstanding \u201ccrazy\u201d ideas concerning our identity as conscious subjects.<p>\nTo set the scene, imagine that we have one hundred supercomputers, each separately running a conscious simulation of the same human life. We\u2019re also going to assume that these simulations are all causally coupled together so that they\u2019re in identical functional states at any one time \u2013 if a particular mental state type is being realized in one at a given time, it\u2019s also being realized in all the others. <p>\nThe question I want to ask now is: how many conscious subjects \u2013 subjective points of view \u2013 exist in this setup? A natural response is \u201cone hundred, obviously!\u201d After all, there are one hundred computers all running their own simulations. But the alternate crazy hypothesis I\u2019d like to suggest is that there\u2019s just one subject in this scenario. Specifically, I want to claim that insofar as two physical realizations of consciousness give rise to a qualitatively identical sequence of experiences, they give rise to a single <i>numerically</i> identical subject of experience. <p>\nCall this hypothesis the <i>Identity of Phenomenal Duplicates</i>, or IPD for short. Why would anyone think such a crazy thing? In short, I\u2019m attracted by the idea that the only factors relevant to the identity and individuation of a conscious subject are subjective: crudely, what makes me me is just the way the world seems to me and my conscious reactions to it. As a subject of phenomenal experience, in other words, my numerical identity is fixed just by those factors that are part of my experience, and factors that lie outside my phenomenal awareness (for example, which of many possible computers are running the simulation that underpins my consciousness) are thus irrelevant to my identity. <p>\nPutting things another way, I\u2019d suggest that maybe my identity qua conscious subject is more like a <i>type</i> than a <i>token</i>, meaning that a single conscious subject could be multiply instantiated. As a helpful analogy, think about the ontology of something like a song, a novel, or a movie. <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> has been screened billions of times over the years, but all of these were instantiations of one individual thing, namely the movie itself. If the IPD thesis is correct, then the same might be true for a conscious subject \u2013 that I myself (not merely duplicates of me!) could be multiply instantiated across a host of different biological or artificial bodies, even at a single moment. What *I* am, then, on this view, is a kind of subjective pattern or concatenation of such patterns, rather than a single spatiotemporally located object. <p>\nHere\u2019s an example that might make the view seem (marginally!) more plausible. Thinking back to the one hundred simulations scenario above, imagine that we pick one simulation at random to be hooked up to a robot body, so that it can send motor outputs to the body and receive its sensory inputs. (Note that because we\u2019re keeping all the simulations coupled together, they\u2019ll remain in \u2018phenomenal sync\u2019 with whichever sim we choose to be embodied as a robot). The robot wakes up, looks around, and is fascinated to learn it\u2019s suddenly in the real world, having previously spent its life in a simulation. But now it asks us: which of the Sims am I? Am I the Sim running on the mainframe in Tokyo, or the one in London, or the one in Sao Paolo? <p>\nOne natural response would be that it was identical to whichever Sim we uploaded the relevant data from. But I think this neglects the fact that all one hundred Sims are causally coupled with one another, so in a sense, we uploaded the data from all of them \u2013 we just used one specific access point to get to it. To illustrate this, note that in transferring the relevant information from our Sims to the robot, we might wish (perhaps for reasons of efficiency) to grab the data from all over the place \u2013 there\u2019s no reason we\u2019d have to confine ourselves to copying the data over from just one Sim. So here\u2019s an alternate hypothesis: the robot was identical to all of them, because they were all identical to one another \u2013 there was just one conscious subject all along! (Readers familiar with Dennett\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/Dennett-WhereAmI.pdf\">Where Am I?</a> may see clear parallels here.) <p>\nI find something very intuitive about the response IPD provides in this case. I realize, though, that what I\u2019ve provided here isn\u2019t much of an argument, and invites a slew of questions and objections. For example, even if you\u2019re sympathetic to the reading of the example above, I haven\u2019t established the stronger claim of IPD, which makes no reference to causal coupling. This leaves it open to say, for example, that had the simulations been qualitatively identical by <i>coincidence</i> (for example, via being a cluster of <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/might-i-be-cosmic-freak.html\">Boltzmann brains</a>) rather than being causally coupled, their subjects wouldn\u2019t have been numerically identical. We might also wonder about beings whose lives are subjectively identical up to a particular point in time, and afterwards diverge. Are they the same conscious subject up until the point of divergence, or were they distinct all along? Finally, there\u2019s also some tricky issues concerning what it means for me to <i>survive</i> in this framework \u2013 if I\u2019m a phenomenal type rather than a particular token instantiation of that type, it might seem like I could still exist in some sense even if all my token instances were destroyed (although would <i>Star Wars</i> still exist in some relevant sense if every copy of it was lost?). <p>\nSetting aside these worries for now, I\u2019d like to quickly explore how the truth or falsity of IPD might actually matter \u2013 in fact, might matter a great deal! Consider a scenario in which some future utilitarian society decides that the best way to maximize happiness in the universe is by running a bunch of simulations of perfectly happy lives. Further, let\u2019s imagine that their strategy for doing this involves simulating the <i>same</i> single exquisitely happy life a billion times over. <p>\nIf IPD is right, <i>then they\u2019ve just made a terrible mistake:</i> rather than creating a billion happy conscious subjects, they\u2019ve just made one exquisitely happy subject with a billion (hedonically redundant) instantiations! To rectify this situation, however, all they\u2019d need to do would be to introduce an element of variation into their Sims \u2013 some small phenomenal or psychological difference that meant that each of the billion simulations was subjectively unique. If IPD is right, this simple change would increase the happiness in the universe a billion-fold. <p>\nThere are other potential interesting applications of IPD. For example, coupled with a multiverse theory, it might have the consequence that you currently inhabit multiple distinct worlds, namely all those in which there exist entities that realize subjectively and psychologically identical mental states. Similarly, it might mean that you straddle multiple non-continuous areas of space and time: if the same identical simulation is run at time t1 and time t2 a billion years apart, then IPD would suggest that a single subject cohabits both instantiations. <p>\nAnyway, while I doubt I\u2019ve convinced anyone (yet!) of this particular crazyism of mine, I hope at least it might provide the basis for some interesting metaphysical arguments and speculations.<p>\n\n[Image credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/44052773@N00/3094070078/\">Paolo Tonon</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/am-i-type-or-token-guest-post-by-henry.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-08-24T08:00:00-07:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7492281222522182068\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Henry%20Shevlin\" rel=\"tag\">Henry Shevlin</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/personal%20identity\" rel=\"tag\">personal identity</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/stream%20of%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">stream of experience</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, August 08, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6341664181727456264\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/the-ethical-significance-of-toddler.html\">The Ethical Significance of Toddler Tantrums (guest post by Henry Shevlin)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>guest post by</p></div></div></div></div></div>\n<a href=\"http://henryshevlin.com/\">Henry Shevlin</a><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OnYs4qMs0mc/WYjC3ui5rkI/AAAAAAAAASw/C_r9bc3mCSgAnIh32aduSEBz6BYntF3YgCLcBGAs/s1600/Toddler.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"300\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OnYs4qMs0mc/WYjC3ui5rkI/AAAAAAAAASw/C_r9bc3mCSgAnIh32aduSEBz6BYntF3YgCLcBGAs/s320/Toddler.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n\nAs any parent can readily testify, little kids get upset. A lot. Sometimes it\u2019s for broadly comprehensible stuff - because they have to go to bed or to daycare, for example. Sometimes it\u2019s for more bizarre and idiosyncratic reasons \u2013 because their banana has broken, perhaps, or because the Velcro on their shoes makes a funny noise.<p>\n\nFor most parents, these episodes are regrettable, exasperating, and occasionally, <a href=\"http://www.reasonsmysoniscrying.com/\">a little funny</a>. We rarely if ever consider them tragic or of serious moral consequence. We certainly feel some empathy for our children\u2019s intense anger, sadness, or frustration, but we generally don\u2019t make a huge deal about these episodes. That\u2019s not because we don\u2019t care about toddlers, of course \u2013 if they were sick or in pain we\u2019d be really concerned. But we usually treat these intense emotional outbursts as just a part of growing up. <p>\n \nNonetheless, I think if we saw an adult undergoing extremes of negative emotion of the kind that toddlers go through on a daily or weekly basis, we\u2019d be pretty affected by it, and regard it as something to be taken seriously. Imagine you\u2019d visited a friend for dinner, and upon announcing you were leaving, he broke down in floods of tears, beating on the ground and begging you not to go. Most of us wouldn\u2019t think twice about sticking around until he felt better. Yet when a toddler pulls the same move (say, when we\u2019re dropping them off with a grandparent), most parents remained, if not unmoved, then at least resolute. <p>\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between our reactions in these cases? In large part, I think it\u2019s because we assume that when adults get upset, they have good reasons for it \u2013 if an adult friend starts sobbing uncontrollably, then our first thought is going to be that they\u2019re facing real problems. For a toddler, by contrast \u2013 well, they can get upset about almost anything. <p>\n\nThis makes a fair amount of sense as far as it goes. But it also seems to require that our moral reactions to apparent distress should be sensitive not just to the degree of unhappiness involved, but the reasons for it. In other words, we\u2019re not discounting toddler tantrums because we think little kids aren\u2019t genuinely upset, or are faking, but because the tantrums aren\u2019t reflective of any concerns worth taking too seriously. <p>\n\nInterestingly, this idea seems at least prima facie in tension with some major philosophical accounts of happiness and well-being, notably like <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#Hed\">hedonism</a> or <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#DesThe\">desire satisfaction theory</a>. By the lights of these approaches, it\u2019s hard to see why toddler emotions and desires shouldn\u2019t be taken just as seriously as adult ones. These episodes do seem like bona fide intensely negative experiences, so for utilitarians, every toddler could turn out to be a kind of negative <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster\">utility monster</a>! Similarly, if we adopt a form of consequentialism that aims at maximizing the number of satisfied desires, toddlers might be an outsize presence \u2013 as indicated by their tantrums, they have a lot of seemingly big, powerful, intense desires all the time (for, e.g., a Kinder Egg, another episode of Ben and Holly, or that one toy their older sibling is playing with). <p>\n\nOne possibility I haven\u2019t so far discussed is the idea that toddlers\u2019 emotional behavior might be deceptive: perhaps the wailing toddler, contrary to appearances, is only mildly peeved that a sticker peeled off his toy. There may be something to this idea: certainly, toddlers have very poor inhibitory control, so we might naturally expect them to be more demonstrative about negative emotions than adults. That said, I find it hard to believe that toddlers really aren\u2019t all that bothered by whatever it is that\u2019s caused their latest tantrum. As much as I may be annoyed at having to leave a party early, for example, it\u2019s almost inconceivable to me that it could ever trigger floods of tears and wailing, no matter how badly my inhibitory control had been impaired by the host\u2019s martinis. (Nonetheless, I\u2019d grant this is an area where psychology or neuroscience could be potentially informative, so that we might gain evidence that toddlers\u2019 apparent distress behavior was misleading). <p>\n\nBut if we do grant that toddlers really get very upset all the time, is it a serious moral problem? Or just an argument against theories that take things like emotions and desires to be morally significant in their own right, without being justified by good reasons? As someone sympathetic to both hedonism about well-being and utilitarianism as a normative ethical theory, I\u2019m not sure what to think. Certainly, it\u2019s made me consider whether, as a parent, I should take my son\u2019s tantrums more seriously. For example, if we\u2019re at the park, and I know he\u2019ll have a tantrum if we leave early, should I prioritize his emotions above, e.g., my desire to get home and grade student papers? Perhaps you\u2019ll think that in reacting like this, I\u2019m just being overly sentimental or sappy \u2013 come on, what could be more normal than toddler tantrums! \u2013 but it\u2019s worth being conscious of the fact that <a href=\"https://victorianchildren.org/victorian-child-labor/\">previous societies normalized ways of treating children</a> that we nowadays would regard as brutal. <p>\n\nThere\u2019s also, of course, the developmental question: toddlers aren\u2019t stupid, and if they realize that we\u2019ll do anything to avoid them having tantrums, then they\u2019ll exploit that to their own (dis)advantage. Learning that you can\u2019t always get what you want is certainly part of growing up. But thinking about this issue has certainly made me take another look at how I think about and respond to my son\u2019s outbursts, even if I can\u2019t fix his broken bananas. <p>\n\nNote: this blogpost is an extended exploration of ideas I earlier discussed <a href=\"http://henryshevlin.com/are-toddler-tantrums-a-serious-ethical-issue/\">here</a>. <p>\n\n[image: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/angelina_creations/4336718492/\">Angelina Koh</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/the-ethical-significance-of-toddler.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-08-08T07:44:00-07:00\">7:44 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6341664181727456264\" onclick=\"\">9\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/developmental%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">developmental psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Henry%20Shevlin\" rel=\"tag\">Henry Shevlin</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, June 15, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4873581417847138438\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/on-not-distinguishing-too-finely-among.html\">On Not Distinguishing Too Finely Among One's Motivations</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mz9y_tAzM8M/WUKxeVzo86I/AAAAAAAAAN8/Jj3WsX5R6bs-YvB5MqzGWyd_IUcRAyc2gCLcBGAs/s1600/Batson.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1080\" data-original-width=\"717\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mz9y_tAzM8M/WUKxeVzo86I/AAAAAAAAAN8/Jj3WsX5R6bs-YvB5MqzGWyd_IUcRAyc2gCLcBGAs/s400/Batson.jpg\" width=\"266\"/></a></div><p>\n\n\nI'm working through Daniel Batson's latest book, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/whats-wrong-with-morality-9780199355570?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">What's Wrong with Morality</a>?<p>\n\nBatson distinguishes between four different types of motives for seemingly moral behavior, each with a different type of ultimate goal.  Batson's taxonomy is helpful -- but I want to push back against distinguishing as finely as he does among people's motives for doing good.<p>\n\nSuppose I offer a visiting speaker a ride to the airport.  That seems like a nice thing to do.  According to Batson, I might have one (or more) of the following types of motivation:<p>\n\n(1.) I might be <b>egoistically</b> motivated -- acting in my own perceived self-interest.  Maybe the speaker is the editor of a prestigious journal and I think I'll have a better shot publishing and advancing my career if the speaker thinks well of me.<p>\n\n(2.) I might be <b>altruistically</b> motivated -- aiming primarily to benefit the speaker herself.  I just want her to have a good visit, a good experience at UC Riverside, and giving her a ride is a way of advancing that goal I have.<p>\n\n(3.) I might be <b>collectivistically</b> motivated -- aiming primarily to benefit a group.  I want UC Riverside's Philosophy Department to flourish, and giving the speaker a ride is a way of advancing that thing I care about.<p>\n\n(4.) I might be <b>motivated by principle</b> -- acting according to a moral standard, principle, or ideal.  Maybe I think driving the speaker to the airport will maximize global utility, or that it is ethically required given my social role and past promises.<p>\n\nBatson characterizes his view of motivation as \"Galilean\" -- focused on the underlying forces that drive behavior (p. 25-26).  <b>The idea seems to be that when I make that offer to the visiting speaker, that action must have been induced by some <i>particular motivational force</i> inside me that is egoistic, altruistic, collectivist, or principled, or some specific combination of those.</b>  On this view, we don't understand why I am offering the ride until we know which of these interior forces is the one that caused me to offer the ride.  Principled morality is rare, Batson argues, because it requires being caused to act by the fourth type of motivation, and people are more normally driven by the first three.<p>\n\nI'm nervous about appeals to internal causes of this sort.  My best guess is that these sorts of simple, familiar folk (or quasi-folk) categories don't map neatly onto the real causal processes generating our behavior, which are likely to be much more complicated, and also misaligned with categories that come naturally to us.  (Compare connectionist structures and <a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/\">deep learning</a>.)<p>\n\nRather than try to articulate an alternative positive account, which would be too much to add to this post, let me just suggest the following.  It's plausible that <b>our motivations are often a tangled mess, and when they are a tangled mess, attempting to distinguish finely among them is usually a mistake.</b><p>\n\nFor example, there are probably hypothetical conditions under which I would decline to drive the speaker because it conflicted with my self-interest, and there are probably other hypothetical conditions under which I would set aside my self-interest and choose to drive the speaker anyway.  I doubt these hypothetical conditions line up neatly, so that I decline to drive the speaker if and only if it would require sacrificing X amount or more of self-interest.  Some situations might just channel me into driving her, even at substantial personal cost, while others might more easily invite the temptation to wiggle out.<p>\n\nThe same is likely true for the other motivations. Hypothetically, if the situation were different so that it was less in the collective interest of the department, or less in the speaker's interest, or less compelled by my favorite moral principles, I might drive or not drive the speaker depending partly on each of these but also partly on other factors of situation and internal psychology, habits, scripts, potential embarrassment -- probably in no tidy pattern.<p>\n\nFurthermore, egoistic, altruistic, collectivist, and principled aims come in many varieties, difficult to disentangle.  I might be egoistically invested in the collective flourishing of the department as a way of enhancing my own stature in the profession.  I might be drawn to different, conflicting moral principles.  I might altruistically desire both that the speaker get to her flight on time and that she enjoy the company of the cleverest conversationalist in the department (me!).  I might enjoy showing off the sights of the L.A. basin through the windows of my car, with a feeling of civic pride.  Etc.<p>\n\nAmong all of these possible motivations -- indefinitely many possible motivations, perhaps, if we decide to slice finely among them -- does it make sense to try to determine which one or few are the <i>real</i> motivations that are genuinely causally responsible for my choosing to drive the speaker?<p>\n\nNow if my actual and hypothetical choices were all neatly aligned with my perceived self-interest, then of course self-interest would be my real motive.  Similarly, if my pattern of actual and hypothetical choices were all neatly aligned with one particular moral principle, then we could say I was mainly moved by that principle.  But if my patterns of choice are not so neatly explained, if my choices arise from a tangle of factors far more complex than Batson's four, then each of Batson's factors is only a <i>simplified label for a pattern that I don't very closely match</i>, rather than a deep Galilean cause of my choice.<p>\n\nThe four factors might, then, not compete with each other as starkly as Batson seems to suppose.  Each of them might, to a first approximation, capture my motivation reasonably well, in those fortunate cases where self-interest, other-interest, collective interest, and moral principle all tend to align.  I have lots of reasons for driving the speaker!  This might be so even if, in hypothetical cases, I diverge from the predicted patterns, probably in different and complex ways.  <b>My motivations might be described, with approximately equal accuracy, as egoistic, altruistic, collectivist, <i>and</i> principled, when these four factors tend to align across the relevant range of situations -- not because each type of motivation contributes equal causal juice to my behavior but rather because each attribution captures well enough the pattern of choices I would make in the types of cases we care about.</b></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/on-not-distinguishing-too-finely-among.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-06-15T09:57:00-07:00\">9:57 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4873581417847138438\" onclick=\"\">16\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, June 01, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7390077429191586003\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-social-role-defense-of-robot-rights.html\">The Social-Role Defense of Robot Rights</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Daniel Estrada's <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/collection/Yq0ePB\">Made of Robots</a> has launched a Hangout on Air series in philosophy of technology.

Most other defenses of the moral status of robots assume, implicitly or explicitly, that robots who are proper targets of moral concern will exist only in the future, once they have cognitive features <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights.htm\">similar to humans</a> or at least similar to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13347-013-0122-y\">non-human vertebrate animals</a>.<p>\n\nIn contrast, <b>Estrada argues that robots <i>already</i> deserve rights -- actual robots that currently exist</b>, even simple robots.<p>\n\nHis core argument is this:<p>\n\n1. Some robots are already \"social participants\" deeply incorporated into our social order.<p>\n\n2. Such deeply incorporated social participants deserve social respect and substantial protections -- \"rights\" -- regardless of whether they are capable of interior mental states like joy and suffering.<p>\n\nLet's start with some comparison cases.  Estrada mentions <b>corpses and teddy bears</b>.  We normally treat corpses with a certain type of respect, even though we think they themselves aren't capable of states like joy and suffering.  And there's something that seems at least a little creepy about abusing a teddy bear, even though it can't feel pain.<p>\n\nYou could explain these reactions without thinking that corpses and teddy bears deserve rights.  Maybe it's the person who existed in the past, whose corpse is now here, who has rights not to be mishandled after death.  Or maybe the corpse's relatives and friends have the rights.  Maybe what's creepy about abusing a teddy bear is what it says about the abuser, or maybe abusing a teddy harms the child whose bear it is.<p>\n\nAll that is plausible, but another way of thinking emphasizes the social roles that corpses and teddy bears play and the importance to our social fabric (arguably) of our treating them in certain ways and not in other ways.  Other comparisons might be: flags, classrooms, websites, parks, and historic buildings.  Destroying or abusing such things is not morally neutral. <b> Arguably, mistreating flags, classrooms, websites, parks, or historic buildings is a harm to society -- a harm that does not reduce to the harm of one or a few specific property owners who bear the relevant rights.</b><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uWw3woAxQZo/WR49PbzJxTI/AAAAAAAAALY/vPH1MkBo9N42OJW61dmIuao6jN6gtLALACLcB/s1600/KS_HitchBOT.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uWw3woAxQZo/WR49PbzJxTI/AAAAAAAAALY/vPH1MkBo9N42OJW61dmIuao6jN6gtLALACLcB/s320/KS_HitchBOT.jpg\" width=\"181\"/></a></div><p>\n\nArguably, the destruction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT\">hitchBOT</a> was like that.  HitchBOT was cute ride-hitching robot, who made it across the length of Canada but who was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/03/us/hitchbot-robot-beheaded-philadelphia-feat/\">destroyed by pranksters in Philadelphia</a> when its creators sent it to repeat the feat in the U.S.  Its destruction not only harmed its creators and owners, but also the social networks of hitchBOT enthusiasts who were following it and cheering it on.<p>\n\nIt might seem overblown to say that a flag or a historic building deserves <i>rights</i>, even if it's true that flags and historic buildings in some sense deserve respect.  If this is all there is to \"robot rights\", then we have a very thin notion of rights.  Estrada isn't entirely explicit about it, but I think he wants more than that.<p>\n\nHere's the thing that makes the robot case different: <b>Unlike flags, buildings, teddy bears, and the rest, robots can <i>act</i>.</b>  I don't mean anything too fancy here by \"act\".  Maybe all I mean or need to mean is that it's reasonable to take the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance\">intentional stance</a>\" toward them.  <b>It's reasonable to treat them as though they had beliefs, desires, intentions, goals -- and that adds a new richer dimension, maybe different in kind, to their role as nodes in our social network</b>.<p>\n\nMaybe that new dimension is enough to warrant using the term \"rights\".  Or maybe not.  I'm inclined to think that whatever rights existing (non-conscious, not cognitively sophisticated) robots deserve remain derivative on us -- like the \"rights\" of flags and historic buildings.  Unlike human beings and apes, <b>such robots have no <i>intrinsic </i>moral status</b>, independent of their role in our social practices.  To conclude otherwise would require more argument or a different argument than Estrada gives.<p>\n\nRobot rights cheap!  That's good.  I like cheap.  Discount knock-off rights!  If you want <i>luxury </i>rights, though, you'll have to look somewhere else (for now).<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT\">image source</a>]\n\nUpdate: I changed \"have rights\" to \"deserve rights\" in a few places above.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-social-role-defense-of-robot-rights.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-06-01T15:51:00-07:00\">3:51 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7390077429191586003\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/culture\" rel=\"tag\">culture</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, May 25, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4622267552074614078\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/05/lynching-milgram-experiments-and.html\">Lynching, the Milgram Experiments, and the Question of Whether \"Human Nature Is Good\"</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>At <a href=\"http://thedeviantphilosopher.org/\">The Deviant Philosopher</a> Wayne Riggs, Amy Olberding, Kelly Epley, and Seth Robertson are collecting suggestions for teaching units, exercises, and primers that incorporate philosophical approaches and philosophers that are not currently well-represented in the formal institutional structures of the discipline.

Day one is on the history of lynching in the United States, featuring lynching photography and Ida B. Wells.  Day two is Mengzi on human nature (with Rousseau as secondary reading).  Day three is Xunzi on human nature (with Hobbes as secondary reading).  Days four and five are the Milgram video and John Doris on situationism.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe central question concerns the psychology of lynching perpetrators and Milgram participants.  On a \u201chuman nature is good\u201d view, we all have some natural sympathies or an innate moral compass that would be revolted by our participation in such activities, if we were not somehow swept along by bad influences (Mengzi, Rousseau).  On a \u201chuman nature is bad\u201d view, our natural inclinations are mostly self-serving and morality is an artificial human construction; so if one\u2019s culture says \u201cthis is the thing to do\u201d there is no inner source of resistance unless you have already been properly trained (Xunzi, Hobbes).  Situationism (which is not inconsistent with either of these alternatives) suggests that most people can commit great evil or good depending on what seem to be fairly moderate situational pressures (Doris, Milgram).<br/>\n<br/>\nStudents should be alerted in advance about the possibly upsetting photographs, and they must be encouraged to look closely at the faces of the perpetrators rather than being too focused on the bodies of the victims (which may be edited out if desired for classroom presentation).  You might even consider giving the students possible alternative readings if they find the lynching material too difficult (such as an uplifting chapter from Colby &amp; Damon 1992).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Day One, a point of emphasis should be that most of the victims were not even accused of capital crimes, and focus can be both on the history of lynching in general and on the emotional reactions of the perpetrators as revealed by their behavior described in the texts and by their faces in the photos.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Day Two, the main emphasis should be on Mengzi\u2019s view that human nature is good.  King Xuan and the ox (1A7), the child at the well (2A6), and the beggar refusing food insultingly given (6A10) are the most vivid examples.  The metaphor of cultivating sprouts is well worth extended attention (as discussed in the Ivanhoe and Schwitzgebel readings for the instructor).  If the lynchers had paused to reflect in the right way, would they have found in themselves a natural revulsion against what they were doing, as Mengzi would predict?  Rousseau\u2019s view is similar (especially as developed in Emile) but puts more emphasis on the capacity of philosophical thinking to produce rationalizations of bad behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Day Three, the main emphasis should be on Xunzi\u2019s view that human nature is bad.  His metaphor of straightening a board is fruitfully contrasted with Mengzi\u2019s of cultivating sprouts.  For example, in straightening a board, the shape (the moral structure) is imposed by force from outside.  In cultivating a sprout, the shape grows naturally from within, given a supportive, nutritive, non-damaging environment.  Students can be invited to consider cartoon versions of \u201cconservative\u201d moral education (\u201chere are the rules, like it or not, follow them or you\u2019ll be punished!\u201d) versus \u201cliberal\u201d moral education (\u201cdon\u2019t you feel bad that you hurt Ana\u2019s feelings?\u201d).<br/>\n<br/>\nDay Four you might just show the Milgram video.<br/>\n<br/>\nDay Five the focus should be on articulating situationism vs dispositionism (or whatever you want to call the view that broad, stable, enduring character traits explain most of our moral behavior).  I recommend highlighting the elements of truth in both views, and then showing how there are both situationist and dispositionist elements in both Mengzi and Xunzi (e.g., Mengzi says that young men are mostly cruel in times of famine, but he also recommends cultivating stable dispositions).  Students can be encouraged to discuss how well or poorly the three different types of approach explain the lynchings and the Milgram results<br/>\n<br/>\nIf desired, Day Six and beyond can cover material on the Holocaust.  Hannah Arendt\u2019s <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i> and Daniel Goldhagen\u2019s <i>Hitler\u2019s Willing Executioners</i> make a good contrast (with Mengzian elements in Arendt and Xunzian elements in Goldhagen).  (If you do use Goldhagen, be sure you are aware of the legitimate criticisms of some aspects of his view by Browning and others.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Discussion Questions</i><br/>\n<ul>\n<li>What emotions are the lynchers feeling in the photographs?</li>\n<li>If the lynchers had stopped to reflect on their actions, would they have been able to realize that what they were doing was morally wrong?</li>\n<li>Mengzi lived in a time of great chaos and evil.  Although he thought human nature was good, he never denied that people actually commit great evil.  What resources are available in his view to explain actions like those of the lynch mobs, or other types of evil actions?</li>\n<li>Is morality an artificial cultural invention?  Or do we all have natural moral tendencies that only need to be cultivated in a nurturing environment?</li>\n<li>In elementary school moral education, is it better to focus on enforcing rules that might not initially make sense to the children, or is it better to try to appeal to their sympathies and concerns for other people?</li>\n<li>How effectively do you think people can predict what they themselves would do in a situation like the Milgram experiment or a lynch mob?</li>\n<li>Are there people who are morally steadfast enough to resist even strong situational pressures?  If so, how do they become like that?</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Activities (optional)</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOn the first day, an in class assignment might be for them to spend 5-7 minutes writing down their opinion on whether human nature is good or evil (or in-between, or alternatively that the question doesn\u2019t even make sense as formulated).  Then can then trade their written notes with a neighbor or two and compare answers.  On the last day, they can review what they wrote on the first day and discuss whether their opinions have changed.<br/>\n\n[Greetings from Graz, Austria, by the way!]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/05/lynching-milgram-experiments-and.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-05-25T13:20:00-07:00\">1:20 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4622267552074614078\" onclick=\"\">1 comments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/announcements\" rel=\"tag\">announcements</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/chinese%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">chinese philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20development\" rel=\"tag\">moral development</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics?updated-max=2017-05-25T13:20:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=14&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

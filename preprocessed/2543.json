There\u2019s another reason for their fine teeth: samples of Pompeii\u2019s water and air found high levels of fluoride. Volcanic rocks and hot springs are high in fluorine which dissolves into water as fluoride, the same thing 25 countries deliberately add to their tap water for public dental health purposes. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-scanned.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38675\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-scanned-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-scanned-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-scanned-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-scanned-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"CAT scan on cast of Pompeiian child. EPA/CESARE ABBATE\" width=\"150\"/></a>While the casts have been X-rayed before, this is the first time any of them have been CAT scanned. One of the reasons for that is that the density of the plaster varies \u2014 the oldest of it dates to the 19th century, plus layers from subsequent restorations \u2014 but it can be as dense as bone. People with our squishy outsides are comparatively easy to scan, but add a thick plaster exoskeleton and it gets tricky. The archaeological team was able to borrow a 16-layer scanner from Philips SpA Healthcare that allowed them to see through the plaster to the bones in great detail. The scanner is superfast, taking only 100 seconds for a full body scan, and is able to block distortions to the images caused by metal elements. It was designed for people with prosthetics or implanted devices. The dead of Pompeii don\u2019t have titanium hips and pacemakers, but metal pieces were added to some of the casts to reinforce the plaster structure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38668\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast-430x546.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast.jpg 1023w\" title=\"CAT scan child from the House of the Golden Bracelet.

The 30 casts of men, women and one child, plus two more casts of animals (a dog and a pig or wild boar) were CAT scanned. The mother holding her child discovered under the staircase in the <a href=\"http://www.pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/r6/6%2017%2042%20garden.htm\" target=\"_blank\">House of the Golden Bracelet</a>, for example, could not be scanned, but a slighter older child, probably a boy, found a few yards away from the mother was small enough to be fully scanned. The cast of the child contained a full skeleton. The length of femur established that the child was between two and three years old at time of death. A bump on the sternum previously thought to be a knot has now been identified as a fibula, probably gold, a baby version of the heavy gold bracelet found on his mother\u2019s wrist which gave the house its name.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-Porta-Nola-body-side.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38666\" height=\"80\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-Porta-Nola-body-side-150x80.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-Porta-Nola-body-side-150x80.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-Porta-Nola-body-side-200x107.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-Porta-Nola-body-side-430x231.jpg 430w\" title=\"CAT scan of Porta Nola body on its side.

The cast of a woman thought from her silhouette to have been pregnant at the time of her death is empty. The CAT scan found no fetal bones and no adult bones. This is an artifact from the 19th century when some of the early casts were done after the skeletal remains were removed, possibly for ethical or religious reasons. One of the most iconic casts, the dog writhing on its back from the House of Orpheus, is also completely devoid of bones and it\u2019s unlikely they would have been removed out of respect for the dead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-body.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38670\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 114px) 100vw, 114px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-body-114x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-body-114x150.jpg 114w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-body-200x261.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-body-430x562.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-body.jpg 993w\" title=\"CAT scan of body.

They have collected sufficient data to create 3D virtual models that will not only provide invaluable information about the lives and deaths of the people of Pompeii, but also about the plaster itself which will be of great aid in future conservation decisions. The team is planning to create a database of the 3D models so scholars around the world have access to them.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Plaster casts of Pompeii given first CAT scans\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38663\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38663#comments\">22 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38647\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38647\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to &lt;em&gt;Erebus&lt;/em&gt; summer dive season goes swimmingly\"><em>Erebus</em> summer dive season goes swimmingly</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, September 29th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Erebus-hull.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38653\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Erebus-hull-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Erebus-hull-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Erebus-hull-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Erebus-hull-430x646.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Erebus-hull.jpg 1198w\" title=\"Marc-Andr\u00e9 Bernier sets a marine biology sampling quadrant on the port side hull.

Divers explored the wreck from August 28th to September 10th, logging a total of 100 dives and 109 hours underwater. The excellent visibility and comparative warmth allowed them to remove the kelp from the full 30-meter (98-foot) length of the ship. With the kelp gone, the team was able to document the structure of the ship, identify the areas damaged by ice, record the debris field surrounding it and fully survey the upper deck.

The bow is almost entirely intact, stable enough that divers in future seasons should be able to swim right into it. Where the structure has been too damaged by ice and time, it will have to be reinforced before any divers attempt to go inside. There is no rush; this is a long-term project.

Since the invasion of Iraq and subsequent <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/286\" target=\"_blank\">orgy of looting</a>, the museum has a matter of policy paid smugglers to keep artifacts from leaving the country, no questions asked. The tablet was acquired by the museum in late 2011 as part of a collection of 80-90 tablets sold by an unnamed shady character. Professor Farouk Al-Rawi examined the collection while the seller haggled with museum official Abdullah Hashim. When Al-Rawi he saw this tablet, he told Hashim to pay whatever the seller wanted: $800.</p>\n<p>Even caked in mud the tablet\u2019s importance was instantly recognizable to the expert. Once it was clean, Al-Rawi identified it as a fragment of Tablet V of the <a href=\"http://www.soas.ac.uk/nme/research/gilgamesh/standard/\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh</a>.<br/>\nThe tablet is the left half of a six-column tablet written in Neo-Babylonian. It\u2019s composed of three fragments that have been glued together, oddly enough, probably either by the original excavators or the seller.

Gilgamesh, King of Uruk, gets the idea to kill the giant Humbaba, guardian of the Cedar Forest, home of the gods, in Tablet II. He thinks accomplishing such a feat of strength will gain him eternal fame. His wise companion (and former wild man) Enkidu tries to talk him out of it \u2014 Humbaba was set to his task by the god Enlil \u2014 but stubborn Gilgamesh won\u2019t budge, so Enkidu agrees to go with him on this quest. Together they overpower the giant. When the defeated Humbaba begs for mercy, offering to serve Gilgamesh forever and give him every sacred tree in the forest, Gilgamesh is moved to pity, but Enkidu\u2019s blood is up now and he exhorts his friend to go through with the original plan to kill the giant and get that eternal renown he craves. Gilgamesh cuts Humbaba\u2019s head off and then cuts down the sacred forest. The companions return to Uruk with the trophy head and lots of aromatic timber.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obverse-of-the-newly-discovered-tablet-V-of-the-Epic-of-Gilgamesh.-The-Sulaymaniyah-Museum-Iraq.-Photo-\u00a9-Osama-S.M.-Amin..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38634\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obverse-of-the-newly-discovered-tablet-V-of-the-Epic-of-Gilgamesh.-The-Sulaymaniyah-Museum-Iraq.-Photo-\u00a9-Osama-S.M.-Amin.-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obverse-of-the-newly-discovered-tablet-V-of-the-Epic-of-Gilgamesh.-The-Sulaymaniyah-Museum-Iraq.-Photo-\u00a9-Osama-S.M.-Amin.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obverse-of-the-newly-discovered-tablet-V-of-the-Epic-of-Gilgamesh.-The-Sulaymaniyah-Museum-Iraq.-Photo-\u00a9-Osama-S.M.-Amin.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obverse-of-the-newly-discovered-tablet-V-of-the-Epic-of-Gilgamesh.-The-Sulaymaniyah-Museum-Iraq.-Photo-\u00a9-Osama-S.M.-Amin.-430x287.jpg 430w\" title=\"Obverse of the newly discovered tablet V of the Epic of Gilgamesh.

From the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jcunestud.66.0069_w-footer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">absolutely fascinating paper about the find</a> (pdf), which includes the entire text of the tablet both transliterated and translated into English, published by <a href=\"https://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff36165.php\" target=\"_blank\">Farouk Al-Rawi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff30983.php\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew George</a> of the University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The most interesting addition to knowledge provided by the new source is the continuation of the description of the Cedar Forest, one of the very few episodes in Babylonian narrative poetry when attention is paid to landscape. The cedars drip their aromatic sap in cascades (ll. 12\u201316), a trope that gains power from cedar incense\u2019s position in Babylonia as a rare luxury imported from afar. The abundance of exotic and costly materials in fabulous lands is a common literary motif. Perhaps more surprising is the revelation that the Cedar Forest was, in the Babylonian literary imagination, a dense jungle inhabited by exotic and noisy fauna (17\u201326). The chatter of monkeys, chorus of cicada, and squawking of many kinds of birds formed a symphony (or cacophony) that daily entertained the forest\u2019s guardian, H\u032eumbaba. The passage gives a context for the simile \u201clike musicians\u201d that occurs in very broken context in the Hittite version\u2019s description of Gilgame\u0161 and Enkidu\u2019s arrival at the Cedar Forest. H\u032eumbaba\u2019s jungle orchestra evokes those images found in ancient Near Eastern art, of animals playing musical instruments. H\u032eumbaba emerges not as a barbarian ogre and but as a foreign ruler entertained with music at court in the manner of Babylonian kings, but music of a more exotic kind, played by a band of equally exotic musicians.</p>\n<p>The aftermath of the heroes\u2019 slaying of H\u032eumbaba is now better preserved (300\u2013308). The previously available text made it clear that Gilgame\u0161 and Enkidu knew, even before they killed H\u032eumbaba, that what they were doing would anger the cosmic forces that governed the world, chiefly the god Enlil. Their reaction after the event is now tinged with a hint of guilty conscience, when Enkidu remarks ruefully that <em>[ana] tu\u0161\u0101r ni\u0161takan qi\u0161ta</em>, \u201cwe have reduced the forest [to] a wasteland\u2019 (303). The anxiety about offending the gods seems to a modern reader compounded by ecological regret. Enkidu goes on to imagine the angry questions that Enlil will ask them when they arrive home: <em>min\u00fb uzzakun\u016bma tarah\u032eh\u032eis\u0101 qi\u0161ta</em>, \u201cwhat was this wrath of yours that you went trampling the forest?\u201d (306). In the theme of the angry gods, the poems about H\u032eumbaba in both Sumerian and Akkadian already displayed an ethical ambivalence toward the expedition to his Cedar Forest, arising from what one commentator has called the \u201cdouble nature\u201d of the forest\u2019s guardian as ogre and servant of Enlil (Forsyth 1981: 21). This newly recovered speech of Enkidu adds to the impression that, to the poets\u2019 minds, the destruction of H\u032eumbaba and his trees was morally wrong. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Here is a video of Hazha Jalal, curator of the Sulaymaniyah Museum, displaying the tablet and talking about it in Kurdish.

Radiocarbon dating of a fragment of cranial bone returned an age range of 9,100-9,400 years before the present. The oldest known decapitation in North America was found in Windover Pond, Florida, and is 8,120\u20136,990 years old. The decapitation previously thought to be the oldest in South America dates to 3,000 years ago. It was discovered in the Peruvian Andes, as have all other similar archaeological decapitations, so until now the practice in South America was thought to have originated among the ancient Andean peoples. The discovery of a decapitated head in Brazil that is not only older than the Andean beheadings but is older than the North American ones to boot upends that theory. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Geographically, the archaeological record of North America and Mesoamerica shows a more widespread occurrence of decapitation compared to South America, with cases occurring from the Arctic to southern Mexico. Our findings suggest that South America had the same spatially widespread distribution observed for North America, making the occurrence of decapitation widespread across the whole continent since the beginning of the Holocene. In addition, they confirm that the vast territorial range of decapitation behavior described in ethnohistorical and ethnographic accounts for the New World has deeper chronological roots. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Schematic-representation-of-Burial-26-from-Lapa-do-Santo-Gil-Tokyo.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38591\" height=\"83\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Schematic-representation-of-Burial-26-from-Lapa-do-Santo-Gil-Tokyo-200x83.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Schematic-representation-of-Burial-26-from-Lapa-do-Santo-Gil-Tokyo-200x83.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Schematic-representation-of-Burial-26-from-Lapa-do-Santo-Gil-Tokyo-150x62.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Schematic-representation-of-Burial-26-from-Lapa-do-Santo-Gil-Tokyo-430x178.jpg 430w\" title=\"Schematic representation of Burial 26 from Lapa do Santo.

The marks on the right hand indicate a sharp tool was used to detach the hand from the arm. The marks on the mandible and cheekbone appear to have been left during the cutting away of soft tissues, while the cuts to the vertebra were a result of severing the neck. A fracture in the atlas bone of the neck was likely caused when it was hyperextended and then pulled up. The atlas was also rotated 42 degrees, probably the result of it having been twisted to the side. This is strong evidence of postmortem decapitation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Arrangement-of-the-cervical-vertebrae.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38590\" height=\"139\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Arrangement-of-the-cervical-vertebrae-200x139.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Arrangement-of-the-cervical-vertebrae-200x139.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Arrangement-of-the-cervical-vertebrae-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Arrangement-of-the-cervical-vertebrae-430x300.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Arrangement-of-the-cervical-vertebrae.jpg 1109w\" title=\"Arrangement of the cervical vertebrae, infero-lateral view.\" width=\"200\"/></a>Burial 26 also upends the widely accepted belief that heads were taken and displayed as war trophies, an unmistakable signifier of military dominance. Results of stable isotope analysis of the head matched the strontium isotope signature of other remains found in the rock shelter, so this person was local, not a captured enemy. Add to that the unique and deliberate positioning of the skull, vertebrae and hands and the decapitation appears to have been a funerary ritual, and a complex one at that.</p>\n<p>The earliest burials at Lapa do Santo are 10,300-10,600 years old, and in this first phase people were buried intact in shallow graves capped by limestone blocks. The second phase began around 9,600 years ago and involved extensive modifications of the bodies. They reduced the mass of the body by various means \u2014 dismemberment, defleshing, burning \u2014 and then buried what was left following ritual strictures. Burial 26 is from the second phase. Archaeologists believe this was a means for Archaic hunter-gatherers, who had no funerary monuments or grave goods, to develop elaborate rituals and explore symbolism using the dead body itself. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Oldest decapitation in the Americas found in Brazil\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38588\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38588#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38620\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38620\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rijksmuseum acquires marksmen\u2019s guild chain\">Rijksmuseum acquires marksmen\u2019s guild chain</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, September 26th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chain-from-the-marksmen\u2019s-guild-Saint-George-of-Zevenbergen-c.-1525-1546.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-38621\" height=\"408\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chain-from-the-marksmen\u2019s-guild-Saint-George-of-Zevenbergen-c.-1525-1546-430x408.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chain-from-the-marksmen\u2019s-guild-Saint-George-of-Zevenbergen-c.-1525-1546-430x408.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chain-from-the-marksmen\u2019s-guild-Saint-George-of-Zevenbergen-c.-1525-1546-150x142.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chain-from-the-marksmen\u2019s-guild-Saint-George-of-Zevenbergen-c.-1525-1546-200x189.jpg 200w\" title=\"Chain from the marksmen\u2019s guild Saint George of Zevenbergen, c. 1525-1546.

The silver chain with gilding and enamel decoration has no maker\u2019s mark, but it was made in Bergen op Zoom or Breda for the marksmen\u2019s guild Saint George of Zevenbergen.</p>\n<p>The <em>Schuttersgilde</em> were voluntary militias which defended Dutch cities from enemy attacks and internal unrest in the Middle Ages, but by the late-16th century had few wars to fight. Organized into guilds by neighborhood or by weapon of choice (bow, crossbow, musket), the militias continued to hold regular target practice in fields and in indoor meeting halls.  </p>\n<p>Once a year the guilds would hold annual marksmanship competitions. The archers\u2019 guild had \u201cjay shoot\u201d in which the members would compete to shoot a wooden bird off of a high pole. The winner would earn the title of \u201cMarksman King\u201d and be allowed to wear a splendid chain to which he would add a medallion with his own coat-of-arms. Only one medallion has survived on the Saint George of Zevenbergen chain, that of Cornelis de Glymes van Bergen, Lord of Zevenbergen, who won the competition on July 18th, 1546. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The chain is richly decorated with oak branches and various symbols. [\u2026] In combination, it demonstrates to whom the work once belonged. Saint George and the Dragon refer to the patron saint of the marksmen\u2019s guild, the seven rabbit mountains depict the name of the town where the guild was established: the city of Zevenbergen (\u201cSeven Mountains\u201d). The remaining symbols portray the task of the marksmen\u2019s guild: to defend the Church and the State. The oak leaves represent \u201csteadfastness in faith\u201d and the birds represent \u201cloyalty to Church and State\u201d.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The centerpiece of the chain is a gilded Saint George slaying the dragon while the daughter of the king prays by beside him with her lamb on a leash.</p>\n<p>Very few marksmen\u2019s chains survived intact over the years, and this one is so elaborately decorated it stands out as the rarest of the rare. By the end of the 19th century it was recognized as a highly coveted object of cultural patrimony. Art historian and historic preservation pioneer Victor de Stuers, the visionary who commissioned architect Pierre Cuypers to design the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/24478\" target=\"_blank\">new Rijksmuseum building</a> against the wishes of King William III, was horrified when the chain was sold in 1874 to Alphonse James de Rothschild, scion of the French branch of the famous banking family and owner of the Ch\u00e2teau Lafitte vineyard. De Stuers thought the chain was an irreplaceable piece of Dutch cultural heritage.</p>\n<p>The chain remained in the French Rothschild family until 2014 when they put it <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/rare-collier-de-roi-de-la-guil-5840123-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5840123&amp;sid=77c506d6-c5c1-420d-8b55-9fb37bb16caf\" target=\"_blank\">up for auction at Christie\u2019s Paris</a>. It sold to an anonymous buyer for $392,920, twice the pre-sale estimate. The buyer, who still prefers to remain anonymous, donated it to the Rijksmuseum.</p>\n<p>There could no more fitting home for the chain because it has a thematic connection to the museum\u2019s most famous masterpiece. The <em>Schuttersgilde</em> would also hold yearly banquets which were captured in group portraits. The static, stiff crowd around a table of the early 16th century evolved into more active postures in the 17th century. Rembrandt\u2019s <em>The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq</em>, better known today as <em>The Night Watch</em>, was a <em>schutterij</em> group portrait, a uniquely dynamic attempt to capture the group in action.<br/>\n<center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Banquet-of-Members-of-Amsterdams-Crossbow-Civic-Guard-by-Cornelis-Anthonisz-1533.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-38623\" height=\"126\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Banquet-of-Members-of-Amsterdams-Crossbow-Civic-Guard-by-Cornelis-Anthonisz-1533-200x126.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Banquet-of-Members-of-Amsterdams-Crossbow-Civic-Guard-by-Cornelis-Anthonisz-1533-200x126.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Banquet-of-Members-of-Amsterdams-Crossbow-Civic-Guard-by-Cornelis-Anthonisz-1533-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Banquet-of-Members-of-Amsterdams-Crossbow-Civic-Guard-by-Cornelis-Anthonisz-1533-430x272.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Banquet-of-Members-of-Amsterdams-Crossbow-Civic-Guard-by-Cornelis-Anthonisz-1533.jpg 1182w\" title=\"Banquet of Members of Amsterdam's Crossbow Civic Guard by Cornelis Anthonisz, 1533.\" width=\"200\"/></a> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-38624\" height=\"162\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum-200x162.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum-200x162.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum-150x122.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Night-Watch-Rijksmuseum-430x349.jpg 430w\" title='\"The Night Watch\" by Rembrandt van Rijn, 1642.

The coffin was found on the site of the small timber church of St. Alban\u2019s Priory where King Canute IV of Denmark, later canonized a saint, was assassinated by rebels in 1086. A light rail project was slated to cut through the area known to be the site of the historically important church, so archaeologists from the <a href=\"http://museum.odense.dk/en\" target=\"_blank\">Odense City Museums</a> surveyed it first. They were hoping to find out more about the church at the time of the murder of King Canute. Instead they found a sarcophagus on Wednesday, September 16th.</p>\n<p>Cameras were present to capture the opening of the sarcophagus.</p>\n<p>[youtube=https://youtu.be/9ti44iINIbM&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sarcophagus-lid-removed.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38609\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sarcophagus-lid-removed-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sarcophagus-lid-removed-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sarcophagus-lid-removed-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sarcophagus-lid-removed-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sarcophagus lid removed, leg bones visible.

The remains were excavated in situ and found to be the skeleton of a man about 30 years old of exceptional height. He was 187 centimeters tall, or just a hair short of six feet and two inches. The man was buried with a miniature eucharist set, a plate for the host and a chalice for the wine, near his hip.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cup-in-sarcophagus.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38612\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cup-in-sarcophagus-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cup-in-sarcophagus-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cup-in-sarcophagus-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cup-in-sarcophagus-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cup-in-sarcophagus.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Chalice found in the sarcophagus.

He was also buried just in front of the altar, the most honored placement in the church. Museum archaeologists believe the most likely candidate is Eilbert, Bishop of Odense from around 1048 to 1072. If it does prove to be Eilbert in that sarcophagus, it will be the oldest bishop\u2019s grave discovered in northern Europe.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Disk-with-inscription.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38611\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Disk-with-inscription-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Disk-with-inscription-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Disk-with-inscription-200x266.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Disk-with-inscription-430x573.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Disk-with-inscription.jpg 1536w\" title=\"Disk, probably a communion plate, with inscription.

An X-ray of the disk revealed an inscription: \u201cthe Lord\u2019s right (hand) has created strength amen.\u201d It is likely a reference to <a href=\"http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-118-16/\" target=\"_blank\">Psalms 118:16</a>, \u201cThe right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help identify the deceased, but it confirms the disk is a communion plate.</p>\n<p>We know the remains are not those of Canute even though he was buried there for a brief time. Canute\u2019s ambition to invade England and wrest the throne from the ailing William the Conqueror (as Canute the Great\u2019s great-grandnephew, Canute IV actually had a halfway decent claim to the throne, unlike William who was a) illegitimate, and b) only Edward the Confessor\u2019s first cousin once removed) and his attempts to centralize power resulted in heavy tax and tithe increases. Peasants and noble in Jutland joined forces and rebelled against Canute\u2019s taxes, chasing him to Odense where he and his brother Benedict took sanctuary in the church. The rebels broke in and ganged up on Benedict, slashing him to death. Canute, standing unarmed and unresisting in front of the altar, was struck with a spear or a sword (chroniclers differ on the point) and was struck on the head with a stone thrown through the window.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/King-Canutes-grave-at-Odense-Cathedral.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38617\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/King-Canutes-grave-at-Odense-Cathedral-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/King-Canutes-grave-at-Odense-Cathedral-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/King-Canutes-grave-at-Odense-Cathedral-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/King-Canutes-grave-at-Odense-Cathedral-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/King-Canutes-grave-at-Odense-Cathedral.jpg 912w\" title=\"King Canute's grave at Odense Cathedral\" width=\"150\"/></a>He and his brother were buried in the church where they fell. Miraculous occurrences at the church and years of famine that were seen as divine punishment for the martyrdom of Canute followed and a cult quickly grew up around him. In 1101, just 15 years after Canute\u2019s death, Pope Paschal II canonized him. Canute was the first Danish saint and became patron saint of Denmark. A new stone church was built to accommodate the saint\u2019s relics even before they were official saint\u2019s relics. Canute and Benedict\u2019s bones were moved to St. Canute\u2019s Cathedral just over a decade after his death. </p>\n<p>Further analysis of the St. Alban\u2019s bones will hopefully answer some questions, like the cause of death and his country of origin. Bishop Eilbert was from Bremen which is about 260 miles south of Odense. I don\u2019t know if stable isotope analysis can differentiate between northern Germany and Denmark. Researchers will also attempt to extract DNA which will give us information about his appearance and heritage.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"1000-year-old sarcophagus found in Odense\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38606\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38606#comments\">5 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38595\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38595\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Olmec relief looted 45 years ago found in France\">Olmec relief looted 45 years ago found in France</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, September 24th, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Olmec-relief-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38597\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Olmec-relief-2-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Olmec-relief-2-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Olmec-relief-2-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Olmec-relief-2-430x259.jpg 430w\" title=\"Xoc relief at the Mexican Cultural institute of Paris, France, Thursday,  Sept. 24, 2015.

A few archaeologists saw it, like B. Traven, author of <em>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</em> which 20 years later would become an iconic Oscar-winning movie by John Houston starring Humphrey Bogart, who photographed it in the 20s. Thirty years later the relief was photographed by Wolfgang Cordan, a German-born poet, fighter in the Dutch resistance against Nazi occupation and anthropologist who roamed the ancient sites of Chiapas in the 1950s and together with William Brito Sansores devised the (now largely discredited) M\u00e9rida System of deciphering Maya hieroglyphics. Cordan published the picture in a 1964 book about his Mexican travels, but was deliberately vague on its location. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Xoc-relief-1968-lines-partially-cleaned.jpg\" target=\"blnk\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38602\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Xoc-relief-1968-lines-partially-cleaned-145x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Xoc-relief-1968-lines-partially-cleaned-145x150.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Xoc-relief-1968-lines-partially-cleaned-200x206.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Xoc-relief-1968-lines-partially-cleaned-430x444.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Xoc-relief-1968-lines-partially-cleaned.jpg 1442w\" title=\"Xoc relief with the lines partially cleaned of vegetation, 1968.

In 1968 Susanna Ekholm-Miller of the New World Archaeological Foundation undertook to locate the relief in Cordan\u2019s picture. She found a reference in a 1957 survey narrowing down the Xoc site to somewhere between the towns of La Martinica and El Porvenir. She took a puddle jumper to the El Porvenir landing strip and quickly discovered that the locals knew about the site and the relief. An hour-and-a-half horseback ride later, she was standing in front of the rock carving.</p>\n<p>Ekholm-Miller\u2019s expedition was a brief one. Her field director approved a two-day trip, so she had less than two days to clean, photograph and map the site before flying back out. In July of 1972, she got approval for a second, longer trip with a larger team. The elements conspired to make it a much harder and longer slog this time giving them only a day and a half to work on the site. When they arrived, they found to their horror that the relief had been looted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Looted-rockface-1972.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38603\" height=\"146\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Looted-rockface-1972-150x146.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Looted-rockface-1972-150x146.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Looted-rockface-1972-200x195.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Looted-rockface-1972-430x420.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Looted-rockface-1972.jpg 1431w\" title=\"Looted rockface, June 1972.

The carving was no longer there. It had been brutally and completely removed. Apparently it was chiselled off the rock face, probably piece by piece. At least a 30 cm-thick layer of the surface had been removed; a huge pile of fragments of the stone lay at its base, though we could find none that bore any definite carving. We assume that the carved surface is on its way to the antiquities market, undoubtedly in many pieces, as the rock had fissures in it besides being of a limestone which fractures easily.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Relief-with-chalk-outline.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38600\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 114px) 100vw, 114px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Relief-with-chalk-outline-114x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Relief-with-chalk-outline-114x150.jpg 114w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Relief-with-chalk-outline-200x262.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Relief-with-chalk-outline-430x563.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Relief-with-chalk-outline.jpg 1406w\" title=\"Relief with chalk outline to help it stand out in the picture.

The lavatory block is being removed to make way for the Abbey\u2019s first new tower in almost 300 years, a subtle addition nestled behind the buttresses of the chapter house that will provide <a href=\"http://www.westminster-abbey.org/triforium\" target=\"_blank\">new and improved access to the Abbey\u2019s attic</a> (triforium) museum. Underneath Victorian drainage pipes, archaeologists found bones from at least 50 people, many of them disarticulated and stacked like cord wood, others in graves lined with chalk slabs in Anglo-Saxon/early Norman style, plus the remains of a three-year-old child buried in a wooden coffin and one adult man buried in an expensive coffin of Northamptonshire Barnack stone. </p>\n<p>The child is too young to have been pledged to the monastery or to have worked there, and the fact that he or she was buried in a wooden coffin indicates a high social status. The bones aren\u2019t preserved enough to determine sex by visual examination. The adult man is missing his skull. His stone coffin was moved to its current location by work crews under Sir George Gilbert Scott, the Gothic Revivalist architect and Surveyor to the Fabric at Westminster Abbey who restored the 13th century chapter house in the 1860s. Scott had the coffin moved because it would have blocked a new window in the chapter house and had it built into a brick wall. The coffin bears the tell-tale signs of interference from this period. A corner of the lid is broken, likely the result of workers lifting it to have a look inside. The skull was probably removed at that time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edwards-body-buried-in-St-Peters-Bayeaux-Tapestry-1070s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-38580\" height=\"59\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edwards-body-buried-in-St-Peters-Bayeaux-Tapestry-1070s-200x59.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edwards-body-buried-in-St-Peters-Bayeaux-Tapestry-1070s-200x59.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edwards-body-buried-in-St-Peters-Bayeaux-Tapestry-1070s-150x44.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edwards-body-buried-in-St-Peters-Bayeaux-Tapestry-1070s-430x127.jpg 430w\" title=\"Edward's body buried in St Peter's, from the Bayeaux Tapestry, 1070s. \" width=\"200\"/></a>The original Romanesque church that would become Westminster Abbey was built by saint and king Edward the Confessor as part of an expansion of the Benedictine monastery on the site. He dedicated it to Saint Peter the Apostle but it was known as the \u201cwest minster\u201d in contrast to St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral which was London\u2019s minster to the east. St. Peter\u2019s was completed in 1065 only days before Edward\u2019s death. He was buried in front of the high altar. </p>\n<p>It was King Henry III, a highly devout man who took Edward the Confessor as his patron saint, who decided to replace Edward\u2019s church with a new one in the glamorous Gothic style pioneered by Abbot Suger in the Church of Saint-Denis in the mid-12th century. Henry envisioned the soaring new church as a more majestic shrine for Edward\u2019s bones and those of England\u2019s kings and queens. The Romanesque church was demolished in 1245 and construction began. Saint Edward\u2019s remains were translated to the new shrine on October 13th, 1269. By the time Henry died in 1272, the apse and radiating chapels of the eastern end, the north and south transepts and choirs were completed. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Stacked-bones-under-pipe.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-38569\" height=\"120\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Stacked-bones-under-pipe-200x120.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Stacked-bones-under-pipe-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Stacked-bones-under-pipe-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Stacked-bones-under-pipe-430x258.jpg 430w\" title=\"Detail of stacked bones under Victorian pipe.

The highest status individuals, the kings, queens and most senior clergy, would have been buried within the church itself, but the newly found remains were close enough to indicate they probably were those of senior clergy. When Henry demolished Edward the Confessor\u2019s church and began his own massive construction project, the land was dug up, and they were all reburied in a layer under the surface of what was the 13th-century masons\u2019 yard, littered with chips of the stone used to build a platform to take the enormous weight of the new building.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Skull-with-pickaxe-hole.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-38570\" height=\"119\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Skull-with-pickaxe-hole-200x119.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Skull-with-pickaxe-hole-200x119.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Skull-with-pickaxe-hole-150x89.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Skull-with-pickaxe-hole-430x257.jpg 430w\" title=\"Skull with pickaxe hole.

Even with holes the stacked bones are in quite good condition, much better condition than the chalk-lined graves which have been damaged by leaks in the Victorian drainage pipes. Archaeologists hope laboratory analysis of the bones will pinpoint who they were, their profession, age, diet, health and where they were raised.</p>\n<p>Jorgensen says the lavatory block is \u201cbuilt as solidly as a nuclear bunker\u201d making it \u201ca nightmare to demolish.\u201d As the tedious process continues, archaeologists expect to find more bones. As it is, the 50 or so already discovered bring the total number of people known to have been buried in Westminster Abbey to an impressive 3,350. Once the remains have been studied, they will be reburied in the grounds on the church.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Medieval bones found under 1950\u2019s Westminster Abbey lavoratory\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38568\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38568#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-38540\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/38540\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Getty and Armenian Church reach agreement over stolen Bible pages\">Getty and Armenian Church reach agreement over stolen Bible pages</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, September 22nd, 2015</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-1v-1256.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38553\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 107px) 100vw, 107px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-1v-1256-107x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-1v-1256-107x150.jpg 107w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-1v-1256-200x278.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-1v-1256-430x599.jpg 430w\" title=\"Canon Table page from Zeyt'un Gospels, Ms. 59, fol. 1v, 1256.

This Bible is the first signed works of T\u2019oros Roslin, scribe and the greatest Armenian illuminator of the Middle Ages. The pages (there are actually eight of them; the Church didn\u2019t know about the last one when it filed) are canon tables, concordances listing passages in the Gospels that describe the same event.

What makes these pages exceptional is the illumination by T\u2019oros Roslin who decorated each page in a riot of brilliant colors and gold paint.

The Sourenians had connections in the upper echelons of the Ottoman government, so the hope was they wouldn\u2019t be killed or deported and could keep the Gospels safe. They lasted a year before they were deported to Marash in 1916, but they did receive special treatment that allowed them to survive transportation instead of starving to death like so many of their compatriots. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-4-1256.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38550\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 107px) 100vw, 107px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-4-1256-107x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-4-1256-107x150.jpg 107w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-4-1256-200x278.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Canon-Table-Page-Ms.-59-fol.-4-1256-430x599.jpg 430w\" title=\"Canon Table page from Zeyt'un Gospels, Ms. 59, fol. 4, 1256.

Although the Church investigated, it was never able to discover who stole the pages and when. At some point the pages ended up in an anonymous private collection in Watertown, Massachusetts. They were seen in public for the first time since the Genocide when the collector loaned the pages to the Morgan Library for a 1994 exhibition. After that exhibition, the Getty acquired the pages.

I want to thank the Getty for joining in a solution that recognizes the historical suffering of the Armenian people and that will also allow this Armenian treasure to remain in the museum which has cared for it and made it available to the Armenian and larger community in Los Angeles. We are pleased that both sides arrived at an amicable solution,\u201d said Lee Crawford Boyd, the Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck shareholder representing the Western Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America. \u201cThe sacred Canon Tables are now being recognized as having belonged to the Armenian Church.

The necropolis was in use from the 1st century B.C. until the city\u2019s destruction on August 24th, 79 A.D. for cremation burials and tombs in keeping with Roman customs at the time, but <a href=\"http://pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/plans/plan%20hg%20east.htm\" target=\"_blank\">earlier inhumation burials</a> have been found there as well. They\u2019ve been heavily damaged by construction of the Roman city, Vesuvius, looters, rough excavations and Allied bombing in World War II. That makes this find exceptionally rare because the tomb was discovered intact with an articulated skeleton and all of its grave goods. </p>\n<p>The archaeological team from the Jean B\u00e9rard Center of Naples wasn\u2019t even looking for graves, even you might think it was considering it was excavating a necropolis. In fact the Porta Ercolano area was what we today would call mixed use with shops, villas and tombs side by side. Archaeologists were exploring the site of a pottery production complex they\u2019ve been excavating for the past four years as part of a research project focusing on artisanship and the economy of Pompeii. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Archaeologist-points-to-bones.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38526\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Archaeologist-points-to-bones-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Archaeologist-points-to-bones-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Archaeologist-points-to-bones-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Archaeologist-points-to-bones-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Archaeologist examines skeletal remains with grave goods on either side of him.

She was buried with about 10 vases and urns that date to the middle of the 4th century B.C. The skeletal remains haven\u2019t been radiocarbon dated yet, so the style of the vases is what dates the tomb. The burial type is known in other Samnite centers like Paestum, but has only been recorded in Pompeii from 19th century excavations which leave a lot to be desired, to put it mildly. Finding an intact grave, left completely alone and undamaged by thieves or construction or the bomb that exploded feet away in 1943 leaving burn marks on the stone slabs of the cyst, gives archaeologists the opportunity to study Samnite Pompeii in heretofore impossible depth with all the advantages of modern technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt is an exceptional find for Pompeii because it throws light on the pre-Roman city about which we know so very little,\u201d said Massimo Osanna, the archaeological superintendent of Pompeii.

Pompeii was founded around the 7th century B.C. by the Oscans, a central Italic tribe. In the 6th century it was conquered by the Etruscans and in the 5th century by the Samnites. Rome\u2019s influence over Pompeii came at the turn the 3th century B.C. after the Third Samnite War (298-290 B.C.) when the city was forced to accept status as a <em>socium</em>, an associate, of the Roman Republic. The status afforded them political autonomy \u2014 it could retain its ancient Oscan language and govern itself \u2014 but compelled military alliance. </p>\n<p>For two centuries they took it, but when a series of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arausio\" target=\"_blank\">Roman military defeats</a> caused wholesale slaughter of Italian troops and when my namesake, the tribune Marcus Livius Drusus, was assassinated for his efforts in securing Roman citizenship for all of the Italian allied peoples, the Italian socii revolted against Rome in 91 B.C. and Pompeii joined its Italian cousins in the rebellion. Two years later Sulla besieged the city and in 80 B.C. he seeded it with his veterans and made it an official Roman colony. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cyst-tomb.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-38527\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cyst-tomb-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cyst-tomb-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cyst-tomb-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cyst-tomb-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Samnite cyst tomb and environs.

The Samnites tricked the Roman commanders, co-consuls Titus Veturius Calvinus and Spurius Postumius Albinus, into deploying their army to the relief of the city of Lucera which 10 shepherds had told them was under siege by the forces of Samnite general Gaius Pontius. The shepherds were actually Pontius\u2019 men and Lucera was not besieged by anyone. The Romans took a short cut through the Caudine Forks, a mountain pass that could only be accessed by two very narrow gorges. The Samnites cut off the entrance to the second gorge and when the Romans turned around, they found the Samnites had blocked the first gorge too. With unclimbable mountain cliffs on either side, the Roman army was well and truly screwed and everyone knew it. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Lucanian-tomb-fresco-depicting-the-Roman-defeat-at-the-Battle-of-The-Caudine-Forks.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38536\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Lucanian-tomb-fresco-depicting-the-Roman-defeat-at-the-Battle-of-The-Caudine-Forks-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Lucanian-tomb-fresco-depicting-the-Roman-defeat-at-the-Battle-of-The-Caudine-Forks-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Lucanian-tomb-fresco-depicting-the-Roman-defeat-at-the-Battle-of-The-Caudine-Forks-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Lucanian-tomb-fresco-depicting-the-Roman-defeat-at-the-Battle-of-The-Caudine-Forks-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Lucanian tomb fresco depicting the Roman defeat at the Battle of The Caudine Forks\" width=\"150\"/></a>To get anyone out alive, Calvinus and Albinus had to surrender unconditionally and the entire army was forced to pass \u201cunder the yoke,\u201d (each man had to bow and walk under an ox yoke), the ultimate degradation for ancient soldiers. The consuls then signed a peace treaty that basically gave the Samnites everything they wanted and returned to Rome utterly humiliated. They had to hand in their symbols of office and resign. They even offered their persons to the Samnites to do whatever they wanted with, but Gaius Pontius refused because he thought it was a stratagem to get him to violate the terms of the treaty and render it null and void. Which it probably was.</p>\n<p>Excavations are ongoing and archaeologists hope to find other Samnite-era graves around the newly discovered one. Where there\u2019s one tomb, there are often more, but the odds of finding another grave miraculously unharmed by the Allied bomb that fell on this very spot are slim. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Intact 4th c.

One of the reasons for that is that the density of the plaster varies \u2014 the oldest of it dates to the 19th century, plus layers from subsequent restorations \u2014 but it can be as dense as bone. People with our squishy outsides are comparatively easy to scan, but add a thick plaster exoskeleton and it gets tricky. The archaeological team was able to borrow a 16-layer scanner from Philips SpA Healthcare that allowed them to see through the plaster to the bones in great detail. The scanner is superfast, taking only 100 seconds for a full body scan, and is able to block distortions to the images caused by metal elements. It was designed for people with prosthetics or implanted devices. The dead of Pompeii don\u2019t have titanium hips and pacemakers, but metal pieces were added to some of the casts to reinforce the plaster structure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-38668\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast-118x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast-118x150.jpg 118w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast-200x253.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast-430x546.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CAT-scan-child-cast.jpg 1023w\" title=\"CAT scan child from the House of the Golden Bracelet.

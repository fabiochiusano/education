That\u2019s how long you have to stay on a bull for it to count as a \u201cride.\u201d Any less than that is a failure. On the best rides, eight seconds doesn\u2019t feel like long enough; on the worst, it\u2019s an eternity. But to get to that feeling, that adrenaline rush of power and success and terror, you first have to make it out of the gates, and Koal Livingston didn\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d94\" name=\"2d94\">It was an overcast September evening in Fairfax, Virginia, the 22nd stop of the Professional Bull Rider\u2019s (PBR) annual world tour. The world\u2019s top bull riders were gathered in the chutes, taping their hands, spitting dip into Styrofoam cups, adjusting Stetsons. There was a million dollars on the line for the weekend, but Livingston, like all good riders, knew his competition wasn\u2019t in Wranglers. The enemy is always the bull. After slapping his chap-covered legs, Livingston hopped over the railing of the chute where his rival, Outlaw, began to wriggle.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bcbb\" name=\"bcbb\">Livingston was almost ready to go\u200a\u2014\u200avest Velcroed, helmet on, mouthguard in, hand gripped around the rope\u200a\u2014\u200awhen Outlaw started bucking. From where I stood above the chute, I could see him go down and back. Then the spotter lost his grip on Livingston\u2019s protective vest, and all of a sudden the bull bucked forward, catapulting Livingston headfirst into the chute\u2019s metal wall. When the gate opened, the bull bucked out, but Livingston stayed down. The staff rushed to shield his body from the audience\u2019s view, but I could see his limp legs peeking out from the corner of the enclosure. The cowboys nearest him removed their hats as the sports medicine team came out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c34d\" name=\"c34d\">Livingston was out cold for almost a minute before he returned to the bright lights of the stadium and rose to his feet. \u201cI absolutely cannot believe this guy is walkin\u2019 out of this arena,\u201d the announcer said as the crowd applauded. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.pbr.com/en/riders/injury-reports.aspx\" href=\"https://www.pbr.com/en/riders/injury-reports.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">At the Fairfax competition</a> that weekend, 10 of the 35 riders were competing with an injury. Before the event ended, four more would be injured. To make it through a full season of bull riding without an injury would be a miracle, one that almost never happens. Sean Willingham, a veteran of the PBR, told me the next afternoon, \u201cYou gotta be prepared. You\u2019re gonna get hurt. You\u2019re not gonna ever not get hurt.\u201d</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"22a2\" name=\"22a2\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 689px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*yzUEp1lRoe-eezSDNhC4AA.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*yzUEp1lRoe-eezSDNhC4AA.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*yzUEp1lRoe-eezSDNhC4AA.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*yzUEp1lRoe-eezSDNhC4AA.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*yzUEp1lRoe-eezSDNhC4AA.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">A bull waiting in a pen at the Madison County Rodeo in Marshall, North Carolina.</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure\" id=\"67fc\" name=\"67fc\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">F</span>or the past fifteen years, the United States has been caught in an endless conversation about safety in sports, professional and amateur. Though sports are not necessarily more dangerous now than in the past\u200a\u2014\u200ain 1905, at least 13 U.S. college football players died from game injuries before the adoption of the forward pass\u200a\u2014\u200abetter science and health care have made us more aware of how the impacts of contact sports destroy our bodies and, over time, degrade our minds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa41\" name=\"aa41\">Football dominates the discussion of the dangers of sports, but every sport is working to become safer. Baseball players have started wearing a plastic glove to protect their hands when they slide into the base. This season, the NHL began stricter enforcement of the slashing penalty to prevent hand injuries; the league also cycles hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/19/nhl-player-fines-put-good-use/AFCmu81UICfFfcwWGU8LBM/story.html\" href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/19/nhl-player-fines-put-good-use/AFCmu81UICfFfcwWGU8LBM/story.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gathered from suspension penalties</a> each year into an emergency fund for players.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1bbb\" name=\"1bbb\">But amid this concerted national rush to protect athletes, one sport stands out: bull riding. A bull rider is 10 times more likely to be seriously injured than a football player. One reason is obvious: 2,000-pound bulls have zero interest in injury prevention. Being stepped on by a bull can kill a man, and has. Getting hit with a bull\u2019s horn can fracture 33 facial bones, as it did with a rider named Chase Outlaw this past July. And the bulls are only getting stronger.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"03e8\" name=\"03e8\">\u201cThese bulls are bred to buck,\u201d says Justin Cornwell, a stock contractor who brings champion bulls to competitions. \u201cAt this level, these bulls are pros. They\u2019re not here to mess around.\u201d Rodeo bulls have been bred to leap and twirl and duck and jump unpredictably\u2014in other words, to win.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4593\" name=\"4593\">Over the past 22 years, the PBR has introduced protective vests and now requires helmets for riders born after 1994. But even those mild safety requirements do not extend to riders outside of PBR arenas, and bull riders are suffering the consequences, with hundreds of accidents recorded just this year alone. There is no comprehensive data on riders injured, and many riders do not even receive treatment for their injuries.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"9f54\" name=\"9f54\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 689px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\" data-paragraph-count=\"2\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" id=\"5057\" name=\"5057\" style=\"width: 30.84%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 149.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg\" data-height=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg\" data-width=\"1335\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" id=\"1b3b\" name=\"1b3b\" style=\"width: 69.16%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\" style=\"width: 144.592%; left: -44.592%;\">Top: Bull riders walk out for the opening ceremony at the PBR event in Greensboro, North Carolina.

The danger, the potential for the bull to win in the most grotesque way possible, is part of the appeal. Still, even bull riding is beginning to take part in the national campaign to make every sport safer. It\u2019s unclear, though, how safe it can ever really be.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"65fb\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"75e2\" name=\"75e2\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>andy Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon who has worked for the PBR for almost 25 years, stands in the chutes with the riders. He tapes torn knees and wraps swollen forearms in ice, and he is often the only voice of reason who can dissuade an injured rider from going out again. Freeman speaks slowly and precisely, and he looks like a rider in his Wranglers and black cowboy hat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d546\" name=\"d546\">Before each rodeo, Freeman sends an email to members of the PBR staff that lists riders who will be competing with an injury. Throughout the day, he\u2019ll send additional emails to the public relations team with reports from the ring: This rider is being transported to the hospital after being stepped on; that rider suffered a concussion. Freeman advises riders when to sit out a round, but in most cases he cannot stop them from riding. When a cowboy doesn\u2019t ride, he doesn\u2019t get paid. And it\u2019s a hell of a lot of money to miss out on. Rank in the top 10 at a PBR event, and you\u2019ll snag a couple thousand dollars. Kaique Pacheco, the top-ranked bull rider in the PBR, won $34,200 in Fairfax alone. Because of that, a cowboy sits out only if he absolutely has to. On the second night of the PBR finals in Las Vegas in November, 21 of the 35 bull riders were competing with an injury. Only one sat out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b8c8\" name=\"b8c8\">The most common injuries in the PBR are sprains: knee, wrist, rib, hamstring, elbow, shoulder, neck, you name it. \u201cFootball players are tough too, but their sport is nowhere close to what we have to deal with every day,\u201d Sean Willingham says. \u201cOf course, they get hit by 300-pound men. We\u2019re getting hit by a 1,500-pound bull.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0d7a\" name=\"0d7a\">Bull riders are under no illusion that what they do is a particularly good idea. \u201cThis is dangerous and stupid,\u201d Willingham says. \u201cWe hope nobody gets hurt, but it\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd1e\" name=\"dd1e\">Willingham, like every rider I spoke to, has had his share of injuries: He got kicked in the head and fractured his skull in the early 2000s. Another bull rider competing at Fairfax, J.B. Mauney, a two-time world finalist, almost died from a lacerated liver after a bull stepped on him. In 2017, Tanner Bryne came back to competition after a bull stepped on him and broke his collarbone, only to tear his groin muscle clean off the bone. He came back again to try to make the final and broke his wrist and his ankle. Chase Outlaw returned from reconstructive shoulder surgery only to get injured within two months of his return.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cedd\" name=\"cedd\">One of the most dangerous injuries, though, doesn\u2019t create a limp. \u201cMy dad taught me my whole life, you don\u2019t quit until your head hits the ground,\u201d <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.pbr.com/en/news/press-releases/2018/11/matt-triplett-wins-round-1-of-pbr-world-finals.aspx\" href=\"https://www.pbr.com/en/news/press-releases/2018/11/matt-triplett-wins-round-1-of-pbr-world-finals.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Triplett said</a> recently. Just like the NFL, bull riding has a concussion problem. When you fall off or get kicked or horned by the bull, your head stops moving, but your brain keeps moving and slaps the inside of your skull. \u201cIt\u2019s like just shaking an egg,\u201d Justin Cornwell says. Because the injury is internal, it\u2019s easy for a rider to ignore. A six-year study published in 2012 found head injuries to be the third most common injury in bull riding, after injuries to knees and shoulders.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\" data-paragraph-count=\"2\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p\" id=\"b71c\" name=\"b71c\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" id=\"4cf7\" name=\"4cf7\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--figure\" id=\"002a\" name=\"002a\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 689px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Top left: A rider takes a fall at the PBR event in Greensboro, North Carolina.

And safety isn\u2019t the goal of these competitions. There is no formal count of how many rodeos are taking place in this country each year. The PRCA counts <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/rodeo/about-the-prca\" href=\"http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/rodeo/about-the-prca\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 650 rodeos</a> under its umbrella, but rodeos are also organized by groups like the Southern Rodeo Association and the Cowboy\u2019s Professional Rodeo Association. Most rodeos are organized locally and held every Saturday, or every Saturday from early May until late October. At smaller rodeos, the prizes can be in the $100 to $500 range, a far cry from the fat purses of PBR events.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"32bf\" name=\"32bf\">Like the NFL and NHL, the PBR worries about the effect concussions might have on its riders. Particularly, the PBR is worried about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by being hit frequently in the head. CTE is a degenerative brain disease that has come to public attention and concern after the death of Hall of Fame NFL player Mike Webster. Though we know that CTE has an ugly array of symptoms\u2014major depression, memory loss, suicidal thoughts and actions, loss of intelligence, as well as dementia\u2014there is <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/595826/everything-know--dont-know--about-concussions\" href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/595826/everything-know--dont-know--about-concussions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a lot we don\u2019t know</a> about CTE, like how many hits will cause it, how to diagnose it in living patients, and what role genetics play</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c5d\" name=\"1c5d\">In the past, \u201c[Riders] wouldn\u2019t admit that they had their bell rung,\u201d says Jake West, CEO of the Western Sports Foundation, a nonprofit built to support bull riders. Like many other members of the bull-riding community, West notes a specific catalyst that changed the way riders talk about their brains: Ty Pozzobon\u2019s suicide.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7f92\" name=\"7f92\">In the summer of 2016, Ty Pozzobon was the best bull rider in Canada and had recently won $100,000 at a PBR event. Like many bull riders, Pozzobon had been knocked fully unconscious 13 times and experienced more serious blows to the head than he could count. Concussions where riders do not lose consciousness are often more dangerous. Pozzobon committed suicide in January 2017. After his autopsy, he became first confirmed case of CTE in a bull rider.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f944\" name=\"f944\">Almost every pro bull rider <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Medium </em>interviewed knew how many concussions they\u2019d sustained in the PBR, because someone else had tested them and kept track. But they had no record of how many they had at small rodeos, in the PRCA (which also has professional bull riding), and on practice bulls. Most riders told me that they could feel when they had a concussion when they stood up off the ground, but most didn\u2019t write that down. Hell, most of them hopped back on a bull less than an hour later, because there was no one there to order them to stop.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\" data-paragraph-count=\"2\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p\" id=\"15a6\" name=\"15a6\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 149.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg\" data-height=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"1335\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" id=\"0f89\" name=\"0f89\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 149.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg\" data-height=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"1335\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--figure\" id=\"9070\" name=\"9070\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 1546px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 149.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg\" data-height=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1335\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Top left: Drew Worley pulls apart the helmet he used to wear, damaged after a kick in the head, at the Arbuckle Rodeo in Burnsville, North Carolina.

The event took place a 15-minute drive from a regional hospital and a helicopter ride to any intensive care unit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"9c0c\" name=\"9c0c\">That\u2019s where I met 20-year-old Drew Worley, who told me he makes \u201ceasily six figures\u201d a year riding bulls professionally in various tournaments and rodeos. Worley bounces a little on the gate as he tells me he knows exactly how many concussions he\u2019s had. His mother was a nurse who made him keep track. Inside his barn, in a china cabinet full of pictures and trophies and championship buckles, is a piece of wood where he used small stencils to write \u201cCONCUSSIONS.\u201d Underneath, there are 33 tick marks. But that doesn\u2019t mean he takes safety seriously. After his mother stopped coming to his rides, he fell out of the habit of wearing helmets. He pulls the one he used to wear from a bag of gear in the mud, yanking on the thin blue plastic to show me where it cracked in half after being hit.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"c3a6\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"dd0a\" name=\"dd0a\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>he day he got in the chute in Fairfax, Koal Livingston was wearing a helmet made of durable white plastic with cutouts for his ears and a face mask that extended a good three inches in front of his nose. Thanks to that helmet, Livingston was up and walking around the next morning, high-fiving fellow riders on the second day of competition. He was smiling, a cream felt hat perched atop his head and his pupils the size of championship belt buckles. He was still recovering from his concussion of the night before and had been told by Freeman and his medical team that his run in Fairfax was over. He had failed the concussion protocol test.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a13b\" name=\"a13b\">Without Freeman and his team, Livingston says, he would have gotten back on a bull the second day of competition. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in being tough and being dumb, you know? A lot of times we\u2019d make the dumb decision,\u201d he says. Staying off the bull may keep Livingston safe, but it doesn\u2019t make him any money. Following concussion protocol means missing out on a payday.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f97b\" name=\"f97b\">Both the NFL and the PBR implemented concussion protocols in 2009 and have been making tweaks to them since as new data becomes available. In its most recent tweak, the PBR has implemented a computerized concussion assessment that\u2019s also being used by the Eagles and Steelers. (All other NFL teams use pencil-and-paper testing as of 2018.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a83d\" name=\"a83d\">The PBR\u2019s concussion protocol includes baseline testing: Riders are competing against a healthy previous version of themselves. \u201cIf he comes in and says he\u2019s okay but he\u2019s really not,\u201d Freeman says, \u201c[baseline testing] allows us to screen out at least some of the athletes who aren\u2019t necessarily being honest.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dc97\" name=\"dc97\">Before competing, a professional bull rider must first ride a bicycle to put his body into stress. Then he does a test on the computer, like a computer game where he must remember patterns and hit buttons in a specified order. He is graded for accuracy and speed. Then he must balance on a smart board and have his eyes tested for reflexivity. If he comes within 10 percent of his baseline, he gets to go back on the bull.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f9e9\" name=\"f9e9\">On the bull, at any level of competition, there are only two safety requirements that apply to everyone. All riders must wear a glove on their riding hand to prevent rope burn, and all riders must wear a protective vest that helps to dissipate blows to the body and prevent puncture wounds from the bull\u2019s horns. The vests became a requirement in the PBR in 1996 after a bull rider named Lane Frost took a horn to the torso and died of internal bleeding. They\u2019re made of polyurethane foam and ballistic material molded in a single piece, covered with leather and (in the case of the pros) sponsorship logos. Vests are made by many western gear companies and range from $250 to $400. Many riders also wear mouth guards.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"db90\" name=\"db90\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 689px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*K6EYwDQjpEsABPsz1_GGCA.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*K6EYwDQjpEsABPsz1_GGCA.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*K6EYwDQjpEsABPsz1_GGCA.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*K6EYwDQjpEsABPsz1_GGCA.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*K6EYwDQjpEsABPsz1_GGCA.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\" data-paragraph-count=\"2\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" id=\"f50f\" name=\"f50f\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*u3yB_SYPMkRoi7xDnvp2sg.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*u3yB_SYPMkRoi7xDnvp2sg.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*u3yB_SYPMkRoi7xDnvp2sg.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*u3yB_SYPMkRoi7xDnvp2sg.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*u3yB_SYPMkRoi7xDnvp2sg.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" id=\"9415\" name=\"9415\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*KPYWov5qiydGs3l2oa9j3A.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*KPYWov5qiydGs3l2oa9j3A.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*KPYWov5qiydGs3l2oa9j3A.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*KPYWov5qiydGs3l2oa9j3A.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*KPYWov5qiydGs3l2oa9j3A.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\" style=\"width: 200%; left: -100%;\">Top: A bull rider prepares his safety equipment shortly before he rides at the PBR event in Greensboro, North Carolina.

For years, bull riders simply wore lacrosse helmets\u200a\u2014\u200athey had full-head protection like a football helmet but no eye hole for a horn to slip through. Then, around the introduction of the helmet rule, a manufacturer called Bulltrough started selling hockey-style helmets with no neck or ear protection but with titanium face masks. The first full-head helmet designed specifically for bull riding, and the most advanced helmet on the market, is made by a company called <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://100xhelmets.com/\" href=\"https://100xhelmets.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">100X</a>. It\u2019s designed with a two-piece adjustable shell and a titanium alloy face mask and retails for $500. Today, helmets are tested by dropped them at 18 to 20 feet per second onto a semi-anvil.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7d81\" name=\"7d81\">But helmets can\u2019t prevent concussions. \u201cIf they had a helmet that prevented concussions, there wouldn\u2019t be any concussions in the NFL, because they\u2019ve got all the money in the world, and their sport would be less threatened,\u201d Freeman says. Still, the PBR does not force every rider to wear a helmet. At the PBR tour I visited, almost a third of the top 35 ranked bull riders were born before 1994 and did not have one on. The same is true of the other titan of rodeo, the PRCA, which includes bull riding as one of its many events.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"af99\" name=\"af99\">Enforcing safety protocol is difficult, because unlike football players who work for a team governed by the NFL or basketball players who work for team governed by the NBA, bull riders don\u2019t work for the PBR. Rather, they\u2019re individual contractors, like boxers, tennis players, and golfers, who get to choose their matches and what kind of rules to play by. \u201cThe history of the rodeo industry itself has been an independent contracting relationship since the dawn of time. It\u2019s the only structure that works for us,\u201d says Sean Gleason, CEO of the PBR.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ebe\" name=\"9ebe\">The danger, though, is that independent contractors don\u2019t have to disclose injuries. \u201cThere could be a guy that shows up at one of our events that went to [a] rodeo last night and got a concussion, and we have no insider visibility into whether we are allowing someone who shouldn\u2019t be competing to compete,\u201d Gleason says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging relationship, but the reality is that it is the choice of those individuals.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0822\" name=\"0822\">And it also means that, unlike the NFL, the PBR cannot offer its employees comprehensive medical insurance. Though the PBR offers insurance for rides that happen at its own events\u200a\u2014\u200ait has a $300 deductible and pays 80 percent of billed charges up to $20,000\u200a\u2014\u200athe organization can\u2019t be liable for injuries that happen elsewhere.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"bab7\" name=\"bab7\">\u201cIf you have an injury that requires you to be taken to the hospital and admitted to the ICU,\u201d Freeman says, \u201cyou\u2019ve probably run out of benefits before you get to the ICU.\u201d The PBR estimates that 50 percent of its riders have primary coverage, because they are either under 26 and on their parents\u2019 insurance or married to someone with insurance. \u201cWhen you go down to the lower tiers, the percentage of guys without primary insurance policy goes way up,\u201d Freeman estimates around 70 to 80 percent are uninsured.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0634\" name=\"0634\">The PBR has tried to create a workaround to this problem. In 1998, bull rider Jerome Davis was bucked forward out of a spin and broke his neck. It ended his career as a bull rider. In response, a nonprofit foundation was created called the Western Sports Foundation (WSF; previously called the Resistol Relief Resources and the Rider Relief Fund). In its current iteration, the WSF works to provide medical, educational, counseling, and financial resources to western sports athletes at any level. It is a separate organization, though heavily funded by the PBR.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"e532\" name=\"e532\">Several independent organizations besides the WSF are working to help bull riders after injury. The Justin Boots company has an emergency fund for riders injured in western sports. The rider Tanner Byrne founded the Ty Pozzobon Foundation this year, in honor of his friend, to raise concussion awareness and support the well-being of rodeo competitors. All of these initiatives are bandages\u2014they are treatments, not preventions.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body section--last\" name=\"7402\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"4f02\" name=\"4f02\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">At</span> every level of bull riding, a tepid attempt is being made to keep athletes from being mauled, but so far the sport has resisted a full-throated push for safety. \u201cEvery time the gate opens, there is a real chance of death, and these athletes know it,\u201d said an announcer during the CBS broadcast of the world finals.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dff\" name=\"3dff\">The appeal of that danger is lucrative. During the 2018 season, Kaique Pacheco, the number one bull rider, made more than $1.5 million from PBR tournaments alone. The top 25 riders all made six figures in the PBR this year, and 100 other riders made at least five figures. In bull riding, every bull could put you in the hospital. But every bull could also earn you a $50,000 check for one weekend of work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6686\" name=\"6686\">Bull riders aren\u2019t naive to the risks they face\u200a\u2014\u200athey know that the inevitability of injury is what makes their sport so watchable, and they\u2019re willing to take the chance. This isn\u2019t, they say, football. No one is changing their sport just to prevent injuries, not when that sport is built on injury.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"9b72\" name=\"9b72\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 689px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*aZOuULo_1y1h8ayZV6KYew.jpeg\" data-height=\"1335\" data-image-id=\"1*aZOuULo_1y1h8ayZV6KYew.jpeg\" data-width=\"2000\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*aZOuULo_1y1h8ayZV6KYew.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*aZOuULo_1y1h8ayZV6KYew.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*aZOuULo_1y1h8ayZV6KYew.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Riders pray together in the center of the arena before the Arbuckle Rodeo\u00a0begins.</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure\" id=\"6f6d\" name=\"6f6d\">\u201cI\u2019m a huge football fan,\u201d CEO Sean Gleason says, \u201c[But] they\u2019re taking political correctness to such a high level in response to injury issues and concerns. Should they do everything in their power to protect and prevent players against injuries? Absolutely\u2026But at some point, the choice should be, okay, we should shut down football instead of not allowing them to hit each other.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d211\" name=\"d211\">Gleason, like many bull riders I interviewed, pointed to this year\u2019s new NFL safety rules as an example of overprotection. The rule, which is vague, essentially creates strike zone where a player is allowed to be tackled: not near the head, not below the knees, and never with the crown of the head. The rule was meant to reduce head collisions, but players immediately pushed back on it. \u201cThe rule is idiotic and should be dismissed immediately,\u201d San Francisco cornerback <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/RSherman_25/status/1031205147261657088\" href=\"https://twitter.com/RSherman_25/status/1031205147261657088\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Sherman tweeted</a>. \u201cWhen you watch rugby players tackle they are still lead [sic] by their head. Will be flag football soon.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e150\" name=\"e150\">Outrage over the rule forces a foundational question: How do you make a sport safe if danger and risk are programmed into its DNA?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f8c8\" name=\"f8c8\">The riders I spoke with had no interest in making rodeos safer: The sport is dangerous, they are possibly insane for doing it, and they are getting on that next bull and going to ride it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"5c79\" name=\"5c79\">\u201cThis is the sport that you cannot participate in with any sense,\u201d Drew Worley says. \u201cThis is the most dangerous sport. I\u2019m being serious.\u201d Almost every cowboy I interviewed made the same point: People drive cars and bungee jump and wear wingsuits. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re naive or stupid. They know the danger, and they want it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"28be\" name=\"28be\">As every other sport makes rules and adds penalties, bull riders are getting on stronger bulls than ever, knowing they\u2019ll get injured, and hanging on for the ride. Riding a bull can\u2019t be safe, and it won\u2019t be, because no one really wants it to be.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"005e\" name=\"005e\"><strong

seconds. That\u2019s how long you have to stay on a bull for it to count as a \u201cride.\u201d Any less than that is a failure. On the best rides, eight seconds doesn\u2019t feel like long enough; on the worst, it\u2019s an eternity. But to get to that feeling, that adrenaline rush of power and success and terror, you first have to make it out of the gates, and Koal Livingston didn\u2019t.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2d94\\\" id=\\\"2d94\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt was an overcast September evening in Fairfax, Virginia, the 22nd stop of the Professional Bull Rider\u2019s (PBR) annual world tour. The world\u2019s top bull riders were gathered in the chutes, taping their hands, spitting dip into Styrofoam cups, adjusting Stetsons. There was a million dollars on the line for the weekend, but Livingston, like all good riders, knew his competition wasn\u2019t in Wranglers. The enemy is always the bull. After slapping his chap-covered legs, Livingston hopped over the railing of the chute where his rival, Outlaw, began to wriggle.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bcbb\\\" id=\\\"bcbb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eLivingston was almost ready to go\u200a\u2014\u200avest Velcroed, helmet on, mouthguard in, hand gripped around the rope\u200a\u2014\u200awhen Outlaw started bucking. From where I stood above the chute, I could see him go down and back. Then the spotter lost his grip on Livingston\u2019s protective vest, and all of a sudden the bull bucked forward, catapulting Livingston headfirst into the chute\u2019s metal wall. When the gate opened, the bull bucked out, but Livingston stayed down. The staff rushed to shield his body from the audience\u2019s view, but I could see his limp legs peeking out from the corner of the enclosure. The cowboys nearest him removed their hats as the sports medicine team came out.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c34d\\\" id=\\\"c34d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eLivingston was out cold for almost a minute before he returned to the bright lights of the stadium and rose to his feet. \u201cI absolutely cannot believe this guy is walkin\u2019 out of this arena,\u201d the announcer said as the crowd applauded. \\x3ca href=\\\"https://www.pbr.com/en/riders/injury-reports.aspx\\\" data-href=\\\"https://www.pbr.com/en/riders/injury-reports.aspx\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3eAt the Fairfax competition\\x3c/a\\x3e that weekend, 10 of the 35 riders were competing with an injury. Before the event ended, four more would be injured. To make it through a full season of bull riding without an injury would be a miracle, one that almost never happens. Sean Willingham, a veteran of the PBR, told me the next afternoon, \u201cYou gotta be prepared. You\u2019re gonna get hurt.

Baseball players have started wearing a plastic glove to protect their hands when they slide into the base. This season, the NHL began stricter enforcement of the slashing penalty to prevent hand injuries; the league also cycles hundreds of thousands of dollars \\x3ca href=\\\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/19/nhl-player-fines-put-good-use/AFCmu81UICfFfcwWGU8LBM/story.html\\\" data-href=\\\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/19/nhl-player-fines-put-good-use/AFCmu81UICfFfcwWGU8LBM/story.html\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3egathered from suspension penalties\\x3c/a\\x3e each year into an emergency fund for players.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1bbb\\\" id=\\\"1bbb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut amid this concerted national rush to protect athletes, one sport stands out: bull riding. A bull rider is 10 times more likely to be seriously injured than a football player. One reason is obvious: 2,000-pound bulls have zero interest in injury prevention. Being stepped on by a bull can kill a man, and has. Getting hit with a bull\u2019s horn can fracture 33 facial bones, as it did with a rider named Chase Outlaw this past July. And the bulls are only getting stronger.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"03e8\\\" id=\\\"03e8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cThese bulls are bred to buck,\u201d says Justin Cornwell, a stock contractor who brings champion bulls to competitions. \u201cAt this level, these bulls are pros. They\u2019re not here to mess around.\u201d Rodeo bulls have been bred to leap and twirl and duck and jump unpredictably\u2014in other words, to win.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4593\\\" id=\\\"4593\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOver the past 22 years, the PBR has introduced protective vests and now requires helmets for riders born after 1994. But even those mild safety requirements do not extend to riders outside of PBR arenas, and bull riders are suffering the consequences, with hundreds of accidents recorded just this year alone. There is no comprehensive data on riders injured, and many riders do not even receive treatment for their injuries.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"9f54\\\" id=\\\"9f54\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 689px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"2000\\\" data-height=\\\"1335\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*Dc987_4GprRYUwCiG0e6rA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\\\" data-paragraph-count=\\\"2\\\"\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"5057\\\" id=\\\"5057\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\\\" style=\\\"width: 30.84%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 149.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"1335\\\" data-height=\\\"2000\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2PB6lnVIumRz0dmlXUeR-A.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"1b3b\\\" id=\\\"1b3b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\\\" style=\\\"width: 69.16%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"2000\\\" data-height=\\\"1335\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yLTTZ0yuzjG2eOtArOUEhw.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cfigcaption class=\\\"imageCaption\\\" style=\\\"width: 144.592%; left: -44.592%;\\\"\\x3eTop: Bull riders walk out for the opening ceremony at the PBR event in Greensboro, North Carolina.

The danger, the potential for the bull to win in the most grotesque way possible, is part of the appeal. Still, even bull riding is beginning to take part in the national campaign to make every sport safer. It\u2019s unclear, though, how safe it can ever really be.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"65fb\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"75e2\\\" id=\\\"75e2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eT\\x3c/span\\x3eandy Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon who has worked for the PBR for almost 25 years, stands in the chutes with the riders. He tapes torn knees and wraps swollen forearms in ice, and he is often the only voice of reason who can dissuade an injured rider from going out again. Freeman speaks slowly and precisely, and he looks like a rider in his Wranglers and black cowboy hat.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d546\\\" id=\\\"d546\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBefore each rodeo, Freeman sends an email to members of the PBR staff that lists riders who will be competing with an injury. Throughout the day, he\u2019ll send additional emails to the public relations team with reports from the ring: This rider is being transported to the hospital after being stepped on; that rider suffered a concussion. Freeman advises riders when to sit out a round, but in most cases he cannot stop them from riding. When a cowboy doesn\u2019t ride, he doesn\u2019t get paid. And it\u2019s a hell of a lot of money to miss out on. Rank in the top 10 at a PBR event, and you\u2019ll snag a couple thousand dollars. Kaique Pacheco, the top-ranked bull rider in the PBR, won $34,200 in Fairfax alone. Because of that, a cowboy sits out only if he absolutely has to. On the second night of the PBR finals in Las Vegas in November, 21 of the 35 bull riders were competing with an injury. Only one sat out.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b8c8\\\" id=\\\"b8c8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe most common injuries in the PBR are sprains: knee, wrist, rib, hamstring, elbow, shoulder, neck, you name it. \u201cFootball players are tough too, but their sport is nowhere close to what we have to deal with every day,\u201d Sean Willingham says. \u201cOf course, they get hit by 300-pound men.

Another bull rider competing at Fairfax, J.B. Mauney, a two-time world finalist, almost died from a lacerated liver after a bull stepped on him. In 2017, Tanner Bryne came back to competition after a bull stepped on him and broke his collarbone, only to tear his groin muscle clean off the bone. He came back again to try to make the final and broke his wrist and his ankle. Chase Outlaw returned from reconstructive shoulder surgery only to get injured within two months of his return.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"cedd\\\" id=\\\"cedd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOne of the most dangerous injuries, though, doesn\u2019t create a limp. \u201cMy dad taught me my whole life, you don\u2019t quit until your head hits the ground,\u201d \\x3ca href=\\\"https://www.pbr.com/en/news/press-releases/2018/11/matt-triplett-wins-round-1-of-pbr-world-finals.aspx\\\" data-href=\\\"https://www.pbr.com/en/news/press-releases/2018/11/matt-triplett-wins-round-1-of-pbr-world-finals.aspx\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3eMatt Triplett said\\x3c/a\\x3e recently. Just like the NFL, bull riding has a concussion problem. When you fall off or get kicked or horned by the bull, your head stops moving, but your brain keeps moving and slaps the inside of your skull. \u201cIt\u2019s like just shaking an egg,\u201d Justin Cornwell says. Because the injury is internal, it\u2019s easy for a rider to ignore. A six-year study published in 2012 found head injuries to be the third most common injury in bull riding, after injuries to knees and shoulders.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\\\" data-paragraph-count=\\\"2\\\"\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"b71c\\\" id=\\\"b71c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p\\\" style=\\\"width: 50%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"2000\\\" data-height=\\\"1335\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ywyz8-fGLulZf-9u80QWyw.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"4cf7\\\" id=\\\"4cf7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\\\" style=\\\"width: 50%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"2000\\\" data-height=\\\"1335\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*F8FmsGm0Y-JZZOAc-13opg.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"002a\\\" id=\\\"002a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 689px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"2000\\\" data-height=\\\"1335\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*NTCg-xSryVaReW6Bw-DsyA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cfigcaption class=\\\"imageCaption\\\"\\x3eTop left: A rider takes a fall at the PBR event in Greensboro, North Carolina.

The PRCA counts \\x3ca href=\\\"http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/rodeo/about-the-prca\\\" data-href=\\\"http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/rodeo/about-the-prca\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3eat least 650 rodeos\\x3c/a\\x3e under its umbrella, but rodeos are also organized by groups like the Southern Rodeo Association and the Cowboy\u2019s Professional Rodeo Association.

Particularly, the PBR is worried about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by being hit frequently in the head. CTE is a degenerative brain disease that has come to public attention and concern after the death of Hall of Fame NFL player Mike Webster. Though we know that CTE has an ugly array of symptoms\u2014major depression, memory loss, suicidal thoughts and actions, loss of intelligence, as well as dementia\u2014there is \\x3ca href=\\\"https://theweek.com/articles/595826/everything-know--dont-know--about-concussions\\\" data-href=\\\"https://theweek.com/articles/595826/everything-know--dont-know--about-concussions\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3ea lot we don\u2019t know\\x3c/a\\x3e about CTE, like how many hits will cause it, how to diagnose it in living patients, and what role genetics play\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1c5d\\\" id=\\\"1c5d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn the past, \u201c[Riders] wouldn\u2019t admit that they had their bell rung,\u201d says Jake West, CEO of the Western Sports Foundation, a nonprofit built to support bull riders. Like many other members of the bull-riding community, West notes a specific catalyst that changed the way riders talk about their brains: Ty Pozzobon\u2019s suicide.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7f92\\\" id=\\\"7f92\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn the summer of 2016, Ty Pozzobon was the best bull rider in Canada and had recently won $100,000 at a PBR event. Like many bull riders, Pozzobon had been knocked fully unconscious 13 times and experienced more serious blows to the head than he could count. Concussions where riders do not lose consciousness are often more dangerous. Pozzobon committed suicide in January 2017. After his autopsy, he became first confirmed case of CTE in a bull rider.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f944\\\" id=\\\"f944\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAlmost every pro bull rider \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eMedium \\x3c/em\\x3einterviewed knew how many concussions they\u2019d sustained in the PBR, because someone else had tested them and kept track. But they had no record of how many they had at small rodeos, in the PRCA (which also has professional bull riding), and on practice bulls. Most riders told me that they could feel when they had a concussion when they stood up off the ground, but most didn\u2019t write that down. Hell, most of them hopped back on a bull less than an hour later, because there was no one there to order them to stop.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\\\" data-paragraph-count=\\\"2\\\"\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"15a6\\\" id=\\\"15a6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p\\\" style=\\\"width: 50%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 149.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"1335\\\" data-height=\\\"2000\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*P-W39wzNVug5aZuKP1mLoQ.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"0f89\\\" id=\\\"0f89\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\\\" style=\\\"width: 50%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 149.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"1335\\\" data-height=\\\"2000\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Hgz5Y5XWnMBNQ7dSIIMiNQ.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"9070\\\" id=\\\"9070\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 1546px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 149.8%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg\\\" data-width=\\\"1335\\\" data-height=\\\"2000\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*N9OxtTTSXMD_XiUZrGgyNA.jpeg\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cfigcaption class=\\\"imageCaption\\\"\\x3eTop left: Drew Worley pulls apart the helmet he used to wear, damaged after a kick in the head, at the Arbuckle Rodeo in Burnsville, North Carolina.

Worley bounces a little on the gate as he tells me he knows exactly how many concussions he\u2019s had. His mother was a nurse who made him keep track. Inside his barn, in a china cabinet full of pictures and trophies and championship buckles, is a piece of wood where he used small stencils to write \u201cCONCUSSIONS.\u201d Underneath, there are 33 tick marks. But that doesn\u2019t mean he takes safety seriously. After his mother stopped coming to his rides, he fell out of the habit of wearing helmets.

He was smiling, a cream felt hat perched atop his head and his pupils the size of championship belt buckles. He was still recovering from his concussion of the night before and had been told by Freeman and his medical team that his run in Fairfax was over.

Then he does a test on the computer, like a computer game where he must remember patterns and hit buttons in a specified order. He is graded for accuracy and speed. Then he must balance on a smart board and have his eyes tested for reflexivity. If he comes within 10 percent of his baseline, he gets to go back on the bull.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f9e9\\\" id=\\\"f9e9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOn the bull, at any level of competition, there are only two safety requirements that apply to everyone. All riders must wear a glove on their riding hand to prevent rope burn, and all riders must wear a protective vest that helps to dissipate blows to the body and prevent puncture wounds from the bull\u2019s horns. The vests became a requirement in the PBR in 1996 after a bull rider named Lane Frost took a horn to the torso and died of internal bleeding.

For years, bull riders simply wore lacrosse helmets\u200a\u2014\u200athey had full-head protection like a football helmet but no eye hole for a horn to slip through. Then, around the introduction of the helmet rule, a manufacturer called Bulltrough started selling hockey-style helmets with no neck or ear protection but with titanium face masks. The first full-head helmet designed specifically for bull riding, and the most advanced helmet on the market, is made by a company called \\x3ca href=\\\"https://100xhelmets.com/\\\" data-href=\\\"https://100xhelmets.com/\\\" class=\\\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\x3e100X\\x3c/a\\x3e. It\u2019s designed with a two-piece adjustable shell and a titanium alloy face mask and retails for $500. Today, helmets are tested by dropped them at 18 to 20 feet per second onto a semi-anvil.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7d81\\\" id=\\\"7d81\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut helmets can\u2019t prevent concussions. \u201cIf they had a helmet that prevented concussions, there wouldn\u2019t be any concussions in the NFL, because they\u2019ve got all the money in the world, and their sport would be less threatened,\u201d Freeman says. Still, the PBR does not force every rider to wear a helmet. At the PBR tour I visited, almost a third of the top 35 ranked bull riders were born before 1994 and did not have one on. The same is true of the other titan of rodeo, the PRCA, which includes bull riding as one of its many events.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"af99\\\" id=\\\"af99\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eEnforcing safety protocol is difficult, because unlike football players who work for a team governed by the NFL or basketball players who work for team governed by the NBA, bull riders don\u2019t work for the PBR. Rather, they\u2019re individual contractors, like boxers, tennis players, and golfers, who get to choose their matches and what kind of rules to play by. \u201cThe history of the rodeo industry itself has been an independent contracting relationship since the dawn of time. It\u2019s the only structure that works for us,\u201d says Sean Gleason, CEO of the PBR.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9ebe\\\" id=\\\"9ebe\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe danger, though, is that independent contractors don\u2019t have to disclose injuries. \u201cThere could be a guy that shows up at one of our events that went to [a] rodeo last night and got a concussion, and we have no insider visibility into whether we are allowing someone who shouldn\u2019t be competing to compete,\u201d Gleason says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging relationship, but the reality is that it is the choice of those individuals.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0822\\\" id=\\\"0822\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAnd it also means that, unlike the NFL, the PBR cannot offer its employees comprehensive medical insurance. Though the PBR offers insurance for rides that happen at its own events\u200a\u2014\u200ait has a $300 deductible and pays 80 percent of billed charges up to $20,000\u200a\u2014\u200athe organization can\u2019t be liable for injuries that happen elsewhere.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bab7\\\" id=\\\"bab7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cIf you have an injury that requires you to be taken to the hospital and admitted to the ICU,\u201d Freeman says, \u201cyou\u2019ve probably run out of benefits before you get to the ICU.\u201d The PBR estimates that 50 percent of its riders have primary coverage, because they are either under 26 and on their parents\u2019 insurance or married to someone with insurance. \u201cWhen you go down to the lower tiers, the percentage of guys without primary insurance policy goes way up,\u201d Freeman estimates around 70 to 80 percent are uninsured.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0634\\\" id=\\\"0634\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe PBR has tried to create a workaround to this problem. In 1998, bull rider Jerome Davis was bucked forward out of a spin and broke his neck. It ended his career as a bull rider. In response, a nonprofit foundation was created called the Western Sports Foundation (WSF; previously called the Resistol Relief Resources and the Rider Relief Fund). In its current iteration, the WSF works to provide medical, educational, counseling, and financial resources to western sports athletes at any level. It is a separate organization, though heavily funded by the PBR.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e532\\\" id=\\\"e532\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eSeveral independent organizations besides the WSF are working to help bull riders after injury. The Justin Boots company has an emergency fund for riders injured in western sports. The rider Tanner Byrne founded the Ty Pozzobon Foundation this year, in honor of his friend, to raise concussion awareness and support the well-being of rodeo competitors. All of these initiatives are bandages\u2014they are treatments, not preventions.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"7402\\\" class=\\\"section section--body section--last\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4f02\\\" id=\\\"4f02\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eAt\\x3c/span\\x3e every level of bull riding, a tepid attempt is being made to keep athletes from being mauled, but so far the sport has resisted a full-throated push for safety. \u201cEvery time the gate opens, there is a real chance of death, and these athletes know it,\u201d said an announcer during the CBS broadcast of the world finals.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3dff\\\" id=\\\"3dff\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe appeal of that danger is lucrative. During the 2018 season, Kaique Pacheco, the number one bull rider, made more than $1.5 million from PBR tournaments alone. The top 25 riders all made six figures in the PBR this year, and 100 other riders made at least five figures. In bull riding, every bull could put you in the hospital. But every bull could also earn you a $50,000 check for one weekend of work.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6686\\\" id=\\\"6686\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBull riders aren\u2019t naive to the risks they face\u200a\u2014\u200athey know that the inevitability of injury is what makes their sport so watchable, and they\u2019re willing to take the chance.

On the best rides, eight seconds doesn\u2019t feel like long enough; on the worst, it\u2019s an eternity. But to get to that feeling, that adrenaline rush of power and success and terror, you first have to make it out of the gates, and Koal Livingston didn\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d94\" name=\"2d94\">It was an overcast September evening in Fairfax, Virginia, the 22nd stop of the Professional Bull Rider\u2019s (PBR) annual world tour. The world\u2019s top bull riders were gathered in the chutes, taping their hands, spitting dip into Styrofoam cups, adjusting Stetsons. There was a million dollars on the line for the weekend, but Livingston, like all good riders, knew his competition wasn\u2019t in Wranglers. The enemy is always the bull. After slapping his chap-covered legs, Livingston hopped over the railing of the chute where his rival, Outlaw, began to wriggle.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bcbb\" name=\"bcbb\">Livingston was almost ready to go\u200a\u2014\u200avest Velcroed, helmet on, mouthguard in, hand gripped around the rope\u200a\u2014\u200awhen Outlaw started bucking. From where I stood above the chute, I could see him go down and back. Then the spotter lost his grip on Livingston\u2019s protective vest, and all of a sudden the bull bucked forward, catapulting Livingston headfirst into the chute\u2019s metal wall. When the gate opened, the bull bucked out, but Livingston stayed down. The staff rushed to shield his body from the audience\u2019s view, but I could see his limp legs peeking out from the corner of the enclosure. The cowboys nearest him removed their hats as the sports medicine team came out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c34d\" name=\"c34d\">Livingston was out cold for almost a minute before he returned to the bright lights of the stadium and rose to his feet. \u201cI absolutely cannot believe this guy is walkin\u2019 out of this arena,\u201d the announcer said as the crowd applauded. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.pbr.com/en/riders/injury-reports.aspx\" href=\"https://www.pbr.com/en/riders/injury-reports.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">At the Fairfax competition</a> that weekend, 10 of the 35 riders were competing with an injury. Before the event ended, four more would be injured. To make it through a full season of bull riding without an injury would be a miracle, one that almost never happens. Sean Willingham, a veteran of the PBR, told me the next afternoon, \u201cYou gotta be prepared. You\u2019re gonna get hurt.

That\u2019s how long you have to stay on a bull for it to count as a \u201cride.\u201d Any less than that is a failure. On the best rides, eight seconds doesn\u2019t feel like long enough; on the worst, it\u2019s an eternity. But to get to that feeling, that adrenaline rush of power and success and terror, you first have to make it out of the gates, and Koal Livingston didn\u2019t.It was an overcast September evening in Fairfax, Virginia, the 22nd stop of the Professional Bull Rider\u2019s (PBR) annual world tour. The world\u2019s top bull riders were gathered in the chutes, taping their hands, spitting dip into Styrofoam cups, adjusting Stetsons. There was a million dollars on the line for the weekend, but Livingston, like all good riders, knew his competition wasn\u2019t in Wranglers. The enemy is always the bull. After slapping his chap-covered legs, Livingston hopped over the railing of the chute where his rival, Outlaw, began to wriggle.Livingston was almost ready to go\u200a\u2014\u200avest Velcroed, helmet on, mouthguard in, hand gripped around the rope\u200a\u2014\u200awhen Outlaw started bucking. From where I stood above the chute, I could see him go down and back. Then the spotter lost his grip on Livingston\u2019s protective vest, and all of a sudden the bull bucked forward, catapulting Livingston headfirst into the chute\u2019s metal wall. When the gate opened, the bull bucked out, but Livingston stayed down. The staff rushed to shield his body from the audience\u2019s view, but I could see his limp legs peeking out from the corner of the enclosure. The cowboys nearest him removed their hats as the sports medicine team came out.Livingston was out cold for almost a minute before he returned to the bright lights of the stadium and rose to his feet. \u201cI absolutely cannot believe this guy is walkin\u2019 out of this arena,\u201d the announcer said as the crowd applauded. At the Fairfax competition that weekend, 10 of the 35 riders were competing with an injury. Before the event ended, four more would be injured. To make it through a full season of bull riding without an injury would be a miracle, one that almost never happens. Sean Willingham, a veteran of the PBR, told me the next afternoon, \u201cYou gotta be prepared. You\u2019re gonna get hurt.

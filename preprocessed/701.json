Ber\u00e9ny painted <em>Sleeping Lady with a Black Vase</em> at the turn of 1927/1928. The model was his second wife, cellist Eta Breuer who posed for several of her husband\u2019s post-Impressionist works, often <a href=\"http://www.mng.hu/en/collections/allando/178/oldal:2/88\" target=\"_blank\">with her cello</a> even though she had stopped playing professionally when she married Ber\u00e9ny. Barki, a researcher at the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest, is writing a biography of the artist and recognized the painting from the last known record of it: a black and white photograph taken at an exhibition in Hungary in 1928. It was bought at that exhibition by an unknown person, perhaps someone Jewish who fled the country before or during World War II. In the chaos of war and its aftermath, <em>Sleeping Lady with a Black Vase</em> disappeared.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-33647\" height=\"144\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s-200x144.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s-200x144.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s-430x311.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sleeping Lady with Black Vase by R\u00f3bert Ber\u00e9ny, 1927-28\" width=\"200\"/></a>After he beheld the work in living color casually hanging behind Hugh Laurie, Geena Davis and a stylishly attired CGI mouse 90 years after its disappearance, Barki barraged Sony Pictures, Columbia Pictures, cameramen, propmasters, directors, anyone connected with the movie that might have some information about the painting, with emails, but nobody knew where the piece was.

Ber\u00e9ny painted <em>Sleeping Lady with a Black Vase</em> at the turn of 1927/1928. The model was his second wife, cellist Eta Breuer who posed for several of her husband\u2019s post-Impressionist works, often <a href=\"http://www.mng.hu/en/collections/allando/178/oldal:2/88\" target=\"_blank\">with her cello</a> even though she had stopped playing professionally when she married Ber\u00e9ny. Barki, a researcher at the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest, is writing a biography of the artist and recognized the painting from the last known record of it: a black and white photograph taken at an exhibition in Hungary in 1928. It was bought at that exhibition by an unknown person, perhaps someone Jewish who fled the country before or during World War II. In the chaos of war and its aftermath, <em>Sleeping Lady with a Black Vase</em> disappeared.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-33647\" height=\"144\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s-200x144.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s-200x144.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s-150x108.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sleeping-Lady-with-Black-Vase-by-Robert-Bereny-1920s-430x311.jpg 430w\" title=\"Sleeping Lady with Black Vase by R\u00f3bert Ber\u00e9ny, 1927-28\" width=\"200\"/></a>After he beheld the work in living color casually hanging behind Hugh Laurie, Geena Davis and a stylishly attired CGI mouse 90 years after its disappearance, Barki barraged Sony Pictures, Columbia Pictures, cameramen, propmasters, directors, anyone connected with the movie that might have some information about the painting, with emails, but nobody knew where the piece was. It was no longer on Sony\u2019s books because at some point between 1999 and 2002 it had been loaned to the CBS drama <em>Family Law</em> and was removed from the warehouse inventory at that time. </p>\n<p>Two years later, he heard from Lisa S., an assistant set designer on <em>Stuart Little</em>. She had bought the painting for $500 from an antiques store in Pasadena specifically for the movie because she thought its cool elegance was perfectly suited for the Little\u2019s New York City apartment. Lisa S. had tracked it down in another warehouse and purchased it from Sony just because she liked it so much. When she contacted Barki, she had no idea of the history of the painting hanging on her bedroom wall. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gergely-Barki-Bereny-Stuart-Little.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33638\" height=\"127\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gergely-Barki-Bereny-Stuart-Little-200x127.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gergely-Barki-Bereny-Stuart-Little-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gergely-Barki-Bereny-Stuart-Little-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gergely-Barki-Bereny-Stuart-Little-430x275.jpg 430w\" title='Gergely Barki and Stuart Little in front of Bereny \"Sleeping woman with black vase\" at Virag Judit Art Gallery' width=\"200\"/></a>After Barki visited the painting in person and confirmed its identity, Lisa sold it to a private collector. That collector has now been persuaded to sell it in Hungary. It will go up for auction at the <a href=\"http://viragjuditgaleria.hu/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Virag Judit Art Gallery</a> in Budapest on December 13th with a starting price of 110,000 euros ($160,000). Gergely Barki won\u2019t make a dime off of his discovery, but he will have a great story to tell in his biography of the artist.</p>\n<p>R\u00f3bert Ber\u00e9ny\u2019s fame today is centered around his being one of The Eight, a group of artists who introduced the Post-Impressionist avant-garde to Hungary in 1909. He had studied art in Paris starting when he was 17 years old in 1904, exhibiting with the French Fauvists and then incorporating the influence of Cezanne and Matisse into his work with The Eight. The Eight had a profound influence on Hungarian culture, literature and music as well as the visual arts. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/To-Arms-To-Arms-Hungarian-Revolution-propaganda-poster-1918.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-33646\" height=\"131\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/To-Arms-To-Arms-Hungarian-Revolution-propaganda-poster-1918-200x131.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/To-Arms-To-Arms-Hungarian-Revolution-propaganda-poster-1918-200x131.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/To-Arms-To-Arms-Hungarian-Revolution-propaganda-poster-1918-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/To-Arms-To-Arms-Hungarian-Revolution-propaganda-poster-1918-430x282.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/To-Arms-To-Arms-Hungarian-Revolution-propaganda-poster-1918.jpg 1003w\" title='\"To Arms!

Sandby Borg was discovered on the island of \u00d6land off the southeastern coast of Sweden in 2010 when the presence of looting pits alerted archaeologists to the site. A scan with metal detectors found five hoards each containing highly decorated gilded silver brooches, finger rings, silver bell pendants and glass beads with millefiori designs, buried in the corners of five houses in the central block of the fort. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-skeleton.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-31940\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-skeleton-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-skeleton-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-skeleton-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-skeleton-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-skeleton.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Sandby skeleton\" width=\"150\"/></a>The next year, archaeologists from the Kalmar County Museum in Sweden returned to excavate and found human skeletons of men killed by violence. In subsequent digs, more skeletons were discovered for a total of at least 10. This summer a potentially <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31937\" target=\"_blank\">highly significant gold solidus</a> was found in a posthole of House 40. In September of this year, for the first time the remains of a small child aged two to five years were found, an extremely important discovery since it suggests there were families in the fort, not just adults. The child was found in the same house as a middle aged man (50-60 years old) who was found lying prone in the fireplace. He was probably struck by a weapon and fell face-down into the fireplace where he came to a gruesome end.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-borg-drawing.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-31941\" height=\"106\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-borg-drawing-150x106.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-borg-drawing-150x106.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-borg-drawing-200x141.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-borg-drawing-430x304.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sandby-borg-drawing.jpg 1100w\" title=\"Drawing of Sandby fort before its destruction in the 5th century\" width=\"150\"/></a>So far less than 3% of the fort has been excavated. Each year archaeologists have only a few short days to dig test pits and every time they\u2019ve uncovered tantalizing evidence of the horror that befell the residents of Sandby Borg in the 5th century. They don\u2019t have the funding to thoroughly excavate any one part of the ringfort, however, which is not only frustrating for our insatiable historical curiosity, but also potentially dangerous since it leaves precious archaeological context and material culture in danger of interference. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sandbyborg/unveiling-the-sandby-borg-massacre?ref=card\" target=\"_blank\">Enter Kickstarter</a>. The Kalmar County Museum Department of Archaeology has started a campaign to raise 400,000 kronor ($52,000), a modest goal that will allow them to zero in on one area and produce a book about their finds.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we reach our goal with this Kickstarter campaign, we will be able to excavate the remaining 1/3 of the house known as House 40 and produce a richly illustrated book presenting the results in English and Swedish. This is the house where at least six people are lying dead on the floor. Two of them have already been recovered, but the remaining four or more are still there. One main objective of investigating the rest of the house is to recover the skeletons. Furthermore, this particular house has proven to contain numerous potential clues to what actually happened here, and why. The Roman gold coin mentioned above is one example; some exquisite details from weaponry are another. The funding will cover both costs for personnel during fieldwork and post-excavation work and analyses, but also for the production of the book.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You have to donate at the 1,000 kronor level ($134) to get the book. If you have deeper pockets (15,000 kr, or $2,012), you can secure a VIP tour of the site personally guided by lead archaeologist Dr. Helena Victor. If you\u2019re Oprah rich, pledge 50,000 kr ($6,700) and you get to get in the trenches and dig!

About a hundred Gravettian Venuses have been found all over Europe, including 15 examples in southwest France, but this is the first one discovered in the north of France. The last one unearthed in an archeological context in France was found in Tursac, Dordogne, in 1959.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Limestone-Venus-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33611\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 127px) 100vw, 127px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Limestone-Venus-2-127x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Limestone-Venus-2-127x150.jpg 127w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Limestone-Venus-2-200x235.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Limestone-Venus-2-430x505.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Limestone-Venus-2.jpg 1190w\" title=\"Venus of Renancourt\" width=\"127\"/></a>In July of this year, the team was excavating a deposit of eolian silt from the end of the last glacial period (40,000 to 10,000 years ago), expecting to find relatively common Paleolithic remains like flints and animal bones. On the second day of the dig, they found a pile of limestone fragments that didn\u2019t seem like natural chips. That night, they were able to puzzle together the 20 fragments to form an almost complete female statuette about 11 centimeters (4.3 inches) tall. Only the right leg piece is missing. It was carved from a single piece of limestone and archaeologists believe it shattered from the cold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Venus-of-Renancourt.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33613\" height=\"142\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Venus-of-Renancourt-150x142.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Venus-of-Renancourt-150x142.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Venus-of-Renancourt-200x189.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Venus-of-Renancourt-430x407.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Venus-of-Renancourt.jpg 811w\" title=\"Venus of Renancourt profile and front\" width=\"150\"/></a>Typical of the 244 Upper Paleolithic Venuses that have been found from different periods in Europe (the oldest being the 35,000-40,000-year-old <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/31712\" target=\"_blank\">Venus of Schelklingen</a> which is also the oldest known human figurative art), the secondary sex characteristics are unmistakably prominent, while the head and extremities are barely present. The Venus of Renancourt has a simple rounded shape for a head and roughly engraved arms and legs. </p>\n<p>In a space of only nine square meters, archaeologists recovered an abundance of Paleolithic remains along with the Venus, including flint projectile points used for hunting and large blades used as tools like knives and scrapers. Numerous animal bones attest to horse meat having been on the menu regularly. Chalk jewelry \u2014 rounds pierced with a hole \u2014 discovered at the site is very unusual and may be unique to this deposit. The remains indicate this was a hunter\u2019s camp which radiocarbon dating found to be 23,000 years old, the last phase of the Gravettian period.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just the Venuses that are rare discoveries in the north of France; evidence of Upper Paleolithic Cro-Magnon presence is rare because at that time there were still glaciers reaching all the way down to the modern-day Netherlands. This discovery suggests there was a window of warmer temperatures that allowed the Cro-Magnon hunters to travel north over impressively long distances. The Gravettian areas in the southwest of France are 125-185 miles away. That\u2019s a lot of ground to cover on foot during an ice age.</p>\n<p>The Venus of Renancourt will be studied thoroughly for the next few months before going on display at Museum of Picardie in Amiens.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"23,000-year-old limestone Venus found in France\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33610\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33610#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-33556\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33556\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Flint axe with wood handle found at Lolland dig\">Flint axe with wood handle found at Lolland dig</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, November 27th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Flint-axe-5500-years-old.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-33557\" height=\"284\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Flint-axe-5500-years-old-430x284.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Flint-axe-5500-years-old-430x284.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Flint-axe-5500-years-old-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Flint-axe-5500-years-old-200x132.jpg 200w\" title=\"Flint axe with intact wooden handle found in vertical position, 5,500 years old\" width=\"430\"/></a></center><br/>\nThe tally of marvels unearthed at the Fehmarn Belt Link tunnel construction site on the Danish island of Lolland seems to get longer every weeks. We can now add a <a href=\"http://cphpost.dk/news/archaeologists-unearth-ancient-flint-axe-near-roedbyhavn.11756.html\" target=\"_blank\">flint axe with an intact wooden handle</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32774\" target=\"_blank\">flint dagger with the intact bark handle</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33450\" target=\"_blank\">5,000-year-old human footprints</a> around the hazel stick gillnets. The axe is about 5,500 years old, around the same age as the footprints and 2,500 years older than the dagger.</p>\n<p>Only eight complete Stone Age axes with the full wooden handle preserved have been found in Denmark before now. All of those were discovered in peat bogs. This is the first example discovered on the site of a former fjord lagoon. Jammed into the dense clay of the seabed, the axe was covered in layers of sand and soil that kept oxygen away and waterlogged the organic material, keeping it moist and intact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aabne-samlinger.dk/femernforbindelsen/femernforbindelsen/nyheder/2014/20141124_oekse/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum Lolland-Falster</a> archaeologists discovered the axe stuck vertically 30 centimeters (just under a foot) below the sea floor east of the harbour town of R\u00f8dbyhavn. It was not the only artifact found jammed into what was then the seashore in a vertical position. There were numerous wooden candlesticks, two oars, two bows, eight spears and 14 axe shafts. There were also deposits of ceramic objects and animals. In one grouping they found 60 jaws from different animals and two axes made from red deer antlers with fragments of the wooden hilts in the shaft holes. This was the only complete axe with both head and hilt in perfect condition.</p>\n<p>Axes were important tools for Stone Age people, but particularly so around the time when agriculture was introduced to the region. In order to begin planting things, people had to clear the virgin forests that covered the country. The establishment of stationary agricultural communities engendered new social hierarchies and religious rituals. Wetlands were a consistent locus for cultic practices, and burials and sacrificial offerings testify to how important these liminal grounds between water and land were to the people who lived near them.</p>\n<p>The proliferation of vertical objects excavated at R\u00f8dbyhavn are a prime example of a coastal area being used for offerings. These objects, all of them with significant practical uses and value, were planted into the clay as part of a ritual sacrifice. Their deliberate placement and the lack of any utilitarian purpose to the Stone Age people burying their stuff and animal bones in the shallows identifies them as religious deposits. </p>\n<p>Excavations will continue until next summer when construction on the tunnel begins and these precious sites will be bulldozed away. Archaeologists hope what they find in the upcoming months will lend them greater understanding of Stone Age religious practices. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Flint axe with wood handle found at Lolland dig\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33556\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33556#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-33585\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33585\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rare Shakespeare first folio found in French library\">Rare Shakespeare first folio found in French library</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, November 26th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/First-folio-closed.jpg\" targete=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33592\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 114px) 100vw, 114px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/First-folio-closed-114x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/First-folio-closed-114x150.jpg 114w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/First-folio-closed-200x262.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/First-folio-closed-430x565.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/First-folio-closed.jpg 761w\" title=\"Unassuming book in Saint-Omer library proves to be Shakespeare First Folio\" width=\"114\"/></a>One of only 233 known copies of the First Folio edition of Shakespeare\u2019s plays has been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/arts/shakespeare-folio-discovered-in-france-.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">discovered in the library of Saint-Omer</a>, a small town in northern France 30 miles south of Calais.

Printed in 1623, just seven years after Shakespeare\u2019s death, by his friends and fellow actors John Heminges and Henry Condell, the First Folio contains 36 of Shakespeare\u2019s 38 plays, and is the earliest, most reliable extant source for half of them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Romeo-Juliet.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33591\" height=\"84\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Romeo-Juliet-150x84.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Romeo-Juliet-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Romeo-Juliet-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Romeo-Juliet-430x242.jpg 430w\" title='\"Romeo and Juliet\" in Saint-Omer First Folio' width=\"150\"/></a>There are differences between this copy and the 232 other ones known to survive. The printers made corrections and alterations throughout the original print run of around 800, so each First Folio is a unique work. In addition to the printing differences, the Saint-Omer copy is also missing the entire text of <em>Two Gentlemen of Verona</em>; the pages were deliberately torn out. There are also annotations that suggest the volume was used for performances. Some of the words are replaced with more modern language, and a character in Henry IV is changed from \u201chostess\u201d to \u201chost\u201d and from \u201cwench\u201d to \u201cfellow\u201d with utter disregard for iambic pentameter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Measure-for-Measure-end.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33593\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Measure-for-Measure-end-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Measure-for-Measure-end-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Measure-for-Measure-end-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Measure-for-Measure-end-430x286.jpg 430w\" title='\"Measure for Measure\" and \"The Comedy of Errors\" in Saint-Omer First Folio' width=\"150\"/></a>The library has had the book in its stacks for 400 years, thanks to its arrangement with the now-defunct college of Jesuits in Saint-Omer which used the city library\u2019s Heritage Room as its own library. Saint-Omer is a small town now, but in the Middle Ages it was an important city with the fourth greatest library in Western Europe. The Jesuit college was founded in the late 16th century when Catholics were forbidden by law to attend college in English. They could just cross the Channel and get an education in France instead, and Saint-Omer was well attended by English Catholics. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shakespeare-First-Folio.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33586\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shakespeare-First-Folio-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shakespeare-First-Folio-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shakespeare-First-Folio-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Shakespeare-First-Folio-430x288.jpg 430w\" title=\"First page of Saint-Omer First Folio\" width=\"150\"/></a>One particularly intriguing note is the name \u201cNevill\u201d written on the first page of <em>The Tempest</em> (also the first page of the book entire since the title pages are gone). It could be the explanation of how the folio got to Saint-Omer since there is only one other known copy in the whole country. Neville was a name adopted by several members of the <a href=\"http://www.scarisbrickhall.org/scarisbrick-hall/scarisbrick-family/\" target=\"_blank\">Scarisbrick family</a>, a prominent Catholic family of landed gentry with a pedigree stretching back to the 1200s. Edward Scarisbrick (Neville), born in 1639, was educated at the Jesuit college of St. Omer, and, following in the footsteps of others in his family, became a Jesuit in 1660. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nevill.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33594\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nevill-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nevill-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nevill-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nevill-430x286.jpg 430w\" title='\"Nevill\" detail' width=\"150\"/></a>There\u2019s some speculation that the find may be relevant to the question of whether William Shakespeare was a secret Catholic, but I don\u2019t see how. Shakespeare was dead and gone when this book got to Saint-Omer. It could be relevant to how Catholics read and performed his plays in the 17th century; I doubt it goes beyond that.</p>\n<p>First Folios are of course very valuable. One <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5175044.stm\" target=\"_blank\">sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 2006</a> for $5.2 million, but this copy would not be so expensive because of its missing pages.

The contents of the pot were discovered fused together in a large lump of metal. Conservators were able to separate the individual parts of the mass and discovered 107 silver coins, six silver bracelets, a large silver plated fibula (cloak brooch) and some glass beads that were probably on a chain that has now disintegrated. The silver bracelets look the same, but there are small differences between them that indicate they are three matched pairs. </p>\n<p>Restorer Johan van der Helm did such a fine job detangling the rusted lump and cleaning the coins that in the end all 107 coins were readable. They are all silver denarii, a very valuable collection at a time when brass coins were far more common in circulation. The oldest coin dates to the reign of the emperor Nero (54-68 A.D.), the youngest to the reign of Marcus Aurelius about a century later (161-180 A.D.). One extremely rare coin was struck under the reign of Emperor Otho who only ruled three months, from January 15th to April 16th 69 A.D., the second in the turbulent Year of the Four Emperors which came to a close with the ascent of Vespasian. </p>\n<p>This find doubles the number of Roman coins discovered in The Hague, which in the 2nd century was sparsely populated countryside in Rome\u2019s Germania Inferior province. The area that is now The Hague was just south of the estuary of the Rhine, the empire\u2019s western frontier, so there were fortifications here and there but the regional capital was the nearby town of Forum Hadriani, modern day Voorburg, which was the northernmost Roman city in continental Europe. It was abandoned in the wake of Saxon raids in around 270 A.D. </p>\n<p>Earlier this fall, the Rotterdamsebaan excavations <a href=\"http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Mediaeval-key-discovered.htm\" target=\"_blank\">uncovered the remains of two Roman houses</a> and several wells close to where the coins were unearthed. It seems to have been a small farming community. Since the hoard was buried all at once rather than deposited over time as savings, it was either an offering to the gods or the earthly goods of an area resident seeking to protect them from marauders. </p>\n<p>The hoard is now on display at the <a href=\"www.haagshistorischmuseum.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Historical Museum of The Hague</a>. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Roman-treasure-The-Hague.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-33581\" height=\"286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Roman-treasure-The-Hague-430x286.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Roman-treasure-The-Hague-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Roman-treasure-The-Hague-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Roman-treasure-The-Hague-200x133.jpg 200w\" title=\"Roman hoard discovered in The  Hague\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Hoard of Roman silver found in The Hague\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33580\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33580#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-33542\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33542\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Norfolk museum acquires Bronze Age dirk used as doorstop\">Norfolk museum acquires Bronze Age dirk used as doorstop</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, November 24th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>When a farmer turned up a hunk of bent bronze while ploughing a field in East Rudham, Norfolk, 12 years ago, he had no idea he\u2019d found an archaeological treasure.

Dirks meant for actual stabbing are sharp, pointed and can be wielded easily with one hand. This piece was designed for a ritual purpose, which is why it was found folded. Bending a metal object as a symbolic act of destruction before burial was a common practice in the Bronze Age <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/22101\" target=\"_blank\">and later</a>.</p>\n<p>Early Bronze Age metal work was done on a small scale for local usage, much like flint knapping or the production of pottery. The Middle Bronze Age saw the development of more specialized metallurgy. Metalworking became the province of increasingly skilled artisans who would have needed workshops and apprentices and imported raw materials to create more elaborate objects. The ceremonial dirks were prestige pieces, the work of the best artisans money could buy. Owning such a heavy, large metal object intended for no practical use was a symbol of power both temporal and, given their ritual purpose, spiritual.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Beaune-Dirk-1500\u20131350-B.C.-British-Museum-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33577\" height=\"39\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Beaune-Dirk-1500\u20131350-B.C.-British-Museum--e1416968923676-150x39.jpg\" title=\"Beaune Dirk, 1,500\u20131,350 B.C,.

The 14th century bell tower, built on a chalk foundation over subterranean salt deposits that get washed out by the springs that put the Bad in Bad Frankenhausen, has been leaning precipitously since a 1908 landslide. It leans 15 feet eastward of the perpendicular, more than the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>\n<p>The Protestant Church in Central Germany (EKM), owner of the church for most of its life, tried to stabilize it several times over the years, but to no avail. Finally in December of 2011, the EKM <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/13834\" target=\"_blank\">decided to demolish the roofless</a>, structurally unsound church and its leaning tower. The only chance of reprieve was if the city could raise the funds necessary to restore the tower, the EKM would sell the Church of Our Dear Ladies to the city for a token sum of \u20ac1 and chip in the money they had planned to spend on demolition (about \u20ac150,000). </p>\n<p>It was a close call. By a vote of nine votes for, seven against and three abstentions, the Bad Frankenhausen city council agreed to the acquisition of the church. The estimated total cost of restoration was \u20ac1 million. Subtracting the demolition funds, that left the city with \u20ac850,000 to scare up. They put \u20ac50,000 into immediate stabilization work in early 2012, and then went to work trying to secure government funding. Without it, the city would not be able to raise the \u20ac800,000 and Bad Frankenhausen\u2019s most recognizable landmark, symbol of the town just as the Leaning Tower is of Pisa, would have to be demolished for safety reasons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Roofless-church-and-leaning-tower.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-13855\" height=\"129\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Roofless-church-and-leaning-tower-300x194.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Roofless-church-and-leaning-tower-300x194.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Roofless-church-and-leaning-tower-150x97.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Roofless-church-and-leaning-tower.jpg 850w\" title=\"The leaning tower and roofless church\" width=\"200\"/></a>The city applied to the Thuringian Ministry of Construction for state funding, but were rejected. With time running out, Bad Frankenhausen threw a hail mary pass and applied to the <a href=\"http://www.bmub.bund.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pm/artikel/bundesbauministerium-foerdert-herausragende-staedtebau-projekte-mit-50-millionen-euro/?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=103&amp;cHash=aea096a89ab039327b277d62173ed20f\" target=\"_blank\">National Urban Planning Projects</a>, a new \u20ac50 million federal program to support city development projects of \u201cnational visibility, high quality, above-average investment volume or high potential for innovation.\u201d The program received 271 applications, 24 from Thuringia alone, for a total of \u20ac900 million in requested funding. </p>\n<p>A jury of members of parliament, academics and urban planning experts selected 21 applications for project funding. The Bad Frankenhausen tower was one of only two winners from Thuringia. The <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/20141119/town-gets-help-to-save-europes-wonkiest-tower\" target=\"_blank\">stabilization of the tower will now be funded to the tune of \u20ac950,000</a>. Mayor Matthias Strejc was particularly pleased to note the tower was considered a historic landmark of national importance by the federal government because the state government had sent them yet another rejection letter just a few days before they heard their application had been accepted by the National Urban Planning Projects.</p>\n<p>The next step for the tower is research into the movement of the soil underneath it. Three holes will be dug, one 400 meters (437 yards) deep and two 70 meters (77 yards), and sensors inserted into the holes. The sensor readings will be viewable in real time by visitors to the tower\u2019s information pavilion. The data will be submitted in a new report due by December 31st. Structural engineers will use that information to fine tune the stabilization plan which as of now involves building a reinforced concrete core in the basement of the tower and creating a steel corset structure on the outside.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Leaning Tower of Bad Frankenhausen saved\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33540\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33540#respond\">No Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-33522\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33522\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Medal of Honor awarded to Gettysburg hero 151 years later\">Medal of Honor awarded to Gettysburg hero 151 years later</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, November 22nd, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushing-at-West-Point-1861.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33527\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushing-at-West-Point-1861-120x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushing-at-West-Point-1861-120x150.jpg 120w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushing-at-West-Point-1861-200x249.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushing-at-West-Point-1861-430x536.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushing-at-West-Point-1861.jpg 1231w\" title=\"Alonzo Cushing in an 1861 West Point class photo\" width=\"120\"/></a>Union Lieutenant Alonzo Hersford Cushing died at Gettysburg on July 3rd, 1863.

At Chancellorsville Cushing was promoted to commander of Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery of the Army of the Potomac II Corps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushings-Battery-on-the-Gettysburg-battlefield.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33530\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushings-Battery-on-the-Gettysburg-battlefield-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushings-Battery-on-the-Gettysburg-battlefield-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushings-Battery-on-the-Gettysburg-battlefield-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushings-Battery-on-the-Gettysburg-battlefield-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alonzo-Cushings-Battery-on-the-Gettysburg-battlefield.jpg 1536w\" title=\"View of Cushing's Battery A position on the Gettysburg battlefield\" width=\"150\"/></a>He was in command of 126 men and six cannons on July 3rd, 1863, the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg. They were positioned inside a bend in the rock wall, known as the Bloody Angle, on Cemetery Ridge that was the center of the line General Robert E. Lee hoped to break through with a massive 13,000-person infantry attack known as Pickett\u2019s Charge. After being pounded by Confederate artillery, Battery A was all but destroyed. All the officers and most of the soldiers were dead. Only two cannons were still functional. </p>\n<p>Cushing himself had been grievously wounded during the artillery assault. A shell fragment hit him in the shoulder and shrapnel gutted him, tearing through his groin and abdomen. He refused categorically to move to the rear, saying he would \u201cstay right here and fight it out or die in the attempt.\u201d Instead, literally holding his intestines in one hand, Cushing ordered that the two remaining cannons be moved right up to the stone wall to shoot at the three Confederate divisions of infantry advancing in rows a mile wide towards the Angle. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gettysburg-Cyclorama-by-Paul-Dominique-Philippoteaux-1883.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33531\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gettysburg-Cyclorama-by-Paul-Dominique-Philippoteaux-1883-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gettysburg-Cyclorama-by-Paul-Dominique-Philippoteaux-1883-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gettysburg-Cyclorama-by-Paul-Dominique-Philippoteaux-1883-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gettysburg-Cyclorama-by-Paul-Dominique-Philippoteaux-1883-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cushing holding his gut, leaning on the cannon beneath the yellow flag in the Gettysburg Cyclorama, by Paul Dominique Philippoteaux, 1883\" width=\"150\"/></a>Weak and unable to shout, Cushing was bodily supported by 1st Sergeant Frederick F\u00fcger who relayed his orders to his men. He observed the charge through a field glass, and ordered his men to fire double-shotted canister, deadly anti-personnel rounds. He used his own thumb to stop the cannon\u2019s vent, burning his fingers to the bone. With the Confederate infantry less than 100 yards away, he yelled \u201cI will give them one more shot.\u201d A few seconds later a bullet hit Cushing in the mouth, exiting out the back of his skull and killing him. He was 22 years old.</p>\n<p>Cushing had stood his ground for more than an hour and a half after his wounding, inflicting heavy casualties and opening gaps in the Confederate lines that played an important role in the Union\u2019s repelling Pickett\u2019s Charge. He was given a posthumous brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel for his service at the Battle of Gettysburg, but no medal.

First the branch of the military in which the would-be recipient served has to approve the nomination. In Cushing\u2019s case, the U.S. Army approved his nomination in 2010. Then legislation had to be passed by both Houses of Congress to waive the three-year time limit. That took three years. Then the President has to approve the nomination. This August, the White House announced that Alonzo Cushing would be awarded the Medal of Honor.</p>\n<p>The deed was done at a ceremony in the Roosevelt Room of the White House attended by more than two dozen Cushing family members and Margaret Zerwekh.

Alvin Johnson, the school\u2019s director and one of its co-founders, wanted its mission of unfettered inquiry and progressive thought to be reflected in the art and architecture as well. He commissioned Joseph Urban to design a new building in modernist International Style that stood out dramatically from the Greenwich Village town houses on West 12th Street. Benton collaborated with Urban to create murals that will flawlessly fit the walls of the third floor boardroom.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3.-City-Activities-with-Subway.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-33342\" height=\"138\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3.-City-Activities-with-Subway-200x138.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3.-City-Activities-with-Subway-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3.-City-Activities-with-Subway-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3.-City-Activities-with-Subway-430x298.jpg 430w\" title=\"3.

Benton painted these murals, most of which are seven and a half feet high, referring to sketched studies he had made while traveling the country in the 1920s. Fun fact: his student Jackson Pollock posed for several of the figures. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5.-Coal.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-33344\" height=\"174\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5.-Coal-200x174.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5.-Coal-200x174.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5.-Coal-150x130.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5.-Coal-430x374.jpg 430w\" title=\"5.

The critical success of the cycle led directly to commissions for eight other murals, including the <a href=\"http://www.iuauditorium.com/about-us/thomas-hart-benton-murals\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Indiana Murals</em></a> which cemented his mainstream fame and put money in his pocket. His dynamic, fluid, colorful style was a major influence for the WPA artists that soon followed.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7.-Instruments-of-Power.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-33346\" height=\"117\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7.-Instruments-of-Power-200x117.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7.-Instruments-of-Power-200x117.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7.-Instruments-of-Power-150x88.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7.-Instruments-of-Power-430x252.jpg 430w\" title=\"7.

Thomas Hart Benton returned to restore his murals twice, once in 1956, once in 1968. He died in 1975 and seven years later, the school decided to sell the murals to fund its endowment. The plan was not happily received in New York City. If the panels were sold to a dealer or auction, they could be scattered to the four winds. Mayor Edward I. Koch even expressed dismay at the prospect of the mural cycle being split up and/or leaving the city.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9.-Outreaching-Hands.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-33348\" height=\"43\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9.-Outreaching-Hands-200x43.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9.-Outreaching-Hands-200x43.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9.-Outreaching-Hands-150x32.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9.-Outreaching-Hands-430x94.jpg 430w\" title=\"9.

The gallery kept them for two years before selling them to the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (aka AXA) for $3.1 million. AXA agreed to always display <em>America Today</em> to the public and proudly sported the murals in the lobby of its corporate headquarters on Seventh Avenue for years before the company and artwork moved to a new building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. In February of 2012, a building renovation saw the murals moved into storage. </p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mural-installed.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-33503\" height=\"241\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mural-installed-430x241.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mural-installed-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mural-installed-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Mural-installed-200x112.jpg 200w\" title=\"Mural installed in replica boardroom.

The Met was more than happy to accept them. Before they could go on display, however, the museum had to create an appropriate space. <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/thomas-hart-benton-america-today\" target=\"_blank\">As of September 30th, it has</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The keystone of the exhibition\u2014the mural\u2014will be installed in a reconstruction of the 30-by-22-foot boardroom as it existed at the New School in 1931, allowing viewers to experience the mural cycle as Benton conceived it. A highlight of this extraordinary opportunity to view the reconstructed mural in its nearly original setting is the incorporation of elements that were part of the architect Joseph Urban\u2019s modernist aesthetic for the New School building, such as the black and red color scheme he used for the room. Among the mural\u2019s most distinctive features are the aluminum-leaf wooden moldings, which not only frame the mural but also create inventive spatial breaks within each large panel. When the mural was installed at the New School, these moldings echoed the Art Deco details of Urban\u2019s building design. </p></blockquote>\n<p>The exhibition also features Benton\u2019s studies from this travels in the 20s and related works by other artists from the Met\u2019s collection. </p>\n<p><script language=\"JavaScript\" src=\"http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n<p><object class=\"BrightcoveExperience\" data=\"http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?&amp;width=842&amp;height=512&amp;flashID=videoe90faf2e1aac4ec0b3233731ab7577da&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;playerID=961742069001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~%2CAAAA1DWaZpE~%2C54HSdV03Erv5XrLl3BHn-JiRdwAvrghj&amp;isVid=true&amp;isUI=true&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&amp;%40videoPlayer=3765573031001&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;autoStart=&amp;debuggerID=&amp;startTime=1416569885895\" height=\"261\" id=\"videoe90faf2e1aac4ec0b3233731ab7577da\" seamlesstabbing=\"undefined\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"430\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"/><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"/><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\"/><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/></object></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Thomas Hart Benton\u2019s epic America Today murals at the Met\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33339\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33339#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2014/11/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

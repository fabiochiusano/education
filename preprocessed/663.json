only way Ted could get hard and remain so for the duration of sexual intercourse was to pretend that his dick was a knife, and the woman he was fucking was stabbing herself with it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39ff\" name=\"39ff\">It\u2019s not like he was some kind of serial killer. Blood held no erotic charge for him, either in fantasy or in real life. Key to the scenario, moreover, was the fact that the woman was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">choosing </em>to stab herself: The idea was that she wanted him so badly, had been driven so wild with obsessive physical desire for his dick, that she was driven to impale herself on it despite the torment it caused. She was the one taking the active role; he just lay there as she thrashed around on top, doing his best to interpret her groans and facial twitches as signs that she was being crushed in an agonizing vise between pleasure and pain.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b63\" name=\"2b63\">He knew it wasn\u2019t great, this fantasy. Yes, the scene he was imagining was ostensibly consensual, but you couldn\u2019t ignore its underlying aggressive themes. Nor was it reassuring that his reliance on the fantasy had increased as the quality of his relationships had declined. Throughout his twenties, Ted\u2019s breakups had been reasonably painless. None of his affairs had lasted longer than a few months, and the women he dated seemed to believe him when he told them he wasn\u2019t looking for anything serious\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least to believe that the fact he\u2019d said this meant they could not accuse him of wrongdoing when it ultimately proved to be true. Once he reached his thirties, though, this strategy no longer worked. More often than not, he\u2019d have what he thought was a final breakup conversation with a woman, only to have her text him shortly afterward, telling him she missed him, that she still didn\u2019t understand what had happened between them, and that she wanted to talk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8184\" name=\"8184\">Thus, one night in November, two weeks before his 36th birthday, Ted found himself sitting across a table from a crying woman named Angela. Angela was a real estate agent, pretty and polished, with sparkly chandelier earrings and expensively highlighted hair. Like all the women he\u2019d dated over the past several years, Angela was, by any objective measure, way out of his league. She was two inches taller than he was; she owned her own home; she made an amazing fettuccine with clam sauce; and she knew how to give a back rub with essential oils that she\u2019d sworn would change his life, which it had. Ted had broken up with her more than two months earlier, but the subsequent texts and phone calls had become so relentless that he\u2019d agreed to another face-to-face meeting in the hopes of gaining some peace.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d79\" name=\"8d79\">Angela had begun the evening chattering brightly about her vacation plans, her work drama, and her adventures with \u201cthe girls,\u201d performing a happiness so clearly calculated to make him see what he was missing that he writhed with vicarious embarrassment, and then, at the 20-minute mark, she dissolved into tears.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3175\" name=\"3175\">\u201cI just <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">don\u2019t understand</em>,\u201d she cried.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5f6\" name=\"c5f6\">What followed was a hopeless, absurd conversation in which Angela insisted that Ted had feelings for her that he was hiding, while he insisted, as kindly as he could, that he did not. Through sobs, she marshaled her evidence of his affection: the time he\u2019d brought her breakfast in bed; the time he\u2019d said, \u201cI think you\u2019d really like my sister\u201d; the gentleness with which he\u2019d taken care of her dog, Marshmallow, when Marshmallow was sick. The problem, it seemed, was that while he\u2019d told Angela from the beginning that he wasn\u2019t looking for anything serious, at the same time, confusingly, he\u2019d also been nice. When what he ought to have done, apparently, was tell her that she could get her own damn breakfast, inform her it was unlikely that she\u2019d ever meet his sister, and be a jerk to Marshmallow when Marshmallow was puking, so that both Marshmallow and Angela would have known where they stood.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1453\" name=\"1453\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, over and over and over again. Not that it mattered. When he failed to admit that he was secretly in love with her, Angela was going to get angry. She was going to accuse him of being a narcissistic, emotionally stunted man-child. She was going to say, \u201cYou really hurt me,\u201d and, \u201cThe truth is, I feel sorry for you.\u201d She\u2019d announce, \u201cI was falling in <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">love </em>with you,\u201d and he would sit there, abashed, as though the claim damned him, even though it was obvious Angela didn\u2019t love him\u200a\u2014\u200ashe thought he was an emotionally stunted man-child and didn\u2019t even like him all that much. Of course, it was hard to feel entirely self-righteous about all this when the reason he knew what was coming was that this was not the first such conversation he\u2019d had with a woman. It was not even the third. Or the fifth. Or the tenth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ead\" name=\"9ead\">Angela sobbed on, a figure of perfect, abject misery: her reddened eyes, her heaving chest, her mascara-stained face. As he watched her, Ted realized that he couldn\u2019t do it any longer. He couldn\u2019t apologize one more time, could not continue with this ritual of self-abasement. He was going to tell her the truth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1702\" name=\"1702\">The next time Angela stopped for breath, Ted said, \u201cYou know none of this is my fault.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0549\" name=\"0549\">There was a pause.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ce4e\" name=\"ce4e\">\u201c<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Excuse </em>me?\u201d Angela said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1dda\" name=\"1dda\">\u201cI was always honest with you,\u201d Ted said. \u201cAlways. I told you what I wanted from this relationship from the very beginning. You could have trusted me, but instead you decided you knew better than I did what I felt. When I said I wanted something casual, you lied and said you wanted the same thing, and then immediately you started doing everything you could to make it something else. When you didn\u2019t manage to make what we had into a serious relationship\u200a\u2014\u200athe thing you wanted and I didn\u2019t\u200a\u2014\u200ayou got hurt. I see that. But I am not the one who hurt you. You did this, not me. I\u2019m just\u200a\u2014\u200ajust\u200a\u2014\u200athe tool you\u2019re using to hurt yourself!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b7f7\" name=\"b7f7\">Angela let out a little cough, like she\u2019d been punched. \u201cFuck you, Ted,\u201d she said. She pushed back her chair, preparing to storm out of the restaurant, and, as she left, she picked up a glass of ice water and threw it at him\u200a\u2014\u200anot just the water, but the whole, full glass. The glass\u200a\u2014\u200ait was more of a tumbler, really\u200a\u2014\u200acracked against Ted\u2019s forehead and landed in his lap.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\" id=\"ae9c\" name=\"ae9c\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 525px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png\" data-height=\"1200\" data-image-id=\"1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png\" data-width=\"1200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"b313\" name=\"b313\">Ted looked down at the broken tumbler. Well. Maybe he should have expected that. Because who was he kidding? This many crying women couldn\u2019t be wrong about him, no matter how unfair their accusations felt. He reached up and touched his forehead. His fingers came away red. He was bleeding. Awesome. Also, his crotch was really, really cold. In fact, as the ice water soaked through his pants, his dick started to hurt even more than his head did. Maybe there should be a legal limit on how cold restaurant water could be, the way there was a limit on how hot coffee could be at McDonald\u2019s. Maybe his dick would get frostbite and shrivel up and fall off, and then everyone he\u2019d ever dated would come together to throw a party in honor of Angela, the fearless heroine who\u2019d ended his reign of terror over the single women of New York.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"80e5\" name=\"80e5\">Wow, he was bleeding more than he\u2019d originally thought. In fact, so much blood was streaming from his forehead that the water in his crotch was turning pink. People were running over, but sound was coming to him kind of scrambled and he couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying. Probably something along the lines of: You deserved this, asshole. He remembered what he\u2019d said right before Angela had flung the glass at him\u200a\u2014\u200a<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I\u2019m just the tool you\u2019re using to hurt yourself</em>\u200a\u2014\u200aand he wondered if this was related somehow to the dick-stabbing fantasy, but he was bleeding and freezing and possibly concussed, and he didn\u2019t have it in him right then to figure it out.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"15a1\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\" id=\"9423\" name=\"9423\">He hadn\u2019t always been this way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"35fe\" name=\"35fe\">Growing up, Ted was the kind of small, bookish boy female teachers described as \u201csweet.\u201d And he was sweet, at least where women were concerned. He spent his childhood and early adolescence floating through a series of crushes on older, unattainable girls: a cousin, a babysitter, his big sister\u2019s best friend. These crushes were always sparked by some small gift of attention\u200a\u2014\u200aa minor compliment, genuine laughter at one of his jokes, remembering his name\u200a\u2014\u200aand they contained no overt or sublimated aggression at all. Just the opposite: In retrospect, they were remarkably chaste. In a recurring daydream he had about his cousin, for example, he envisioned himself as her husband, puttering around the kitchen as he prepared breakfast. Dressed in an apron, he hummed to himself as he squeezed fresh orange juice into a pitcher, whisked the pancake batter, fried the eggs, and placed a single daisy in a small white vase. He carried the tray upstairs to the bedroom and sat down on the side of the bed, where his cousin was snoozing beneath a hand-stitched quilt. \u201cRise and shine!\u201d he said. His cousin\u2019s eyes fluttered open. She smiled sleepily at him, and as she sat up, the quilt slid down, revealing her bare breasts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf47\" name=\"bf47\">That was it! That was the entire fantasy. And yet he nursed it so long, and with such devoted attention (Should the pancakes have chocolate chips in them? What color should the quilt be? Where should he put the tray so that it would not fall off the bed?), that it imbued his aunt and uncle\u2019s house with a sexual aura that remained palpable to him even as an adult, even though his cousin had long ago become a lesbian and immigrated to the Netherlands and he hadn\u2019t seen her in years.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9f68\" name=\"9f68\">Never, not even in his wildest imaginings, had young Ted allowed himself to believe that his crushes might be reciprocated. He wasn\u2019t stupid. Whatever else he might be, he\u2019d never been that. All he\u2019d ever wanted was for his love to be tolerated, maybe even appreciated: He yearned to be permitted to linger worshipfully around his crushes, lightly bumping up against them every so often, the way a bee might brush against a flower.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"379b\" name=\"379b\">Instead, what transpired was that as soon as Ted fixated on a new crush, he would start to moon over her, gazing at her and smiling like a dope, concocting reasons to touch her hair, her hand. And then, inevitably, the girl would recoil\u200a\u2014\u200abecause for some impenetrable reason, Ted\u2019s affections provoked in their targets a reaction of intense and visceral disgust.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"12d3\" name=\"12d3\">They were not cruel to him, these crushes. Ted was drawn to the kind of dreamy girls to whom open cruelty was anathema. Instead, perhaps understanding that their earlier small attentions had been the doorway through which Ted had entered uninvited, the girls set about locking themselves down. Instituting some universally understood emergency girl protocol, they refused to make eye contact, spoke to him only when necessary, and stood as far across the room as it was possible to get. They barricaded themselves inside fortresses of chill politeness, where they hunkered down and waited for as long as it took for him to go away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ee3\" name=\"1ee3\">God, it was awful. Decades later, remembering those crushes made Ted want to die of shame. Because the worst part was, even after it became obvious that the girls he adored found his attentions excruciating, he still desperately desired to be around them and make them happy. He struggled in the grip of this conundrum, trying to exert self-control in the form of brutal self-punishment (standing naked in front of the mirror, forcing himself to look at his skinny legs, concave chest, small penis: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">She hates you, Ted, face it, all girls hate you, you\u2019re ugly, you\u2019re disgusting, you\u2019re gross</em>) and then losing control and finding himself awake at three in the morning, crying with frustration and typing <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">states where it\u2019s legal to marry your cousin </em>into the internet search bar, playing an endless game of whack-a-mole with his hopes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d25\" name=\"2d25\">The summer before high school, after a particularly humiliating episode with a camp counselor, Ted went for a long solitary walk and considered his future. Fact: He was short and ugly and greasy-haired and no girls would ever like him. Fact: Just knowing that someone as gross as Ted liked them creeped girls out. Conclusion: If he didn\u2019t want to spend his whole life making women miserable, he needed to figure out a way to keep his crushes to himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7fd2\" name=\"7fd2\">So that was what he did.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5611\" name=\"5611\">His freshman year of high school, Ted crafted a new persona: cheerfully asexual, utterly unthreatening, scrubbed clean of any whiffs of need. This Ted was a 60-year-old comic in a 14-year-old\u2019s body: hilarious, self-deprecating, and much too neurotic to ever have actual sex. When pressed, this Ted claimed to have a crush on Cynthia Krazewski, a cheerleader who was so unattainable that he might as well have claimed to have been in love with God Himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"b4c5\" name=\"b4c5\">Thus disguised, Ted was free to befriend the girls he really did like and to channel all his energy into being nice to them without ever hinting that he wanted any more than that. The truth was he <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">didn\u2019t </em>want more, not really. He had no faith in love\u2019s capacity to cause him anything but pain. Far easier, and more pleasant, to be friends with girls: to chat with them, to hear their stories, to drive them places, to tell them jokes that made them giggle, and then to go home and masturbate himself into a frenzy, banishing his desires to the realm of the imagination, where they couldn\u2019t do any harm.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"c51f\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"deef\" name=\"deef\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">By</span> his junior year, all of Ted\u2019s romantic energy had coalesced around a single target: Anna Travis, who not only tolerated him but considered him a friend. This was the magic of his new persona: As long as Ted kept his feelings hidden from them, girls\u200a\u2014\u200asome of them, at least\u200a\u2014\u200aliked him quite a lot.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f18\" name=\"8f18\">Though she was considerably more popular than he was, when it came to love, Anna was as hopeless as Ted. For three weeks in ninth grade, Anna dated Marco, a soccer player who dumped her when he was promoted from the freshman team to junior varsity, and she\u2019d never gotten over it. Years later, Anna still had an insatiable desire to talk about Marco with anyone who would listen, and since everyone else was sick of the topic (and, perhaps, a bit unnerved by how crazy her eyes got when it came up), her sole partner for these conversations was Ted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"536a\" name=\"536a\">Obviously, Ted didn\u2019t exactly <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">want </em>to help Anna spend hours analyzing what it meant that Marco had said, \u201cMiss you, kid,\u201d and punched her in the shoulder when he saw her in the hallway the week before\u2026 but at the same time, he also did. Because telling Anna how stupid Marco was for dumping her and how infinitely superior she was to Marco\u2019s new girlfriend-of-the-week was the closest he\u2019d ever come to confessing how he felt. Plus, watching Anna yearn for Marco provided fuel for Ted\u2019s fantasies in which Anna yearned for him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4437\" name=\"4437\">Fantasy: It\u2019s late at night. Ted\u2019s phone rings. Anna.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"69fa\" name=\"69fa\">\u201cAnna,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is it? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b1ca\" name=\"b1ca\">\u201cI\u2019m outside,\u201d she says. \u201cCan you come down?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0595\" name=\"0595\">Ted puts on his bathrobe and opens the door. Anna is on his stoop, looking miserable: hair messy, shirt askew. \u201cAnna?\u201d Ted says.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b374\" name=\"b374\">Anna flings herself against Ted and starts sobbing. He wraps his arms around her, patting her back as her chest shakes against his. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Anna,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s okay, I promise. Shhhh, shhhh.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0d3b\" name=\"0d3b\">\u201cNo!\u201d she cries. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d and then she tries to kiss him. Her lips brush warmly against his, but then he pulls away. She\u2019s shocked, heartbroken. \u201cPlease,\u201d she says. \u201cPlease, just\u2026\u201d He stands there stiffly, allowing her to slide her tongue into his mouth, and after a moment of hesitation, kisses her back, tenderly, but then, once again, he pulls away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"646a\" name=\"646a\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anna,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I thought we were just friends.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"75dc\" name=\"75dc\">She says, \u201cI know\u200a\u2014\u200aI mean, I tried to keep it that way. But I can\u2019t hide anymore. It\u2019s always been you, this whole time. I know you don\u2019t feel that way about me. I know you love Cynthia. But I just\u2026 if you would just give me a chance. Please. Please.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"101c\" name=\"101c\">And then she\u2019s kissing him again and pushing him toward the bedroom, and he\u2019s trying to resist, saying things like, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship,\u201d but she\u2019s so insistent, she won\u2019t stop begging him, she\u2019s unbuttoning his pants, and sliding on top of him, and putting his hand on her breast. Once they\u2019re both naked, Anna is gazing at him in a way that is both worshipful and anxious, and she says, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d and he sighs heavily and says, \u201cNothing,\u201d and stares off into the distance, and she says, \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about Cynthia, aren\u2019t you?\u201d and he says, \u201cNo,\u201d but they both know that he is. Anna says, \u201cI promise, Ted, if you just give me a chance, I will make you forget about Cynthia,\u201d and then she slides her head down between his legs.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"7a78\" name=\"7a78\">Every so often, Ted wondered if there was a chance Anna might like him as more than a friend. She didn\u2019t like him as much as he liked her, that was obvious, and she was never going to show up at his doorstep sobbing from frustrated passion, but\u2026 <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">maaaaaaaaaaybe</em>? She sat close to him on the couch sometimes, and she was always trying to talk him into asking girls out, which in and of itself was probably not a good sign, but when she did it, she\u2019d say things like, \u201cYou\u2019re a lot cuter than you think you are, Ted,\u201d and, \u201cAny girl would be lucky to go out with a guy like you.\u201d So even though she didn\u2019t <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">like </em>like him, maybe there was some latent potential that he could activate if he only told her how he felt. But there was also a kind of Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle thing going on, whereby any serious attempt to determine the state of the relationship would invariably alter it\u200a\u2014\u200aand because change was scary, and he was 99 percent sure Anna didn\u2019t like him like that and never would, he let things stay the way they were: good old friendly, utterly dishonest Ted.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"22b0\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"72f8\" name=\"72f8\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>nna was a year ahead of him in school, college-bound for Tulane, and the week before she left for New Orleans, she coaxed her parents into throwing her a huge goodbye bash. The party was a performance with an intended audience of one, Marco; an elaborate setting designed to show off Anna at maximum sparkle\u200a\u2014\u200aand sparkle, dazzlingly, she did. She wore a short lace dress with a plunging neckline, and high heels, and lots of eye makeup, and she piled her tawny hair on top of her head. She surrounded herself with a coterie of other beautiful girls, all of them crying and laughing and shouting and posing for pictures and emoting so brightly that the rest of the world went dim.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e3f8\" name=\"e3f8\">Ted lurked around the edge of the party, hating himself. He and Anna had mostly hung out one-on-one, when she was feeling down about Marco and didn\u2019t have the energy to go out. On these occasions, they sat around on the couch and ate pizza and talked. Anna was usually wearing sweatpants. Ted had rarely seen her like this, broadcasting her charisma at full force. He was painfully aware of his natural role at the party\u200a\u2014\u200afawning courtier\u200a\u2014\u200aand he didn\u2019t want to play it. Maybe he\u2019d been deluding himself that he\u2019d kept his feelings hidden all this time, when really he\u2019d been walking around with his dick dangling out of his fly, unknowingly exposed. Maybe everyone in the room was thinking, \u201cOh, there\u2019s Ted. He\u2019s in love with Anna. Isn\u2019t it embarrassing? Isn\u2019t it cute?\u201d Maybe Anna knew too.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d81\" name=\"8d81\">Of course Anna knew.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6025\" name=\"6025\">Ted\u2019s pride bristled inside him, cutting into the soft parts. For the first time, he was angry at Anna, at the way she\u2019d allowed a random distribution of physical resources\u200a\u2014\u200aheight, facial symmetry, soccer-playing ability\u200a\u2014\u200ato determine the outcomes of both their lives. He was smarter than Marco, and kinder than Marco, and had more in common with Anna than Marco, and he knew how to make Anna laugh harder than Marco ever would\u200a\u2014\u200abut none of that mattered, because who he <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">was </em>didn\u2019t matter, to her or to anyone else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d5d\" name=\"4d5d\">The evening dragged on, and as the party started to break up, the remaining guests decided to wander down to the beach. Ted could have gone home, but instead he stayed and sulked. Someone lit a campfire, and Ted sat in the literal shadows as he watched the glow from the flames play across Anna\u2019s face. He felt like something deep inside had broken. He\u2019d asked for nothing; he\u2019d tried to content himself with as little as it was possible to want. Yet here he was, feeling humiliated and small once again.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\" id=\"0c96\" name=\"0c96\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 516px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png\" data-height=\"1200\" data-image-id=\"1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png\" data-width=\"2400\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"b2db\" name=\"b2db\">Anna was roasting a marshmallow, twirling it contemplatively over the coals. She was wearing a boy\u2019s sweatshirt over her short dress, and her bare legs were crusted with sand. The wind shifted, sending a plume of smoke billowing over her. She coughed, and stood, and then she circled the fire and plunked herself down next to Ted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9f7e\" name=\"9f7e\">\u201cGetting hard to breathe over there,\u201d she said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"25ae\" name=\"25ae\">\u201cDid you have fun at your party?\u201d Ted asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8ed0\" name=\"8ed0\">\u201cIt was all right,\u201d Anna said. She sighed, probably because Marco was long gone. He\u2019d only stayed an hour. Looking at Anna, her forlorn expression mirroring his own, Ted felt bad about how angry he\u2019d been only a few minutes before. He unrequitedly loved Anna; Anna unrequitedly loved Marco; Marco probably unrequitedly loved some rando none of them had ever met. The world was pitiless. Nobody had any power over anyone else.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3d13\" name=\"3d13\">He said, \u201cYou look beautiful.

She looked like she might be about to say something more, but instead she put her head on his shoulder, and he put his arm around her. She closed her eyes and settled against him, and when he was pretty sure she was asleep, he let himself kiss her forehead. Her skin tasted like salt and smoke. Maybe I was wrong, Ted thought. Maybe I could be content with this.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"88f1\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\" id=\"7a16\" name=\"7a16\">Unfortunately, he could not.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c44\" name=\"7c44\">Ted had hoped that when Anna left for college, his feelings for her might torment him less, but they didn\u2019t. Indeed, with Anna\u2019s physical presence in his life so diminished, Ted could see with greater clarity the astonishing amount of space she took up in his head. In the morning, as he waited for his alarm to go off, he imagined holding her in his arms and nuzzling her neck; the first thing he did when he got up was check his email to see if she\u2019d sent him a message overnight; all day, he filtered his experience for amusing bits and pieces that he could turn into stories to write to her about. Whenever he was bored or anxious, his brain distracted itself by worrying at the question of whether he could ever make Anna like him, like a dog working the last bits of marrow from a bone. And for hours at night, his bedroom turned into the set of an imaginary porn film starring the two of them, with the occasional movie star or classmate as a walk-on guest. Given how little contact Ted had now with actual Anna, it was like he was in a relationship with an imaginary friend.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ba9\" name=\"3ba9\">Ted would have preferred not to live like this, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do about it. He supposed the answer was to develop a crush on someone else, someone who might like him back. As it happened, that wasn\u2019t as wild a prospect as it might have been a year earlier\u200a\u2014\u200awhile Ted was still short and nerdy, his braces had come off, he\u2019d gotten a decent haircut, and there was this girl he tutored in biology, a sophomore named Rachel, whose crush on him even he wasn\u2019t oblivious enough to overlook.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0c5a\" name=\"0c5a\">Ted wasn\u2019t remotely attracted to Rachel, who was thin and frizzy-haired and abrasive, but he was 17 years old and had never even held hands with a girl, so who was he to keep his standards high? Maybe if he and Rachel hooked up, he\u2019d start to develop feelings for her. Stranger things had happened. Besides, he had to admit that dating Rachel couldn\u2019t <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">hurt </em>his chances with Anna\u200a\u2014\u200aafter all, how many stories had he heard about girls who didn\u2019t realize the love of their lives was standing right in front of them until the moment he fell for someone else?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"335b\" name=\"335b\">So, one afternoon after tutoring, Ted, mumbling, asked Rachel what she was doing that weekend and if she wanted to hang out. As soon as the words escaped his lips, he regretted them, but it was too late. Rachel took charge immediately, acquiring his phone number and giving him her own. She told him what time, precisely, she\u2019d be expecting him to call her, and when he dutifully phoned, she let him know what movie she wanted to see that weekend, what time it was showing, and where they should eat dinner beforehand, and then she gave him directions to her house so he could pick her up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a4d3\" name=\"a4d3\">As they walked out of the theater, she was already making plans for future hangouts, chattering about how much she wanted to try the new Thai place on Seventh, and how they shouldn\u2019t forget to go see that romantic comedy they\u2019d watched the trailer for, and did Ted have any plans for Halloween, because she and her friends were putting together a group costume and he\u2019d be welcome to join.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1e4e\" name=\"1e4e\">Ted was wildly uncomfortable. He wasn\u2019t quite sure who Rachel was on a date with, but it didn\u2019t seem to be him. He\u2019d contributed nothing to the outing; as far as he could tell, she could have brought an inflatable doll with her to the movie and had an equally good time. As he drove her home, he resolved to politely make it clear there would not be a second date. Rachel would hate him for dumping her, obviously, which meant he might need to drop out of the tutoring program, but he figured it\u2019d be worth it to avoid the awkwardness that would otherwise follow. They didn\u2019t have any other activities in common, so if he played his cards right, he might never have to see her again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"43f7\" name=\"43f7\">When they reached Rachel\u2019s house, Ted put the car in park but left it running.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfc5\" name=\"dfc5\">Rachel unbuckled her seat belt. \u201cGood night,\u201d she said, but she didn\u2019t move.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"12b6\" name=\"12b6\">\u201cGood night,\u201d he said, going in for a hug. What, precisely, were his responsibilities here? Did he even <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">have </em>to explicitly break up with her, since they\u2019d only been on the one date? Could he just quit tutoring and hope she got the hint? He was patting Rachel\u2019s back in a way that he hoped signaled <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Please don\u2019t hate me, I\u2019m sorry about what I\u2019m about to do to you</em>, when she took his cheeks between her palms, held his face steady, and kissed him on the mouth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3478\" name=\"3478\">Ted\u2019s first kiss! The shock of it briefly drove all other thoughts from his head. He froze, jaw slack, and Rachel plunged her tongue into his mouth and wriggled it around. Just as his brain caught up with his body and he remembered he was supposed to be kissing her back, she broke away and started covering his lips with light little pecks. \u201cLike this,\u201d she said breathily, and he realized she was taking it on herself to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">teach </em>him how to kiss her, because he obviously didn\u2019t know how. A hammer of shame swung down and flattened him. Dorky, know-it-all Rachel, condescending to teach him how to kiss!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8853\" name=\"8853\">Well, since it was too late not to humiliate himself, he might as well take the opportunity to learn. After a few minutes, he decided that kissing wasn\u2019t that hard, really, although it certainly wasn\u2019t everything it was cracked up to be. Overall, it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant sensation, but there was nothing particularly erotic about it. Rachel\u2019s glasses kept bumping up against the bridge of his nose, and it was weird to see her this close up. She looked like a different person, paler, more\u2026 vague, somehow, like a painting. He tried closing his eyes, but it made him uncomfortable, like someone was going to sneak up behind him and plunge a knife into his back.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d31\" name=\"4d31\">So this was kissing. He had to admit Rachel seemed into it. She kept kind of rolling around and sighing. Would he be enjoying himself more if he were kissing Anna? Frankly, it was hard to ever imagine being turned on by this activity. Two boneless slabs of flesh, flopping around, like a pair of slugs mating in the cavern of your mouth. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Gross</em>, Ted thought. What was wrong with him? Rachel\u2019s breath smelled like popcorn butter: slightly metallic, with a hint of the burnt grease that stuck to the bottom of the machine. Or was that his breath? He could think of no way to tell.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e45a\" name=\"e45a\">Rachel was basically on top of him now, moving her hand in an exploratory way, like maybe she was trying to figure out if he had a boner. Needless to say, he did not have a boner; he actually felt like his dick might have snuck up inside his body to hide. Was the fact that he didn\u2019t have a boner going to hurt Rachel\u2019s feelings? Should he try to fantasize about Anna so that he could get a boner so that Rachel wouldn\u2019t feel bad about the fact that he hadn\u2019t gotten a boner for her? No, that could not be the right course of action. But what did Rachel <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">want</em>? She was full-on straddling him now, grinding her hips against his knee and groaning. Did she want to have sex? Surely not. They were parked outside her parents\u2019 house, and she was only a sophomore, and besides, he was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ted</em>. It was one thing to accept that Rachel might have developed a minor crush on him during biology tutoring, another to think that he\u2019d made her so wildly hot for the D that she was ready to bone him in the front seat of his car.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8882\" name=\"8882\">Still, she really did seem to be absurdly into this. It was almost existentially unsettling, that two people in such close physical proximity could be experiencing the same moment so differently.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cdd1\" name=\"cdd1\">Unless\u2026 she was faking her enthusiasm? Or, if not faking, entirely, then exaggerating. A lot. But why would she do that? Pretend he was turning her on with his clumsy tongue fumblings when he wasn\u2019t?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5349\" name=\"5349\">Oh.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4973\" name=\"4973\">As soon as it occurred to him, he realized the answer was obvious. She knew he was nervous, and she was trying to coax him through it. His ineptitude and discomfort were probably visible from space. She was pretending to enjoy herself so he\u2019d relax and stop being such a bad kisser. She was faking sexual excitement out of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">pity</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c61\" name=\"1c61\">If before he\u2019d felt like his dick had crawled up inside his body, now he felt like a two-ton lead slab had dropped on his crotch from the heavens, paralyzing him for life.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c06\" name=\"2c06\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Kill yourself, Ted</em>, a voice in his head said. Seriously.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3a5b\" name=\"3a5b\">He might have done it, too\u200a\u2014\u200ajust leaped out of the car and pitched himself in front of the nearest oncoming vehicle\u200a\u2014\u200abut then Rachel picked up his hand and pressed it to her breast. He felt the no-thoughts shock again. Rachel\u2019s breasts were small, but her shirt was low-cut, so he was touching a lot of very soft skin. Tentatively, he squeezed, and then he rubbed the spot where he was pretty sure her nipple would be. Holy shit, it <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">was </em>there, and after a second of rubbing, it popped up under his thumb.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4b3b\" name=\"4b3b\">Whoa.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"49f0\" name=\"49f0\">Closing his eyes like he was jumping off a diving board, he plunged his hand under her shirt and bra, and then he didn\u2019t have to worry about the no-boner problem, because the bare nipple he was pinching was the dirtiest, sexiest thing in the world, and it was somehow only dirtier and sexier for being attached to a person he barely knew, whose breath smelled like popcorn and whose transparent parody of arousal was an insult to them both.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dbf7\" name=\"dbf7\">He pinched it again, a little harder. She yelped, but then quickly recovered. \u201cOh, my <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">God</em>, Ted,\u201d she moaned, fakely.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"f54f\" name=\"f54f\">They dated for the next four months.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"611d\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"a63b\" name=\"a63b\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">L</span>ooking back, Ted thought Rachel was the first woman he could truly be said to have treated badly. Yeah, he\u2019d inadvertently creeped out some of his crushes, but he\u2019d been a kid, and he\u2019d wrestled mightily to keep himself under control. And there was probably an argument to be made about the way he\u2019d acted around Anna when they\u2019d been in school together\u200a\u2014\u200athat he should have been honest with her about his feelings instead of skulking around in the friend zone\u200a\u2014\u200abut while he might have been cowardly with Anna, he\u2019d also done his best to be kind. Rachel, though\u2026 if there was a hell, and he ended up in it, he was pretty sure the devil would hold up a picture of Rachel, shake it in his face, and say, \u201cHey, buddy, what was the deal with this one?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d8f2\" name=\"d8f2\">But he didn\u2019t know! He really, truly didn\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"700c\" name=\"700c\">In the four months they were together, he never started liking Rachel any more than he did on their first date. Everything about her bugged him: her stupid hair, her nasal voice, her habit of bossing him around. The thought of people saying, \u201cThere goes Rachel, Ted\u2019s girlfriend!\u201d made him cringe. He saw, in her, all the parts of himself he tried so hard to repress: her sycophantic overtures to people who treated her like shit, her faux-patrician condescension toward the handful of people below her on the popularity ladder, the sarcastic jabs she used to distance herself from all the other losers on her social plane.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"415c\" name=\"415c\">Like him, she was prone to embarrassing bodily mishaps\u200a\u2014\u200aperiod stains, bad breath, sitting in ways that inadvertently exposed her underwear\u200a\u2014\u200abut, unlike him, these episodes didn\u2019t seem to cause her inordinate shame. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">He </em>was the one who felt ashamed: When he caught sight of her in the hallway ahead of him, sauntering on with a rusty patch on the back of her jean skirt, or when Jennifer Roberts fanned the air in disgust after Rachel, who\u2019d been standing much too close, finally turned away. In these moments, Ted didn\u2019t just dislike Rachel: He <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">hated </em>her, more than he\u2019d ever hated anyone else in his life.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ef53\" name=\"ef53\">So why didn\u2019t he break up with her?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5586\" name=\"5586\">At home, alone, Ted knew he did not like Rachel and that he did not want to date her, and so breaking up with her seemed straightforward, the right thing to do. But then they would meet up, and as soon as Rachel saw him, if he hesitated, or pulled away, or signaled with even the tiniest of expressions that something was wrong, then her face would darken. At the first hint of her anger, he would feel an onrush of guilt and cold fear. He\u2019d get swept up in a current of conviction that he was a total garbage asshole jerk, his sins stretching in an unbroken chain back to his original decision to agree to go on even one date with her when he\u2019d been in love with Anna the whole time. Skewered by guilt, he would decide that rather than confront Rachel directly and add to the immeasurable wrongs he\u2019d already done her, it\u2019d be <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">so much better </em>to wait for a more opportune moment, like maybe one where she\u2019d do the breaking up herself. After all, it wasn\u2019t like he was such a prize; surely if he just sat it out, sooner rather than later she\u2019d free herself of this delusion that he was remotely datable and dump him of her own accord. With that in mind, he\u2019d agree to whatever she was suggesting with a sense of profound relief\u200a\u2014\u200aand then it\u2019d be 10 minutes later, or 15, or an hour, and he\u2019d surface and think, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Wait a second, I was going to break up with her. Why are we sitting here in this Olive Garden, eating lunch?</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"51d8\" name=\"51d8\">With Rachel prattling on, that dark cloud of incipient anger nowhere to be seen, the idea that just seconds ago it had felt impossible to end the relationship seemed absurd\u200a\u2014\u200abut it also seemed absurd to break up with her out of nowhere, when he\u2019d just been sitting there acting like everything was fine and saying things like, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go with you to visit your cousin on Sunday.\u201d Because if he tried to break up with Rachel right now, while she was halfway through a breadstick, surely the first thing she\u2019d say would be, \u201cIf you knew you were going to break up with me, why did you literally <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">just </em>agree to go with me to visit my cousin on Sunday?\u201d and he would have no answer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"373d\" name=\"373d\">Well, what if she did, Ted? What. If. She. Did. Couldn\u2019t he have just shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cWhelp, sucks for your cousin, I changed my mind\u201d? No. He could not do that, because that was something that only an asshole would do, and he, Ted, was not an asshole. He was\u2026 a nice guy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3cab\" name=\"3cab\">Yes, okay, everyone agreed that nice guys were the worst, but this was different. To feel incapable of interrupting Rachel in the middle of a meal and dumping her without warning\u200a\u2014\u200athat wasn\u2019t Nice Guy Syndrome, that was just being humane. He\u2019d never empathized with Rachel more than he did in those moments, imagining what it would be like to be innocently eating lunch with a person who had been acting for all the world as though he liked you, who had given you no hint that anything was bothering him at all, when suddenly, out of nowhere, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">wham</em>, it turned out you were completely wrong about him and everything he\u2019d been telling you was a lie.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9298\" name=\"9298\">His whole life, Ted had clung to the idea that he was misunderstood\u200a\u2014\u200athat the girls who\u2019d rejected him were wrong to treat him as though there was something inherently creepy about him. He might not have been the handsomest guy around, but he wasn\u2019t <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">bad</em>. And yet sometimes he\u2019d lie awake at night imagining Rachel telling her story to a tribunal of all the girls who\u2019d ever rejected him, regaling them about his deceptions, the way he\u2019d pretended to like her when he didn\u2019t, the mask of \u201cniceness\u201d he wore when the truth was he was a selfish, lying piece of shit\u200a\u2014\u200aand he saw all those girls, Anna at their center, shocked but not shocked, nodding and agreeing that, yes, of course, they\u2019d known something was wrong with him all along.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8712\" name=\"8712\">And so Anna took on another role in his head: forewoman of a jury that stood ready to convict. The longer the relationship with Rachel went on, the more Ted needed her to return to his imaginary tribunal with a story that vindicated him. He needed his first-ever girlfriend not simply to say, but to believe, that while things might not have worked out between them, he wasn\u2019t creepy or scary or bad; he was, fundamentally, a good guy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe8a\" name=\"fe8a\">To placate this imagined version of Anna, he stayed with Rachel, and he lied. He finished his lunch at the Olive Garden, he went to visit the cousin, and he tried to lay the groundwork for his escape. He did his best to keep his distance from Rachel\u2014not enough to make her angry, just enough to keep the relationship from getting any more serious than it already was. He didn\u2019t call her very often, and he was busy a lot but always apologetic about it. He did exactly what was required of him, but no more. He felt a bit as though he were playing dead, remaining limp and pliable in the hopes that she would eventually lose interest and wander away. \u201cAll right,\u201d the tribunal would say at the end of it. \u201cHe\u2019s not the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">best </em>person. He\u2019s not a saint. But he\u2019s no Marco, manipulating girls just for the hell of it. It could have been worse. He deserves another chance. We find the defendant\u2026 reasonably okay.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f0ee\" name=\"f0ee\">\u201cBut wait,\u201d a voice pipes up, just before the gavel comes down.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4886\" name=\"4886\">\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"81f9\" name=\"81f9\">\u201cJust one thing, though.

Rachel, that squirmy, compelling dynamic. The word predated her. He\u2019d used it when he was a kid to describe certain kinds of comics and cartoons and movies and books where people were \u201cmean\u201d to girls. Wonder Woman was chained to the railroad tracks. On the cover of one of his sister\u2019s Nancy Drew mysteries, Nancy was gagged and tied to a chair.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a71\" name=\"4a71\">Young Ted liked stories where people were \u201cmean\u201d to girls, but that didn\u2019t imply he wanted to <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">do </em>mean things to them. When he imagined himself into these stories, which he only rarely did\u200a\u2014\u200abeing mostly content to watch them play out\u200a\u2014\u200ahe, Ted, was never the one tying girls up. No, he was the one who was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">rescuing </em>them. He untied the ropes and rubbed their wrists to get the circulation flowing, gently undid the gags, stroked their hair as they cried against his chest. To be the villain, the tier-upper, the inflictor of pain? No, no, no, no, no. Meanness had nothing to do with Ted\u2019s love life, or his fantasy life, either. Until Rachel came along.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b60a\" name=\"b60a\">As far as possible, Ted avoided hooking up with Rachel. He rarely touched her affectionately, and he kept his mouth closed when they kissed. Though he recognized that it bothered her, he felt like he was being a good person when he did this: Since he didn\u2019t like her, he had no right to pressure her into doing sex stuff. After all, if he made an effort to hook up and then later broke up with her, she\u2019d be justified in returning to the tribunal and accusing him of using her for sex<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">. </em>By this logic, therefore, the only way he could exculpate himself from guilt was to require Rachel to prod and nag him and push him to be alone with her, to ask him two or three or five times, so that, in the end, no one could claim that it was his fault.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eecb\" name=\"eecb\">Once they were in her bedroom, with her door closed, she\u2019d start kissing him in that way that never ceased to feel fake: those light pecks, those melodramatic sighs. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ugh, Rachel</em>, he would think, as the annoyance he\u2019d been fighting all day pushed to the surface. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Why are you so bossy and pushy and oblivious? Why do you like me? Why can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m not that into you? </em>But she would keep throwing herself at him\u2026 and eventually, surrendering to temptation, he would channel his irritation into a pinch or a bite or even, later, a light slap.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"d64a\" name=\"d64a\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*7kjxYytutijeJMsJHTH7Ig.png\" data-height=\"1200\" data-image-id=\"1*7kjxYytutijeJMsJHTH7Ig.png\" data-width=\"1200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*7kjxYytutijeJMsJHTH7Ig.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7kjxYytutijeJMsJHTH7Ig.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7kjxYytutijeJMsJHTH7Ig.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"463a\" name=\"463a\">She claimed to be into it when he was \u201cmean\u201d to her, and he guessed she must be, if how wet and flushed and wriggly she got meant anything at all. Yet he still felt, gut-deep, that there was a patina of falseness over everything she did, and that in claiming to enjoy what he did to her, she was telling him what she thought he wanted to hear. Part of what it meant to be \u201cmean\u201d to Rachel, therefore, was to scrape away that falseness, to dig under it, to force her to show a true reaction: He wanted to catch that real part of Rachel, but it kept slipping away from him, like an eel dipping under the water, and chasing it drove him up the wall with lust. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I hate you, I hate you</em>, he\u2019d think, pinning her bony wrists above her head and biting the meat of her shoulder and dry-humping her leg until he came.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"225a\" name=\"225a\">\u201cThat was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">amazing</em>,\u201d she\u2019d sigh afterward, cuddling up to him, but he did not, could not, believe her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d58\" name=\"2d58\">Sometimes, he wondered if, more than the hookups themselves, she liked their aftermath, because in those brief periods, he was different with her. He needed her to salve his guilt over what he\u2019d just done so badly that he was vulnerable, open and raw. He\u2019d kiss her and bring her water, and afterward he\u2019d lie beside her and hide his face in her hair. In those moments, he could look at Rachel\u2019s face and see her not as ugly or pretty or good or bad or loved or hated, but just as a person lying next to him, stripped of all the judgment he was continually imposing on her, his obsessive critical analysis of everything she did. What if he <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">could </em>like Rachel? If he liked her, then he wouldn\u2019t be a bad person for dating her. He\u2019d have nothing to atone for. They could be happy. He\u2019d be free. The thought made him feel fantastically light, like some sponge inside him, heavy with poison, had finally been wrung dry.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"afad\" name=\"afad\">It never lasted. As the postcoital bliss began to fade, Anna would manifest beside him like a ghost. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Think about me, think about me</em>, she\u2019d whisper in his ear, and he would. His brain would rev up again, thinking, churning, judging. He\u2019d fucked up by hooking up with Rachel, letting Rachel see him like this, exposed. Now she\u2019d be even more sure that he liked her; now she\u2019d be even more hurt when he dumped her; now he had even more sins against her to expiate; now it would be even harder to get away.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cc6e\" name=\"cc6e\">He\u2019d sit up, pull on his underwear.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2e19\" name=\"2e19\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c6a7\" name=\"c6a7\">\u201cNothing.

The problem was that while an abstract \u201csophomore\u201d could conceivably be a sexy rival to Anna, raising Ted\u2019s status in her eyes, Rachel <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">herself </em>could be nothing but a liability. If Anna asked him follow-up questions he couldn\u2019t avoid, he feared that the discovery that he\u2019d been romantically linked with Rachel Derwin-Finkel might be enough to taint him forever with her loser\u2019s stench.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7439\" name=\"7439\">Rachel, on the other hand, knew <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">all about </em>Anna.

The slightest flicker of discomfort on his face would be immediately met with \u201cTed? Ted? What\u2019s wrong? What are you thinking about? Ted?\u201d Since he was usually thinking about how annoying Rachel was and/or daydreaming about Anna, he had no choice but to lie when this happened; he lied more to Rachel, on a day-to-day basis, than he\u2019d ever lied to anyone in his life. And yet every once in a while, she would interrogate him in a way that sent him spasming, unable to keep himself from revealing a piece of the truth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"beec\" name=\"beec\">For example, he once\u200a\u2014\u200a<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">once</em>\u200a\u2014\u200amentioned Anna to Rachel, but he might as well have tattooed ASK ME ABOUT MY FEELINGS FOR ANNA TRAVIS.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3fbd\" name=\"3fbd\">\u201cGilda Radner was basically an underrated genius,\u201d he said that night in the Blockbuster, as they browsed past a rack featuring <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Best of SNL</em>. \u201cMy friend Anna is a huge fan of hers.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f1f2\" name=\"f1f2\">\u201cYour friend Anna?\u201d Rachel echoed.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0dee\" name=\"0dee\">Ted froze. \u201cYep.\u201d He felt as though he were walking across a lake in winter, and the ice had begun to crackle all around him. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">No sudden movements</em>, he told himself. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">You can still get yourself to safe ground.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9031\" name=\"9031\">\u201cI don\u2019t think I know Anna,\u201d Rachel said.

I want to hear.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fa43\" name=\"fa43\">As Anna began telling him the story of her day (\u201cWell, so, I woke up at four a.m. because fucking Charise had fucking crew\u2026\u201d), Ted stroked his hand slowly down his chest and around his rib cage, imagining it was Anna\u2019s hand, his skin goose-pimpling beneath Anna\u2019s fingers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ce05\" name=\"ce05\">As she talked, he said very little, mostly just sympathetic uh-uhs and oh-nos. Once, when she sounded particularly upset, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and then mouthed silently, \u201csweetheart.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c654\" name=\"c654\">Meanwhile, his hand progressed in slow sensuous circles down his torso, along the waistband of his boxers, and under the elastic band, hesitantly stroking the edge of his pubic hair.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"2f08\" name=\"2f08\">\u201cTell me more about Kathleen,\u201d he said when Anna seemed to be running out of story. Kathleen was Anna\u2019s stepmother. He began playing with his dick\u200a\u2014\u200atapping it with his fingertips, flicking it on the shaft. \u201cDo you think your dad will stand up to her, or will he take her side?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"71ca\" name=\"71ca\">\u201cOh my God, are you <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">kidding</em>?\u201d Anna practically shrieked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"a57e\" name=\"a57e\">\u201cShhhh, shhhh,\u201d Ted hushed her. \u201cCharise has practice in four hours.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c609\" name=\"c609\">\u201cFuck Charise,\u201d Anna whispered. Ted laughed. Anna laughed too. He could practically feel her breath on his face. He squeezed his dick, arcing his back with pleasure, and gritted his teeth to force himself to keep quiet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"7987\" name=\"7987\">\u201cAre you getting sleepy?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e4ba\" name=\"e4ba\">\u201cYes,\u201d Anna said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"cf5e\" name=\"cf5e\">\u201cDo you want to fall asleep together?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3150\" name=\"3150\">\u201cI do\u2026 but you have to get up so early\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"56ea\" name=\"56ea\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep in study hall.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b0bc\" name=\"b0bc\">\u201cYou\u2019re sweet, Ted.

He listened to her breathe in and out as his hand worked steadily beneath the sheets. He felt ashamed of himself, of course, but the warmth of that shame pooled in his crotch, amplifying his pleasure. He came in a torrent, making no sounds other than those that could be explained away as sleepy breathing. Only when he\u2019d calmed himself completely, his pulse and his breath both fully slowed, did he dare to whisper, \u201cAnna, are you asleep?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d5d0\" name=\"d5d0\">He imagined Anna lying awake, eyes wide, staring at the ceiling, her heart full of yearning, but there was only silence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"bff4\" name=\"bff4\">\u201cI love you, Anna,\u201d he whispered, and he hung up the phone.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"b04a\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"d0fb\" name=\"d0fb\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">A</span>nd then it was winter break, and Anna was coming home to visit. Would Ted see her? Of course he would see her. They were practically best friends! They talked every night. She\u2019d said, \u201cYou were always there for me, always.\u201d He would see her, obviously. The only question was when.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f92\" name=\"5f92\">And where.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0fb1\" name=\"0fb1\">And how.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3788\" name=\"3788\">In high school, making plans with Anna had been a process as delicate as surgery, and occasionally as brutal. If he asked her directly to hang out, she\u2019d always smile and say, \u201cSure! Sounds great! Call me tomorrow and we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Only a slight tightness around her mouth and the heaviness of her exhale would suggest that he\u2019d imposed. But inevitably, a conflict would appear at the last minute, or else, when he tried to pin down the details, she\u2019d simply fail to answer the phone. If he called her out on her flakiness, or even made reference to the broken plans, as opposed to pretending they\u2019d never existed in the first place, she\u2019d pull away even further, in a way that made him feel ashamed of himself and needy for pressing her.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c09\" name=\"1c09\">On the other hand, she happily kept him informed about plans she had with other people, providing a steady flow of information about excursions that were about to happen, details of dates or parties that were always <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">this close </em>to coming together. As long as he listened, without complaint, to an endless description of activities that were supposed to happen without him, there was a 30 percent chance, at least, that Anna would change her mind at the last minute, claim to be unable to handle the unbearable burden of whatever her social plans were supposed to be, and decide to hang out with him instead. She\u2019d arrive at his house and collapse in exaggerated relief: \u201cI am <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">so glad </em>we\u2019re doing this. I was <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">so </em>not in the mood for another house party at Maria\u2019s.\u201d As though they were both equally at the mercy of circumstance, similarly oblivious to the power dynamic that governed their \u201cfriendship.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6bc5\" name=\"6bc5\">But surely something had changed between them! Surely she wouldn\u2019t treat him now the way she had then, not after she\u2019d spoken the words aloud: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">You were always there for me, always, but I never appreciated it. I always took you for granted. </em>What could those words be but a confession? And what was a confession if not a promise, or at least a willingness, to change? He loved the way her voice had caught and hitched a little before that second \u201calways.\u201d <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">You were always there for me, always. </em>When they got married, she could include them in her wedding vows: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">You were always there for me, always.

She still hadn\u2019t confided in him about Marco; the other day, Rachel\u2019s obnoxious friend Shelly had announced, out of the blue, that she\u2019d heard that Marco Hernandez had an actual <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">restraining order </em>out against Anna that required her to stay 500 feet away from him at all times. This was obviously an idiotic rumor of the type that was Shelly\u2019s specialty, but he still wished Anna would do something to reassure him\u200a\u2014\u200aideally burst into tears and say, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">You were always there for me, always</em>, and plead with him to forgive her for all her years of neglect\u200a\u2014\u200abut he\u2019d have settled for even a hint that she intended to make an active effort to meet up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"17e7\" name=\"17e7\">Instead, the conversation took a sharp and unsettling turn.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b9bc\" name=\"b9bc\">\u201cActually,\u201d Anna said. \u201cI was talking to Missy Johansson, you know her? And <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">she </em>told <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">me </em>you were dating somebody! Rachel Derwin-Finkel? And I was like, no way, that\u2019s not possible. But she insisted that it was!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d5ce\" name=\"d5ce\">\u201cHahahahahahahaha!\u201d Ted said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2fc5\" name=\"2fc5\">And then, when Anna\u2019s silence indicated that cackling like a madman was an insufficient response, he added, \u201cUm.

There was something deeply wrong, almost violating, about having Anna talk to him about Rachel; it was like having his parents walk in on him having sex.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"669e\" name=\"669e\">\u201cMaybe all three of us can hang out when I\u2019m there! I\u2019d like to see Rachel again. It\u2019s been way too long.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"9eed\" name=\"9eed\">\u201cUm, sure.

We used to have playdates, like, constantly. We don\u2019t know each other that well anymore, \u2019cause we went in different directions, socially, in school, but Rachel\u2019s a really good kid. Mostly what I remember about Rachel is that she was super into horses when we were little. And My Little Ponies and stuff. Remember?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b50\" name=\"5b50\">Clever, Anna. Very clever. What <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">actually </em>happened was that a rumor had spread around school that Rachel Derwin-Finkel masturbated with My Little Ponies. It was one of those rumors that no one really believed, not really<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">, </em>but that they passed along enthusiastically nonetheless. Ted himself had argued passionately with the other boys at his lunch table about whether that was even possible (Did she just stick it in there, or\u2026?), and then, when the controversy threatened to die down, he\u2019d willfully revived it, because the Rachel scandal had taken the focus off the previous scandal roiling the third grade, which was the question of whether or not he, Ted, had been caught by the music teacher pooping in the instrument closet during the spring recital, WHICH OF COURSE HE HAD NOT.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"56d3\" name=\"56d3\">What did Anna know about what it was like to have a rumor like that spread about you, that overpowering and helpless shame? He wished he could believe Anna was jealous, but he didn\u2019t; she was just marking her territory, like a dog peeing on a patch of grass. Did he even exist in her mind as a living, breathing, thinking person? He spent so much time trying to figure out what she was thinking, but what kind of a consciousness did she imagine lived behind the mask of his face?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9c65\" name=\"9c65\">For the first time, Ted imagined fucking Anna the way he (almost) fucked Rachel: cruelly, without concern for her comfort, fully acknowledging that as much as he loved her, he also hated her. In his fantasy, Anna was underneath him, his hand was around her throat, and, oh shit, there was Rachel: They were in a three-way. Rachel was naked, on her hands and knees, and Ted was grabbing Anna by the hair and forcing her \u2014</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd72\" name=\"bd72\">Making her \u2014</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a8f5\" name=\"a8f5\">They were both \u2014</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"303f\" name=\"303f\">\u201cDid you hear what I said, Ted?\u201d Anna asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"b0f2\" name=\"b0f2\">\u201cNo\u200a\u2014\u200asorry\u200a\u2014\u200alisten, I, uh, I\u2019ve got to go!\u201d</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"cb02\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"5787\" name=\"5787\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">On</span> Anna\u2019s fourth day in New Jersey, Ted was in Rachel\u2019s bedroom, dressing himself after another round of not-quite-copulation, when Rachel asked him what he wanted to do for New Year\u2019s Eve.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b10b\" name=\"b10b\">\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ted said as he pulled on a sock. \u201cI think I might just stay home.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"90df\" name=\"90df\">\u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cEllen is having a thing, and I told her we\u2019d go.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0f28\" name=\"0f28\">\u201cWhat?

What had happened was that Anna had complained to him at length the previous night about the painful obligation she was under to go to Cynthia Krazewski\u2019s party, despite the fact that it was the absolute last thing she\u2019d ever want to do, and thus Ted had inferred there was a strong likelihood that if he should happen to be home alone on New Year\u2019s, he would get a last-minute phone call from Anna, and the two of them would wind up spending New Year\u2019s together, most of which they would pass watching <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">SNL </em>in Ted\u2019s basement, but then at midnight, they\u2019d switch to network television to watch the ball drop, and he\u2019d \u201cdiscover\u201d a bottle of chilled champagne in his fridge, and after they\u2019d toasted each other, he\u2019d turn to her with a wry, amused smile on his face and say, \u201cI know this is silly, but we might as well!\u201d and she\u2019d giggle and say, \u201cI guess so!\u201d and so he\u2019d kiss her in an almost-friendly way, on the lips but closed-mouthed, and then he\u2019d pause as he was pulling away and wait, and she would wait, and then <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">she\u2019d </em>go in for the kiss, and then they\u2019d be making out for real, grappling on the couch and then on the floor, and when he took her shirt off, he\u2019d pull it up but then kind of twist it around her arms so they were pinned above her head, which was a trick he\u2019d recently discovered with Rachel, and Anna would make this kind of sexy, surprised Oh face with her mouth, and she\u2019d be panting underneath him and they\u2019d fuck and he\u2019d make her come so hard that afterward they would be together for the rest of their lives.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2cd7\" name=\"2cd7\">It was a <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">foolproof plan</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"57c0\" name=\"57c0\">Oh, wait. No, it wasn\u2019t.

Clad in only her underwear, her tiny tits shaking, she did a hideous little dance, a mocking-Ted dance.

Unable to turn his head either left or right, he stared directly up into a blinding fluorescent light and wondered if he was dying. That\u2019s ridiculous, he told himself. I am absolutely not dying. A lady threw a glass of water at me; it\u2019s a minor injury; it\u2019s absurd to think a person could die because of that. Immediately, he imagined Rachel saying scornfully, \u201cPeople die of head injuries <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">all the time</em>, Ted.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6b7f\" name=\"6b7f\">Ted thought, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I am probably not dying, but I am scared and alone and I don\u2019t like this.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"e7dc\" name=\"e7dc\">\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he shouted, through a dry, cracked throat. \u201cCould someone please tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8d90\" name=\"8d90\">No one responded to his plea, but eventually some blurry shadow-creatures came swimming toward him. They asked him questions in a nonsense language, and he answered in an equally unintelligible garble, and he was rewarded by a prickle in his arm, followed by a flooding ease of bliss.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"582c\" name=\"582c\">As the drugs took hold, Ted\u2019s memories began to entwine with a strange yet perversely lovely hallucination. In this hallucination, the tumbler Angela flung at his head had not bounced off his skull but shattered instead. One piece of glass had become lodged in his forehead, and he could see that piece of glass in the center of his vision, rising like a tower, impaling him, pinning him down, refracting a shimmering circle of rainbows in the light. Through the glass, he could see himself reflected in all his miserable glory.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf33\" name=\"cf33\">There he was.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a87\" name=\"4a87\">There he <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"4ca0\" name=\"4ca0\">Trenton, New Jersey, on the last day of 1998.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"4016\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"a69a\" name=\"a69a\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">T</span>ed and Rachel are standing on Cynthia Krazewski\u2019s front porch. Rachel has prepared herself as though for battle. She is clad in a skintight black dress and shiny high heels, her hair sprayed and bound in a tight French twist.

She is in the corner, talking to Ryan Creighton. She\u2019s wearing a dowdy smock dress over leggings, and she\u2019s dyed her hair an unbecoming shade of red. In contrast to Rachel, Anna looks a little\u2026 bland? She looks like what Ted knows her to be: tired, overwhelmed, and sad. Ted thinks, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Is it possible that Rachel is hotter than Anna? Or that they\u2019re both equally hot?</em> His world trembles on its foundations, but then Ted sees Anna put her hand on Ryan Creighton\u2019s biceps and laugh flirtatiously, and once again she body-slams his heart.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6a79\" name=\"6a79\">Rachel sees Ted looking at Anna looking at Ryan Creighton. She stiffens and grips Ted\u2019s hand until it hurts.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cedb\" name=\"cedb\">Realizing she\u2019s being watched, Anna takes Ryan Creighton\u2019s arm and leads him over to Rachel and Ted. There is a bunch of superficial hugging and some <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Oh my God it\u2019s been so long</em>s.

Anna disappears from sight. Ted tries to go after her, but Rachel holds his wrist in a firm and brutal grip. Rumor filters back to them that Marco Hernandez was at the party briefly but left when he found out that Anna was there. There is more talk about the restraining order, and whether it\u2019s real or not, and how that would even work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"199a\" name=\"199a\">Midnight comes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"54b4\" name=\"54b4\">Ted kisses Rachel with tongue and squeezes her ass. In doing so, he discovers that it is possible to enjoy something and yet not care about it in the slightest. He finds this sensation\u200a\u2014\u200afeeling pleasure, and simultaneously feeling detached from the pleasure\u200a\u2014\u200ato be, itself, quite pleasurable. He wonders if he has miraculously become a Buddhist, or suffered a psychotic break.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9c1a\" name=\"9c1a\">When Ted finally withdraws his tongue from Rachel\u2019s throat, he sees that Anna is watching them. Anna looks upset. Rachel sees Anna watching them, and kisses Ted again, in triumph. Ted once more feels like a patch of peed-on grass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5bc3\" name=\"5bc3\">Anna disappears, but when Rachel leaves to go to the bathroom, she returns.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"8611\" name=\"8611\">\u201cTed, can I talk to you?\u201d she asks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"98eb\" name=\"98eb\">\u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"f827\" name=\"f827\">\u201cIn <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">private</em>.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"719a\" name=\"719a\">She leads him outside, onto the porch. It\u2019s freezing, sleeting a little, but he\u2019s wrapped in enough drunken warmth that he doesn\u2019t really mind it. Anna lights a cigarette. She exhales a gray wave of smoke and scratches at her thighs. It\u2019s news to Ted she smokes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"3b9e\" name=\"3b9e\">\u201cI can\u2019t believe you,\u201d she says at last. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"69bf\" name=\"69bf\">\u201cDid what?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"dbb8\" name=\"dbb8\">\u201cMade out with your girlfriend like that.

To the surprise of both parties involved, Ted has difficulty maintaining an erection. The reason for this, though he would never, ever confess it, is the look on Anna\u2019s face. She just seems so dutiful. She looks like she is taking medicine, or eating vegetables. She looks like she is thinking, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Whelp, my life sucks so bad I guess I might as well have sex with Ted.</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8c71\" name=\"8c71\">No, that\u2019s not fair.

The way Anna wanted Marco, and he wanted Anna, and Rachel (or so it seems, in retrospect) wanted him.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"870c\" name=\"870c\">In the absence of this painful wanting, Ted has trouble getting hard.

Stop slapping yourself! </em>Only in this case, it\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Stop impaling yourself on my dick!</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f146\" name=\"f146\">The women he dates all turn on him eventually, of course. The more they feel like they\u2019ve compromised themselves by being with him, the more passionately they pursue him when he launches his retreat. He becomes an instrument of pure self-punishment: What is wrong with me, that even <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">this fucking loser </em>won\u2019t give me what I want? They identify all sorts of problems in him that he needs them to fix: he isn\u2019t \u201cin touch with his emotions,\u201d or he\u2019s \u201cafraid of commitment,\u201d but they never question the basic premise, that somewhere deep down, underneath it all, he wants to be with them. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Of course you have feelings for me</em>, Angela might as well have been saying, right before she threw the glass at him. <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Admit it, dammit!</em></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"df41\" name=\"df41\">I\u2019m <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">me</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"5fde\" name=\"5fde\">And you\u2019re <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ted</em>.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"section section--body\" name=\"f97d\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"/></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\" id=\"b922\" name=\"b922\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\">In</span> 2018, Ted is Facebook friends with both Anna and Rachel, though he hasn\u2019t seen either of them in years. Rachel is married, a pediatrician, and the mother of four kids; Anna lives in Seattle as a single mom. She seems to be doing okay, now, but for a while she was going through a rough time; Ted suspects she may be in some kind of recovery program. She posts inspirational quotations that strike him as beneath her: \u201cI can\u2019t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination,\u201d and \u201cIt is in the darkest moments that we must try to see the light.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"75b5\" name=\"75b5\">He thinks of Anna, now, as he\u2019s lying on the gurney. In fact, he sees her. She\u2019s coming at him through the rainbows, accompanied by a chorus of voices, a fluttering of wings.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0a9a\" name=\"0a9a\">What time is it? What day is it? What year? Here is Anna, but she\u2019s not alone. She\u2019s with all the women of the tribunal. They\u2019re here, at his bedside, whispering about him, observing him closely, judging him the way they always have. They\u2019re fighting, disagreeing about something, and he senses there is a misunderstanding at the center of all of it, some base confusion. He could clear it up, if only there weren\u2019t a giant shard of glass embedded in his forehead, if only this blood would stop pooling in his mouth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c531\" name=\"c531\">I didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone, he tries to tell them. I just wanted to be seen, and loved for who I am. The problem was, it was all a misunderstanding. I pretended to be a good person, and then I couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2582\" name=\"2582\">No, wait. Let me start over. That\u2019s not right.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"10b4\" name=\"10b4\">All I\u2019ve ever wanted is to be loved. Well, to be worshipped. To be desired, madly and painfully, to the exclusion of all else. Is that so wrong?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f807\" name=\"f807\">No, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">wait</em>. That\u2019s definitely not what I meant.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8338\" name=\"8338\">Listen, listen. I can explain. There\u2019s a bad Ted underneath the good Ted, yes, but then, under <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that</em>, there\u2019s a Ted who\u2019s good for real. But no one ever sees him; his whole life, no one ever has. Underneath it all, I\u2019m just that kid who wanted nothing more than to be loved and didn\u2019t know how to make it happen, even though I tried and tried and tried.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f0b0\" name=\"f0b0\">Hey, stop. Put me down. I\u2019m trying to tell you something. Would you stop talking and listen to me, please? The light up there is hurting my eyes. But also, maybe turn on the air conditioning? It\u2019d be a little easier to explain myself if it wasn\u2019t so damn warm. Are those flames licking at my feet?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb40\" name=\"fb40\">I\u2019m trying to say something important.

Blood held no erotic charge for him, either in fantasy or in real life. Key to the scenario, moreover, was the fact that the woman was \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3echoosing \\x3c/em\\x3eto stab herself: The idea was that she wanted him so badly, had been driven so wild with obsessive physical desire for his dick, that she was driven to impale herself on it despite the torment it caused. She was the one taking the active role; he just lay there as she thrashed around on top, doing his best to interpret her groans and facial twitches as signs that she was being crushed in an agonizing vise between pleasure and pain.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2b63\\\" id=\\\"2b63\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe knew it wasn\u2019t great, this fantasy. Yes, the scene he was imagining was ostensibly consensual, but you couldn\u2019t ignore its underlying aggressive themes. Nor was it reassuring that his reliance on the fantasy had increased as the quality of his relationships had declined. Throughout his twenties, Ted\u2019s breakups had been reasonably painless. None of his affairs had lasted longer than a few months, and the women he dated seemed to believe him when he told them he wasn\u2019t looking for anything serious\u200a\u2014\u200aor at least to believe that the fact he\u2019d said this meant they could not accuse him of wrongdoing when it ultimately proved to be true. Once he reached his thirties, though, this strategy no longer worked. More often than not, he\u2019d have what he thought was a final breakup conversation with a woman, only to have her text him shortly afterward, telling him she missed him, that she still didn\u2019t understand what had happened between them, and that she wanted to talk.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8184\\\" id=\\\"8184\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThus, one night in November, two weeks before his 36th birthday, Ted found himself sitting across a table from a crying woman named Angela. Angela was a real estate agent, pretty and polished, with sparkly chandelier earrings and expensively highlighted hair. Like all the women he\u2019d dated over the past several years, Angela was, by any objective measure, way out of his league. She was two inches taller than he was; she owned her own home; she made an amazing fettuccine with clam sauce; and she knew how to give a back rub with essential oils that she\u2019d sworn would change his life, which it had. Ted had broken up with her more than two months earlier, but the subsequent texts and phone calls had become so relentless that he\u2019d agreed to another face-to-face meeting in the hopes of gaining some peace.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8d79\\\" id=\\\"8d79\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAngela had begun the evening chattering brightly about her vacation plans, her work drama, and her adventures with \u201cthe girls,\u201d performing a happiness so clearly calculated to make him see what he was missing that he writhed with vicarious embarrassment, and then, at the 20-minute mark, she dissolved into tears.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3175\\\" id=\\\"3175\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cI just \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3edon\u2019t understand\\x3c/em\\x3e,\u201d she cried.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c5f6\\\" id=\\\"c5f6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhat followed was a hopeless, absurd conversation in which Angela insisted that Ted had feelings for her that he was hiding, while he insisted, as kindly as he could, that he did not. Through sobs, she marshaled her evidence of his affection: the time he\u2019d brought her breakfast in bed; the time he\u2019d said, \u201cI think you\u2019d really like my sister\u201d; the gentleness with which he\u2019d taken care of her dog, Marshmallow, when Marshmallow was sick. The problem, it seemed, was that while he\u2019d told Angela from the beginning that he wasn\u2019t looking for anything serious, at the same time, confusingly, he\u2019d also been nice. When what he ought to have done, apparently, was tell her that she could get her own damn breakfast, inform her it was unlikely that she\u2019d ever meet his sister, and be a jerk to Marshmallow when Marshmallow was puking, so that both Marshmallow and Angela would have known where they stood.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1453\\\" id=\\\"1453\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, over and over and over again. Not that it mattered. When he failed to admit that he was secretly in love with her, Angela was going to get angry. She was going to accuse him of being a narcissistic, emotionally stunted man-child. She was going to say, \u201cYou really hurt me,\u201d and, \u201cThe truth is, I feel sorry for you.\u201d She\u2019d announce, \u201cI was falling in \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3elove \\x3c/em\\x3ewith you,\u201d and he would sit there, abashed, as though the claim damned him, even though it was obvious Angela didn\u2019t love him\u200a\u2014\u200ashe thought he was an emotionally stunted man-child and didn\u2019t even like him all that much. Of course, it was hard to feel entirely self-righteous about all this when the reason he knew what was coming was that this was not the first such conversation he\u2019d had with a woman. It was not even the third. Or the fifth. Or the tenth.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9ead\\\" id=\\\"9ead\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAngela sobbed on, a figure of perfect, abject misery: her reddened eyes, her heaving chest, her mascara-stained face. As he watched her, Ted realized that he couldn\u2019t do it any longer. He couldn\u2019t apologize one more time, could not continue with this ritual of self-abasement. He was going to tell her the truth.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1702\\\" id=\\\"1702\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe next time Angela stopped for breath, Ted said, \u201cYou know none of this is my fault.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0549\\\" id=\\\"0549\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThere was a pause.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ce4e\\\" id=\\\"ce4e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201c\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eExcuse \\x3c/em\\x3eme?\u201d Angela said.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1dda\\\" id=\\\"1dda\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cI was always honest with you,\u201d Ted said. \u201cAlways. I told you what I wanted from this relationship from the very beginning. You could have trusted me, but instead you decided you knew better than I did what I felt. When I said I wanted something casual, you lied and said you wanted the same thing, and then immediately you started doing everything you could to make it something else. When you didn\u2019t manage to make what we had into a serious relationship\u200a\u2014\u200athe thing you wanted and I didn\u2019t\u200a\u2014\u200ayou got hurt. I see that.

She pushed back her chair, preparing to storm out of the restaurant, and, as she left, she picked up a glass of ice water and threw it at him\u200a\u2014\u200anot just the water, but the whole, full glass. The glass\u200a\u2014\u200ait was more of a tumbler, really\u200a\u2014\u200acracked against Ted\u2019s forehead and landed in his lap.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"ae9c\\\" id=\\\"ae9c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 525px; max-height: 525px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 100%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png\\\" data-width=\\\"1200\\\" data-height=\\\"1200\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*802BHkhG-8gQJ4HfcRPnUw.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b313\\\" id=\\\"b313\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3eTed looked down at the broken tumbler. Well. Maybe he should have expected that. Because who was he kidding? This many crying women couldn\u2019t be wrong about him, no matter how unfair their accusations felt. He reached up and touched his forehead. His fingers came away red. He was bleeding. Awesome. Also, his crotch was really, really cold. In fact, as the ice water soaked through his pants, his dick started to hurt even more than his head did. Maybe there should be a legal limit on how cold restaurant water could be, the way there was a limit on how hot coffee could be at McDonald\u2019s. Maybe his dick would get frostbite and shrivel up and fall off, and then everyone he\u2019d ever dated would come together to throw a party in honor of Angela, the fearless heroine who\u2019d ended his reign of terror over the single women of New York.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"80e5\\\" id=\\\"80e5\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eWow, he was bleeding more than he\u2019d originally thought. In fact, so much blood was streaming from his forehead that the water in his crotch was turning pink. People were running over, but sound was coming to him kind of scrambled and he couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying. Probably something along the lines of: You deserved this, asshole. He remembered what he\u2019d said right before Angela had flung the glass at him\u200a\u2014\u200a\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eI\u2019m just the tool you\u2019re using to hurt yourself\\x3c/em\\x3e\u200a\u2014\u200aand he wondered if this was related somehow to the dick-stabbing fantasy, but he was bleeding and freezing and possibly concussed, and he didn\u2019t have it in him right then to figure it out.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"15a1\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9423\\\" id=\\\"9423\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--leading\\\"\\x3eHe hadn\u2019t always been this way.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"35fe\\\" id=\\\"35fe\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGrowing up, Ted was the kind of small, bookish boy female teachers described as \u201csweet.\u201d And he was sweet, at least where women were concerned. He spent his childhood and early adolescence floating through a series of crushes on older, unattainable girls: a cousin, a babysitter, his big sister\u2019s best friend. These crushes were always sparked by some small gift of attention\u200a\u2014\u200aa minor compliment, genuine laughter at one of his jokes, remembering his name\u200a\u2014\u200aand they contained no overt or sublimated aggression at all. Just the opposite: In retrospect, they were remarkably chaste. In a recurring daydream he had about his cousin, for example, he envisioned himself as her husband, puttering around the kitchen as he prepared breakfast. Dressed in an apron, he hummed to himself as he squeezed fresh orange juice into a pitcher, whisked the pancake batter, fried the eggs, and placed a single daisy in a small white vase. He carried the tray upstairs to the bedroom and sat down on the side of the bed, where his cousin was snoozing beneath a hand-stitched quilt. \u201cRise and shine!\u201d he said. His cousin\u2019s eyes fluttered open. She smiled sleepily at him, and as she sat up, the quilt slid down, revealing her bare breasts.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bf47\\\" id=\\\"bf47\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThat was it! That was the entire fantasy. And yet he nursed it so long, and with such devoted attention (Should the pancakes have chocolate chips in them? What color should the quilt be? Where should he put the tray so that it would not fall off the bed?), that it imbued his aunt and uncle\u2019s house with a sexual aura that remained palpable to him even as an adult, even though his cousin had long ago become a lesbian and immigrated to the Netherlands and he hadn\u2019t seen her in years.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9f68\\\" id=\\\"9f68\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNever, not even in his wildest imaginings, had young Ted allowed himself to believe that his crushes might be reciprocated. He wasn\u2019t stupid. Whatever else he might be, he\u2019d never been that. All he\u2019d ever wanted was for his love to be tolerated, maybe even appreciated: He yearned to be permitted to linger worshipfully around his crushes, lightly bumping up against them every so often, the way a bee might brush against a flower.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"379b\\\" id=\\\"379b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eInstead, what transpired was that as soon as Ted fixated on a new crush, he would start to moon over her, gazing at her and smiling like a dope, concocting reasons to touch her hair, her hand. And then, inevitably, the girl would recoil\u200a\u2014\u200abecause for some impenetrable reason, Ted\u2019s affections provoked in their targets a reaction of intense and visceral disgust.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"12d3\\\" id=\\\"12d3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThey were not cruel to him, these crushes. Ted was drawn to the kind of dreamy girls to whom open cruelty was anathema. Instead, perhaps understanding that their earlier small attentions had been the doorway through which Ted had entered uninvited, the girls set about locking themselves down. Instituting some universally understood emergency girl protocol, they refused to make eye contact, spoke to him only when necessary, and stood as far across the room as it was possible to get. They barricaded themselves inside fortresses of chill politeness, where they hunkered down and waited for as long as it took for him to go away.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1ee3\\\" id=\\\"1ee3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eGod, it was awful. Decades later, remembering those crushes made Ted want to die of shame. Because the worst part was, even after it became obvious that the girls he adored found his attentions excruciating, he still desperately desired to be around them and make them happy. He struggled in the grip of this conundrum, trying to exert self-control in the form of brutal self-punishment (standing naked in front of the mirror, forcing himself to look at his skinny legs, concave chest, small penis: \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eShe hates you, Ted, face it, all girls hate you, you\u2019re ugly, you\u2019re disgusting, you\u2019re gross\\x3c/em\\x3e) and then losing control and finding himself awake at three in the morning, crying with frustration and typing \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3estates where it\u2019s legal to marry your cousin \\x3c/em\\x3einto the internet search bar, playing an endless game of whack-a-mole with his hopes.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2d25\\\" id=\\\"2d25\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe summer before high school, after a particularly humiliating episode with a camp counselor, Ted went for a long solitary walk and considered his future. Fact: He was short and ugly and greasy-haired and no girls would ever like him. Fact: Just knowing that someone as gross as Ted liked them creeped girls out. Conclusion: If he didn\u2019t want to spend his whole life making women miserable, he needed to figure out a way to keep his crushes to himself.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7fd2\\\" id=\\\"7fd2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo that was what he did.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5611\\\" id=\\\"5611\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHis freshman year of high school, Ted crafted a new persona: cheerfully asexual, utterly unthreatening, scrubbed clean of any whiffs of need. This Ted was a 60-year-old comic in a 14-year-old\u2019s body: hilarious, self-deprecating, and much too neurotic to ever have actual sex. When pressed, this Ted claimed to have a crush on Cynthia Krazewski, a cheerleader who was so unattainable that he might as well have claimed to have been in love with God Himself.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b4c5\\\" id=\\\"b4c5\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eThus disguised, Ted was free to befriend the girls he really did like and to channel all his energy into being nice to them without ever hinting that he wanted any more than that. The truth was he \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3edidn\u2019t \\x3c/em\\x3ewant more, not really. He had no faith in love\u2019s capacity to cause him anything but pain. Far easier, and more pleasant, to be friends with girls: to chat with them, to hear their stories, to drive them places, to tell them jokes that made them giggle, and then to go home and masturbate himself into a frenzy, banishing his desires to the realm of the imagination, where they couldn\u2019t do any harm.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"c51f\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"deef\\\" id=\\\"deef\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eBy\\x3c/span\\x3e his junior year, all of Ted\u2019s romantic energy had coalesced around a single target: Anna Travis, who not only tolerated him but considered him a friend. This was the magic of his new persona: As long as Ted kept his feelings hidden from them, girls\u200a\u2014\u200asome of them, at least\u200a\u2014\u200aliked him quite a lot.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8f18\\\" id=\\\"8f18\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThough she was considerably more popular than he was, when it came to love, Anna was as hopeless as Ted. For three weeks in ninth grade, Anna dated Marco, a soccer player who dumped her when he was promoted from the freshman team to junior varsity, and she\u2019d never gotten over it. Years later, Anna still had an insatiable desire to talk about Marco with anyone who would listen, and since everyone else was sick of the topic (and, perhaps, a bit unnerved by how crazy her eyes got when it came up), her sole partner for these conversations was Ted.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"536a\\\" id=\\\"536a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eObviously, Ted didn\u2019t exactly \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ewant \\x3c/em\\x3eto help Anna spend hours analyzing what it meant that Marco had said, \u201cMiss you, kid,\u201d and punched her in the shoulder when he saw her in the hallway the week before\u2026 but at the same time, he also did. Because telling Anna how stupid Marco was for dumping her and how infinitely superior she was to Marco\u2019s new girlfriend-of-the-week was the closest he\u2019d ever come to confessing how he felt. Plus, watching Anna yearn for Marco provided fuel for Ted\u2019s fantasies in which Anna yearned for him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4437\\\" id=\\\"4437\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eFantasy: It\u2019s late at night.

Once they\u2019re both naked, Anna is gazing at him in a way that is both worshipful and anxious, and she says, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d and he sighs heavily and says, \u201cNothing,\u201d and stares off into the distance, and she says, \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about Cynthia, aren\u2019t you?\u201d and he says, \u201cNo,\u201d but they both know that he is. Anna says, \u201cI promise, Ted, if you just give me a chance, I will make you forget about Cynthia,\u201d and then she slides her head down between his legs.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7a78\\\" id=\\\"7a78\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\\\"\\x3eEvery so often, Ted wondered if there was a chance Anna might like him as more than a friend. She didn\u2019t like him as much as he liked her, that was obvious, and she was never going to show up at his doorstep sobbing from frustrated passion, but\u2026 \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3emaaaaaaaaaaybe\\x3c/em\\x3e? She sat close to him on the couch sometimes, and she was always trying to talk him into asking girls out, which in and of itself was probably not a good sign, but when she did it, she\u2019d say things like, \u201cYou\u2019re a lot cuter than you think you are, Ted,\u201d and, \u201cAny girl would be lucky to go out with a guy like you.\u201d So even though she didn\u2019t \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3elike \\x3c/em\\x3elike him, maybe there was some latent potential that he could activate if he only told her how he felt. But there was also a kind of Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle thing going on, whereby any serious attempt to determine the state of the relationship would invariably alter it\u200a\u2014\u200aand because change was scary, and he was 99 percent sure Anna didn\u2019t like him like that and never would, he let things stay the way they were: good old friendly, utterly dishonest Ted.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"22b0\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"72f8\\\" id=\\\"72f8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading\\\"\\x3e\\x3cspan class=\\\"graf-dropCap\\\"\\x3eA\\x3c/span\\x3enna was a year ahead of him in school, college-bound for Tulane, and the week before she left for New Orleans, she coaxed her parents into throwing her a huge goodbye bash. The party was a performance with an intended audience of one, Marco; an elaborate setting designed to show off Anna at maximum sparkle\u200a\u2014\u200aand sparkle, dazzlingly, she did. She wore a short lace dress with a plunging neckline, and high heels, and lots of eye makeup, and she piled her tawny hair on top of her head. She surrounded herself with a coterie of other beautiful girls, all of them crying and laughing and shouting and posing for pictures and emoting so brightly that the rest of the world went dim.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e3f8\\\" id=\\\"e3f8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTed lurked around the edge of the party, hating himself. He and Anna had mostly hung out one-on-one, when she was feeling down about Marco and didn\u2019t have the energy to go out. On these occasions, they sat around on the couch and ate pizza and talked. Anna was usually wearing sweatpants. Ted had rarely seen her like this, broadcasting her charisma at full force. He was painfully aware of his natural role at the party\u200a\u2014\u200afawning courtier\u200a\u2014\u200aand he didn\u2019t want to play it. Maybe he\u2019d been deluding himself that he\u2019d kept his feelings hidden all this time, when really he\u2019d been walking around with his dick dangling out of his fly, unknowingly exposed. Maybe everyone in the room was thinking, \u201cOh, there\u2019s Ted. He\u2019s in love with Anna. Isn\u2019t it embarrassing? Isn\u2019t it cute?\u201d Maybe Anna knew too.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8d81\\\" id=\\\"8d81\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOf course Anna knew.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6025\\\" id=\\\"6025\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTed\u2019s pride bristled inside him, cutting into the soft parts. For the first time, he was angry at Anna, at the way she\u2019d allowed a random distribution of physical resources\u200a\u2014\u200aheight, facial symmetry, soccer-playing ability\u200a\u2014\u200ato determine the outcomes of both their lives. He was smarter than Marco, and kinder than Marco, and had more in common with Anna than Marco, and he knew how to make Anna laugh harder than Marco ever would\u200a\u2014\u200abut none of that mattered, because who he \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ewas \\x3c/em\\x3edidn\u2019t matter, to her or to anyone else.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4d5d\\\" id=\\\"4d5d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe evening dragged on, and as the party started to break up, the remaining guests decided to wander down to the beach. Ted could have gone home, but instead he stayed and sulked. Someone lit a campfire, and Ted sat in the literal shadows as he watched the glow from the flames play across Anna\u2019s face. He felt like something deep inside had broken. He\u2019d asked for nothing; he\u2019d tried to content himself with as little as it was possible to want. Yet here he was, feeling humiliated and small once again.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cfigure name=\\\"0c96\\\" id=\\\"0c96\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 1032px; max-height: 516px;\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 50%;\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\\\" data-image-id=\\\"1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png\\\" data-width=\\\"2400\\\" data-height=\\\"1200\\\" data-action=\\\"zoom\\\" data-action-value=\\\"1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png?q=20\\\" crossorigin=\\\"anonymous\\\" class=\\\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\\\"\\x3e\\x3ccanvas class=\\\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/canvas\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3cnoscript class=\\\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\"\\x3e\\x3cimg class=\\\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\\\" src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*vEmmQK-q9jJ2eqEHXw_9Rg.png\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/noscript\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/figure\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b2db\\\" id=\\\"b2db\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\\\"\\x3eAnna was roasting a marshmallow, twirling it contemplatively over the coals. She was wearing a boy\u2019s sweatshirt over her short dress, and her bare legs were crusted with sand. The wind shifted, sending a plume of smoke billowing over her.

She sighed, probably because Marco was long gone. He\u2019d only stayed an hour. Looking at Anna, her forlorn expression mirroring his own, Ted felt bad about how angry he\u2019d been only a few minutes before. He unrequitedly loved Anna; Anna unrequitedly loved Marco; Marco probably unrequitedly loved some rando none of them had ever met. The world was pitiless. Nobody had any power over anyone else.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3d13\\\" id=\\\"3d13\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe said, \u201cYou look beautiful.

She looked like she might be about to say something more, but instead she put her head on his shoulder, and he put his arm around her.

Maybe I could be content with this.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3c/section\\x3e\\x3csection name=\\\"88f1\\\" class=\\\"section section--body\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3chr class=\\\"section-divider\\\"\\x3e\\x3c/div\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-content\\\"\\x3e\\x3cdiv class=\\\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\\\"\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7a16\\\" id=\\\"7a16\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--leading\\\"\\x3eUnfortunately, he could not.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7c44\\\" id=\\\"7c44\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTed had hoped that when Anna left for college, his feelings for her might torment him less, but they didn\u2019t. Indeed, with Anna\u2019s physical presence in his life so diminished, Ted could see with greater clarity the astonishing amount of space she took up in his head. In the morning, as he waited for his alarm to go off, he imagined holding her in his arms and nuzzling her neck; the first thing he did when he got up was check his email to see if she\u2019d sent him a message overnight; all day, he filtered his experience for amusing bits and pieces that he could turn into stories to write to her about. Whenever he was bored or anxious, his brain distracted itself by worrying at the question of whether he could ever make Anna like him, like a dog working the last bits of marrow from a bone. And for hours at night, his bedroom turned into the set of an imaginary porn film starring the two of them, with the occasional movie star or classmate as a walk-on guest. Given how little contact Ted had now with actual Anna, it was like he was in a relationship with an imaginary friend.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3ba9\\\" id=\\\"3ba9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTed would have preferred not to live like this, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do about it. He supposed the answer was to develop a crush on someone else, someone who might like him back. As it happened, that wasn\u2019t as wild a prospect as it might have been a year earlier\u200a\u2014\u200awhile Ted was still short and nerdy, his braces had come off, he\u2019d gotten a decent haircut, and there was this girl he tutored in biology, a sophomore named Rachel, whose crush on him even he wasn\u2019t oblivious enough to overlook.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0c5a\\\" id=\\\"0c5a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTed wasn\u2019t remotely attracted to Rachel, who was thin and frizzy-haired and abrasive, but he was 17 years old and had never even held hands with a girl, so who was he to keep his standards high? Maybe if he and Rachel hooked up, he\u2019d start to develop feelings for her. Stranger things had happened. Besides, he had to admit that dating Rachel couldn\u2019t \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ehurt \\x3c/em\\x3ehis chances with Anna\u200a\u2014\u200aafter all, how many stories had he heard about girls who didn\u2019t realize the love of their lives was standing right in front of them until the moment he fell for someone else?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"335b\\\" id=\\\"335b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo, one afternoon after tutoring, Ted, mumbling, asked Rachel what she was doing that weekend and if she wanted to hang out. As soon as the words escaped his lips, he regretted them, but it was too late. Rachel took charge immediately, acquiring his phone number and giving him her own. She told him what time, precisely, she\u2019d be expecting him to call her, and when he dutifully phoned, she let him know what movie she wanted to see that weekend, what time it was showing, and where they should eat dinner beforehand, and then she gave him directions to her house so he could pick her up.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a4d3\\\" id=\\\"a4d3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAs they walked out of the theater, she was already making plans for future hangouts, chattering about how much she wanted to try the new Thai place on Seventh, and how they shouldn\u2019t forget to go see that romantic comedy they\u2019d watched the trailer for, and did Ted have any plans for Halloween, because she and her friends were putting together a group costume and he\u2019d be welcome to join.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1e4e\\\" id=\\\"1e4e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTed was wildly uncomfortable. He wasn\u2019t quite sure who Rachel was on a date with, but it didn\u2019t seem to be him. He\u2019d contributed nothing to the outing; as far as he could tell, she could have brought an inflatable doll with her to the movie and had an equally good time. As he drove her home, he resolved to politely make it clear there would not be a second date. Rachel would hate him for dumping her, obviously, which meant he might need to drop out of the tutoring program, but he figured it\u2019d be worth it to avoid the awkwardness that would otherwise follow. They didn\u2019t have any other activities in common, so if he played his cards right, he might never have to see her again.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"43f7\\\" id=\\\"43f7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhen they reached Rachel\u2019s house, Ted put the car in park but left it running.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"dfc5\\\" id=\\\"dfc5\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRachel unbuckled her seat belt. \u201cGood night,\u201d she said, but she didn\u2019t move.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"12b6\\\" id=\\\"12b6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cGood night,\u201d he said, going in for a hug.

Could he just quit tutoring and hope she got the hint?

The shock of it briefly drove all other thoughts from his head. He froze, jaw slack, and Rachel plunged her tongue into his mouth and wriggled it around. Just as his brain caught up with his body and he remembered he was supposed to be kissing her back, she broke away and started covering his lips with light little pecks. \u201cLike this,\u201d she said breathily, and he realized she was taking it on herself to \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eteach \\x3c/em\\x3ehim how to kiss her, because he obviously didn\u2019t know how. A hammer of shame swung down and flattened him.

After a few minutes, he decided that kissing wasn\u2019t that hard, really, although it certainly wasn\u2019t everything it was cracked up to be. Overall, it wasn\u2019t an unpleasant sensation, but there was nothing particularly erotic about it. Rachel\u2019s glasses kept bumping up against the bridge of his nose, and it was weird to see her this close up. She looked like a different person, paler, more\u2026 vague, somehow, like a painting. He tried closing his eyes, but it made him uncomfortable, like someone was going to sneak up behind him and plunge a knife into his back.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4d31\\\" id=\\\"4d31\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo this was kissing. He had to admit Rachel seemed into it. She kept kind of rolling around and sighing. Would he be enjoying himself more if he were kissing Anna? Frankly, it was hard to ever imagine being turned on by this activity. Two boneless slabs of flesh, flopping around, like a pair of slugs mating in the cavern of your mouth. \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eGross\\x3c/em\\x3e, Ted thought. What was wrong with him? Rachel\u2019s breath smelled like popcorn butter: slightly metallic, with a hint of the burnt grease that stuck to the bottom of the machine. Or was that his breath? He could think of no way to tell.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e45a\\\" id=\\\"e45a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRachel was basically on top of him now, moving her hand in an exploratory way, like maybe she was trying to figure out if he had a boner. Needless to say, he did not have a boner; he actually felt like his dick might have snuck up inside his body to hide. Was the fact that he didn\u2019t have a boner going to hurt Rachel\u2019s feelings? Should he try to fantasize about Anna so that he could get a boner so that Rachel wouldn\u2019t feel bad about the fact that he hadn\u2019t gotten a boner for her? No, that could not be the right course of action. But what did Rachel \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ewant\\x3c/em\\x3e? She was full-on straddling him now, grinding her hips against his knee and groaning. Did she want to have sex? Surely not. They were parked outside her parents\u2019 house, and she was only a sophomore, and besides, he was \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eTed\\x3c/em\\x3e. It was one thing to accept that Rachel might have developed a minor crush on him during biology tutoring, another to think that he\u2019d made her so wildly hot for the D that she was ready to bone him in the front seat of his car.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8882\\\" id=\\\"8882\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eStill, she really did seem to be absurdly into this.

Or, if not faking, entirely, then exaggerating. A lot. But why would she do that? Pretend he was turning her on with his clumsy tongue fumblings when he wasn\u2019t?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5349\\\" id=\\\"5349\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOh.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4973\\\" id=\\\"4973\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAs soon as it occurred to him, he realized the answer was obvious. She knew he was nervous, and she was trying to coax him through it. His ineptitude and discomfort were probably visible from space. She was pretending to enjoy herself so he\u2019d relax and stop being such a bad kisser. She was faking sexual excitement out of \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3epity\\x3c/em\\x3e.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1c61\\\" id=\\\"1c61\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIf before he\u2019d felt like his dick had crawled up inside his body, now he felt like a two-ton lead slab had dropped on his crotch from the heavens, paralyzing him for life.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2c06\\\" id=\\\"2c06\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eKill yourself, Ted\\x3c/em\\x3e, a voice in his head said.

He felt the no-thoughts shock again. Rachel\u2019s breasts were small, but her shirt was low-cut, so he was touching a lot of very soft skin. Tentatively, he squeezed, and then he rubbed the spot where he was pretty sure her nipple would be. Holy shit, it \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ewas \\x3c/em\\x3ethere, and after a second of rubbing, it popped up under his thumb.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4b3b\\\" id=\\\"4b3b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhoa.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"49f0\\\" id=\\\"49f0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eClosing his eyes like he was jumping off a diving board, he plunged his hand under her shirt and bra, and then he didn\u2019t have to worry about the no-boner problem, because the bare nipple he was pinching was the dirtiest, sexiest thing in the world, and it was somehow only dirtier and sexier for being attached to a person he barely knew, whose breath smelled like popcorn and whose transparent parody of arousal was an insult to them both.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"dbf7\\\" id=\\\"dbf7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHe pinched it again, a little harder.

Yeah, he\u2019d inadvertently creeped out some of his crushes, but he\u2019d been a kid, and he\u2019d wrestled mightily to keep himself under control. And there was probably an argument to be made about the way he\u2019d acted around Anna when they\u2019d been in school together\u200a\u2014\u200athat he should have been honest with her about his feelings instead of skulking around in the friend zone\u200a\u2014\u200abut while he might have been cowardly with Anna, he\u2019d also done his best to be kind. Rachel, though\u2026 if there was a hell, and he ended up in it, he was pretty sure the devil would hold up a picture of Rachel, shake it in his face, and say, \u201cHey, buddy, what was the deal with this one?\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d8f2\\\" id=\\\"d8f2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eBut he didn\u2019t know!

Everything about her bugged him: her stupid hair, her nasal voice, her habit of bossing him around. The thought of people saying, \u201cThere goes Rachel, Ted\u2019s girlfriend!\u201d made him cringe. He saw, in her, all the parts of himself he tried so hard to repress: her sycophantic overtures to people who treated her like shit, her faux-patrician condescension toward the handful of people below her on the popularity ladder, the sarcastic jabs she used to distance herself from all the other losers on her social plane.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"415c\\\" id=\\\"415c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eLike him, she was prone to embarrassing bodily mishaps\u200a\u2014\u200aperiod stains, bad breath, sitting in ways that inadvertently exposed her underwear\u200a\u2014\u200abut, unlike him, these episodes didn\u2019t seem to cause her inordinate shame. \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eHe \\x3c/em\\x3ewas the one who felt ashamed: When he caught sight of her in the hallway ahead of him, sauntering on with a rusty patch on the back of her jean skirt, or when Jennifer Roberts fanned the air in disgust after Rachel, who\u2019d been standing much too close, finally turned away. In these moments, Ted didn\u2019t just dislike Rachel: He \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ehated \\x3c/em\\x3eher, more than he\u2019d ever hated anyone else in his life.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ef53\\\" id=\\\"ef53\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSo why didn\u2019t he break up with her?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5586\\\" id=\\\"5586\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAt home, alone, Ted knew he did not like Rachel and that he did not want to date her, and so breaking up with her seemed straightforward, the right thing to do. But then they would meet up, and as soon as Rachel saw him, if he hesitated, or pulled away, or signaled with even the tiniest of expressions that something was wrong, then her face would darken. At the first hint of her anger, he would feel an onrush of guilt and cold fear. He\u2019d get swept up in a current of conviction that he was a total garbage asshole jerk, his sins stretching in an unbroken chain back to his original decision to agree to go on even one date with her when he\u2019d been in love with Anna the whole time. Skewered by guilt, he would decide that rather than confront Rachel directly and add to the immeasurable wrongs he\u2019d already done her, it\u2019d be \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eso much better \\x3c/em\\x3eto wait for a more opportune moment, like maybe one where she\u2019d do the breaking up herself. After all, it wasn\u2019t like he was such a prize; surely if he just sat it out, sooner rather than later she\u2019d free herself of this delusion that he was remotely datable and dump him of her own accord. With that in mind, he\u2019d agree to whatever she was suggesting with a sense of profound relief\u200a\u2014\u200aand then it\u2019d be 10 minutes later, or 15, or an hour, and he\u2019d surface and think, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eWait a second, I was going to break up with her. Why are we sitting here in this Olive Garden, eating lunch?\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"51d8\\\" id=\\\"51d8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWith Rachel prattling on, that dark cloud of incipient anger nowhere to be seen, the idea that just seconds ago it had felt impossible to end the relationship seemed absurd\u200a\u2014\u200abut it also seemed absurd to break up with her out of nowhere, when he\u2019d just been sitting there acting like everything was fine and saying things like, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go with you to visit your cousin on Sunday.\u201d Because if he tried to break up with Rachel right now, while she was halfway through a breadstick, surely the first thing she\u2019d say would be, \u201cIf you knew you were going to break up with me, why did you literally \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ejust \\x3c/em\\x3eagree to go with me to visit my cousin on Sunday?\u201d and he would have no answer.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"373d\\\" id=\\\"373d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWell, what if she did, Ted? What. If. She. Did. Couldn\u2019t he have just shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cWhelp, sucks for your cousin, I changed my mind\u201d? No. He could not do that, because that was something that only an asshole would do, and he, Ted, was not an asshole. He was\u2026 a nice guy.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3cab\\\" id=\\\"3cab\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eYes, okay, everyone agreed that nice guys were the worst, but this was different. To feel incapable of interrupting Rachel in the middle of a meal and dumping her without warning\u200a\u2014\u200athat wasn\u2019t Nice Guy Syndrome, that was just being humane. He\u2019d never empathized with Rachel more than he did in those moments, imagining what it would be like to be innocently eating lunch with a person who had been acting for all the world as though he liked you, who had given you no hint that anything was bothering him at all, when suddenly, out of nowhere, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ewham\\x3c/em\\x3e, it turned out you were completely wrong about him and everything he\u2019d been telling you was a lie.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9298\\\" id=\\\"9298\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eHis whole life, Ted had clung to the idea that he was misunderstood\u200a\u2014\u200athat the girls who\u2019d rejected him were wrong to treat him as though there was something inherently creepy about him. He might not have been the handsomest guy around, but he wasn\u2019t \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ebad\\x3c/em\\x3e. And yet sometimes he\u2019d lie awake at night imagining Rachel telling her story to a tribunal of all the girls who\u2019d ever rejected him, regaling them about his deceptions, the way he\u2019d pretended to like her when he didn\u2019t, the mask of \u201cniceness\u201d he wore when the truth was he was a selfish, lying piece of shit\u200a\u2014\u200aand he saw all those girls, Anna at their center, shocked but not shocked, nodding and agreeing that, yes, of course, they\u2019d known something was wrong with him all along.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8712\\\" id=\\\"8712\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAnd so Anna took on another role in his head: forewoman of a jury that stood ready to convict. The longer the relationship with Rachel went on, the more Ted needed her to return to his imaginary tribunal with a story that vindicated him. He needed his first-ever girlfriend not simply to say, but to believe, that while things might not have worked out between them, he wasn\u2019t creepy or scary or bad; he was, fundamentally, a good guy.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fe8a\\\" id=\\\"fe8a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTo placate this imagined version of Anna, he stayed with Rachel, and he lied. He finished his lunch at the Olive Garden, he went to visit the cousin, and he tried to lay the groundwork for his escape. He did his best to keep his distance from Rachel\u2014not enough to make her angry, just enough to keep the relationship from getting any more serious than it already was. He didn\u2019t call her very often, and he was busy a lot but always apologetic about it. He did exactly what was required of him, but no more. He felt a bit as though he were playing dead, remaining limp and pliable in the hopes that she would eventually lose interest and wander away. \u201cAll right,\u201d the tribunal would say at the end of it. \u201cHe\u2019s not the \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ebest \\x3c/em\\x3eperson. He\u2019s not a saint. But he\u2019s no Marco, manipulating girls just for the hell of it. It could have been worse. He deserves another chance.

He\u2019d used it when he was a kid to describe certain kinds of comics and cartoons and movies and books where people were \u201cmean\u201d to girls. Wonder Woman was chained to the railroad tracks.

He untied the ropes and rubbed their wrists to get the circulation flowing, gently undid the gags, stroked their hair as they cried against his chest. To be the villain, the tier-upper, the inflictor of pain? No, no, no, no, no. Meanness had nothing to do with Ted\u2019s love life, or his fantasy life, either.

Yet he still felt, gut-deep, that there was a patina of falseness over everything she did, and that in claiming to enjoy what he did to her, she was telling him what she thought he wanted to hear. Part of what it meant to be \u201cmean\u201d to Rachel, therefore, was to scrape away that falseness, to dig under it, to force her to show a true reaction: He wanted to catch that real part of Rachel, but it kept slipping away from him, like an eel dipping under the water, and chasing it drove him up the wall with lust. \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eI hate you, I hate you\\x3c/em\\x3e, he\u2019d think, pinning her bony wrists above her head and biting the meat of her shoulder and dry-humping her leg until he came.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"225a\\\" id=\\\"225a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cThat was \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eamazing\\x3c/em\\x3e,\u201d she\u2019d sigh afterward, cuddling up to him, but he did not, could not, believe her.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2d58\\\" id=\\\"2d58\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eSometimes, he wondered if, more than the hookups themselves, she liked their aftermath, because in those brief periods, he was different with her. He needed her to salve his guilt over what he\u2019d just done so badly that he was vulnerable, open and raw. He\u2019d kiss her and bring her water, and afterward he\u2019d lie beside her and hide his face in her hair. In those moments, he could look at Rachel\u2019s face and see her not as ugly or pretty or good or bad or loved or hated, but just as a person lying next to him, stripped of all the judgment he was continually imposing on her, his obsessive critical analysis of everything she did. What if he \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ecould \\x3c/em\\x3elike Rachel? If he liked her, then he wouldn\u2019t be a bad person for dating her.

If Anna asked him follow-up questions he couldn\u2019t avoid, he feared that the discovery that he\u2019d been romantically linked with Rachel Derwin-Finkel might be enough to taint him forever with her loser\u2019s stench.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7439\\\" id=\\\"7439\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eRachel, on the other hand, knew \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eall about \\x3c/em\\x3eAnna.

He listened to her breathe in and out as his hand worked steadily beneath the sheets. He felt ashamed of himself, of course, but the warmth of that shame pooled in his crotch, amplifying his pleasure. He came in a torrent, making no sounds other than those that could be explained away as sleepy breathing.

If he asked her directly to hang out, she\u2019d always smile and say, \u201cSure! Sounds great! Call me tomorrow and we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Only a slight tightness around her mouth and the heaviness of her exhale would suggest that he\u2019d imposed. But inevitably, a conflict would appear at the last minute, or else, when he tried to pin down the details, she\u2019d simply fail to answer the phone. If he called her out on her flakiness, or even made reference to the broken plans, as opposed to pretending they\u2019d never existed in the first place, she\u2019d pull away even further, in a way that made him feel ashamed of himself and needy for pressing her.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1c09\\\" id=\\\"1c09\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOn the other hand, she happily kept him informed about plans she had with other people, providing a steady flow of information about excursions that were about to happen, details of dates or parties that were always \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ethis close \\x3c/em\\x3eto coming together. As long as he listened, without complaint, to an endless description of activities that were supposed to happen without him, there was a 30 percent chance, at least, that Anna would change her mind at the last minute, claim to be unable to handle the unbearable burden of whatever her social plans were supposed to be, and decide to hang out with him instead. She\u2019d arrive at his house and collapse in exaggerated relief: \u201cI am \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eso glad \\x3c/em\\x3ewe\u2019re doing this.

I always took you for granted. \\x3c/em\\x3eWhat could those words be but a confession? And what was a confession if not a promise, or at least a willingness, to change?

Ted himself had argued passionately with the other boys at his lunch table about whether that was even possible (Did she just stick it in there, or\u2026?), and then, when the controversy threatened to die down, he\u2019d willfully revived it, because the Rachel scandal had taken the focus off the previous scandal roiling the third grade, which was the question of whether or not he, Ted, had been caught by the music teacher pooping in the instrument closet during the spring recital, WHICH OF COURSE HE HAD NOT.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"56d3\\\" id=\\\"56d3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eWhat did Anna know about what it was like to have a rumor like that spread about you, that overpowering and helpless shame?

Unable to turn his head either left or right, he stared directly up into a blinding fluorescent light and wondered if he was dying. That\u2019s ridiculous, he told himself. I am absolutely not dying. A lady threw a glass of water at me; it\u2019s a minor injury; it\u2019s absurd to think a person could die because of that. Immediately, he imagined Rachel saying scornfully, \u201cPeople die of head injuries \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eall the time\\x3c/em\\x3e, Ted.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6b7f\\\" id=\\\"6b7f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eTed thought, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eI am probably not dying, but I am scared and alone and I don\u2019t like this.\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e7dc\\\" id=\\\"e7dc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\\\"\\x3e\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he shouted, through a dry, cracked throat. \u201cCould someone please tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8d90\\\" id=\\\"8d90\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNo one responded to his plea, but eventually some blurry shadow-creatures came swimming toward him.

One piece of glass had become lodged in his forehead, and he could see that piece of glass in the center of his vision, rising like a tower, impaling him, pinning him down, refracting a shimmering circle of rainbows in the light.

In contrast to Rachel, Anna looks a little\u2026 bland? She looks like what Ted knows her to be: tired, overwhelmed, and sad. Ted thinks, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eIs it possible that Rachel is hotter than Anna?

To the surprise of both parties involved, Ted has difficulty maintaining an erection. The reason for this, though he would never, ever confess it, is the look on Anna\u2019s face. She just seems so dutiful. She looks like she is taking medicine, or eating vegetables. She looks like she is thinking, \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eWhelp, my life sucks so bad I guess I might as well have sex with Ted.\\x3c/em\\x3e\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8c71\\\" id=\\\"8c71\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eNo, that\u2019s not fair.

And it turns out that is how Ted has always wanted to be wanted: the way he has always wanted women. The way Anna wanted Marco, and he wanted Anna, and Rachel (or so it seems, in retrospect) wanted him.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"870c\\\" id=\\\"870c\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn the absence of this painful wanting, Ted has trouble getting hard.

The whole time Ted is having sex with Rachel, Imaginary Anna flutters around him, waving her angel\u2019s wings in his face: \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eI\u2019m so beautiful and perfect\\x3c/em\\x3e, she sighs. \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eHow could you possibly prefer having this creepy weirdo sex with Rachel Derwin-Finkel?

When what he ought to have done, apparently, was tell her that she could get her own damn breakfast, inform her it was unlikely that she\u2019d ever meet his sister, and be a jerk to Marshmallow when Marshmallow was puking, so that both Marshmallow and Angela would have known where they stood.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"1453\" name=\"1453\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, over and over and over again.

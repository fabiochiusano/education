In fact, John Scott had visited Augustus two weeks before the 23-year-old died of tuberculosis, only to unexpectedly follow him to the grave just a week later. At first the funeral party thought wild hogs might be responsible for the churned-up soil at Augustus Devin\u2019s grave, but upon closer inspection they found the young man\u2019s body was gone, stolen by body-snatchers, the reviled resurrection men who made their living by trafficking the dead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44671\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Congress Green Cemetery historical marker by trippybeth @ Reflectionsuponmyreality2.wordpress.com\" width=\"150\"/></a>Horrified by this discovery and concerned that their father might suffer a similar indignity, Benjamin and his brothers John and Carter took additional measures to secure his final resting place. The grave was already brick vaulted with a thick stone bottom. They placed three large, heavy stone slabs eight inches thick on top of the metal casket \u2014 the largest at the head and the two smaller ones at the foot \u2014 and poured cement over them to create a solid block weighing nearly a ton. The grave was kept open for several hours until the cement dried. It was then filled and the family paid a watchman a dollar a night to guard the grave for 30 nights. Having seen his father safely to his eternal repose, Benjamin Harrison, a distinguished attorney and already a prominent figure in the Republican party, returned to his home in Indianapolis to prepare for a speech he was giving at the Republican State Convention on June 5th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44668\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856-90x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856-90x150.jpg 90w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856-180x300.jpg 180w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856-430x714.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ad for Medical College of Ohio in Williams' Cincinnati Directory of 1856. &quot;The Dissecting Rooms will be opened on the first of October, under the care of the Demonstrator of Anatomy, and students may rely on a full supply of materiel [ie, dead bodies] throughout the session.&quot;\" width=\"90\"/></a>Benjamin\u2019s youngest brother John Harrison went to Cincinnati with his nephew George Eaton to find and reclaim young Augustus\u2019 body before the grieving mother had to be told it was gone.

His father William Henry Harrison was the ninth President and holds the record for the shortest tenure, having died of pneumonia on the 32nd day of his presidency. John Scott\u2019s son Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd President, serving one full term from 1889 to 1893. The Honorable John Scott Harrison was a Congressman from Ohio, a gentleman farmer, a family man and a highly respected member of his community, but if he is remembered at all today, it is for what happened to him after his death, a true tale of horror that caused a nation-wide sensation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/John-Scott-Harrison-obituary-in-the-New-York-Times-May-19th-1878.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44664\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/John-Scott-Harrison-obituary-in-the-New-York-Times-May-19th-1878-106x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/John-Scott-Harrison-obituary-in-the-New-York-Times-May-19th-1878-106x150.jpg 106w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/John-Scott-Harrison-obituary-in-the-New-York-Times-May-19th-1878-430x603.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/John-Scott-Harrison-obituary-in-the-New-York-Times-May-19th-1878.jpg 868w\" title=\"John Scott Harrison obituary in the New York Times, May 19th, 1878\" width=\"106\"/></a>After a peaceful death in his bed at Point Farm the night of May 25th, 1878, John Scott Harrison was buried in the family plot overlooking the Ohio River Valley in Congress Green Cemetery, North Bend, Ohio. The funeral took place on May 29th. As family and friends walked to the grave for the burial service, they were dismayed to see that the still-fresh grave of their kinsman <a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=14628055\" target=\"_blank\">Augustus Devin</a> had been disturbed. John Scott\u2019s daughter Sarah was married to Augustus\u2019 uncle Thomas Jefferson Devin, and the families were very close. In fact, John Scott had visited Augustus two weeks before the 23-year-old died of tuberculosis, only to unexpectedly follow him to the grave just a week later. At first the funeral party thought wild hogs might be responsible for the churned-up soil at Augustus Devin\u2019s grave, but upon closer inspection they found the young man\u2019s body was gone, stolen by body-snatchers, the reviled resurrection men who made their living by trafficking the dead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44671\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Congress-Green-Cemetery-historical-marker-by-trippybeth-430x322.jpg 430w\" title=\"Congress Green Cemetery historical marker by trippybeth @ Reflectionsuponmyreality2.wordpress.com\" width=\"150\"/></a>Horrified by this discovery and concerned that their father might suffer a similar indignity, Benjamin and his brothers John and Carter took additional measures to secure his final resting place. The grave was already brick vaulted with a thick stone bottom. They placed three large, heavy stone slabs eight inches thick on top of the metal casket \u2014 the largest at the head and the two smaller ones at the foot \u2014 and poured cement over them to create a solid block weighing nearly a ton. The grave was kept open for several hours until the cement dried. It was then filled and the family paid a watchman a dollar a night to guard the grave for 30 nights. Having seen his father safely to his eternal repose, Benjamin Harrison, a distinguished attorney and already a prominent figure in the Republican party, returned to his home in Indianapolis to prepare for a speech he was giving at the Republican State Convention on June 5th.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44668\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856-90x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856-90x150.jpg 90w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856-180x300.jpg 180w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ad-for-Medical-College-of-Ohio-in-Williams-Cincinnati-Directory-of-1856-430x714.jpg 430w\" title=\"Ad for Medical College of Ohio in Williams' Cincinnati Directory of 1856. &quot;The Dissecting Rooms will be opened on the first of October, under the care of the Demonstrator of Anatomy, and students may rely on a full supply of materiel [ie, dead bodies] throughout the session.&quot;\" width=\"90\"/></a>Benjamin\u2019s youngest brother John Harrison went to Cincinnati with his nephew George Eaton to find and reclaim young Augustus\u2019 body before the grieving mother had to be told it was gone. There was little question in their mind where the body had wound up. It was almost certainly sold to a local medical school, the primary receivers of stolen human flesh. While the Anatomy Act of 1832 had ended the illicit cadaver trade in the UK by supplying anatomy schools with bodies of unclaimed indigents, the federal system in the United States left that kind of legislation to individual states, and the notion of handing over the bodies of the poor for dissection offended American religious and moral sensibilities so much that few states made such provisions. This combined with the explosion of new medical schools in the mid-19th century (in 1800 there were 4 medical schools in the whole country; by 1876 there were 73; by the end of the century there were dozens more) to create a massive demand for anatomical \u201cmateriel\u201d that the resurrection men were only too glad to fill.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7251137/cincinnati_enquirer_item_of_may_30th/\" target=\"_blank\">item in the <em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em></a> on the morning of May 30th gave Harrison and Eaton a valuable clue to the possible whereabouts of the missing body: </p>\n<blockquote><p><center><strong>A Mystery.</strong></center></p>\n<p>About three o\u2019clock this morning, a sensation was created on Vine street by a buggy being driven into the alley north of the Grand Opera house. It proceeded about half way through to Race street, when something white was taken out and disappeared. Several men started in to see what was going on, when the buggy drove out to Race street and left rapidly. The general impression was that a \u201cstiff\u201d was being smuggled into the Ohio Medical College.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This small blurb and the outrage to a well-connected family with legal clout was sufficient for John Harrison and George Eaton to secure a search warrant that very day for the Medical College of Ohio. Armed with the warrant, Harrison and Eaton, accompanied by former Cincinnati Chief of Police Colonel Thomas E. Snelbaker, Constable Lacey and Deputy Constable Tallen of the Cincinnati police, went to the college and insisted on searching the premises. They were accompanied by the very apprehensive janitor, A.Q. Marshall, who protested that the officers of the college should be present before they turned the place upside down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ohio-Medical-College-on-Sixth-St-near-Vine.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44675\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ohio-Medical-College-on-Sixth-St-near-Vine-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ohio-Medical-College-on-Sixth-St-near-Vine-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ohio-Medical-College-on-Sixth-St-near-Vine-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ohio-Medical-College-on-Sixth-St-near-Vine-430x318.jpg 430w\" title=\"The old Ohio Medical College on Sixth Street near Vine, now no longer standing.\" width=\"150\"/></a>The party proceeded to search every room on all five floors of the building, from cellar to garret. In the cellar they found a chute that opened onto the alley between Vine and Race Streets where the buggy had been seen dumping a suspicious white bundle at 3:00 o\u2019clock that morning. This was how the resurrectionists surreptitiously delivered cadavers to the medical school. No need for daylight transactions that might raise awkward questions; no need for the faculty to interact with the grave-robbers in the presence of the evidence of their crimes. Another chute, this one running vertically from the cellar to the top of the building, was connected to it. The search party looked into both chutes, illuminating the darkness with their lamps, but saw nothing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dissections-in-anatomy-laboratory-1893-University-of-Michigan-Library-Digital-Collections.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-36593\" height=\"75\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dissections-in-anatomy-laboratory-1893-University-of-Michigan-Library-Digital-Collections-150x75.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dissections-in-anatomy-laboratory-1893-University-of-Michigan-Library-Digital-Collections-150x75.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dissections-in-anatomy-laboratory-1893-University-of-Michigan-Library-Digital-Collections-200x100.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dissections-in-anatomy-laboratory-1893-University-of-Michigan-Library-Digital-Collections-430x216.jpg 430w\" title='Dissections in University of Michigan anatomy laboratory with handwritten label \"Mortui vivos docent\" (\"The dead teach the living\"), ca. 1893.

Then they came upon a dissection room. A student was using it for its intended purposes, cutting into a partial body \u2014 the head and chest of a black woman \u2014 merrily slicing away at the already putrefying flesh. Walking briskly past this macabre scene, they found a box of assorted limbs cut from cadavers and kept for later use. Mixed in with the arms and legs was the intact body of a six-month-old baby.</p>\n<p>Disgusted and disturbed, they moved on to the top floor of the building. By this time, the police had allowed the janitor to leave, ostensibly to notify the school officers of the search, but Colonel Snelbaker was smart enough to have him followed. Instead of running off to alert the faculty, Mr. Marshall went upstairs to a room at the southeast corner of the building. He realized he was being shadowed so he turned around before entering, but it was too late. The cops now knew there was something worth hiding in that room.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-windlass-and-chute-in-the-5th-floor-room.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44666\" height=\"104\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-windlass-and-chute-in-the-5th-floor-room.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878-150x104.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-windlass-and-chute-in-the-5th-floor-room.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878-150x104.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-windlass-and-chute-in-the-5th-floor-room.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878-200x138.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-windlass-and-chute-in-the-5th-floor-room.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878-430x298.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-windlass-and-chute-in-the-5th-floor-room.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878.jpg 1500w\" title=\"The windlass and chute in the 5th floor room.

In a corner of the room near a window was a windlass. A rope ran from it into a square hole in the floor, presumably reaching the bottom of the long chute in the cellar. This is how the bodies were moved from the cellar to the dissection rooms: they were tied to a rope and lifted by the windlass at the top of chute. Snelbaker saw that the rope was taut as if something heavy was tied to it. He turned the windlass and slowly the body of a man emerged from the hole, the rope tied around his neck and under one arm. He was naked except for a tattered shirt and a cloth covering his head.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Section-showing-the-length-of-the-vertical-chute-connecting-to-the-dump-chute-in-the-cellar-body-dangling-from-the-rope.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44665\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 58px) 100vw, 58px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Section-showing-the-length-of-the-vertical-chute-connecting-to-the-dump-chute-in-the-cellar-body-dangling-from-the-rope.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878-58x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Section-showing-the-length-of-the-vertical-chute-connecting-to-the-dump-chute-in-the-cellar-body-dangling-from-the-rope.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878-58x150.jpg 58w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Section-showing-the-length-of-the-vertical-chute-connecting-to-the-dump-chute-in-the-cellar-body-dangling-from-the-rope.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878-116x300.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Section-showing-the-length-of-the-vertical-chute-connecting-to-the-dump-chute-in-the-cellar-body-dangling-from-the-rope.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878-311x800.jpg 311w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Section-showing-the-length-of-the-vertical-chute-connecting-to-the-dump-chute-in-the-cellar-body-dangling-from-the-rope.-Drawing-in-The-Cincinnati-Enquirer-Friday-May-31st-1878.jpg 800w\" title=\"Drawing showing the length of the vertical chute connecting to the dump chute in the cellar, body dangling from the rope.

The body was that of an old man in comparatively good health, not of a youth emaciated by the ravages of consumption. He was about to walk away when Snelbaker urged him to check, just in case. They pulled the body into the room and laid it on the floor. Blood trickled from a loosely stitched neck incision, forced out by the pressure of the rope. Slowly and somberly, Snelbaker loosened the rope around his neck so the cloth covering his face could be lifted.</p>\n<p>Harrison had been right; it wasn\u2019t the body of Augustus Devin. Under the cloth was the face of an elderly man, discolored and bruised from the rope and careless treatment at the hands of the resurrection men. He had short white hair and a snow-white beard cropped an inch below his chin. John Harrison staggered, suddenly weak at the knees. \u201cIt\u2019s father,\u201d he rasped, and collapsed to the floor. The body of the Honorable John Scott Harrison, buried in a cement-reinforced bricked vault less than 24 hours earlier, had been stolen from the grave, stripped of his clothing, shorn of his distinctive waist-length beard, and dangled from a rope in the cadaver chute of a medical school.</p>\n<p><center>~~ TO BE CONTINUED ~~</center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"A True Tale of Grave-Robbing Horror, Part I\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29198\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/29198#comments\">35 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-44649\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44649\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Coming attractions\">Coming attractions</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, October 30th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>I won\u2019t be posting a full article today because I\u2019m working on a special Halloween treat for all you boys and girls.

These estimates are based mainly on the type of interrals: coffin burials. The wood has not survived, but the coffin nails have. There are few grave goods \u2014 a coin, an iron ring and two modest pieces of Greek pottery from the Hellenistic period \u2014 but nothing clearly datable to the Roman period. A Roman-era necropolis was found nearby during construction of the main road, so this may be a continuation of the same burial ground.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-3.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44632\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-3-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-3-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-3-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-3-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-3.jpg 1359w\" title=\"Skeleton unearthed in Batroun graveyard. Joseph Eid/AFP\" width=\"150\"/></a>Batroun is one of the most ancient cities in the world, although the date of its founding is ambiguous. Ancient sources appear to differ on the matter, and it\u2019s hard to pin down because the name of the town changes. The city of \u201cBatruna\u201d is mentioned by Rib-Hadda, the king of Gubla (Byblos to the Greeks), in <a href=\"http://www.kchanson.com/ITK/amarna79.html\" target=\"_blank\">EA 79</a> of the Amarna letters, a collection of diplomatic correspondence to Pharaoh Akhenaten incised on clay tablets in the 14th century B.C.; some scholars believe this Batruna is Batroun. However, 2nd century B.C. Greek historian Menander of Ephesus is quoted in Flavius Josephus\u2019s <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em> (<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link82HCH0013\" target=\"_blank\">Book VIII, 13, 2</a>) saying \u201cthe city Botrys in Phoenicia\u201d was founded by Ithobaal I of Tyre, the 9th century B.C. Phoenician king whose daughter Jezebel became infamous thanks to the Biblical account of her marriage to Ahab. The Greek name for Batroun is Botrys, Bothrys or Bostrys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44634\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard-430x287.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Skeleton-in-Batroun-graveyard.jpg 1359w\" title=\"Detail of skeleton in Batroun graveyard.

It was subsequently conquered by the Assyrians, Alexander the Great, the Arab Iturean tribes and the Romans. It was part of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch when on July 9th, 551 A.D., it was all but destroyed by a massive earthquake that levelled many Levantine cities. It reappears in the historical record in the 12th century when Crusaders took it from the Emirate of Banu Ammar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Batroun-Phoenician-wall.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44637\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Batroun-Phoenician-wall-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Batroun-Phoenician-wall-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Batroun-Phoenician-wall-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Batroun-Phoenician-wall-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Phoenician wall in Batroun, Lebanon.

Radiocarbon dating should confirm the date of this necropolis.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Ancient cemetery unearthed in Batroun, Lebanon\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44630\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44630#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-44617\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44617\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Rare Pictish cross slab found on Orkney\">Rare Pictish cross slab found on Orkney</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, October 28th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>The Orkney Islands at the northern tip of Scotland have a uniquely <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/42744\" target=\"_blank\">rich archaeological patrimony</a> going back 8,500 years to the Mesolithic era.

He saw that it wasn\u2019t a natural stone, but had been shaped and carved with designs. Much of the carved surface was obscured by its position in the cliff. Dr. Anderson-Whymark was able to see part of the carving, a beast or dragon in an S-shape that is characteristic of Pictish design from the 3rd to the 8th centuries. Because more storms were expected within days, the stone had to be recovered as quickly as possible or risk literally falling off a cliff.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Pictish-Cross-Slab.-Photo-by-Dr-Hugo-Anderson-Whymark.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44623\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Pictish-Cross-Slab.-Photo-by-Dr-Hugo-Anderson-Whymark-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Pictish-Cross-Slab.-Photo-by-Dr-Hugo-Anderson-Whymark-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Pictish-Cross-Slab.-Photo-by-Dr-Hugo-Anderson-Whymark-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Pictish-Cross-Slab.-Photo-by-Dr-Hugo-Anderson-Whymark-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"The Pictish Cross Slab.

Once it was removed, experts identified it as a Pictish cross slab from the 8th century. The stone, 2.8 feet long by 1.8 feet wide and 3.6 inches thick, is incomplete and weathered, but an intricately carved cross stood out on the front face with the dragon/beast at its side. The rear face, even more weathered than the front, featured another beast with what looks like a beak holding a staff.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-reverse-side-of-the-slab.-Photo-by-UHI-Archaeology-Institute..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44624\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-reverse-side-of-the-slab.-Photo-by-UHI-Archaeology-Institute.-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-reverse-side-of-the-slab.-Photo-by-UHI-Archaeology-Institute.-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-reverse-side-of-the-slab.-Photo-by-UHI-Archaeology-Institute.-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-reverse-side-of-the-slab.-Photo-by-UHI-Archaeology-Institute.-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"The reverse side of the slab.

The Al-Qarawiyyin library has been in continuous operation since the 10th century and is believed to be the oldest library in the world.

In a fitting tribute to its founder, the person in charge of the restoration is a woman, Canadian-Moroccan architect Aziza Chaouni.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Inside the library are ornately carved wooden window frames and archways, colorful ceramic tile designs on the floors and elegant Arabic calligraphy engraved in the walls. The high ceilings in the reading room are adorned with gold chandeliers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a big restoration because there was a need for the building and the manuscripts to be preserved,\u201d said Abdullah al-Henda, part of the restoration team that\u2019s been working on the restoration since 2012. \u201cThere were problems of infiltration, of sewage, degradation of walls, some cracks in different places in the library.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/9th-century-Quran.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-44612\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/9th-century-Quran-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/9th-century-Quran-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/9th-century-Quran-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/9th-century-Quran-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"9th century Quran written on camel leather with kufic calligraphy, at the Al-Qarawiyyin Library.

It\u2019s particularly meaningful to have a book written in his hand, because after university he began his career as a calligrapher for the Chancellery in Tunis. When he moved to Fez shortly thereafter, he got a job writing royal proclamations for the Sultan. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhen you read a book, you travel in history. When you see a manuscript that is nearly ten or more centuries old, you travel in time. As I said, the library gives you a spiritual bond for these and other reasons.

Now that the restoration of the structure is almost complete with new gutters, solar panels and air conditioning, the manuscripts finally have a room suited to their preservation. It is climate controlled with a custom temperature and humidity settings as well as a state-of-the-art security system. The restored library also has a new laboratory for the treatment and conservation of its historic manuscripts.</p>\n<p>Right now, only curator Abdelfattah Bougchouf has access to the rare manuscripts kept in the secure room. With the help of experts from the Institute of Computational Linguistics in Italy, that will soon change. All 4,000+ manuscripts are being digitized in the new laboratory. This will make them widely available to students and researchers all over the world. About 20% of them have been digitized so far. The scanning process will also highlight any small holes and areas in need of conservation that are not necessarily evident to the naked eye.</p>\n<p>The library will reopen to the public in May 2017.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"242\" src=\"http://players.brightcove.net/665003303001/4k5gFJHRe_default/index.html?videoId=5179208687001\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Oldest library in the world renovated, digitized\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44602\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44602#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-44586\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44586\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Help bring Ruby Slippers, Scarecrow back together\">Help bring Ruby Slippers, Scarecrow back together</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, October 26th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ruby-slippers.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-44598\" height=\"158\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ruby-slippers-200x158.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ruby-slippers-200x158.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ruby-slippers-150x118.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ruby-slippers-430x340.jpg 430w\" title=\"Dorothy's Ruby Slippers, 1939, The Wizard of Oz.

The Smithsonian\u2019s budget is sufficient to keep the Ruby Slippers relatively stable in their current condition, but they turned to Kickstarter for the money to conserve the shoes and create a custom state-of-the-art display case with light, temperature and humidity controls that will ensure the long-term preservation of one of the museum\u2019s most iconic film artifacts.</p>\n<p>Costume designer Adrian made several pairs of Ruby Slippers for the movie. This pair was worn when Dorothy danced down the Yellow Brick Road, and their condition attests to their hard use. In 1939 (and for decades afterwards), costumes were made to last for the duration of shooting. Materials were chosen to look good at low cost. Adrian took commercial shoes, spray-painted them red and attached a red net with red sequins and beads. The red color of the sequins is a coating of cellulose nitrate lacquer. In the 77 years since the shoes were made, the color has faded given the slippers a muted, dingy look. The nitrocellulose coating is cracked and flaking. Threads stitching the sequins to the net are breaking. The red paint on the soles is cracking and the sole is coming apart from the top of the shoe. (See <a href=\"http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/conservator-ruby-slippers-sparkle\" target=\"_blank\">this interview</a> with the conservator of the Ruby Slippers for more details about their complex conservation needs.)</p>\n<p>The money raised would go to repairing what could be repaired (without ruining the original evidence of use because that is an important part of their history), but also towards researching how best to approach the conservation of materials like the sequin coating about which we know very little. That is essential to ensuring that the new display case is properly set to keep the Ruby Slippers in ideal conservation conditions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scarecrow.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44597\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scarecrow-99x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scarecrow-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scarecrow-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scarecrow-430x646.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scarecrow.jpg 442w\" title=\"Scarecrow costume, 1939, The Wizard of Oz.

The goal was met and exceeded within a week, thanks to donations from more than 5,000 people from 41 countries on every inhabited continent. With another 21 days to go, the Smithsonian has added a stretch goal of $85,000 for the conservation and display of the patchwork <a href=\"http://newsdesk.si.edu/snapshot/scarecrow-costume\" target=\"_blank\">Scarecrow costume</a> worn by Ray Bolger in the movie.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Scarecrow will need a full conservation assessment to determine which materials were used to construct the costume. This will include working with scientists to identify the materials and conducting historical research. We will take a close look at the textiles and dyes that are extremely sensitive to light and wear. We need to understand what condition they are in to determine what treatment will best conserve and preserve them. Once those issues are addressed, we can decide how best to display the costume.

Coin expert Gregory Tong recognized it as one of Britain\u2019s rarest coins: a 1703 Queen Anne \u2018Vigo\u2019 five-guinea gold coin, made from gold taken from Spanish treasure galleons at the Battle of Vigo Bay in October 1702.</p>\n<p>It was the early days of the War of Spanish Succession, when the last decrepit, inbred Hapsburg king of Spain died putting the Bourbon Philip V, son of Louis XIV of France, on the throne and threatening the Balance of Power in Europe. The allied fleets of Britain and the Dutch Republic had attempted to capture the port of C\u00e1diz at the end of August 1702, hoping to gain a base in the Mediterranean for their ships and to cripple Spain\u2019s access to the wealth of its New World colonies. The attempt was a disastrous failure. Craft and ships were lost in the landing, troops pillaged port towns and never even got to C\u00e1diz itself. As September came and no progress was made, bad weather became an issue. On September 30th, the Allied fleet left with its proverbial tail between its legs.</p>\n<p>The C\u00e1diz debacle did have one useful consequence for the Allies: the Spanish silver fleet which usually landed at C\u00e1diz was forced to dock at  Vigo Bay in Galicia. Lacking the complex customs and trade infrastructure required to process the tons of silver and gold, the Spanish treasure ships and the French fleet protecting were locked into the bay for a month. The English command got wind of this as its ships were heading back to England, and figured they might at least make lemonade out of the C\u00e1diz lemons by attacking the treasure ships. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Battle-of-Vigo-bay-23-October-1702-Anonymous-ca.-1705.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44579\" height=\"111\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Battle-of-Vigo-bay-23-October-1702-Anonymous-ca.-1705-150x111.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Battle-of-Vigo-bay-23-October-1702-Anonymous-ca.-1705-150x111.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Battle-of-Vigo-bay-23-October-1702-Anonymous-ca.-1705-200x148.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Battle-of-Vigo-bay-23-October-1702-Anonymous-ca.-1705-430x318.jpg 430w\" title=\"Battle of Vigo bay, 23 October 1702, Anonymous Dutch painter, ca. 1705. Rijksmuseum.\" width=\"150\"/></a>On October 22nd, the Anglo-Dutch fleet entered Vigo Bay. The next day, they engaged the Spanish and French fleet. It was a total rout. Every single Spanish and French ship was either captured or burned. More than 2,000 men died on the Spanish-French side. Only 200 were lost on the Allied side. While most of the silver had already been unloaded from the treasure ships, the Allies did manage to score thousands of pounds of silver and a much smaller amount of gold.</p>\n<p>Really it wasn\u2019t that much of a monetary gain, but the outcome of Vigo Bay did persuade Portuguese King Peter II to join the Grand Alliance, and it gave the British some PR relief after the C\u00e1diz disaster. To fluff up the minor victory and obscure the major loss, silver and gold booty from the Spanish fleet was delivered to the Master of the Mint, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/35474\" target=\"_blank\">a certain Sir Isaac Newton</a>, to use in the production of commemorative coins, portable propaganda to convince people that the war was going well. He received 4,504 lb 2 oz of silver and just 7 lb 8 oz of gold, for a combined estimated value of a rather measly \u00a314,000. (Philip V of Spain made something like seven million pesos from the Vigo Bay caper because he was able to confiscate all the silver the ships were carrying meant for English and Dutch merchants, so money-wise, this victory was decidedly on the Pyrrhic side.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44576\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-150x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-200x198.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-430x427.jpg 430w\" title=\"1703 Queen Anne Vigo five-guinea coin, obverse.

Only 20 of the five-guinea pieces are believed to have been struck. The Vigo coins were meant to be circulated \u2014 the silver was made into crown, half-crown, shilling and six-penny pieces \u2014 but the gold five guinea coins were so expensive that only the very wealthiest people could afford them, and they weren\u2019t likely to spend them like cash.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-reverse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44575\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-reverse-141x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-reverse-141x150.jpg 141w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-reverse-200x212.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Queen-Anne-Vigo-coin-reverse-430x455.jpg 430w\" title=\"1703 Queen Anne Vigo five-guinea coin, reverse.

Only six of them have gone on the market in the last 50 years. The estimated value of the toy box coin is \u00a3200,000-250,000 ($243,620-$304,525), but it could easily sell for more given its rarity. The last Vigo coin to sell at auction went for just under \u00a3296,160 ($360,200) and that was in 2012.</p>\n<p>When the owner discovered that the coin he\u2019d played pirate treasure with was an actual treasure, he closed himself in the car and exulted so vigorously that the auction house staff could see the car bouncing as it was parked. He even came back the next day to be sure he wasn\u2019t getting punked. </p>\n<p>The coin goes on the auction block at Boningtons\u2019 Epping saleroom on Wednesday November 16th. </p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Extremely rare British coin found in boy\u2019s toy box\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44573\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44573#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-44562\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/44562\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 40+ ancient shipwrecks found in Black Sea\">40+ ancient shipwrecks found in Black Sea</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, October 24th, 2016</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>The <a href=\"http://blackseamap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Sea Maritime Archeology Project</a> wasn\u2019t looking for shipwrecks. Its brief is to survey the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea for data about the rise water levels after the last Ice Age 20,000 years ago. To accomplish this aim, marine archaeologists have been scanning the seabed using cutting edge Remotely Operated Vehicles that can detect land surfaces underneath what is now the Black Sea but in prehistory were on dry land. They\u2019ve also taken core samples, laser scanned and filmed the sea bed both in video and with high resolution 3D photogrammetry. One of the two Black Sea MAP ROVs has broken records for depth (1,800 meters or 5,905 feet) and speed (over six knots) and was able to survey 1,250 km (777 miles), recording everything with its path using a full panoply of geophysical instrumentation, high definition cameras and a laser scanner. </p>\n<p>A felicitous but entirely unplanned side-effect of this exceptionally thorough geophysical survey is <a href=\"http://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/10/black-sea.page\" target=\"_blank\">the discovery of more than 40 historic shipwrecks</a>, including ancient Byzantine, medieval and Ottoman ships. Some of them may even be the first of their kind ever found, previously known only from documentary sources. Such a large, varied group of shipwrecks from different periods will give archaeologists a whole new understanding of trade and maritime links between towns on the coast of the Black Sea.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[University of Southampton professor and Principle Investigator on the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project Jon] Adams comments: \u201cThe wrecks are a complete bonus, but a fascinating discovery, found during the course of our extensive geophysical surveys. They are astonishingly preserved due to the anoxic conditions (absence of oxygen) of the Black Sea below 150 metres.</p>\n<p>\u201cUsing the latest 3D recording technique for underwater structures, we\u2019ve been able to capture some astonishing images without disturbing the sea bed. We are now among the very best exponents of this practice methodology and certainly no-one has achieved models of this completeness on shipwrecks at these depths.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>With the data from the ROVs, researchers have created 3D digital models using the photogrammetry process. Software calculates the position of millions of points captured in thousands of photographs and builds a model which is then overlaid with the visual elements from the pictures to make it look real. The resulting 3D models of the shipwrecks are, to put it mildly, spectacular. Minute details are clearly visible. There is no pixelation and the kind of visibility difficulties that might impede clear video are no match for 3D photogrammetry. The results speak for themselves:</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photogrammetric-model-of-a-shipwreck-from-the-Medieval-period.-Rodrigo-Pacheco-Ruiz..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-44565\" height=\"241\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photogrammetric-model-of-a-shipwreck-from-the-Medieval-period.-Rodrigo-Pacheco-Ruiz.-430x241.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photogrammetric-model-of-a-shipwreck-from-the-Medieval-period.-Rodrigo-Pacheco-Ruiz.-430x241.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photogrammetric-model-of-a-shipwreck-from-the-Medieval-period.-Rodrigo-Pacheco-Ruiz.-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photogrammetric-model-of-a-shipwreck-from-the-Medieval-period.-Rodrigo-Pacheco-Ruiz.-200x112.jpg 200w\" title=\"Photogrammetric model of a shipwreck from the Medieval period.

His mother had had three miscarriages before Paul was born (she apparently kept the miscarried fetuses in jars in the family home), so he was very much beloved. His teenaged years were troubled and he was sent to boarding school where his boredom and appreciation for Baudelaire inspired him to write his own poetry. After he graduated, he had few interests besides pursuing his poetry. He enrolled in law school in 1862 but dropped out, preferring to hang with his artist friends in Paris. </p>\n<p>He published his first poem in a literary magazine in 1863. His father, hoping like so many parents of artists before and after him that he would get a \u201creal job,\u201d secured him employment at an insurance company, then at City Hall. Verlaine continued to write even as he worked his 9-5 jobs. In 1866, when he was 22, his first collection of poems, <em>Po\u00e8mes saturniens</em>, was published. It was well-received and established him as a significant new talent on the scene.</p>\n<p>His personal life, on the other hand, was a mess. He still lived at home with his parents. He drank to excess and was a brutally violent drunk. After his first love (his cousin who was raised by his parents after she was orphaned and wisely married someone else) died in childbirth in 1867, he tried to kill his mother several times in an alcoholic haze. At his mother\u2019s vigorous encouragement, he got married in of August 1870 to Mathilde Maut\u00e9. He was 26; she was 17. They moved to Paris where, as a supporter of the Paris Commune, he enlisted in the National Guard and patrolled the streets of a quiet neighborhood every other night. When the Commune fell in May 1871, Verlaine fled the repression of the Communards. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Portrait-of-Arthur-Rimbaud-at-seventeen-by-\u00c9tienne-Carjat-December-1871..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44555\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 119px) 100vw, 119px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Portrait-of-Arthur-Rimbaud-at-seventeen-by-\u00c9tienne-Carjat-December-1871.-e1477277364479-119x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Portrait-of-Arthur-Rimbaud-at-seventeen-by-\u00c9tienne-Carjat-December-1871.-e1477277364479-119x150.jpg 119w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Portrait-of-Arthur-Rimbaud-at-seventeen-by-\u00c9tienne-Carjat-December-1871.-e1477277364479-200x251.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Portrait-of-Arthur-Rimbaud-at-seventeen-by-\u00c9tienne-Carjat-December-1871.-e1477277364479-430x540.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Portrait-of-Arthur-Rimbaud-at-seventeen-by-\u00c9tienne-Carjat-December-1871.-e1477277364479.jpg 903w\" title=\"Portrait of Arthur Rimbaud at seventeen, by \u00c9tienne Carjat, December 1871.\" width=\"119\"/></a>He was back in the city by September which is when he met Arthur Rimbaud for the first time. Rimbaud was a fan of Verlaine\u2019s poetry and had sent him several letters included poems of his own. In January of 1872, Verlaine invited the 17-year-old to moved in with him and Mathilde, an arrangement which was fraught with tension. There was a newborn in the house \u2014 Mathilde had given birth to their son Georges in October of 1871 \u2014 and Verlaine\u2019s relationship with the teenaged poet quickly developed into a tempestuous sexual and emotional affair. Meanwhile, his alcoholism and violence increased. He beat Mathilde whenever he drank, threatened to kill her, even hit their infant son, once throwing him against a wall. She took the baby and left.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/By-the-Table-by-Henri-Fantin-Latour-1872.-Mus\u00e9e-dOrsay..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44558\" height=\"110\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/By-the-Table-by-Henri-Fantin-Latour-1872.-Mus\u00e9e-dOrsay.-150x110.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/By-the-Table-by-Henri-Fantin-Latour-1872.-Mus\u00e9e-dOrsay.-150x110.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/By-the-Table-by-Henri-Fantin-Latour-1872.-Mus\u00e9e-dOrsay.-200x147.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/By-the-Table-by-Henri-Fantin-Latour-1872.-Mus\u00e9e-dOrsay.-430x317.jpg 430w\" title=\"By the Table by Henri Fantin-Latour, 1872.

They collaborated on poetry, drank absinthe by the keg, smoked opium and fought like wolverines, scandalizing even their circle of poets and intellectuals. After a desultory attempt to win back Mathilde by promising her he\u2019d never see Arthur again, Verlaine left Paris with Rimbaud July of 1872 for Brussels. In September they moved on to London. There they spent almost a year off and on, fighting, drinking, breaking up, making up and generally being miserable with each other. Rimbaud tried to stab Verlaine. Verlaine called Rimbaud his \u201cinfernal spouse.\u201d Rimbaud would write about this time in the aptly named <em>A Season in Hell</em>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-2-1873-Christies.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44552\" height=\"91\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-2-1873-Christies-150x91.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-2-1873-Christies-150x91.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-2-1873-Christies-200x121.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-2-1873-Christies-430x262.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-2-1873-Christies.jpg 1326w\" title=\"Verlaine's revolver.

Rimbaud went to Brussels, but told Verlaine he was going to Paris instead of staying with him. On the morning of July 10th, 1873, Verlaine bought a Lefaucheux 7mm six-shooter from the Montigny armory in Brussels. He wrote to his family and friends to inform them he planned suicide, spent the rest of the morning drinking, then returned to his room with Rimbaud. When the younger man announced he was leaving, Verlaine fired at him twice, intending murder. He barely wounded him, one bullet grazing his left wrist, the other ricocheting off the wall into the chimney.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-1873-Christies.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-44553\" height=\"85\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-1873-Christies-150x85.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-1873-Christies-150x85.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-1873-Christies-200x113.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-1873-Christies-430x244.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-revolver-1873-Christies.jpg 1387w\" title=\"Verlaine's revolver.

When he reached for his pocket, Rimbaud ran to the police who arrested Verlaine. Rimbaud withdraw his complaint the next day, Verlaine was tried for assault with pederasty as an aggravating factor. On August 8th, he was sentenced to two years in the prison of Petites Carmes. In October he was transferred to the prison in Mons. He was released early for good behavior after 555 days of incarceration on January 16th, 1875.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-drinking-absinthe-in-the-Caf\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois-1er-in-1892-photographed-by-Paul-Marsan-Dornac.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44554\" height=\"101\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-drinking-absinthe-in-the-Caf\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois-1er-in-1892-photographed-by-Paul-Marsan-Dornac-150x101.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-drinking-absinthe-in-the-Caf\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois-1er-in-1892-photographed-by-Paul-Marsan-Dornac-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-drinking-absinthe-in-the-Caf\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois-1er-in-1892-photographed-by-Paul-Marsan-Dornac-200x134.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-drinking-absinthe-in-the-Caf\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois-1er-in-1892-photographed-by-Paul-Marsan-Dornac-430x289.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Verlaine-drinking-absinthe-in-the-Caf\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois-1er-in-1892-photographed-by-Paul-Marsan-Dornac.jpg 1452w\" title=\"Verlaine drinking absinthe in the Caf\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois 1er in 1892, photographed by Paul Marsan Dornac\" width=\"150\"/></a>The two saw each other one last time in 1885. Rimbaud died of cancer six years later. He was 37. Verlaine died broke, drunk, diabetic and syphilitic in 1896 at the age of 51.</p>\n<p>He never thought to claim his revolver from the police. They sent it back to Montigny where it remained in their archives, unknown to the public, for close to a century. When the Montigny company filed for bankruptcy in the 1980s and had to liquidate all its inventory, the owner reached out to his good friend and weapons collector Jacques Ruth to buy some of their stock. In gratitude, he gave Ruth the revolver at the center of the notorious Brussels Affair. </p>\n<p>Ruth didn\u2019t grasp its cultural significance at the time. He only realized what a scandalous treasure he had when he saw the 1995 film <em>Total Eclipse</em> starring David Thewlis as Verlaine and Leonardo DiCaprio as Rimbaud. In 2004, a new exhibition dedicated to the life and work of Paul Verlaine opened in Brussels. Ruth notified the curator that he had the famous revolver. The curator thought he was joking, but research confirmed that it was the real deal, serial number 14096, listed in the Montigny registry book as the one Verlaine bought on July 10th, 1873. It went on display for the first time at a 2015 exhibition on Verlaine held at the Mons prison where he did time.</p>\n<p>The Lefaucheux six-shooter #14096 <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/about/press-center/releases/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=8485\" target=\"_blank\">goes on the auction block</a> at The Exceptional Sale at Christie\u2019s Paris on November 30th.

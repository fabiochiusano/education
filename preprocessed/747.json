The 50-foot ship, dubbed the Panarea III, and its cargo of amphorae were at a depth of 426 feet (130 meters), deep enough to keep it out reach of treasure hunters and naval traffic. The submersibles weren\u2019t able to dive deeply enough to retrieve any objects from the wreck, so this year the Superintendent enlisted technical divers from the non-profit Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) to explore the site and recover a few artifacts. They also had the aid of two high tech submersibles with gripper arms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Diver_blowing_silt_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33159\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Diver_blowing_silt_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Diver_blowing_silt_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Diver_blowing_silt_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Diver_blowing_silt_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Diver blows silt away from pillar revealing buried section\" width=\"200\"/></a>They found a well-preserved wooden portion of the ship\u2019s keel and recovered 16 artifacts \u2014 amphorae, pottery vessels, fishing plates and the altar \u2014 from the wreck, all of them in excellent condition. Divers didn\u2019t realize what the altar was when they first saw it on the edge of the amphora field. It looked like a little pillar initially. When they blew away some of the accumulated silt, they found the bottom of it was mostly buried. About a foot in diameter at the widest point and three inches high, that was actually the top of the altar, a basin used to burn incense in ritual offerings. The base of the pedestal was found next to it. There are metal supports embedded in the base, probably the remains of fasteners to keep it from going overboard at the first swell. It\u2019s engraved with three Greek letters (ETH) and there\u2019s a decorative wave relief around the edge of the basin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Team_w_amphora.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-33154\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Team_w_amphora-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Team_w_amphora-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Team_w_amphora-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Team_w_amphora-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Divers and archaeologists with recovered artifacts\" width=\"200\"/></a>Archaeologists dated the objects to between 218 and 210 B.C. Because the cargo was mostly Greco-Italic jars but with Punic amphorae in the bow of the ship, archaeologists believe it was a Greek trading vessel that traveled between Rome and Carthage, possibly supplying the fleet of Roman consul <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/marcellu.html\" target=\"_blank\">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> who was commander of Sicily from 214 to 211 B.C. These were dangerous times to be a merchant in the Mediterranean. The crew of the Panarea III had eminently good reason to bolt an altar to the ship\u2019s deck and make copious sacrifices to the gods. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Amphora_Diver_sub.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33155\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Amphora_Diver_sub-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Amphora_Diver_sub-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Amphora_Diver_sub-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Amphora_Diver_sub-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Diver and submersible find an amphora\" width=\"200\"/></a>The Second Punic War started in 218 B.C. and while the most famous military encounters between Carthage and the Roman Republic involved elephants, alps, the Fabian strategy and pitched battles with body counts so disastrously high to this day they are ranked as among the most costly battles in human history, Carthage and Rome threw fleets of ships at each other too. Rome was rather more successful on water than they were on land in the first eight years, winning major naval encounters around Sicily and Sardinia. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Divers_cleaning_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-33158\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Divers_cleaning_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE-200x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Divers_cleaning_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE-200x112.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Divers_cleaning_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE-150x84.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Divers_cleaning_Pillar_near_amphora_GUE-430x241.jpg 430w\" title=\"Divers cleaning the pillar next to the amphora field\" width=\"200\"/></a>Marcellus was successful on land as well, particularly when given command of Sicily. He besieged the city of Syracuse, then allied to Carthage and a powerful potential foothold for Hannibal in his struggle to conquer Italy, for two years (214 B.C. \u2013 212 B.C.) by sea and by land. It took so long to take the city because it was ably defended by high walls and the ingenious inventions of Archimedes. After the Romans finally found a weak point in the wall and broke through, a soldier came upon Archimedes in his study and killed him despite Marcellus\u2019 order that the great mathematician not be harmed.</p>\n<p>The artifacts recovered from the shipwreck will be conserved and eventually put on display at the <a href=\"http://www.regione.sicilia.it/beniculturali/museolipari/pagina.asp?Idlingua=2&amp;Id=1\" target=\"_blank\">Aeolian Archaeological Museum of Lipari</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"2,200-year-old altar found on Italo-Greek shipwreck\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33149\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33149#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-33135\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33135\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Sistine Chapel gets new LED lighting, climate control systems\">Sistine Chapel gets new LED lighting, climate control systems</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, October 30th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SistineChapel_NewLight.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33144\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SistineChapel_NewLight-121x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SistineChapel_NewLight-121x150.jpg 121w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SistineChapel_NewLight-200x247.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SistineChapel_NewLight-430x531.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SistineChapel_NewLight.jpg 744w\" title=\"Sistine Chapel illuminated by new LED light system\" width=\"121\"/></a>The Vatican debuted a cutting edge <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sistine-chapel-new-led-lights-and-air-conditioning-system/\" target=\"_blank\">new LED lighting system in the Sistine Chapel</a> on Wednesday. Designed and installed by the <a href=\"http://www.osram.com/osram_com/news-and-knowledge/innovation/new-light-for-the-sistine-chapel/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">German company Osram</a>, the new system features more than 7,000 light-emitting diodes mounted behind a cornice high up on the walls. It\u2019s energy efficient, requiring up to 90% less electricity than the 1980s halogen lighting system it replaced while providing five to ten times more brightness. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Test-installation-of-LED-system.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33146\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Test-installation-of-LED-system-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Test-installation-of-LED-system-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Test-installation-of-LED-system-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Test-installation-of-LED-system-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Test of the LED system at 3250 Kelvin\" width=\"150\"/></a>Using a full complement of red, green, blue, warm white and cool white LED lights, the new system illuminates the complete color spectrum of the frescoes. It took four years of careful analysis by lighting designers, restorers and colorimetry experts to ensure the LEDs were set to properly light the original colors without altering their hue. They analyzed 280 points of the fresco pigments using a non-invasive system that illuminates the points with a calibrated light and measures the reflected spectrum. This highly accurate data served as the benchmark for the adjustments to the LED lights.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_before.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-33143\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_before-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_before-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_before-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_before-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_before.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Sistine Chapel ceiling before LED lighting installed\" width=\"200\"/></a>This is a huge change, beneficial to visitors and the long-term stability of the frescoes. The old system had eight 150 watt spotlights and two 1,000 watt projectors installed outside the chapel windows. They were big and hot, but because the windows were covered with semi-transparent plastic to protect the frescoes from damaging UV radiation, much of their light was absorbed before it made indoors. The end result was a perpetual low-contrast twilight which made the art harder to see and cast shadows on the works that were not spotlit. In a lesser chamber, this might not be much of a loss, but the works on the side walls of the chapel were painted by the likes of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_after.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33142\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_after-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_after-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_after-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_after-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sistinechapel_ceiling_after.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Sistine Chapel ceiling after LED lighting installed\" width=\"200\"/></a>The new LEDs and accompanying reflectors ensure that not only are Michelangelo\u2019s immortal ceiling and Last Judgment now lit with a homogeneous, visually accurate and glare-free light, but all of the art of the Sistine Chapel is illuminated to its greatest advantage. The end result is exceptionally vivid color, brightness, readability and boosted optical effects from the foreshortening technique Michelangelo used. The impression conveyed is one of enhanced three dimensionality. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_before.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33141\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_before-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_before-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_before-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_before-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_before.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Fresco detail before new lighting\" width=\"150\"/></a>Preserving the paintings and improving the visitor experience were priorities in the installation of a new climate control system as well. When the old system was installed in the early 1990s, the Sistine Chapel was visited by fewer than two million people a year. That number has more than tripled since then, and six million sweating, breathing, stinking, dirt-tracking humans do a number on the environment in a closed space. The new air conditioning and filtration system, <a href=\"http://www.utc.com/News/BIS/Pages/Carrier-Unveils-Innovative-Solution-to-Preserve-Michelangelos-Frescoes-in-the-Si.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">designed by Carrier</a>, a part of United Technologies Corp., the same company that designed the first air conditioning system in 1993.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_after.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33140\" height=\"112\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_after-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_after-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_after-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_after-430x321.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fresco_detail_after.jpg 1280w\" title=\"Fresco detail after new lighting\" width=\"150\"/></a>For two years engineers studied the climate inside the chapel, using the latest and greatest simulation tools to understand the movement of air, moisture and particulate matter in the space. I love this quote from Jackie Anderson, Senior Engineer at UTC: \u201cThinking about the Sistine Chapel and the air within it, it\u2019s probably some of the most interesting air I will ever deal with.\u201d Analysis of the issues required huge computational resources and resolving them took a great deal of ingenuity, especially since the final system had to be \u201cchurch quiet,\u201d nearly invisible and utilize pre-existing ductwork since obviously this is a historic building and you can\u2019t just drill holes in it wherever. </p>\n<p>There was a lot on the line. If the temperature, humidity, dust and pollutants could not be controlled, then the Vatican was going to have to take drastic action to preserve the paintings, ie, close the chapel to tourists, something it definitely did not want to do. Carbon dioxide levels were a most pressing concern. In 2010, curators found areas of the paint were <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/vatican-tourists-harming-sistine-chapel-frescoes-26579443\" target=\"_blank\">developing a crusty white patina</a>. Analysis of the white powder found it was composed of calcium carbonate and calcium bicarbonate deposits, probably formed when rising carbon dioxide levels and humidity moved through the plaster walls of the chapel. The white patches were removed easily with no damage to the paint, but the situation was a big red flag that the old systems were no longer able to control the elements.</p>\n<p>The new air conditioning system has three times greater cooling capacity, twice as energy efficient, six filtration levels and 70 different sensors to monitor the numbers of visitors and the air quality. The room will remain perpetually at 77 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, with temperatures, ventilation and humidity levels adjusted according to the number of people in the chapel. The system taps into three security cameras to actually count the bodies in the room at any given time and then governs itself accordingly. It can be monitored from a computer, tablet or a smartphone.</p>\n<p>The total cost of both lighting and climate control systems is estimated to be around $3.8 million. The companies donated their services, plus there was additional funding support from the EU.</p>\n<p>This video lingers on the frescoes under the new lighting system:</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/tvLv7T_PrOA&amp;w=430]</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a Carrier video about the new air system. There isn\u2019t much detail about the technology, sadly, but there is that quote from Jackie Anderson and several cool glimpses of the simulations.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://youtu.be/wfFppqDDeRU&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Sistine Chapel gets new LED lighting, climate control systems\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33135\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33135#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-33116\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33116\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to 50,000 artifacts found in tunnel under Teotihuacan temple\">50,000 artifacts found in tunnel under Teotihuacan temple</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, October 29th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tunnel-grid.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33122\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tunnel-grid-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tunnel-grid-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tunnel-grid-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tunnel-grid-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Artifacts in the tunnel underneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent in Teotihuacan\" width=\"200\"/></a>When last we saw the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2013/05/01\" target=\"_blank\">tunnel underneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent</a> in Teotihuacan, the remote vehicle Tl\u00e1loc II-TC had forged 65 feet ahead of the point where humans could tread and identified the presence of three chambers with its infrared camera and laser scanner.

I have long been an admirer of the historical handwriting and typeface fonts created by <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Three Islands Press</a> (3IP).

Rusk's handwriting, Texas Hero font\" width=\"150\"/></a>A:</strong> Back in 1994, when I was doing a little graphic design and desktop publishing on the side, I had occasion for some reason to use a font that looked like old handwriting, but I couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. So I decided to create one. At the time, my mom \u2014 a historical librarian \u2014 worked at The Center for American History at the University of Texas, so I asked if she could send me copies of any old letters she might find lying around. Within a week or two, she\u2019d sent me photocopies of a whole bunch of letters written by famous early Texans like Sam Houston, Mirabeau B Lamar, Emily Austin Perry, and Thomas J Rusk. Rusk\u2019s handwriting seemed the most legible and least peculiar of the bunch, so I chose to work with that.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.oldfonts.com/texashero.html\" target=\"_blank\">Texas Hero</a> was the result.]</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">What was the first handwriting font you created and when was that?</font><br/>\nA:</strong> The first handwriting font I created was also the first font I created \u2014 and it was not at all historical. The year was 1993. I was working either in the production or editorial department (I spent time in both) at a company that published trade magazines, and one of our art directors had some of the coolest hand-lettering I\u2019d ever seen. I had by then experimented briefly with (then) Altsys Fontographer making logos and such and proposed turning her handwriting into a font. She agreed and drew out the alphabet on a piece of poster board. A few weeks (months?) later, I\u2019d finished my first generation of the <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP00101\" target=\"_blank\">Marydale family</a>. It\u2019s what got me started in this whole wacky enterprise.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">Fonts were only a decade old in the early 90s, the province of computer manufacturers, software companies and visionary traditional typesetters like Monotype. Did you have any experience in graphic design or typesetting? How did you go from curiosity to execution? What tools did you use? How long did it take you to make the first one?</font><br/>\nA:</strong> I had absolutely no training in typography at all. Up until then I\u2019d worked mainly as a journalist \u2014 but that career had, by the mid- to late-1980s, put me in close proximity with early Apple Macintosh computers, and I couldn\u2019t stop playing around most evenings with programs like Adobe Illustrator and (then) Aldus Pagemaker. Just fiddling. Exploring. Learning things. Soon I was offering to design newsletters for a couple of local non-profits I belonged to, and before I knew it I actually had some paying graphic design jobs.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d guess it took me a couple hundred hours to make that first version of Marydale. I would scan each character very large, hand-trace it with Illustrator\u2019s vector tools, import the outlines into Fontographer, and finish things up there. I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was doing at first, but when you have a perfectionist streak you tend to keep banging away until you arrive at that \u201cVoila!\u201d moment. I had a bunch of those moments along the way, but I\u2019m sure my font-making methods remain roundabout and inefficient. This all happened a year or two before the Web exploded on the scene, but I figured I\u2019d release those first few fonts as shareware on CompuServe and America Online. I was pretty dang stunned \u2014 albeit pleasantly so \u2014 when checks started arriving in the mail. Which is pretty much all the incentive you need to keep going in a capitalist society like ours, ha ha.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/01.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Emily Austin Perry letter home\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33066\" height=\"115\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/01-150x115.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/01-150x115.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/01-200x154.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/01-430x332.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/01.jpg 720w\" title=\"Emily Austin Perry letter home\" width=\"150\"/></a>Over the years, as I\u2019ve learned more about type design, I\u2019ve repeatedly gone back and revised my early type designs \u2014 fixing inconsistencies, adding OpenType features, stuff like that. I now use FontLab Studio to create all my type.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">Did you think of it as a form of historical preservation from the beginning? Now that pen-to-paper writing has become increasingly rare as even the few remaining formal settings for handwriting like wedding invitations go virtual, has that added a sense of urgency to your work?</font><br/>\nA:</strong> Not at first. I thought of it as: 1) a really cool, fun, sometimes tedious form of play; 2) a way to provide new and interesting resources for graphic designers. But I couldn\u2019t help becoming immersed in the content of the source materials \u2014 Emily Perry\u2019s letters home, Sam Houston\u2019s \u201ctalks\u201d to his Native American compadres \u2014 and I began to understand and empathize with the kind of urgent devotion to communication that went into putting pen to paper back then. Ironically, of course, this whole crazy pursuit of mine quite logically coincided with a modern decline in the art of handwriting. Heck, these days cursive is rarely even taught in school. I never saw it coming, but in the past few years it\u2019s dawned on me that my type work truly is a kind of an odd form of historical preservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">Do you deliberately set out to look for good font candidates or do you mainly stumble on them in the course of doing other things?</font><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ssletter1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Page one of Rev.

The first few fonts, especially, came from random moments of, \u201cHey, cool!\u201d Once I started getting interested in the historical stuff, though, I have tended to keep an eye out for interesting source documents \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP00601\" target=\"_blank\">Schooner Script</a> is the result of an off-hand query I made to the owner of a local antique shop, and <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP01501\" target=\"_blank\">Broadsheet</a> came from some old newspaper pages saved by a dealer of ancient longcase clocks. While on a trip to England several years ago, I came upon a business specializing in antique maps and ended up buying a page of an early-18th century Atlas: <a href=\"http://www.oldfonts.com/antiquarianscribe.html\" target=\"_blank\">Antiquarian Scribe</a>.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019ve also made fonts on a whim or at the suggestion of a customer. An example of the former is <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP01901\" target=\"_blank\">Viktorie</a>, modeled after the barely legible scrawl of a waitress in a local restaurant; an example of the latter is <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP02301\" target=\"_blank\">Douglass Pen</a>, after I had my interest piqued by an actor who had portrayed \u2014 and therefore knew a heck of a lot about \u2014 the famous American abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglass.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">What characteristics make for a good handwriting or historical typeface font?</font><br/>\nA:</strong> I\u2019m not sure I know that answer to that, at least not generally. I\u2019d say a modicum of legibility, for one. But beyond that I suppose just an interesting sort of look or flourish or expressiveness that strikes you, that at once (if subliminally) makes you wonder at the character and personality of the person who took pen to paper (or set the type) in the first place. For some reason I\u2019m reminded of my <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP01001\" target=\"_blank\">Bonsai font</a>, an interpretation of a flawed, topheavy letterpress job. I\u2019ve often wondered if the printers noticed the problem and maybe thought, \u201cMeh, it\u2019s legible enough.\u201d (I, for one, think it\u2019s lovely.)</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">You make a point of explaining where the font came from in all your descriptions. How important is the backstory \u2014 the author of the hand, the source of the writing \u2014 to you?</font><br/>\nA:</strong> Really important. Essential, to me \u2014 and, I think, to the folks who have licensed my fonts. I think humans generally have a keen curiosity about how things got the way they are and where things come from. Where we came from. Witness our interest in genealogy. Since we have fairly good memories, centuries of records at our fingertips, and brains that are prone to solving puzzles and imagining things, it\u2019s no wonder that our thoughts turn to the preservation and illumination of the dim times that have gone before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Emily_Austin_Perry.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Emily Austin Perry\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33067\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Emily_Austin_Perry-116x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Emily_Austin_Perry-116x150.jpg 116w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Emily_Austin_Perry-200x258.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Emily_Austin_Perry-430x555.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Emily_Austin_Perry.jpg 577w\" title=\"Emily Austin Perry\" width=\"116\"/></a><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">Do you have a favorite or favorites among the fonts you\u2019ve made? What makes it/them stand out to you as particularly compelling?</font><br/>\nA:</strong> I think <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP01701\" target=\"_blank\">Lamar Pen</a> is perhaps the best of my old handwriting fonts \u2014 at least the most elegant and handsome. (Note, though, that I am certainly not a fan of Mirabeau B Lamar, the second president of Texas, whose hand it simulates.) But I have a special fondness for <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP01601\" target=\"_blank\">Emily Austin</a>. I believe this has a lot to do with the spirit of the woman herself, her expressiveness in her letters, how she wore her personality on her sleeve, so to speak, in the words and sentences she strung together. Emily was a product of her time, and her extant portraits show a strict and proper pioneer woman, but from all I\u2019ve read she was a loving, thoughtful, motherly presence in the many lives she touched. Her descendants still celebrate her birthday every year down Texas way.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">I didn\u2019t realize that you immersed yourself in your historical sources to the point of developing an understanding of their characters and lives, although from your <a href=\"http://www.3ipfonts.com/family.html?sku=3IP02601\" target=\"_blank\">description of Abigail Adams</a> it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve read extensively enough to be able to discern different phases of her handwriting over the years. How thoroughly have you read the correspondence of Emily Austin, Frederick Douglass, Abigail Adams, Mirabeau Lamar and the other figures whose writing you have converted to fonts?

Ma sent me probably six or eight of Emily A Perry\u2019s letters home from when she was traveling up East looking for a cure for her daughter\u2019s spells and seizures. I had nearly that many of Lamar\u2019s letters \u2014 and also a <a href=\"http://scholarship.rice.edu/jsp/xml/1911/21658/1/aa00359.tei.html\" target=\"_blank\">great reproduction of his journal</a> on first traveling from Georgia to Texas in 1835.</p>\n<p>I must confess: I didn\u2019t read every page of that journal. Nor did I read all of Abigail Adams\u2019s letters to John (or many of his to her) but rather found myself pausing every now and then while looking near at the shapes of letterforms and pulling back to find myself immersed in her words. Nor did I read every page of her son\u2019s diary \u2014 which is no doubt a good thing, considering it spans some seventy years, because I\u2019d probably still be reading!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Selecting an E of Emily's\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33061\" height=\"115\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06-150x115.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06-150x115.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06-200x154.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06-430x332.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06.jpg 720w\" title=\"Selecting an E of Emily's\" width=\"150\"/></a>I probably read about a half dozen of Frederick Douglass\u2019s letters and a number of his written lectures.

Kind of funny how it all worked out.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">You eloquently describe the experience of becoming engrossed by the source material. Primary sources taught in school history classes are often transcriptions rather than images of the original documents. Sometimes the writing is hard to decipher otherwise, but if we posit legibility, do you think it would help draw students in if they had to read letters/reports/news stories the way they were read in their time? That might help keep the dying art of penmanship alive too, since forgetting how to read it is part and parcel of forgetting how to write it.</font><br/>\nA:</strong> I do certainly think it would help. There\u2019s unquestionably more allure to original old \u2014 to a school kid, ancient \u2014 artifacts and documents than boring typeset transcriptions. In fact, I bet many kids would get a huge kick out of working to figure out how to decipher old handwriting. Trouble is, how many teachers would think it worth the bother? (It would so be worth the bother.)</p>\n<p><strong>Q: <font color=\"#663300\">You\u2019re read correspondence and diaries of notable figures, discovered obscure historical events like the dramatic destruction by water-and-quicklime fire of the Governor detailed in the letter that became Schooner Script, pored over antique maps, periodicals and rubbings of headstones. It seems to me that you\u2019ve become a historian in the course of becoming a historical preservationist, all without remotely setting out to do it. Given how important the backstories are to you, have you considered writing more about them? I\u2019m certain you have more than enough material for a fascinating book, a compendium of personal stories linked solely by great handwriting and texts.</font><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Emily Austin font comes together\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33057\" height=\"115\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10-150x115.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10-150x115.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10-200x154.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10-430x332.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10.jpg 720w\" title=\"Emily Austin font comes together\" width=\"150\"/></a>A:</strong> I\u2019ve recently started <a href=\"http://www.oldfonts.com/antiquepenman/\" target=\"_blank\">an occasional blog</a> about the vanishing art of penmanship, and I have so far tended to dwell on my historical adventures.

The trail is vast, covering 30,000 kilometers and crossing six countries. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site this June, which has drawn new attention to the network from researchers, including the section in Incahuasi. While investigating the trail, the archaeological team found a hydraulic system with two masonry fountains connected to canals carved out of the mountain rock. It was one of those fountains that has a large 13-angled cut stone in the center.</p>\n<p>Inca masonry is famous for its finely hewn polygonal stones that fit together without mortar like intricate jigsaw puzzles. Even today, half a millennium after they were constructed, many of these dry walls are still joined so perfectly you can\u2019t pass a piece of paper between stones. The variety of shapes and precision cutting provided exceptional seismic resistance, hence their longevity even in earthquake-prone areas. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/12-angled-stone-in-Hatun-Rumiyoc-Street-Cuzco.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-33022\" height=\"135\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/12-angled-stone-in-Hatun-Rumiyoc-Street-Cuzco-200x135.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/12-angled-stone-in-Hatun-Rumiyoc-Street-Cuzco-200x135.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/12-angled-stone-in-Hatun-Rumiyoc-Street-Cuzco-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/12-angled-stone-in-Hatun-Rumiyoc-Street-Cuzco-430x290.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/12-angled-stone-in-Hatun-Rumiyoc-Street-Cuzco.jpg 1600w\" title=\"The Stone of  Twelve Angles in Hatun Rumiyoc Street, Cusco\" width=\"200\"/></a>One particular polygonal stone has become a Peruvian icon: the 12-angled stone in a wall on Hatun Rumiyoc Street in Cusco. The wall is all that remains of the palace of Inca Roca, sixth Sapa Inca (ruler) of the Kingdom of Cusco, and the Stone of Twelve Angles has become a hugely popular tourist attraction. Its unique shape features in logos from beer to railroads. </p>\n<p>The fame of the Hatun Rumiyoc stone lends a special cachet to the discovery of a stone with 13 angles. The city of Incahuasi was built in the mid-15th century by T\u00fapac Yupanqui, the 10th Sapa Inca, to serve as a military and administrative center of the empire he expanded south along the coast. He called it New Cusco and deliberately evoked the power and glamour of the great Inca capital by building a smaller version of its monumental structures and planned grid of streets and squares. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fountain-left-canal-system.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33014\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fountain-left-canal-system-200x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fountain-left-canal-system-200x150.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fountain-left-canal-system-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fountain-left-canal-system-430x322.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fountain-left-canal-system.jpg 1142w\" title=\"Canal system carved out of mountain rock, fountain with 13-angled stone on the bottom left\" width=\"200\"/></a>The dry, subtropical desert climate required the construction of extensive canal and irrigation systems for agricultural purposes.

Two mountain springs fed the fountains.

They also held ritual significance. In Andean cultures, bodies of water were considered sacred places of origin. The Incas promoted this notion, emphasizing the symbolic importance of water management as a defining standard for community membership. In Incahuasi, the canal system invoked multiple sacred origins: the mountain springs feeding the fountains, the departure point of the Viscacha to water the valley, which, once the river descends to the coast, becomes an important tributary of the Pisco River.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"13-angled stone found in Inca hydraulic system\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33013\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/33013#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32997\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32997\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Restoration on unique Medusa mosaic almost finished\">Restoration on unique Medusa mosaic almost finished</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, October 24th, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-Odeon.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-32999\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-Odeon-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-Odeon-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-Odeon-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-Odeon-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"Kibyra Odeon, Medusa mosaic in the semi-circular orchestra pit in front of the stage\" width=\"200\"/></a>The only known surviving <em>opus sectile</em> mosaic of <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/medusa-to-gaze-once-more-from-mosaic.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=73372&amp;NewsCatID=375\" target=\"_blank\">Medusa is finally being restored</a> five years after its discovery in the ancient Odeon theater of Kibyra, in southwest Turkey\u2019s Burdur Province.

It is almost entirely intact, with an estimate 95% of its thin marble tiles still in place. Authorities are keen to keep it in its original context so visitors can enjoy the rare pleasure of seeing it the same way the ancients did rather than removed from its orchestra pit semi-circle and placed in a museum. The Kibyra Odeon could seat 3,600 people and was used for musical and theatrical events as well as serving as legal court and legislative chamber during the cold months when its roof made it the most comfortable structure in town suitable for public use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Restoring-Medusa.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-33002\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Restoring-Medusa-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Restoring-Medusa-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Restoring-Medusa-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Restoring-Medusa-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"Piecing together marble fragments from Medusa mosaic\" width=\"200\"/></a>Last year the Medusa mosaic was <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/27148\" target=\"_blank\">uncovered for the first time since its discovery</a> to allow conservators to perform a detailed feasibility study. This year, the Culture and Tourism Ministry funded the restoration based on the recommendations in last year\u2019s report. Regional archaeologists are working with an Istanbul conservation company to restore the mosaic. They\u2019ve been working on it for two months and expect to continue for another month.</p>\n<p>According to D\u00fczg\u00fcn Tarkan from the archaeology department of Mehmet Akif Ersoy University in Burdur, the mosaic has survived some very hard times.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He said they believed that the mosaic had suffered from a large fire in the ancient era. \u201cIn its original, it was covered with a wooden roof. This is why we believe that the timbers that fell during the fire burned the mosaic for days. The marble pieces that form the mosaic received great damage. Now we are merging them and the broken pieces are being attached to the mosaic.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-medusa-mosaic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-32998\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-medusa-mosaic-200x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-medusa-mosaic-200x132.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-medusa-mosaic-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kibyra-medusa-mosaic-430x284.jpg 430w\" title=\"Medusa mosaic in orchestra pit, crushed marble fragments in the geometric plates radiating out from Medusa's face\" width=\"200\"/></a>You can see in the images from last year\u2019s study that there are areas where the <em>opus sectile</em> marble veneers are in fragments. That\u2019s apparently the result of this devastating days-long fire that took down the wooden roof that once covered the Odeon. Some of the marble plaques that characterize the <em>opus sectile</em> style (as opposed to the small, regular squares of the <em>opus tessellatum</em> style) are just a single millimeter thick. It defies belief that all those shards remained in place so archaeologists could painstakingly piece them back together and reinstall them on site. Clearly Medusa\u2019s petrifying visage really did protect her.</p>\n<p>Once the mosaic is stabilized, it will be covered with a layer of glass (or a transparent material of some kind) to protect it from grubby tourist feet and hands, bad weather and all manner of other potential damage sources. That way visitors to the Odeon will be able to walk on Medusa\u2019s face without hurting her.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Medusa-mosaic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-27147\" height=\"285\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Medusa-mosaic-430x285.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Medusa-mosaic-430x285.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Medusa-mosaic-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Medusa-mosaic-200x133.jpg 200w\" title=\"Medusa mosaic, face detail\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Restoration on unique Medusa mosaic almost finished\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32997\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32997#comments\">1 Comment \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-32981\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32981\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Replica of &lt;em&gt;Vasa&lt;/em&gt; bronze cannon shot\">Replica of <em>Vasa</em> bronze cannon shot</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Thursday, October 23rd, 2014</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Vasa_ship_-02-.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32990\" height=\"143\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Vasa_ship_-02--150x143.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Vasa_ship_-02--150x143.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Vasa_ship_-02--200x191.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Vasa_ship_-02--430x410.jpg 430w\" title=\"Vasa on display at Vasa Museum\" width=\"150\"/></a>In late 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.vasamuseet.se/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Vasa Museum</a> in Stockholm, home of the beautiful but unstable <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/10142\" target=\"_blank\">flagship of the Swedish fleet</a> that sank a mile from the shore on its maiden voyage in 1628, put together a team to recreate one of the ship\u2019s 24-pounder bronze cannons. Although <em>Vasa</em> went down in ignominy before it had a chance to make a name for itself, the light cannon that became known as the Vasa gun would be adopted all branches of the Swedish military as the standard artillery piece during the Thirty Years\u2019 War. Sweden was the world\u2019s largest exporter of cannon in the 17th century, and other European countries developed their own versions of the Vasa gun, so learning more about this particular weapon illuminates a far broader stage than just the ship or Swedish naval warfare.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Three-bronze-cannons-in-the-Vasa-warship-museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32991\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Three-bronze-cannons-in-the-Vasa-warship-museum-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Three-bronze-cannons-in-the-Vasa-warship-museum-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Three-bronze-cannons-in-the-Vasa-warship-museum-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Three-bronze-cannons-in-the-Vasa-warship-museum-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Three bronze cannons in the Vasa Museum \" width=\"150\"/></a>The aim of the project was to make an accurate copy of the cannon and its accessories (mount, ammunition, powder, etc) and then fire it on range. The experiment would be documented with film, audio recordings, doppler radar and pressure monitoring to provide a wide range of data on the ballistic and tactical capabilities of the Vasa gun. Because <em>Vasa</em> was recovered in such excellent condition thanks to the cold, woodworm-inhospitable waters of the Baltic Sea, it was possible for the team to recreate every element of the weapon system, not just the barrel which is the only part that usually survives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Replica-Vasa-gun.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32993\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Replica-Vasa-gun-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Replica-Vasa-gun-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Replica-Vasa-gun-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Replica-Vasa-gun-430x286.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Replica-Vasa-gun.jpg 639w\" title=\"Replica Vasa gun\" width=\"150\"/></a>It took almost two years for the project to get to the firing stage. Designing and building the molds and fittings, testing the pour with an iron version first, composing the proper alloy, casting and curing the final product, was no small task. No detailed was spared to make it an exact replica, right down to the decorative motifs on the outside of the gun. The bronze 24-pounder was cast in November of last year. It is ten feet long, weighs 1.5 tons and the alloy is made of around 93% copper, 4-5% tin, and trace amounts of zinc and lead. </p>\n<p>Here is video of the casting of the cannon at the foundry last November. The gentleman with the impressive beard is Tom Ward, a Boston sculptor and Fulbright scholar who has been documenting the creation of the replica in an <a href=\"http://www.vasamuseet.se/creating-the-cannon\" target=\"_blank\">outstanding blog on the Vasa Museum website</a> which I highly recommend reading last page to first so you can see the insane amounts of work that went into this ambitious project:</p>\n<p> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"265\" src=\"http://csp.picsearch.com/video?a=FoaDpg8f5G5Q-_GjGvDJ-VyG-BNUwahGIT4SxrhiDKQxmDJjxMUG3QduxJHuIQrXeas46kHUlRmFTl8uMT7_gPxNFCQxKDguRYRpxwTpUcA541dJM5GFjA\" width=\"430\"></iframe></p>\n<p>It took another 11 months after that to get the cannon in proper firing order. On October 2nd, 2014, a Vasa gun fired for the first time in nearly four centuries. In this proofing run, the cannon shot four rounds, the largest of which used 3.3 kilos of powder to generate 10,400 psi of breech pressure and a muzzle velocity of 399 meters per second or mach 1.17. The ball doesn\u2019t beat the speed of sound for long, however.

A small work at eight by five inches, the painting was valued by the Ader-Nordmann auction house at only \u20ac400-\u20ac600 ($505-$758). One week before the October 17th auction, Pierre-Gilles Girault, assistant curator of the <a href=\"http://www.chateaudeblois.fr/\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Ch\u00e2teau de Blois</a>, found out about the sale from a Henry III keyword alert he\u2019d set up on a public auction search site. </p>\n<p>The Ch\u00e2teau de Blois played a dramatic role in the bloody intrigues of Henry\u2019s turbulent reign, and in 2010 the museum held an exhibition dedicated to the period, <em>Renaissance celebrations and crimes, the Court of Henry III</em>. When Girault saw the painting for sale, he recognized its rare iconography of Henry on his knees at the foot of the Cross and its unusual medium \u2014  oil on paper mounted on panel  \u2014 as a work he had seen in a 1930s-era catalogue of the Louvre collection. The size was slightly different, however, so he thought it might be a contemporary copy. The museum was still interested in acquiring it to expand its Henry III materials. Even a copy of a realistic portrait of a king, whose life and reign were mired in Wars of Religion, depicted in such a heavy-handedly devout posture could well be worth the small purchase price. There are very few extant realistic portraits of Henry III, and they\u2019re standard court paintings. This one ties Henry directly into the defining issue of his reign and of 16th century France.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri_III_1578_by_Etienne_Dumonstier.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32974\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 102px) 100vw, 102px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri_III_1578_by_Etienne_Dumonstier-102x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri_III_1578_by_Etienne_Dumonstier-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri_III_1578_by_Etienne_Dumonstier-200x293.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri_III_1578_by_Etienne_Dumonstier-430x631.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri_III_1578_by_Etienne_Dumonstier.jpg 823w\" title=\"Henry III by Etienne Dumonstier, 1578\" width=\"102\"/></a>Although as Duke of Anjou the Catholic Henry had played a major role fighting the Protestants in the French Wars of Religion \u2014 he was the leader of the army, defeating Hugenots forces in several battles and besieging the Hugenot city of La Rochelle  \u2014 when he became king after the death of his older brother Charles IX, he took a more practical approach. With the Protestant army led by his younger brother Fran\u00e7ois, formerly Duke of Alen\u00e7on and now Duke of Anjou, besieging Paris, in 1576 Henry signed he Edict of Beaulieu which granted the Hugenots freedom of religion and major political concessions. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri-de-Guise-ca-1585-1590.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32976\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 126px) 100vw, 126px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri-de-Guise-ca-1585-1590-126x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri-de-Guise-ca-1585-1590-126x150.jpg 126w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri-de-Guise-ca-1585-1590-200x236.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri-de-Guise-ca-1585-1590-430x508.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Henri-de-Guise-ca-1585-1590.jpg 541w\" title=\"Henry, Duke of Guise, ca 1585-1590\" width=\"126\"/></a>Henry I, Duke of Guise, didn\u2019t take kindly to that. He formed the Catholic League, a coalition of French Catholic societies supported by the Pope and Philip II of Spain, to apply military and political pressure in favor of the eradication of the Hugenots. His efforts were very successful. Henry III was forced to fight both Protestants and Catholics arrayed against him, and he just didn\u2019t have the wherewithal to pull it off. He was forced to roll back the concessions in the Edict of Beaulieu and Peace of La Rochelle and give the League everything it asked for, including that the king pay its troops. From the Treaty of Nemours in 1585 through the end of 1588, Henry was king in name only. For a short while the Duke of Guise even took Paris, forcing Henry III to flee to the royal palace at Blois in May of 1588. </p>\n<p>With his marriage childless, Anjou dead and his presumptive heir now the Protestant Henry, King of Navarre, Henry III had good reason to fear not just for his throne, but for his life. It was the defeat of the Spanish Armada in August of 1588 that weakened the Catholic League and emboldened Henry III. In September, Henry called a meeting of the Estates General at the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois. In December, he invited the Duke of Guise and his brother Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, to the council chamber. The Duke was directed to join Henry III in the adjoining bed chamber where he was set promptly set upon by Henry\u2019s loyal bodyguards, the Forty-five, who stabbed him to death at the foot of the king\u2019s bed. The next day, the Cardinal of Guise met a similar fate in the castle\u2019s dungeon. Henry\u2019s formidable mother Catherine de\u2019 Medici, horrified at the assassinations, died two weeks later and was buried at Blois since Paris was still held by Guise\u2019s men. (Her body was later moved to St. Denis and would ultimately suffer the fate of all the monarchs of France buried there when in 1793 a revolutionary mob looted the cathedral and threw all the royal remains in an unmarked mass grave.)</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lassassinat-du-duc-de-Guise-au-ch\u00e2teau-de-Blois-by-Paul-Delaroche-1834.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-32975\" height=\"246\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lassassinat-du-duc-de-Guise-au-ch\u00e2teau-de-Blois-by-Paul-Delaroche-1834-430x246.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lassassinat-du-duc-de-Guise-au-ch\u00e2teau-de-Blois-by-Paul-Delaroche-1834-430x246.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lassassinat-du-duc-de-Guise-au-ch\u00e2teau-de-Blois-by-Paul-Delaroche-1834-150x85.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lassassinat-du-duc-de-Guise-au-ch\u00e2teau-de-Blois-by-Paul-Delaroche-1834-200x114.jpg 200w\" title=\"&quot;L'assassinat du duc de Guise au ch\u00e2teau de Blois&quot; (&quot;The assassination of the Duke of Guise at the Blois Palace&quot;) by Paul Delaroche, 1834\" width=\"430\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>This is why the painting of Henry III that embeds him, monarchical ermines and all, praying on the ground with human bones in the center of the apex of Catholic iconography, the Crucifixion, held such interest for the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois museum. Chief curator Elisabeth Latr\u00e9moli\u00e8re, in accordance with standard museum acquisition protocols, sought out expert opinions on the piece. Girault emailed the Louvre\u2019s 16th century art curator and received an immediate response even though it was Sunday. The Louvre sent its people to examine the painting in person, and on October 14th, they verified by comparing it to the sole known pre-loss photograph of the painting taken in 1925 that it was the original work, gone missing more than 70 years ago under mysterious circumstances.</p>\n<p>Ader Nordmann immediately withdrew the work as soon as the Louvre experts authenticated it. It was being sold as part of the estate of an elderly woman; nobody had any idea how she had acquired it or what winding road took it from the Louvre to the auction. The painting will be returned to the Louvre posthaste, but Elisabeth Latr\u00e9molli\u00e8re hopes the museum will throw them a bone and lend them the portrait for display at the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois. After all, if it weren\u2019t for the Blois curators, the painting would still be lost, an unknown budget purchase in someone\u2019s private collection.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Lost Louvre portrait of Henry III found at auction\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32972\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/32972#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2014/10/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

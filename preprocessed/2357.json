They decided on a large-scale mural depicting the 1440 Battle of Anghiari in which greatly outnumbered Florentine armies held a bridge against the Duke of Milan\u2019s mercenaries, thereby keeping central Italy\u2019s free from Milanese control.</p>\n<p>Vasari glowingly describes Leonardo\u2019s design:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Studies-for-the-Heads-of-Two-Soldiers-in-Battle-of-Anghiari-1504-05.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12635\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 145px) 100vw, 145px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Studies-for-the-Heads-of-Two-Soldiers-in-Battle-of-Anghiari-1504-05-145x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Studies-for-the-Heads-of-Two-Soldiers-in-Battle-of-Anghiari-1504-05-145x150.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Studies-for-the-Heads-of-Two-Soldiers-in-Battle-of-Anghiari-1504-05-291x300.jpg 291w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Studies-for-the-Heads-of-Two-Soldiers-in-Battle-of-Anghiari-1504-05.jpg 940w\" title=\"Studies for the Heads of Two Soldiers in The Battle of Anghiari, Leonardo da Vinci, 1504-1505\" width=\"145\"/></a>Whereupon Leonardo, determining to execute this work, began a cartoon in the Sala del Papa, an apartment in S. Maria Novella, representing the story of Niccol\u00f2 Piccinino, Captain of Duke Filippo of Milan; wherein he designed a group of horsemen who were fighting for a standard, a work that was held to be very excellent and of great mastery, by reason of the marvellous ideas that he had in composing that battle; seeing that in it rage, fury, and revenge are perceived as much in the men as in the horses, among which two with the forelegs interlocked are fighting no less fiercely with their teeth than those who are riding them do in fighting for that standard, which has been grasped by a soldier, who seeks by the strength of his shoulders, as he spurs his horse to flight, having turned his body backwards and seized the staff of the standard, to wrest it by force from the hands of four others, of whom two are defending it, each with one hand, and, raising their swords in the other, are trying to sever the staff; while an old soldier in a red cap, crying out, grips the staff with one hand, and, raising a scimitar with the other, furiously aims a blow in order to cut off both the hands of those who, gnashing their teeth in the struggle, are striving in attitudes of the utmost fierceness to defend their banner; besides which, on the ground, between the legs of the horses, there are two figures in foreshortening that are fighting together, and the one on the ground has over him a soldier who has raised his arm as high as possible, that thus with greater force he may plunge a dagger into his throat, in order to end his life; while the other, struggling with his legs and arms, is doing what he can to escape death.</p>\n<p>It is not possible to describe the invention that Leonardo showed in the garments of the soldiers, all varied by him in different ways, and likewise in the helmet crests and other ornaments; not to mention the incredible mastery that he displayed in the forms and lineaments of the horses, which Leonardo, with their fiery spirit, muscles, and shapely beauty, drew better than any other master. </p></blockquote>\n<p>In classic Leonardo style, he invented an accordion-folding scaffold to reach the top of his immense canvas. Also in a classic but less fortunate Leonardo style, he invented a new undercoat to apply to the wall under his oil painting. He didn\u2019t want to use fresco because it had failed rather spectacularly in <em>The Last Supper</em>, so he scared up some weird mixture that in tests worked quite well. On the huge scale of the wall, though, where it was virtually impossibly to keep the environment evenly warm, the primer didn\u2019t dry quickly enough and before his very eyes the paint started dripping. Leonardo brought in braziers to heat the wall and try to preserve what he could, but only the bottom of the painting managed to dry on time. The paints on the top were hopelessly intermingled. Bummed, Leonardo abandoned the project. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12634\" height=\"218\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy-300x218.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy-300x218.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy-1024x744.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy.jpg 1179w\" title='\"The Battle of the Standard\" by Peter Paul Rubens, 1603, copy of Leonardo' width=\"300\"/></a>Even incomplete, the mural was widely revered. Many copies were made of it over the years, most notably by Peter Paul Rubens in 1603, based on a 1553 engraving by Lorenzo Zacchia. By the time Rubens made his version, Leonardo\u2019s original was long gone. The Hall of the Five Hundred was enlarged between 1555 and 1572, and in the process <em>The Battle of Anghieri</em> and the incomplete work by Michelangelo that was across from it were both lost.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Salone-dei-Cinquecento.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12633\" height=\"114\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Salone-dei-Cinquecento-150x114.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Salone-dei-Cinquecento-150x114.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Salone-dei-Cinquecento-300x229.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Salone-dei-Cinquecento.jpg 1024w\" title=\"Salone dei Cinquecento, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence\" width=\"150\"/></a>It was none other than Giorgio Vasari who was in charge of the restructuring of the hall. He and his associates painted vast battle murals on the walls, including over the wall that had once held Leonardo\u2019s lost masterpiece. On one of those murals, way up high, Vasari left a curious note. There\u2019s no lettering anywhere else on this intricate scene of army against army, but in one green standard Vasari painted two words: \u201cCerca Trova,\u201d seek and find.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cercatrova-vasari.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12632\" height=\"99\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cercatrova-vasari-150x99.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cercatrova-vasari-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cercatrova-vasari-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cercatrova-vasari-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cercatrova-vasari.jpg 1100w\" title=\"The &quot;Cerca Trova&quot; note in Vasari's mural\" width=\"150\"/></a>Florentine art historian and University of California, San Diego, professor Maurizio Seracini found Vasari\u2019s note in the 1970s. Ever since then, he\u2019s tried to find out more about the wall and might be behind it. Ultrasounds taken in 1976 detected no painting behind the current one. In 2000, Seracini used radar scanning to discover that Vasari had painted his work on a new brick wall, not directly on Leonardo\u2019s surface. Could Vasari, who we know held <em>Anghiari</em> in the highest of esteem, had built a brick surface to keep Leonardo\u2019s work, whatever was left of it, intact? Is that what seekers would find if they looked?</p>\n<p>The problem is how do we find out what, if anything, is behind the bricks without dismantling the 16th century works. Enter freelance photographer Dave Yoder. In 2007, Yoder was assigned by National Geographic to do a story about Seracini\u2019s decades-long investigation, and in 2010, National Geographic inked a deal with Florence to pay the city $250,000 for exclusive rights to publish the results of Mr. Seracini\u2019s research. </p>\n<p>It was Yoder who found <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/27/arts/design/leonardo-mural-in-florence-may-be-revealed.html\" target=\"blank\">a possible solution to the conundrum</a>. Googling, he found nuclear physicist Robert Smither who was creating a gamma ray camera that would be able to take high-resolution pictures of cancer inside of a patient without invasive exploration. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Smither figured that his camera, which essentially uses copper crystals in place of lens glass to focus the gamma rays that bounce back when an object is sprayed with neutrons, could provide a definitive answer. It could not only determine whether the Leonardo painting was there by identifying the chemicals in the paint but could also capture an image of the hidden work \u2014 without damaging the Vasari fresco on top.</p>\n<p>Thus ensued an unlikely and somewhat surreal turn of events in which Mr. Yoder, between glossy-magazine assignments, found himself borrowing time at a facility of Italy\u2019s energy research agency in Frascati, outside Rome. The testing, in June 2010, went well. The team took pigments similar to those used by Leonardo and original bricks from Leonardo\u2019s era that Mr. Seracini found at the Palazzo Vecchio and sprayed them with neutrons. The gamma rays that bounced back were strong enough for Mr. Smither to collect and read.</p>\n<p>That convinced Mr. Smither that if they exposed the wall in the Hall of Five Hundred to neutrons, they could tell from the gamma rays that bounced back whether Leonardo\u2019s painting was still there. And, at that point, they could build a special camera that would create an image from those particular gamma rays.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s the best of both worlds: we get to see what\u2019s left of Leonardo\u2019s painting without damaging the wall on top of it. The only problem is money. In order to develop and test the gamma camera, the researchers need $265,000.  Since everyone is broke, they\u2019ve taken it to <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/704089843/the-search-for-the-lost-da-vinci\" target=\"blank\">Kickstarter</a> where people can donate a dollar or a hundred thousand of them to see this plan come to fruition. </p>\n<p>I think Leonardo, compulsive inventor that he was, would be absolutely thrilled to have a new gamma ray camera built so that we can see his art.</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"366px\" src=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/704089843/the-search-for-the-lost-da-vinci/widget/video.html\" width=\"430px\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Kickstart the search for lost da Vinci mural\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12619\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/multimedia\" rel=\"category tag\">Multimedia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/renaissance\" rel=\"category tag\">Renaissance</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12619#comments\">7 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12601\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12601\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to State, collectors vie for Gypsy fortune teller machine\">State, collectors vie for Gypsy fortune teller machine</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, August 30th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-fortune-teller-machine.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12609\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-fortune-teller-machine-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-fortune-teller-machine-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-fortune-teller-machine-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-fortune-teller-machine-682x1024.jpg 682w\" title=\"1906 speaking gypsy fortune teller machine, Virginia City, Montana\" width=\"200\"/></a>A 1906 verbal gypsy fortune teller machine in the gold rush ghost town of <a href=\"http://www.virginiacitymt.com/\" target=\"blank\">Virginia City</a>, Montana, <a href=\"http://www.ksro.com/news/article.aspx?id=3183217\" target=\"blank\">is being tussled over by private collectors, the state, historians and citizens</a>. The fortune teller machine is one of no more than three remaining that used a recording to \u201cspeak\u201d fortunes to whosoever fed it a nickel. Magician and collector of historic penny arcade games David Copperfield thinks it may be the only one of its kind remaining, and of course he wants to buy it. He\u2019s not the only one. </p>\n<p>Until recently the fortune teller machine lived in relative obscurity, one dusty game artifact among the multitude collected by General Mills heir Charles Bovey. It was Bovey who began to buy up properties in Virginia City in the 1940s so they could be restored and the town kept intact as living Montana history. He did the same for neighboring gold rush ghost town Nevada City. He dedicated thirty years of his life to preserving the state\u2019s 19th century history, and while he was it, he used the buildings to store his ever-burgeoning collection of antique games and musical machines.</p>\n<p>Founded in 1863 as a gold rush boomtown, just two years later Virginia City had a population of 10,000 and was made capital of the newly created Montana Territory. Population followed the gold, though, and that was already moving west towards Helena. In 1875 the capital was moved to Helena where it remained when Montana joined the Union as a state in 1889. In 1942, the last mine in the area closed. Bovey jumped on the opportunity and start buying.</p>\n<p>That boom and bust cycle not only makes Virginia City a classic example of a gold rush town, but it also ensured there was little interest in knocking down old buildings to make new ones. Bovey was able to restore a great many structures from the first decade or so of Virginia City\u2019s life. Of almost 300 structures in town, almost half were built before 1900. The largest proportion of the 200 historic buildings in town date to the 1870s, and even the later construction is of great historical value in that it illustrates the growth and decline of frontier mining-dependent communities. </p>\n<p>Virginia City was designated National Historic Landmark on July 4, 1961. Charles Bovey continued buying and restoring until his death in 1978. After that, his wife Sue and son Ford continued to preservation and restoration efforts until Ford sold Virginia City and Nevada City, properties, land and contents, to the State of Montana for $6.5 million in 1998. Since then, Virginia City has been under the aegis of the Montana Heritage Preservation Commission.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-arcade.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-12606\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-arcade-300x199.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-arcade-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-arcade-150x99.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Gypsy-arcade-1024x679.jpg 1024w\" title=\"The Gypsy Arcade museum, Main St., Virginia City\" width=\"300\"/></a>Bovey\u2019s historical games and machines stayed in town, adding to its tourist appeal. There are hundreds of thousands of these games, most of them in curatorial storage. The fortune telling machine was used by visitors through the early 1970s when its deteriorating condition necessitated its removal to storage. It was put back on display in 1999, but it was for looking only, no touching. Conservators finally <a href=\"http://woodenobject.tripod.com/Gypsy.htm\" target=\"blank\">began to restore it to function</a> in September of 2004, finishing in June, 2006. In 2008, the gypsy returned to public display (again, no touching allowed) in the Gypsy Arcade, a turn-of-the-century gadgetry museum on Virginia City\u2019s main street. </p>\n<p>It was that successful restoration that brought the fortune teller to the attention of collectors. Around that time, Copperfield approached the Montana Heritage Commission offering a reported $2 million for the machine, including enough money to replace the gypsy with another non-verbal historical fortune telling machine for display purposes. They turned him down.</p>\n<p>The pressure is back on now, though, because like most every other state-supported institution, the Heritage Commission has been kneecapped by budget cuts. You know it\u2019s a bad sign when your curator of collections, Janna Norby, gets laid off due to budget cuts just two weeks after giving the AP a great quote for their article about the gypsy: \u201cIf we start selling our collection for money, what do we have?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thankfully she\u2019s not alone in her sentiments. The current staff, skeleton though it may be, of the Heritage Commission insist that they would never sell of any of the antiques under their stewardship. This makes the private collectors grumpy because they think they can do a much better job of maintaining it and conserving it using the latest technology money can buy. Collector and restorer Theo Holstein is putting together a consortium of private collectors to bid $3 million for the gypsy. David Copperfield is revving back up to bid too, and those figures being bandied about could go even higher into the stratosphere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kids-view-fortune-teller-machine.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12607\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kids-view-fortune-teller-machine-199x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kids-view-fortune-teller-machine-199x300.jpg 199w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kids-view-fortune-teller-machine-99x150.jpg 99w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kids-view-fortune-teller-machine-682x1024.jpg 682w\" title=\"Children view the gypsy fortune teller at the Gypsy Arcade museum\" width=\"199\"/></a>Since the Montana Heritage Commission is overseen by the state Department of Commerce, which, needless to say, has slightly different priorities involving commerce rather than preservation, those millions of dollars just might be enough to pry the gypsy away from Virginia City after all.

Thomas Slade-Jones, Congregationalist minister and the school\u2019s owner. It was an unpaid position with a hellish commute. He wrote to his brother Theo of his daily life teaching students Bible history and weeding the garden, of his dreams of becoming a clergyman. This was a period of increasing religious devotion for Vincent. His letters are packed full of his thoughts on Biblical passages, of his desire to spend less time teaching and more time helping Mr. Jones minister to his flock.</p>\n<p>In a letter to Theo <a href=\"http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/4/076.htm\" target=\"blank\">from October 7, 1876</a>, Vincent reported walking almost six hours (!) to London to collect some school fees for Rev. Jones. While roaming the Strand neighborhood, recently rebuilt and now a home to many of the literary and artistic avant-garde, he encountered some old friends and had dinner.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After that I went to [art dealer] van Wisselingh, where I saw sketches for two church windows. In the middle of one window stands the portrait of a middle-aged lady, oh, such a noble face, with the words \u201cThy will be done,\u201d over it, and in the other window the portrait of her daughter, with the words, \u201cFaith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d There, and in the gallery of Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co., I saw beautiful pictures and drawings. It is such an intense delight to be so often reminded of Holland by art.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Daniel-Cottier-windows-St-Andrews.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12597\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Daniel-Cottier-windows-St-Andrews-187x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Daniel-Cottier-windows-St-Andrews-187x300.jpg 187w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Daniel-Cottier-windows-St-Andrews-93x150.jpg 93w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Daniel-Cottier-windows-St-Andrews.jpg 614w\" title=\"Lady Margaret Carnegie and Georgiana Carnegie as Virgin Maries, by Daniel Cottier\" width=\"187\"/></a>Van Gogh scholars have long searched for these church windows, and it seems <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/aug/24/van-gogh-windows-hampshire-church\" target=\"blank\">they\u2019ve finally found them</a> in a small church, St. Andrew\u2019s, in Owslebury, near Winchester. The two windows are almost exactly as Vincent describes them, only one inscription \u2014 \u201cFaith is the substance of things hoped for\u201d \u2014 was changed to \u201cFear not, only believe\u201d between design and execution. </p>\n<p>William Carnegie, 8th Earl of Northesk, commissioned the windows as memorials to his wife Georgiana and his daughter Lady Margaret as older and younger versions of the Virgin Mary. Georgiana died in 1874 at age 63, after 31 years of marriage. Margaret died in 1871 at just 23 years of age. The windows were installed in the church after his death in 1878.</p>\n<p>Art historian Max Donnelly found the windows while researching the glazier, Daniel Cottier, and put two and two together in a serendipitous leap.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Donnelly said: \u201cI saw a reference to them at the church in Owslebury and managed to get some photographs.

It depicts a tree heavily laden with heavily laden phalluses under which eight or nine women stand in various poses and large black birds fly. Expert thinks the fresco dates to 1265, the same year inscribed on the fountain itself.</p>\n<p>According to George Ferzoco, the director of the Centre for Tuscan Studies at the University of Leicester whose summer program was in Massa that year, the townspeople\u2019s initial reaction to the find was mixed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThey considered it to be somehow dirty or erotic, one or the other. Those who saw it as erotic looked at it as being a symbol that mirrored the reality of the water and the place. Water gives life; Phalluses give life: Isn\u2019t this a unique and interesting way to portray the life-giving properties of water? The porn camp, if we can call it that, saw it as being somehow deliberately obscene and thus believed that as little attention as possible needed to be drawn to it.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over a decade later, that ambivalence has long gone and locals are furiously protective of their Tree of Fertility. In 2008 a program of restoration was undertaken to fully clean the mural which had suffered not just from its whitewashing but also from water damage and concretions. The restoration finally ended in early August and the public were allowed back in to view the mural, only to find to their dismay<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8714235/Italian-art-experts-accused-of-censoring-phallic-fresco.html\" target=\"blank\">that there were parts missing</a>.

They claim any paint loss was the result of salt and calcium concretions lifting paint as they were removed during the cleaning. If any repainting gets done, restorers say, it\u2019ll be done to put the lost phalluses back in, not to remove them.</p>\n<p>Councilman Galeotti is not at all satisfied with that explanation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhat the restorers say is absolute nonsense. As far as we are concerned they have compromised the authenticity of the fresco. The work was intended as a symbol of fertility with the penises being crucial to the intention of the art but now these have been removed and the message is therefore no longer there.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe intend to make a formal complaint to the local prosecutor so that he can open an investigation into this disrespectful slaughter of an artistic work. There was obviously no intention to respect the original artist.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can\u2019t find any before and after images of the tree so we can assess the phallic loss with our own eyes, but judging from some of the old pictures I found (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/goodwines/1554154044/\" target=\"blank\">see this one from 2003</a>), the fresco was in truly awful condition when uncovered. Recent pictures show it in far superior condition, figures, phalluses and tree.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably not actually a fertility symbol, btw. George Ferzoco\u2019s studies suggest that the fresco is a political allegory, negative advertising, if you will, writ large in a highly trafficked location: the public fountain where people drew their water for daily use. Ferzoco notes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe fact of the matter is that there is, with regard to the phalluses on display in this painting, nothing whatsoever to do with fertility. It\u2019s one thing to have a symbol of a phallus on its own. That can stand for good luck, fertility, what have you. It\u2019s another to put it in a different context, one in which it\u2019s seen to be quite literally growing on a tree. The Medieval culture, more than ours, was one that was extremely sensitive to what was perceived as the goodness of nature, the goodness of what is natural, and they would have put two and two together in a way which involved seeing this particular tree bearing fruit that is not natural fruit. Those two elements of the equation would have added up to be something which is not natural and hence not good.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/massa_marittima-mural.png\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12581\" height=\"152\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/massa_marittima-mural-300x228.png\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/massa_marittima-mural-300x228.png 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/massa_marittima-mural-150x114.png 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/massa_marittima-mural-1024x780.png 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/massa_marittima-mural.png 1279w\" title=\"Tree of Fertility mural in Massa Marittima, 1265\" width=\"200\"/></a> While the phalluses in the tree are, by the context, strange and shocking, there are other phalluses in the painting which add currency to Ferzoco\u2019s hypothesis that this is anything but a mural celebrating fecundity. \u201cWe have an image of two women who appear to be locked in serious combat over one of these phalluses, so this supposed fertility symbol that ought to bring life and goodness is in fact bringing strife to the people fighting over it. More importantly, there is a woman on the left side of the mural, standing in what I call her \u2018Lady Di\u2019 pose, standing quite demurely, until you realise that she\u2019s being sodomised by one of these phalluses. You can\u2019t get pregnant by sodomy \u2013 it\u2019s the ultimate in non-fertility. There\u2019s something going on in the mural that subverts notions of fertility.\u201d</p>\n<p>But why would one display such an extravagant, and no doubt expensive, symbol of non-fertility in such a central place? What message is it conveying? \u201cThe key to that subversion \u2013 according to Ferzoco \u2013 is shown with the symbol of one of the two competing political factions of the time, which is displayed prominently in the mural. This is the Eagle, a symbol of the Ghibelline party. The juxtaposition of this party symbol along with another symbol being used unnaturally, in a non-fertile way is meant to create in the viewer a kind of relationship between what is unnatural or not good on the one hand and the Ghibelline party on the other. It makes even more sense when you consider that during almost all of its history as an independent city republic, Massa Marittima was controlled by the anti-Ghibelline Guelph party.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stick with us, is the message, or prepare for a society in which perverted trees grow phallus fruit and women tear each other\u2019s hair out trying to have non-reproductive sexual congress with them.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Did restorers castrate the penis tree?\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12577\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/social-policy\" rel=\"category tag\">Social policy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12577#comments\">11 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12557\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12557\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Gosport church\u2019s Handel Organ to be restored\">Gosport church\u2019s Handel Organ to be restored</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, August 27th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casing4.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-12563\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casing4-224x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casing4-224x300.jpg 224w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casing4-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Casing4-766x1024.jpg 766w\" title=\"The Handel Organ at Holy Trinity Church, Gosport\" width=\"149\"/></a>For the past five years, <a href=\"http://www.holytrinitygosport.co.uk/index.html\" target=\"blank\">Holy Trinity Church</a> in Gosport, Hampshire, has been trying to raise the \u00a3150,000 ($245,000) necessary to restore their 18th century organ, once caressed by the nimble fingers of George Frederick Handel.

Handel not only played it once it was installed in the Duke\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannons_(house)\">Cannons</a> estate, but probably consulted with the builders, Abraham Jordan and son, on the organ\u2019s design. </p>\n<p>After the Duke died in 1744, his son found the estate so riddled with debt that in 1747 he held a twelve-day demolition sale during which the entire contents of the estate, from furnishing to the very structure of the building, was sold at auction. Holy Trinity Church purchased the organ at that auction for \u00a3117 ($191) and hired Abraham Jordan\u2019s son to install it in the west gallery.</p>\n<p>Later it would be moved to the east gallery and enlarged. A restoration in 1897 replaced the 18th century workings, leaving only eight of the original Jordan stops from 1720. Raise the volume as high as you can to listen to this not-so-greatly recorded example of the same sounds Handel once produced.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8rlOoaVRtQ&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Gosport church\u2019s Handel Organ to be restored\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12557\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12557#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-12540\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12540\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Sculptures of Roman emperors found in Turkey\">Sculptures of Roman emperors found in Turkey</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Friday, August 26th, 2011</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Archaeologists excavating the ancient Lycian city of Tlos on the Mediterranean in southwestern Turkey have uncovered <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=excavations-at-tlos-reveal-roman-works-2011-08-18\" target=\"blank\">five almost intact Roman-era marble statues</a>. Three of them are of Roman emperors Hadrian, Antonius Pius and Marcus Aurelius. The two are of women, one probably Faustina Minor, daughter of Antonius Pius and wife of Marcus Aurelius, and the other of a goddess, possibly Isis. They are missing some hands and arms, and the statue of the goddess has no face, but other than that they are whole and unbroken, a very rare thing indeed.</p>\n<p>While I was looking for more detailed pictures of the find, I encountered <a href=\"http://www.turkeysforlife.com/2011/08/tlos-roman-statues-fethiye-museum.html\" target=\"blank\">this blog entry</a>, both charming and unnerving, written by someone on the scene. They read about the find in the above article.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We assumed the statues would be whisked away to Istanbul, Ankara or at best, Antalya Archaeological Museum \u2013 but, thanks to Twitter, we saw one of the Turkish language newspapers had reported the statues had been taken to Fethiye Museum. Often overlooked by visitors to Fethiye, the museum finally has in its possession a bit of a draw in the recently discovered statues. </p>\n<p>We went up there yesterday to see if we could see them, expecting them to be packed away somewhere, not for public viewing just yet. But, maybe we got there at the perfect time and the museum hasn\u2019t decided what to do with the statues yet because there they were, greeting us at the gate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They\u2019re just hanging out there. Right inside a gate a 5-year-old could scale easily. It\u2019s fantastic that locals have such access to their ancient heritage, but security-wise and conservation-wise, they should probably be indoors somewhere behind lock and key. I\u2019m sure (okay, I\u2019m not, but I hope) they\u2019ll be moved soon. Meanwhile, we get the benefit of these great pictures.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-2.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12543\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-2-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-2-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-2-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-2.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Roman Emperor, possibly Antonius Pius\" width=\"112\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tlos-statue-Fethiye-Museum.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12544\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tlos-statue-Fethiye-Museum-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tlos-statue-Fethiye-Museum-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tlos-statue-Fethiye-Museum-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tlos-statue-Fethiye-Museum-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tlos-statue-Fethiye-Museum.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Roman emperor, possibly Hadrian\" width=\"112\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-1.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12545\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-1-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-1-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-1-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tlos-statue-fethiye-museum-1.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Roman emperor, possibly Marcus Aurelius\" width=\"112\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/isis-faustina-minor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-12546\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/isis-faustina-minor-300x187.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/isis-faustina-minor-300x187.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/isis-faustina-minor-150x93.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/isis-faustina-minor-1024x640.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/isis-faustina-minor.jpg 1600w\" title=\"Faustina Minor (l), goddess, possibly Isis (r)\" width=\"240\"/></a></center></p>\n<p>Tlos is thought to be the most ancient and largest of Lycian cities.

Her sister Helen found out the next day that she had stopped at a motorcycle repair shop to have her skates sharpened. The owner of the shop, Italian immigrant Alfredo Cocchi, had been suspiciously absent from the store earlier in the day, but when the Crugers told the police, they insisted he was a \u201crespectable businessman\u201d and just glanced around the cellar instead of search the premises thoroughly. Cocchi hastily left the country and returned to Italy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Grace-Humiston-line-drawing-New-York-Times-June-24-1917.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12531\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Grace-Humiston-line-drawing-New-York-Times-June-24-1917-206x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Grace-Humiston-line-drawing-New-York-Times-June-24-1917-206x300.jpg 206w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Grace-Humiston-line-drawing-New-York-Times-June-24-1917-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Grace-Humiston-line-drawing-New-York-Times-June-24-1917.jpg 640w\" title=\"Grace Humiston, line drawing by the New York Times, June 24, 1917\" width=\"206\"/></a>Ruth\u2019s father Henry Cruger hired the formidable Grace Humiston to pursue the case. Grace was born into a wealthy New York family and graduated from Hunter College in 1888, 22 years before <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/9172\" target=\"blank\">Virginia O\u2019Hanlon</a> of \u201cYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\u201d fame did. She taught for a short while then enlisted in night classes at New York University Law School. The Dean was so impressed with her talents that he suggested she take day classes and well. She followed his advice and graduated in 1904, a year early. </p>\n<p>She passed the bar the next year and founded the People\u2019s Law Firm, a firm that specialized in providing legal services for people who could pay very little. Legal Aid only took on completely indigent clients, so the poor were often prey to fraudulent \u201clawyers\u201d or ones who were too incompetent/drunk to get better paying clients. The People\u2019s Law Firm was an immediate success.</p>\n<p>On the pursuit of several missing girls whose relatives had engaged her services, she went to Alabama and infiltrated the notorious turpentine camps under a variety of disguises looking for the missing and seeing for herself the slave labor conditions entire families worked under. Agents lured poor minorities and immigrants to the camps with the prospect of decent pay, then left them behind to be imprisoned, beaten, held at gun-point and forced into greater and greater \u201cdebt\u201d thanks to company store schemes. After her perilous year-long investigation, Grace assisted Attorney General Charles Bonaparte in prosecuting the owners of these hell holes.</p>\n<p>Several other of her cases made the new news. She traveled all over the world busting agents who promised emigrants to the US a bright future only to steal their savings and leave them destitute in a new country. She was also personally responsible for the pardon of an Italian woman convicted of murdering her abusive husband, and the retrial and acquittal of a man who had been wrongfully convicted of murder and was on death row at Sing Sing. So when the Crugers hired her, she was already well-known as a badass. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Humiston spent 15 hours a day on the case, working pro bono, interviewing Harlem residents who might have noticed suspicious activity around Cocchi\u2019s shop. One man recalled seeing Cocchi emerge from his basement around midnight on February 13, covered with dirt and appearing \u201cnervous.\u201d Another spotted Cocchi the following night, again \u201cdirty and nervous.\u201d On this evidence, Humiston went to Cocchi\u2019s shop, determined to get into the cellar.</p>\n<p>Cocchi\u2019s wife appeared at the door wielding a brick. \u201cI\u2019ll split your skull with this brick if you try to come in here,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Humiston reported the threat to Police Commissioner Arthur Woods, who granted her a search permit. On June 16, she enlisted the help of Patrick Solam, a close friend of the Cruger family and the general foreman for Grand Central Terminal. Solam started in the main basement room, directly beneath the shop. A cluster of benches, toolboxes and chests of drawers created a triangular work area. Solam noticed that one chest along the southeast corner of the room slanted slightly, protruding an inch beyond the others. He asked two assistants to help move it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Underneath they found broken concrete. After much digging, they found the body of Ruth Cruger, still wearing the clothing she was last seen in, ankles bound, ice skates covered in blood. She had been killed by a blow to the back of the head and then her abdomen slashed with her own skate. Her father identified the body from the graduation ring she was wearing. </p>\n<p>Italian authorities refused to extradite Cocchi, but he was arrested, tried and convicted of Ruth Cuger\u2019s murder in Bologna. He confessed to the crime:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI had never seen Ruth Cruger before she came to my shop to have her skates sharpened,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the very beginning Ruth did all in her power to attract my attention. I felt something strange when her dark, penetrating eyes fixed on mine. I was still more disconcerted when she came again to get her skates. An overpowering attraction for the young woman seized me. What happened afterward seems like a dream.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Grace found out that the corrupt police officers had had a kickback deal with Cocchi which is why they didn\u2019t search his shop properly. </p>\n<p>The case was widely reported all over the country. The nice lady lawyer, scion of a wealthy high society New York family, who believed that keeping a home was far more important for a woman than a career even as she worked 15, 16 hour days to solve the case of a missing pretty young white girl, made for great copy. The Holmes comparisons were immediately rife. Humiston herself, however, rejected them. She bluntly told the <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E00E0D7123BE03ABC4C51DFB066838C609EDE\" target=\"blank\">New York Times</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cNo, I never read Sherlock Holmes. In fact, I am not a believer in deduction. Common sense and persistence will always solve a mystery. You never need theatricals nor Dr. Watsons if you stick to a case.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Embarrassed by all the bad press, New York Police Commissioner Arthur Woods <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C07E4D7133BE03ABC4A51DFB166838C609EDE\" target=\"blank\">granted Grace Humiston police powers</a> to investigate kidnappings of young women.</p>\n<p>This was a big thing for her. Despite Cocchi\u2019s creepy psycho explanation for the murder, Grace was convinced that Cocchi was involved in a white slavery scheme, that he had intended to force Ruth into prostitution only to have the plan go awry. She formed the Morality League of America to seek out missing girls and women presumed to have been abducted for the purposes of prostitution, and put her police powers to use in support of it.</p>\n<p>It was her fixation on white slavery that ultimately led to her downfall. In November of 1917, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C03E2DB113AE433A25755C1A9679D946696D6CF\" target=\"blank\">she announced at a Women Lawyers Association dinner</a> that she had discovered 600 pregnant unmarried young women at the U.S. Army\u2019s Camp Upton, and that seven of them were already dead. Her announcement caused a furor. The Army <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9403E7DA113AE433A25754C1A9679D946696D6CF\" target=\"blank\">strenuously denied</a> the existence of hundreds of pregnant slave hookers at Camp Upton, and when pressed, Grace could not furnish any solid evidence of her allegation.</p>\n<p>In December, Commissioner Woods <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0DE5D71E3AE433A25753C3A9649D946696D6CF\" target=\"blank\">revoked her police powers</a>. Two years later <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F40F17FF3D5C147A93C4A8178CD85F4D8185F9\" target=\"blank\">she would herself be arrested</a> on the likely spurious grounds of running a dance hall without a license. The dance hall in question was the Manhattanville Be Kind Club, a club Grace had started for youths to do wholesome things together \u2014 including dancing, on occasion \u2014 and to serve as a day care for working mothers.

A finial atop one of the four main spires (known as pinnacles) on the roof of the Washington National Cathedral broke off and plummeted to the ground, embedding itself into the grass. Two other pinnacles lost their finials and the last remaining one was knocked askew.

The cathedral has recently undergone a period of intense budget-cutting. Several years ago, its staff was cut from 170 to 70 and spending was slashed in half after its endowment plunged amid the economic slowdown. An official said Wednesday that the last year has seen strong fundraising.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They\u2019re going to need every penny they can get. The cathedral was not insured against earthquakes, what with it being in Washington, D.C. and all, and repairs are certain to run into the millions of dollars. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Washington+Monument+Crack.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Crack in Washington Monument pyramidion\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12515\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Washington+Monument+Crack-100x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Washington+Monument+Crack-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Washington+Monument+Crack-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Washington+Monument+Crack-685x1024.jpg 685w\" title=\"Crack in Washington Monument pyramidion\" width=\"100\"/></a>The Washington Monument is cracked. There\u2019s a four foot-long, one inch-wide crack on one of the facets of the pyramidion, the small pyramid that tops the obelisk, and today engineers found more small cracks at the top of the 555-foot monument. Again, the damage does not appear to be structural \u2014 the rumors that the obelisk was leaning are false \u2014 but repairing the tallest obelisk in the world is always a challenge. The National Parks Service has enlisted engineering experts who specialize in earthquake damage assessment and historical architecture to examine and restore the monument.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Smithsonian-castle.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Smithsonian Castle\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12522\" height=\"62\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Smithsonian-castle-e1314244307579-150x62.jpg\" title=\"Smithsonian Castle\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Smithsonian museums are all open today after they were found undamaged.

Although detailed exploration is necessary before they can confirm it, preliminary examination indicates that it is the wreck of the warship <em>Mars</em>, flagship of King Erik XIV\u2019s fleet which sank during a battle with Denmark in 1564. That would make this ship 64 years older than the <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/10142\" target=\"blank\"><em>Vasa</em></a>, Sweden\u2019s famously intact wreck salvaged from Stockholm Bay 50 years ago, and just 19 years older than Tudor England\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/3566\" target=\"blank\"><em>Mary Rose</em></a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/erik_xiv_of_sweden_by_steven_van_der_meulen_1561.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Eric XIV of Sweden by Steven Van der Meulen, 1561\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12503\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/erik_xiv_of_sweden_by_steven_van_der_meulen_1561-159x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/erik_xiv_of_sweden_by_steven_van_der_meulen_1561-159x300.jpg 159w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/erik_xiv_of_sweden_by_steven_van_der_meulen_1561-79x150.jpg 79w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/erik_xiv_of_sweden_by_steven_van_der_meulen_1561-544x1024.jpg 544w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/erik_xiv_of_sweden_by_steven_van_der_meulen_1561.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Eric XIV of Sweden by Steven Van der Meulen, 1561\" width=\"159\"/></a>The <em>Mars</em> was even bigger than the <em>Vasa</em>. It carried 107 guns and a crew of 800, and unlike the <em>Vasa</em> which was poorly constructed and sank on its maiden voyage, <em>Mars</em> actually took those cannon and sailors to war. King Eric, of tenuous sanity but substantial ambition, sought to expand Sweden\u2019s territories in the eastern Baltic, dominated at that time by his cousin Frederick II of Denmark. In 1563 tensions exploded into the Northern Seven Years\u2019 War between Sweden on one side and Denmark\u2013Norway, L\u00fcbeck and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian union on the other.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The shipwreck was discovered at a depth of 75 metres [246 feet], near the northern promontory of the Baltic island of \u00d6land off of Sweden\u2019s east coast. The wreckage is reportedly solid oak and the seabed is strewn with bronze cannons.</p>\n<p>The Mars was the largest ship in the Baltic in its heyday and was sunk, only a year after its maiden voyage, during a sea battle with the Danish-L\u00fcbeckian navy in 1564. </p>\n<p>After two days of ferocious fighting, Mars was hit by cannon fire and went up in smoke. In the ensuing kerfuffle the vessel went down and has been resting untouched in its watery grave for 447 years. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Vasa_stern_vase.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt='\"Vase\" emblem of the Swedish royal family on the lower stern of the warship Vasa' class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12504\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Vasa_stern_vase-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Vasa_stern_vase-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Vasa_stern_vase-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Vasa_stern_vase-768x1024.jpg 768w\" title='\"Vase\" emblem of the Swedish royal family on the lower stern of the warship Vasa' width=\"112\"/></a>The wreck is the proper size and age to be the <em>Mars</em>, and no other ships of its kind went down between Gotland and Oland at that time. Divers also found a sheaf of corn engraved on one of the cannons, the emblem of the House of Vasa, the Swedish royal family in the 16th and 17th centuries. That same emblem can be found on the lower stern of the warship <em>Vasa</em>, embraced by two putti.</p>\n<p>The wreck appears to be well-preserved, divers say, with a hole in its side but otherwise in good condition thanks to the cold waters of the Baltic. Swedish divers have been looking for the <em>Mars</em> for decades, so the team is in seventh heaven.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For wreck-diver Lundgren, finding the lost Mars would be like a boyhood dream come true. </p>\n<p>\u201cTo discover a shipwreck is the dream of all divers, but to find Mars, which people have been searching for so long \u2013 it couldn\u2019t get bigger than that.

It was discovered broken in 180 pieces in the storage room of the <a href=\"http://www.uwo.ca/museum/\" target=\"blank\">Museum of Ontario Archaeology</a>, and was recently painstakingly put back together. Once the vessel was whole again, researchers were surprised to find that it is riddled with holes all over the sides and even one on the bottom.</p>\n<p>The museum has contacted experts in Roman pottery asking if they\u2019re familiar with this form, but nobody has seen another example. Speculation is rife as to how the jar might have been used.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThere are a lot of different options, a lot of them involving either a lamp or some sort of animal container,\u201d [Museum of Ontario Archaeology researcher Katie] Urban said, adding that while the tiny holes would\u2019ve allowed light to pass through the object, the hole at its bottom suggests it wasn\u2019t a lamp.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is that the jar was used to store dormice, rodents found throughout Europe; ancient texts suggest the mice were a popular snack for Romans. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>Urban said the problem with this theory is that dormice jars from elsewhere in the Roman world look different from this vessel. The rodent jars were equipped with a ramp that mice could run along and use to help store food within the holes.</p>\n<p>Yet another idea is that the jar held snakes, ones too big to slither out through its holes. Snakes were a popular religious symbol throughout the ancient world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If we knew more about its archaeological context, we might be able to plug the holes, to coin a phrase. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know where the sherds were found. Museum records suggest the collection of broken jar pieces was donated to the museum by pioneering Welsh archaeologist <a href=\"http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/ArchRev/rev95_6/grimes.htm\" target=\"blank\">William Francis Grimes</a>, director of the Museum of London and the University College London\u2019s Institute of Archaeology, in the 1950s. Grimes is most famous for having unearthed the London Mithraeum in 1954 while surveying a bomb site in central London, but the Museum of Ontario Archaeology has no indication that the jar was found on that famous dig. </p>\n<p>Since the inventory of Grimes\u2019 gifts to the museum is incomplete, it\u2019s possible that the jar isn\u2019t even from Roman Britain, but rather from Ur. The British Museum gave a collection of artifacts from Leonard Woolley\u2019s excavation of the royal burials at Ur to the Ontario museum in 1933. This is unlikely, however, so the museum\u2019s working assumption is that the holy jar is Roman.</p>\n<p>I think it looks a little like one of those pots used to grow strawberries. Those have holes in the bottom for drainage and in the sides for the plants to grow out of. The holes look too small for that use, though.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Roman jar filled with holes perplexes experts\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12487\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/12487#comments\">28 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2011/08/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

Maria Novella, representing the story of Niccol\u00f2 Piccinino, Captain of Duke Filippo of Milan; wherein he designed a group of horsemen who were fighting for a standard, a work that was held to be very excellent and of great mastery, by reason of the marvellous ideas that he had in composing that battle; seeing that in it rage, fury, and revenge are perceived as much in the men as in the horses, among which two with the forelegs interlocked are fighting no less fiercely with their teeth than those who are riding them do in fighting for that standard, which has been grasped by a soldier, who seeks by the strength of his shoulders, as he spurs his horse to flight, having turned his body backwards and seized the staff of the standard, to wrest it by force from the hands of four others, of whom two are defending it, each with one hand, and, raising their swords in the other, are trying to sever the staff; while an old soldier in a red cap, crying out, grips the staff with one hand, and, raising a scimitar with the other, furiously aims a blow in order to cut off both the hands of those who, gnashing their teeth in the struggle, are striving in attitudes of the utmost fierceness to defend their banner; besides which, on the ground, between the legs of the horses, there are two figures in foreshortening that are fighting together, and the one on the ground has over him a soldier who has raised his arm as high as possible, that thus with greater force he may plunge a dagger into his throat, in order to end his life; while the other, struggling with his legs and arms, is doing what he can to escape death.</p>\n<p>It is not possible to describe the invention that Leonardo showed in the garments of the soldiers, all varied by him in different ways, and likewise in the helmet crests and other ornaments; not to mention the incredible mastery that he displayed in the forms and lineaments of the horses, which Leonardo, with their fiery spirit, muscles, and shapely beauty, drew better than any other master. </p></blockquote>\n<p>In classic Leonardo style, he invented an accordion-folding scaffold to reach the top of his immense canvas. Also in a classic but less fortunate Leonardo style, he invented a new undercoat to apply to the wall under his oil painting. He didn\u2019t want to use fresco because it had failed rather spectacularly in <em>The Last Supper</em>, so he scared up some weird mixture that in tests worked quite well. On the huge scale of the wall, though, where it was virtually impossibly to keep the environment evenly warm, the primer didn\u2019t dry quickly enough and before his very eyes the paint started dripping. Leonardo brought in braziers to heat the wall and try to preserve what he could, but only the bottom of the painting managed to dry on time. The paints on the top were hopelessly intermingled. Bummed, Leonardo abandoned the project. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-12634\" height=\"218\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy-300x218.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy-300x218.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy-150x109.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy-1024x744.jpg 1024w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Peter-Paul-Rubens-1603-copy.jpg 1179w\" title='\"The Battle of the Standard\" by Peter Paul Rubens, 1603, copy of Leonardo' width=\"300\"/></a>Even incomplete, the mural was widely revered.

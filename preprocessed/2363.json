Le Guennec claimed the artist\u2019s last wife, Jacqueline, gave them to him as gifts after he installed alarm systems in several of Picasso\u2019s houses, and that he had another 100 or so in a trunk in his garage. He had sent the PA pictures of some of the works in January, but they weren\u2019t high enough quality for the experts to authenticate, so he brought them in for a live examination. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-of-a-horse.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Drawing of a horse\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8775\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-of-a-horse-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-of-a-horse-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-of-a-horse-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-of-a-horse.jpg 956w\" title=\"Drawing of a horse\" width=\"150\"/></a>Claude Picasso, Pablo\u2019s son and head of the Picasso Administration, didn\u2019t believe him. At first he thought they were fakes. They aren\u2019t signed or dated, but when the experts examined the pieces closely they found many of them were numbered using a secret system Picasso used and the collection displayed such an adept use of a variety of techniques to make forgery highly improbable if not impossible. So Claude grudgingly accepted that the works were authentic. He didn\u2019t buy the gift story at all, though, and promptly filed suit for illegal receipt of the works. </p>\n<p>Last month, French police raided the Le Guennec\u2019s home and confiscated the trove. They arrested Pierre but released him shortly thereafter. They\u2019re keeping the collection while they investigate the allegations. </p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis was a gift,\u201d Danielle Le Guennec told The Associated Press by phone from their home in the town of Mouans-Sartoux, near the tourist Riviera hotspot of Antibes. \u201cWe aren\u2019t thieves. We didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>She said the couple decided to come forward with the works this year because they were getting on in years, and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to leave any headaches to our children\u201d with their own estate. Her husband had undergone a cancer treatment operation in March, she said.</p>\n<p>The works, which were kept in a trunk, didn\u2019t appear to be much to her untrained eye, she said: \u201cBut even if this was a little jot of the pencil, it did come from the master.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t tableaus like the ones sold in America.\u201d</p>\n<p>Claude Picasso, quoted in Liberation, noted that his father was known for his generosity \u2013 but that he always dedicated, dated and signed his gifts, as he knew that some recipients might try to sell the works one day.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo give away such a large quantity, that\u2019s unheard-of. It doesn\u2019t hold water,\u201d Claude Picasso was quoted in Liberation as saying. \u201cThis was part of his life.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Olga-Accoudee.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Olga Accoudee\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8776\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Olga-Accoudee-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Olga-Accoudee-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Olga-Accoudee-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Olga-Accoudee.jpg 956w\" title=\"Olga Accoudee\" width=\"150\"/></a>Claude says his father was a bit of a hoarder. He kept everything from subway tickets to bits of string. The notion that Pablo Picasso would have given away such a huge number of his works is utterly alien to his established patterns of behavior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Papier-colle-pipe-et-bouteille.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Papier colle pipe et bouteille collage\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8773\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Papier-colle-pipe-et-bouteille-150x100.jpg\" title=\"Papier colle pipe et bouteille collage\" width=\"150\"/></a>The works were from his early, most prolific period, between 1900 and 1932. Among them are drawings, lithographs, portraits \u2014 including of his first wife, Russian ballerina Olga Khokhlova \u2014 watercolors, sketches and models for some of his most famous works, a painting from his Blue Period, and 9 collages that were described by critics in 1912 as \u201cpainted proverbs\u201d but were thought to have been lost when Picasso\u2019s studio was flooded. </p>\n<p>The estimated market value of this hoard according to the Picasso Administration is around $79 million. The Le Guennecs claim they didn\u2019t want to sell them, just have them authenticated.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Nu-Assis.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Nu Assis\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-8777\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Nu-Assis-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Nu-Assis-150x100.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Nu-Assis-300x200.jpg 230w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Nu-Assis.jpg 490w\" title=\"Nu Assis\" width=\"115\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-on-a-notebook.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Drawing on a notebook\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-8772\" height=\"147\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-on-a-notebook-150x100.jpg\" title=\"Drawing on a notebook\" width=\"100\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-on-another-notebook.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Drawing on another notebook\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-8771\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 108px) 100vw, 108px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-on-another-notebook-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-on-another-notebook-150x100.jpg 108w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-on-another-notebook-300x200.jpg 217w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Drawing-on-another-notebook.jpg 463w\" title=\"Drawing on another notebook\" width=\"108\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Nature-Morte-Verre.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Nature Morte Verre collage\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-8774\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Nature-Morte-Verre-150x100.jpg\" title=\"Nature Morte Verre collage\" width=\"100\"/></a></center></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Retired electrician has 271 undocumented Picassos\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8763\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8763#comments\">19 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-8737\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8737\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Yale to return Inca artifacts for real this time.

All of the artifacts will go back by December 31, 2012, with the items in good enough condition for museum display to be returned in time for the centennial of Bingham\u2019s finds in July 2011. The objects are to be housed at the University of San Antonio Abad in Cuzco and will be available to Yale scholars to study in collaboration with local experts. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The memorandum states that the center will be built with financial support from the Peruvian government. [University President Richard] Levin said Yale will work with the university in Cusco to establish a museum and research center dedicated to the artifacts, adding that details of the deal to found the center are still under negotiation.</p>\n<p>Still, Levin said that the artifacts may return to Yale for short exhibitions of up to two years, as allowed under Peruvian law.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will be able to ensure that the objects will be well taken care of and will be accessible to scholars,\u201d Levin said, adding that these are \u201cconditions that were very important to us.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The memorandum has yet to be formalized, however, and it\u2019s not the first time Yale and Peru have gotten this far only to have it go up in smoke. The last time was in 2007, when after months of negotiations an agreement was reached that acknowledged Peru\u2019s title to the artifacts but granted Yale rights to study and display some of the pieces in New Haven for up to 99 years. That deal fell through in 2008, followed by Peru filing suit against the university in a Connecticut federal court. Peru turned up the heat even further recently, <a href=\"http://www.livinginperu.com/news/13495\" target=\"blank\">taking to the streets</a> in mass protests, threatening to press criminal charges and formally requesting that the White House intervene in the dispute.</p>\n<p>Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, even came down on Peru\u2019s side this June, an interesting illustration of the changing attitude towards repatriation issues given that Hiram Bingham III was himself a Senator from Connecticut from 1924 to 1933.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hiram_Bingham_at_Machu_Picchu_ruins_1911.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Hiram Bingham at Machu Picchu in 1911\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8754\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hiram_Bingham_at_Machu_Picchu_ruins_1911-200x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hiram_Bingham_at_Machu_Picchu_ruins_1911-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hiram_Bingham_at_Machu_Picchu_ruins_1911-100x150.jpg 100w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hiram_Bingham_at_Machu_Picchu_ruins_1911.jpg 501w\" title=\"Hiram Bingham at Machu Picchu in 1911\" width=\"100\"/></a>Bingham is often described as having rediscovered Machu Picchu in his 1911 expedition, although really the locals had never lost it and even foreigners like missionaries and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/424\" target=\"blank\">adventurers/looters</a> knew about it decades before Bingham made his way there.

If the memorandum of understanding gets the official stamp of approval, Peru\u2019s ownership will be uncontested.

The dig is in preparation for the future construction of a wheelchair-accessible elevator that would bring visitors up to the castle walls. </p>\n<p>The find is exciting not just because it might well have been originally constructed as a secret passageway, which is inherently awesome, but because it\u2019s the only medieval structure surviving inside the castle bailey.  The newly-discovered structure has been provisionally dated to the 12th century, which makes it one of the first stone buildings in the castle. </p>\n<p>Lincoln Castle was built by William the Conqueror just 2 years after the conquest to consolidate his power. In 1068 it was just a wooden keep, but it was later replaced by a stone one. The castle has been built on and over repeatedly since then, so finding original stone structures is a major coup.</p>\n<blockquote><p>County archaeologist Beryl Lott described it as an exciting and unique discovery.</p>\n<p>She said: \u201cThere are no other known surviving remains of medieval structures within the castle bailey.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese excavations have discovered the remains of a substantial stone building with a circular interior, possibly the remains of a stairwell or room below the current ground level of the castle bailey.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe room is accessed by a doorway, which leads into a tunnel in the direction of the central bailey area.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lincoln Castle saw a lot of exciting action in the 12th century, most famously the battle between King Stephen and Empress Matilda in 1141. If you\u2019ve read Ken Follett\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pillars-Earth-Hardcover/dp/B003CYZSUS/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1291002476&amp;sr=8-4\" target=\"blank\"><em>Pillars of the Earth</em></a>, watched the sadly inferior TV series based thereon, or read the Cadfael book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Mans-Ransom-Ellis-Peters/dp/0446405167/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1291002449&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"blank\"><em>Dead Man\u2019s Ransom</em></a>, the First Battle of Lincoln featured prominently. </p>\n<p>Stephen besieged Lincoln Castle where Matilda was holed up, but just when it looked like she was done for, her half-brother Robert of Gloucester charged in like the cavalry and won the day. Stephen was captured and Matilda garnered herself a short-lived spell \u2014 from February to June \u2014 on the throne of England. Who knows but Matilda might have taken cover in that passageway before her half-brother\u2019s forces came to save her bacon.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Mysterious  medieval tunnel found at Lincoln Castle\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8716\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8716#comments\">6 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-8693\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8693\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to The Bastille: Living hell and 5-star hotel\">The Bastille: Living hell and 5-star hotel</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Saturday, November 27th, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lhomme-au-masque-de-Fer.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"1789 drawing of &quot;L'homme au Masque de Fer,&quot; the Man in the Iron Mask\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8706\" height=\"100\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lhomme-au-masque-de-Fer-150x100.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lhomme-au-masque-de-Fer-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lhomme-au-masque-de-Fer-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lhomme-au-masque-de-Fer.jpg 956w\" title=\"1789 drawing of &quot;L'homme au Masque de Fer,&quot; the Man in the Iron Mask\" width=\"150\"/></a>A new exhibit at the Arsenal Library branch of the French National Library called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/en/cultural_events/anx_exhibitions/f.bastille_eng.html\" target=\"blank\">La Bastille, or a Living Hell</a>\u201d is putting on display <a href=\"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/breakingnews/exhibit-shows-paris-bastille-prison-had-5-star-comforts-but-was-still-symbol-of-oppression-110837069.html\" target=\"blank\">archives and artifacts of life inside the Bastille</a>, fortress, prison and symbol of royal injustice whose destruction launched a revolution. The prison archives were thrown into ditches by the Parisians who stormed the Bastille on the 14th of July 1789. Nine years passed before the administrator of the Arsenal Library was able to get his hands on them, and there they remained generating surprisingly little interest for the next couple hundred years.</p>\n<p>This exhibit is the first time the archives and artifacts have been gathered together for a comprehensive look at how prisoners in the Bastille really lived, as opposed to the fictional representations of revolutionary misinformation and propaganda. The high profile prisoners like Voltaire and the Marquis de Sade actually led a pretty cushy existence, complete with suites of rooms, their own furniture and dinner parties with outside guests. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Clothing-belonging-to-prisoner-Damiens.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Clothing belonging to prisoner Damiens\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8705\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Clothing-belonging-to-prisoner-Damiens-115x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Clothing-belonging-to-prisoner-Damiens-115x150.jpg 115w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Clothing-belonging-to-prisoner-Damiens-230x300.jpg 230w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Clothing-belonging-to-prisoner-Damiens.jpg 295w\" title=\"Clothing belonging to prisoner Damiens\" width=\"115\"/></a>Even the poor prisoners \u2014 forgers, printers, Huguenots \u2014 lived in far more comfortable conditions than prisoners in any other prison in Paris. They each had their own cells and the prison could only hold a maximum of 50 prisoners, so there wasn\u2019t anything like the squalor and horror that characterized most prisons.</p>\n<p>They were still in a 14th century fortress, though, locked behind 3 triple-locked doors, with highly restricted, censored communications and enforced secrecy. Prisoners were sent to the Bastille by secret order of the King. There was no trial, not even any explanation of the charges. </p>\n<blockquote><p>People were not put in the Bastille for crimes such as theft or murder. They were there for troubling the social order. This included Protestants, homosexuals, prostitutes, traitors, and anyone who dared say anything against the king or his reign \u2014 which meant most of the prisoners were authors, publishers and book peddlers.</p>\n<p>Life inside the Bastille had its limitations, and communications with the outside world were strictly controlled. One prisoner sent a message on his handkerchief written out of coffee and soot, on display in the exhibit. Another smuggled his out in a cheese. One prisoner sewed a message onto a piece of cloth, claiming his innocence and asking whoever found it to help him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecret is the word that defines this prison. Prisoners who left the Bastille would have to sign a register promising to never talk about the prisoners they saw in the Bastille or what they lived through,\u201d Dutray said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One story in the archives describes a terminally ill Protestant woman who was sent to the Bastille. Her daughter was allowed to accompany her even though the daughter was not technically under arrest. She remained by her mother\u2019s side, hiding the truth of how ill her mother was from her captors to ensure she would not be forcibly converted to Catholicism, until her death. Once the woman died, officials didn\u2019t want to release the daughter because she might talk, so they just kept her prisoner in the Bastille for a few years until finally sending her to a convent for the newly converted.</p>\n<p>It was that secrecy which fed the rumors of torture and dark doings that would make the Bastille a symbol of royal abuse and a primary revolutionary target. When 8000 people stormed it on what would become known as Bastille Day, they found only 7 prisoners inside and a cache of gunpowder and weapons. They released the prisoners, dumped the archives, killed the governor and some of the guards, and the next day began to demolish the fortress itself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pierre_de_la_bastille.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Miniature of the Bastille carved out of stone from the Bastille (Carnavalet Museum).\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8709\" height=\"87\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pierre_de_la_bastille-150x112.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pierre_de_la_bastille-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pierre_de_la_bastille-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pierre_de_la_bastille.jpg 980w\" title=\"Miniature of the Bastille carved out of stone from the Bastille, (Carnavalet Museum).\" width=\"150\"/></a>Today there are only a few stones of it left on Boulevard Henri IV, a miniature sculpture of the fortress carved out of one the building stones, a door and a few keys.

The stamp was issued by the Lower Saxony town of Syke in 1872, just a year after German unification. It\u2019s not in mint condition or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_Jenny\" target=\"blank\">printed upside down</a> or designed by <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/5626\" target=\"blank\">Lawrence of Arabia</a>. It\u2019s actually on an envelope and postmarked. The reason it is so valuable is that it was split in two.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Gaertner Auction House explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cStamps were in short supply in Syke between 1872 and 1874 so it was decided that they should be cut in half as a makeshift solution,\u201d she said. \u201cBut because this was only done for a short period, very few letters actually bear these halved stamps.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>When they were created, bisects were worth half the face value of the whole stamp. Postmasters would divide less popular larger denomination stamps into fractions when stocks of the more popular cheaper denominations ran out. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t just halves, but also quarters and eighths, as during Mexico\u2019s classic period (1856 \u2013 1874). People also split stamps informally and used them for the fraction of their face value and postal officials tacitly accepted them even when they were officially verboten.</p>\n<p>Bisects and splits only have philatelic value if they are still attached to the envelope or postcard complete with postmark. If the stamp is on its own, there\u2019s no way to tell that it wasn\u2019t just cut up after it was used. Unlike many of the most famous rarities, for instance the Inverted Jenny, there is no such thing as a mint condition sheet of bisections.</p>\n<p>The Syke bisect is both official and extremely rare. Only 3 of them are known to exist today, and this particular one is famous in its own right because it was on the cover of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Die-Syke-Halbierungen-Briefmarken-Deutschen-1872-1874/dp/B0000EAUT4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1290832862&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"blank\">definitive book</a> on Syke bisects written by the felicitously named Rolf Rohlfs in 1982. Two bidders, one from north Germany, one from the south, went head to head for this special half stamp.

They spent 3 days partying without any kind of religious service whatsoever. It wasn\u2019t until 2 years later that they combined theology and party.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 1623, the Pilgrims at Plymouth Plantation, Massachusetts, held another day of Thanksgiving. As a drought was destroying their crops, colonists prayed and fasted for relief; the rains came a few days later. And not long after, Captain Miles Standish arrived with staples and news that a Dutch supply ship was on its way. Because of all this good fortune, colonists held a day of Thanksgiving and prayer on June 30. This 1623 festival appears to have been the origin of our Thanksgiving Day because it combined a religious and social celebration.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After that there were a variety of local celebrations coinciding with the fall harvest until </p>\n<blockquote><p>[I]n 1789, Elias Boudinot, Massachusetts, member of the House of Representatives, moved that a day of Thanksgiving be held to thank God for giving the American people the opportunity to create a Constitution to preserve their hard won freedoms. A Congressional Joint Committee approved the motion, and informed President George Washington. On October 3, 1789, the President proclaimed that the people of the United States observe \u201ca day of public thanksgiving and prayer\u201d on Thursday, the 26th of November.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So the first official Thanksgiving in the United States of America was to give thanks for the Constitution. I think that\u2019s pretty cool. Also cool is that Jefferson alone among the next 3 Presidents refused to proclaim a day of thanksgiving and prayer because he thought it violated the <a href=\"http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/rel_liberty/establishment/index.aspx\" target=\"blank\">establishment clause</a>.</p>\n<p>After Madison the practice fell out of fashion. Thanksgiving the official annual holiday as we know it today was the result of one lady working avidly for 30 years to get one put on the books, plus the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of the credit for the establishment of an annual Thanksgiving holiday may be given to Sarah Josepha Hale. Editor of Ladies Magazine and Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book, she began to agitate for such a day in 1827 by printing articles in the magazines. She also published stories and recipes, and wrote scores of letters to governors, senators, and presidents. After 36 years of crusading, she won her battle. On October 3, 1863, buoyed by the Union victory at Gettysburg, President Lincoln proclaimed that November 26, would be a national Thanksgiving Day, to be observed every year on the fourth Thursday of November.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can read the text of Lincoln\u2019s Thanksgiving proclamation <a href=\"http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm\" target=\"blank\">here</a>.

Durability and ease of repair is where rudimentary early technology spanks the fancy new stuff. (Also because it\u2019s not connected to the network so when Skynet turns evil and the Cylons launch their attack, George will still be on our side. Walking. Very, very slowly.)</p>\n<p>Royal Air Force officer Tony Sale built George in 1950 for \u00a315 and scrap aluminium and duralumin he scavenged from a Wellington bomber that had crashed at RAF Debden air base where Sale taught student pilots how to use radar. The 6-foot robot is powered by two 12-volt motorcycle batteries in his legs. His eyes light up and he can walk, turn his head, move his arms, and sit down. He used to be able to zero in on a  specially-designed illuminated beer bottle with light sensitive cells in his eyes, but alas that functionality is no longer. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Georges-guts.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"George's guts\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8652\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 89px) 100vw, 89px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Georges-guts-134x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Georges-guts-134x300.jpg 134w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Georges-guts-67x150.jpg 67w\" title=\"George's guts\" width=\"89\"/></a>Mr. Sale is a robotics pioneer, and has been from a very young age.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr Sale has always been interested in mechanics and built his first George the robot using Meccano when he was just 12 years old. The instructions for making the robot were in the Meccano manual and it could walk at a steady pace by shuffling its feet.</p>\n<p>In 1945 Mr Sale made a second George the robot and three years later at the age of 17 he improved it by making it bigger and controlling it by radio. This new 3ft version was also made from Meccano, but was covered with a silver cardboard skin and was considered so impressive it appeared on television.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat summer I decided to build a fourth George, which was 5ft high and had a moving jaw to simulate speech,\u201d he said. \u201cHe caused lots of excitement and was featured in the newspapers.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p>But it was the 5th George that really made a splash with his impressive 6-foot height, 30 foot-range radio control, uncanny resemblance to the Tin Woodman and, of course, that sweet beer trick. Path\u00e9 made a classic 50s newsreel about him and his (fictional) housekeeping skills and he got a great deal of attention from the press for a while.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter George\u2019s 15 minutes were up and since the technology necessary to give George even rudimentary artificial intelligence was either non-existent or unminiaturizable, Sale packed George away in a corner of his garage where he remained for 45 years. When a BBC television show called Wallace and Gromit\u2019s World of Invention contacted him to ask after George, Sale dusted him off, gave his bearings a fresh coating of oil, put two new lithium batteries in his legs and he booted right back up like old days.</p>\n<p>Now that he\u2019s alive (ALIVE!) again, he\u2019ll be going on display at the <a href=\"http://www.tnmoc.org/36/section.aspx/152\" target=\"blank\">National Museum of Computing</a> at Bletchley Park, the war-time home of the famous Colossus computer that broke the Nazi Lorenz cipher. Sale helped found the museum, and he led the team which spent 10 years <a href=\"http://www.tnmoc.org/colossus-rebuild.aspx\" target=\"blank\">recreating the Colossus Mark 2</a> computer which now stands in the same exact place the original once stood, breaking German codes during the war.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some excellent footage of George, Tony and Colossus Mark 2 Mark 2 today:</p>\n<p><object height=\"336\" width=\"430\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/emp/external/player.swf\"/><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"/><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"config_settings_addReferrerToPlaylistRequest=true&amp;config_settings_showPopoutCta=false&amp;config_settings_showPopoutButton=false&amp;config_settings_language=defaultconfig%5Fplugin%5FfmtjLiveStats%5FpageType%3Deav6&amp;config=http%3A%2F%2Fnews%2Ebbc%2Eco%2Euk%2Fplayer%2Femp%2Fconfig%2Fdefault%2Exml%3F10%5F17%5F10%5F17%5F301547%5F20101019102320&amp;playlist=http%3A%2F%2Fplaylists%2Ebbc%2Eco%2Euk%2Fnews%2Ftechnology%2D11773624A%2Fplaylist%2Esxml&amp;config_settings_showFooter=true&amp;config_plugin_fmtjLiveStats_pageType=eav6&amp;config_settings_showPopoutButton=false&amp;config_settings_showPopoutCta=false&amp;config_settings_addReferrerToPlaylistRequest=true\"/><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" flashvars=\"config_settings_addReferrerToPlaylistRequest=true&amp;config_settings_showPopoutCta=false&amp;config_settings_showPopoutButton=false&amp;config_settings_language=defaultconfig%5Fplugin%5FfmtjLiveStats%5FpageType%3Deav6&amp;config=http%3A%2F%2Fnews%2Ebbc%2Eco%2Euk%2Fplayer%2Femp%2Fconfig%2Fdefault%2Exml%3F10%5F17%5F10%5F17%5F301547%5F20101019102320&amp;playlist=http%3A%2F%2Fplaylists%2Ebbc%2Eco%2Euk%2Fnews%2Ftechnology%2D11773624A%2Fplaylist%2Esxml&amp;config_settings_showFooter=true&amp;config_plugin_fmtjLiveStats_pageType=eav6&amp;config_settings_showPopoutButton=false&amp;config_settings_showPopoutCta=false&amp;config_settings_addReferrerToPlaylistRequest=true&amp;config_settings_showFooter=true\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/emp/external/player.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"430\"/></object></p>\n<p>You can see the full 1950 newsreel about George excerpted in the above video on <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=74088\" target=\"blank\">British Path\u00e9\u2019s website</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"George the Robot walks again after 45 years\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8639\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8639#comments\">4 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-8624\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8624\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Hungary to sell communist art for red sludge relief\">Hungary to sell communist art for red sludge relief</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, November 23rd, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bronze-of-lenin.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Bronze of Lenin\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8633\" height=\"105\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bronze-of-lenin-150x105.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bronze-of-lenin-150x105.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bronze-of-lenin-300x211.jpg 300w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bronze-of-lenin.jpg 720w\" title=\"Bronze of Lenin\" width=\"150\"/></a>The Hungarian government will be putting some of its <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131511974\" target=\"blank\">communist history on the auction block</a> in aid of the victims of the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131072292\" target=\"blank\">red sludge flood</a> that killed 10 people, all the fish in the Marcal river and contaminated and destroyed vast swaths of western Hungary.

The skeletons are buried in an unusual way \u2014 in shore ditches with no grave goods \u2014 and since there are no specific cultural or date markers, they\u2019re a bit of a mystery right now. They may predate the Romans.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jo Lyon, a senior archaeologist at the [Museum of London], said: \u201cWe were extremely fortunate to discover such a comprehensive repertoire of Roman finds and features so close to the surface. They tell us a great deal about how the people of this village lived, worked and died.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe archaeology at Syon Park has given us a valuable, rare insight into the daily life of an agricultural village on the outskirts of Londinium (London) that would have supplied the Roman city and provided shelter for travellers passing through. It helps us build a picture of the Roman landscape and shows how the busy metropolis of Londinium connected with the rest of Roman Britain.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Roman-skeleton.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"A Roman skeleton buried in a field ditch at Syon Park\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8615\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 131px) 100vw, 131px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Roman-skeleton-131x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Roman-skeleton-131x150.jpg 131w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Roman-skeleton-263x300.jpg 263w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Roman-skeleton.jpg 634w\" title=\"A Roman skeleton buried in a field ditch at Syon Park\" width=\"131\"/></a>Londinium was founded by the Romans around 49 A.D., 7 years or so after the 43 A.D. invasion of Britain. They built roads in and out and settlements radiated outwards around the roads. The Syon Park village was between the road and the Thames, a highly convenient location both for travel and for agriculture. Most Roman settlements were continuously built over. This one remained intact just under the surface despite its suburban London location thanks to its being preserved as parkland in the Syon estate.</p>\n<p>Local legend has it that the area where they were found is just a few hundred yards away from where Julius Caesar crossed the Thames and defeated an alliance of British tribes under chieftain Cassivellaunus in 54 B.C.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Duke of Northumberland, whose family has held residence at Syon Park for more than 400 years, said: \u201cSyon Park has a rich and remarkable history. The Roman findings are an incredible addition to this legacy and emphasise Syon Park\u2019s place as a prominent landmark in ancient British history.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Waldorf Astoria is scheduled to open early next year. Some of the artifacts will go on display in the luxury hotel.</p>\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/tzLrSZGrGhQ&amp;w=430]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Roman village found on west London Ducal estate\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8601\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/rome\" rel=\"category tag\">Roma, Caput Mundi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8601#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-8586\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8586\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to First Batman comic sells for $500,000\">First Batman comic sells for $500,000</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, November 21st, 2010</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Detective-Comics-27.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Detective Comics #27, sold for $492,937\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8598\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Detective-Comics-27-189x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Detective-Comics-27-189x300.jpg 189w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Detective-Comics-27-94x150.jpg 94w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Detective-Comics-27-647x1024.jpg 647w\" title=\"Detective Comics #27, sold for $492,937\" width=\"189\"/></a>Robert Irwin bought a copy of Detective Comics #27 at a Sacramento newsstand in 1939 for a dime. He was 13 and an avid reader of comics. This one issue was the only one he kept past childhood. Thursday <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_16658831\" target=\"blank\">he sold it at auction for $492,937</a>.</p>\n<p>Detective Comics #27 features the first appearance of \u201cThe Batman.\u201d Although 250,000 copies of the comic were printed in 1939, only 150 are known to be extant today, hence the big price tag. Mr. Irwin kept his in excellent condition over the years, but even so it\u2019s still not the top of the market for this particular issue. Earlier this year, Heritage Auction sold a near-mint copy for $1.75 million. </p>\n<p>In fact, it was that sale that inspired Robert Irwin to finally sell his copy. He had rediscovered it 6 years earlier and he knew he had something special when a collector offered him $100,000 for it. He turned down the offer and held on to it for another 5 years. </p>\n<p>As impressive as the sale price is, that\u2019s not the part that gives experts the biggest thrill. It\u2019s the backstory, the fact that the boy who bought it when it was new in 1939 is the man who sold it in 2010. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Although he has seen comic books sell for more than a million dollars, Jaster considers this auction a once-in-a-lifetime kind of sale at the auction house.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here for nine years and been part of a lot of major auctions, but this one was unique,\u201d said [Ed Jaster, senior vice president at Heritage]. \u201cTo come across an item that someone bought for 10 cents and have it sell for almost a half million dollars \u2014 that\u2019s special.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Robert-Irwin-with-DC-27.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img alt=\"Robert Irwin with his copy of DC #27\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8593\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Robert-Irwin-with-DC-27-112x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Robert-Irwin-with-DC-27-112x150.jpg 112w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Robert-Irwin-with-DC-27-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Robert-Irwin-with-DC-27.jpg 236w\" title=\"Robert Irwin with his copy of DC #27\" width=\"112\"/></a>When asked why he kept only this one comic out of the hundreds he and his brother bought when they were kids, Irwin said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I must have just liked the cover.\u201d The cover was designed by the great Bob Kane himself, so that\u2019s as good a reason as any.</p>\n<p>Once the auction house gets its cut, Irwin should clear about $400,000. He\u2019ll celebrate with his wife and son over dinner in Dallas, then he\u2019s going back to Sacramento to pay off his mortgage.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"First Batman comic sells for $500,000\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8586\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/modernish\" rel=\"category tag\">Modern(ish)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/treasures\" rel=\"category tag\">Treasures</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8586#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"navigation\">\n<div class=\"alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/date/2010/11/page/2\">\u00ab Previous Entries</a></div>\n<div class=\"alignright\"></div>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- MAIN -->\n<div id=\"SIDE\">\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page_item page-item-16\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/its-a-blog-about-history\">It\u2019s a blog.

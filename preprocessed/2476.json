Photo courtesy the Trustees of the British Museum.\" width=\"200\"/></a>A 3,000-year-old boundary stone from Babylonia <a href=\"http://www.arabnews.com/node/1469361/middle-east\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was returned to Iraq</a> in an official ceremony on Tuesday after seven years of investigation and legal wrangling. It\u2019s not clear when the object was stolen \u2014 experts believe it was looted during the chaos of the Iraq War around 15 years ago. It surfaced in 2012 when the importer attempted to smuggle the piece into Britain with fake paperwork. The stone arrived at Heathrow airport in May 2012. The customs declaration claimed it was a carved stone made in Turkey worth $330. When a UK Border Force officer opened the box, he recognized the stone was no Turkish fake and that the claimed origin in the declaration had to be fraudulent. </p>\n<p>Experts at the British Museum quickly identified it from the copious cuneiform inscriptions as a 12th century B.C. kudurru, a ceremonial boundary stone recording a land grant from the king. There are only 200 known surviving examples of kudurrus, and this one is a stand-out. It describes a gift of land from Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I to one of his subjects in recognition of his distinguished service. The inscription indicates the stone came from Nippur, an ancient Sumerian city in what is now southern Iraq that was restored and expanded by Babylonian monarchs. Nippur suffered extensive looting in 2003 which is when experts believe the kudurru was stolen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54636\" height=\"232\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-200x232.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-200x232.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-129x150.jpg 129w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-768x890.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-430x499.jpg 430w\" title=\"Boundary stone engraved with depictions of gods Marduk and Enlil. Photo courtesy the Trustees of the British Museum.\" width=\"200\"/></a>One side of the stone is covered in images depicting the gods Enlil and Marduk. The other side is inscribed with cuneiform text. In addition to recording the land grant, the text describes an enormously significant period of Babylonian history. It tells of how at the end of the preceding dynasty, Elamite forces had invaded the kingdom, looted the temples and carried away the statue of the god Marduk leaving Babylon bereft not just of the visual representation of the god, but of the protection of the god himself.</p>\n<p>Enlil, father of the gods, created Nebuchadnezzar to avenge the outrage done to the Babylonians. The great king invaded Elam, defeated its army and reclaimed the statue of Marduk. He returned it to the temple and all was right with the world again.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt is such an important moment in Babylonian history. Forever after the Babylonians told stories about this great, brave king who brought Marduk back, and in response they created the Babylonian epic of creation, which tells about how Marduk was appointed to defeat the forces of chaos and to put order into the universe. So, every spring at the new year festival they recite this epic of creation.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54634\" height=\"231\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-200x231.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-200x231.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-130x150.jpg 130w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-768x888.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-back-430x497.jpg 430w\" title=\"Cuneiform inscriptions on boundary stone.

So, it is to protect forever this gift in recognition of this act of bravery,\u201d said Taylor.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"UK returns looted Nebuchadnezzar boundary stone to Iraq\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54632\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54632#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54558\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54558\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Police seize smuggled leather Hebrew manuscript\">Police seize smuggled leather Hebrew manuscript</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, March 12th, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54563\" height=\"96\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-150x96.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-150x96.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-200x127.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-768x489.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover-430x274.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/leather-manuscript-cover.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Cover page of leather manuscript believed to have been looted from a Syrian museum.

The owl is listed among the abomination birds in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+11%3A13-18&amp;version=KJV\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leviticus</a> and in medieval Christendom it was often used to symbolize Jews as creatures of darkness because of their rejection of Christ. As for the man, the prohibition against graven images put a damper on figural depictions in Jewish art, but it didn\u2019t prevent it entirely. There are frescoes, mosaics and manuscripts with images of Biblical figures, even ones from pagan mythology employed as metaphors. He could be a representation of a prophet or anybody else, for that matter. He does bear a resemblance to other rough drawn images of Jesus, however.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54567\" height=\"90\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-150x90.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-150x90.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-200x120.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-768x461.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination-430x258.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Man-illumination.jpg 1200w\" title=\"Robed man illumination.

Had they accepted a fraudulent ownership record starring a Swiss private collector a few years back I would have laughed mirthlessly at the very idea of it, but the sensitivity to potentially looted artifacts is so much higher now that museums and auction houses have been dragged kicking and screaming into giving a damn by source countries creating legal and PR nightmares for them. That such a recent, high-profile, much-publicized sale could be a looted artifact with phony papers is an ugly testament to how deep the rot runs in the antiquities market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gilded-cartonnage-coffin-lid-whole.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-48811\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 164px) 100vw, 164px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gilded-cartonnage-coffin-lid-whole-164x300.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gilded-cartonnage-coffin-lid-whole-164x300.jpg 164w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gilded-cartonnage-coffin-lid-whole-82x150.jpg 82w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gilded-cartonnage-coffin-lid-whole-768x1404.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gilded-cartonnage-coffin-lid-whole-430x786.jpg 430w\" title=\"Gilded cartonnage coffin of Nedjemankh.

Made from layers of linen, gesso and resin, covered in gilding front and back and lined with sheets of silver foil inside the lid, the mummiform coffin was the final resting place of Late Ptolemaic official Nedjemankh, a priest of Heryshef in Heracleopolis Magna.</p>\n<p>The gilded coffin of Nedjemankh went on display immediately in the museum\u2019s Egyptian Art gallery, and soon got <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/nedjemankh-gilded-coffin\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a dedicated exhibition</a> that ran from July 2018 until Tuesday, February 12th. Or at least it was meant to. There was supposed to be an exhibition tour beginning on February 22nd. <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/met-tours/gallery-talks/exh-tour-nedjemankh?eid=A007_%7bD658A518-7369-4F8C-96B9-59614A620FF2%7d_20181011102732\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">No longer</a>. I don\u2019t know exactly which day, but the coffin was taken off display this week. </p>\n<p>On Friday the museum <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2019/metropolitan-museum-of-art-returns-coffin-to-egypt\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced that it was returning the coffin to Egypt</a> because the Manhattan\u2019s DA Office had found evidence that the Swiss private collection and legal export document from 1971 were nothing but happy horseshit conjured up by traffickers in looted antiquities. Not only was it not legally exported in 1971, it didn\u2019t leave Egypt until 2011 and I don\u2019t need to tell you the circumstances were very, very far from legal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Notwithstanding the representations that the coffin had been exported from Egypt in 1971, recent evidence suggests it was looted from Egypt in 2011. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said, \u201cStewards of the world\u2019s most important artifacts have a duty to hold their acquisitions to the highest level of scrutiny. Following my Office\u2019s investigation, this beautiful piece of ancient Egyptian history will soon be returned to its rightful place. Our Antiquities Trafficking Unit will continue to root out stolen antiquities in our fight to stop the looting of historic sites and the trade of stolen artifacts around the world.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The seller was a Paris dealer named Christophe Kunicki. The Met is less than pleased with him having paid 3.5 million euros (just under $4 million) for the coffin in July of 2017, just six years after it was stolen from Egypt. This character has yet to comment on the fraudulent sale and the Met plans to consider \u201call means,\u201d according to spokesman Kenneth Weine, for the recovery of the $4 million they were conned out of. There is no word on any criminal action that might be taken against him, and there probably won\u2019t be.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced today it will review and revise its acquisitions process. Max Hollein, Director of The Met, said, \u201cOur museum must be a leader among our peers in the respect for cultural property and in the rigor and transparency of the policy and practices that we follow. We will learn from this event\u2014specifically I will be leading a review of our acquisitions program\u2014to understand what more can be done to prevent such events in the future.\u201d\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here\u2019s one revision to any museum or collector\u2019s acquisition policy that needs to be carved in stone from now on: buy nothing purporting to come from Swiss private collections. It\u2019s a scam every damn time. The Met apologized to Egypt profusely and abjectly, as well it should, and I do the same to you, as well I should. I can\u2019t believe I was so thoroughly duped by the oldest lie in the book, one I have mocked and excoriated ad nauseum in this very blog a million times before.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"I fell for a \u201cSwiss Private Collection\u201d lie, dammit\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54339\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54339#comments\">10 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-54019\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54019\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Speaking of looted art from Visigothic Spain\u2026\">Speaking of looted art from Visigothic Spain\u2026</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Tuesday, January 22nd, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Visigoth-reliefs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-54021\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Visigoth-reliefs-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Visigoth-reliefs-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Visigoth-reliefs-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Visigoth-reliefs-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Visigoth-reliefs-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"7th c. Visigoth limestone reliefs of two evangelists looted from the church of Maria del Lara in Spain. Photo by Niklas Halle'n, AFP. \" width=\"200\"/></a>Two Visigoth reliefs looted from a church in northern Spain 15 years ago have been <a href=\"https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/indiana-jones-art-finds-stolen-spanish-carvings-english-garden-doc-1cg4hv2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found in Britain and returned to Spanish officials</a>. The theft was a total debacle, but the heavy reliefs depicting two evangelists managed to survive intact against the odds.</p>\n<p>The 7th century limestone reliefs originally adorned the church of Santa Maria de Lara, one of only a handful of churches from the Visigoth era still remaining on the Iberian peninsula. Built in the 7th or early 8th century, the church was abandoned after the Umayyad conquest and was likely rebuilt after the Spanish Reconquista in the 9th century. It was donated to the neighboring monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza in the 11th century but was not maintained and fell to ruin, eventually being forgotten entirely. The remains were rediscovered by a priest on a walk in 1921. They were obscured by brush and the location was remote so even after the church was found locals still used the ruins as corrals for their livestock. </p>\n<p>Its fortunes improved when scholars identified as a Visigoth church in 1927 and it was granted National Monument status two years later. It wasn\u2019t until the custodian and guide built an asphalted road to the nearby town of Quintanilla de las Vinas in the 1970s that the church became a popular tourist draw and brought it enough money to fund the site\u2019s maintenance.</p>\n<p>Even with a decent access road and thousands of visitors a year, Santa Maria de Lara was secluded enough that in 2004 thieves were able to use a crane to strip two 110-pound stone reliefs from the church and remove them unimpeded. They thought they had hit the jackpot. Very few Visigoth figural sculptures have survived, so these two pieces would be worth millions. Notice the conditional. They would be worth millions if they weren\u2019t protected cultural patrimony, but they are. </p>\n<p>As so often happens, the looters found themselves saddled with artifacts they could not sell for what they were worth. They had to take the hit and sell them off for whatever money they could get. And so in 2010, two priceless Visigoth reliefs were sold in Britain as garden ornaments for maybe 50,000 pounds apiece. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54022\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-200x133.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-200x133.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/arthur-brand-with-reliefs-430x286.jpg 430w\" title=\"Arthur Brand with recovered reliefs.

He alerted <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53373\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Art Detective</a>, private investigator Arthur Brand who recovers looted cultural material and stars in a TV show in the Netherlands dedicated to his exploits. Brand traveled to England to follow up, only to find that his informant had just died. His wife only knew a man named \u201cTony\u201d was connected to the stones. All she had was his first name and a description of him. </p>\n<p>It took Brand years to track Tony down. When he finally did, the fellow was suffering from dementia. He did remember the reliefs. He had seen them being delivered to London on a truck by a French art dealer and recognized that they might be Visigothic. Eventually he was able to locate photographs of them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Brand then tracked down the French dealer, who pointed them towards an unnamed British aristocratic family living north of London.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt ended up in the garden of an English nobleman, who did not know that it was world heritage, where they would stay like 15 years,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The owners were so shocked when told the truth that \u201cthey wanted to throw the artworks into a river and let them disappear forever. Fortunately we managed to convinced them not to,\u201d said Brand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I hope that was facetious. Destroying cultural heritage out of shame for having bought it through no fault of your own seems \u2026 well, nuts. Anyway it\u2019s all good now. The reliefs are on their way back to Burgos and scholars are thrilled at what might be learned from them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The looted artworks could also be \u201cessential\u201d evidence in a debate raging among scholars about the exact age of the church, said Oxford University researcher David Addison.</p>\n<p>Addison said some believed it was a 7th century building while others dated it to the 10th or 11th centuries.</p>\n<p>Brand\u2019s return of the artifacts \u201cwould be a great service in this regard,\u201d Addison said.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Speaking of looted art from Visigothic Spain\u2026\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54019\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/medieval\" rel=\"category tag\">Medieval</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/54019#comments\">3 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53993\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53993\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to A tale of Visigothic treasure lost and found\">A tale of Visigothic treasure lost and found</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Monday, January 21st, 2019</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>It was August 25th, 1858. The night before had been dark and stormy, but this one was moonlit and clear. Francisco Morales and Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez were traveling on the road to Guadamar with their daughter Escol\u00e1stica and a donkey when they reached the Guarrazar spring six miles outside Toledo. While answering the call of nature, Escol\u00e1stica spied under the white glimmer of the moonlight a square hole barely covered with two flat stones. In the gap between them something shone gone. That something turned out to be a priceless treasure of gold crosses, goblets and other objects festooned with precious stones, pearls and glass. Francisco, Mar\u00eda and Escol\u00e1stica dug up everything they could find, rinsed the artifacts in the spring and quickly made off with their ill-gotten gains.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t know it, but they weren\u2019t alone that night. Domingo de la Cruz, a gardener who owned an orchard near Guarrazar spring, had observed them digging up buried treasure. The next night, he went back to the site and did some of his own digging, finding a second, smaller collection of treasure. He too made off with it. Nobody told the authorities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crowns-on-display-at-Cluny.-Photo-by-sailko..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54001\" height=\"168\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crowns-on-display-at-Cluny.-Photo-by-sailko.-200x168.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crowns-on-display-at-Cluny.-Photo-by-sailko.-200x168.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crowns-on-display-at-Cluny.-Photo-by-sailko.-150x126.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crowns-on-display-at-Cluny.-Photo-by-sailko.-768x645.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Crowns-on-display-at-Cluny.-Photo-by-sailko.-430x361.jpg 430w\" title=\"Crowns on display at Cluny.

Many of them were broken up, melted down and reused making them untraceable. It\u2019s said that one smith was so torn over what to do with a unique gold dove that he threw it in the Tagus. Gemstone trader Jos\u00e9 Navarro took a different approach. He had a yen for archaeology, so he bought numerous fragments and painstakingly pieced them back together, reconstructing the votive crowns commissioned by Visigothic royalty as donations to the Church, royals that can be identified with precision because pendant letters spell out the name of the exalted donors. Navarro did all this work under strictest secrecy. In 1859, his work as complete as he could get it, Navarro sold the crowns, pendants and assorted pieces to to Edmond Du Sommerard, director of the Mus\u00e9e National du Moyen \u00c2ge in Cluny, France.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the news of this exceptional discovery finally broke wide. Cluny published their acquisition in the scientific press and Spain was horrified to discover that incalculably precious cultural patrimony had been found only after it was lost. The Spanish government repeatedly demanded that France return the treasure, but was blown off by Napoleon III and subsequent governments. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Corona_de_Recesvinto-e1548143349193.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53997\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 72px) 100vw, 72px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Corona_de_Recesvinto-e1548143349193-72x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Corona_de_Recesvinto-e1548143349193-72x150.jpg 72w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Corona_de_Recesvinto-e1548143349193-145x300.jpg 145w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Corona_de_Recesvinto-e1548143349193-768x1591.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Corona_de_Recesvinto-e1548143349193-386x800.jpg 386w\" title=\"Votive crown of Recceswinth.

He found a few loose pearls and gemstones that had fallen off the jewels, graves, some architectural remains and lots of evidence that the site had been thoroughly picked over by local looters who had heard about the treasure through the gossip mill.</p>\n<p>It was R\u00edos who recognized that while the form of the votive crown and the decoration were of Byzantine design, the pieces were manufactured locally. The conventional wisdom among European historians at that time was that Spain was a penurious backwater in the early Middle Ages and that the splendors of the Visigoths which had so astounded the Umayyad conquerors who took Toledo in 712 A.D. had to have been Germanic in origin. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Votive-crown.-Photo-by-Luis-Garc\u00eda..jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-54000\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 98px) 100vw, 98px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Votive-crown.-Photo-by-Luis-Garc\u00eda.-98x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Votive-crown.-Photo-by-Luis-Garc\u00eda.-98x150.jpg 98w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Votive-crown.-Photo-by-Luis-Garc\u00eda.-196x300.jpg 196w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Votive-crown.-Photo-by-Luis-Garc\u00eda.-768x1174.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Votive-crown.-Photo-by-Luis-Garc\u00eda.-430x657.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Votive-crown.-Photo-by-Luis-Garc\u00eda..jpg 1056w\" title=\"Votive crown.

Much hemming and hawing and hypothetical \u201cif somebody happened to have purloined gold Visigothic treasure a few years back and wanted to hand it in, would he get thrown in the dungeon or paid off?\u201d kind of talk ensued. Queen Isabel agreed to accept the remaining treasure \u2014 including the votive crown of King Suintila (r. 621-631) \u2014 and give Domingos de la Cruz a fabulous pension of 4,000 reals a year in return.

The first comprehensive study took place in 1995 and revealed that the gemstones traveled great distances. The cabochon sapphires are from Sri Lanka. The emeralds are from the Austrian Tyrol. </p>\n<p>The question of why they had been buried in the first place was still open, however. Historians speculated that the priceless religious artifacts had been secreted in consecrated graves to keep them safe from the invasion force of T\u00e1riq Ibn Ziyad. Spanish archaeologist Juan Manuel Rojas <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/01/17/inenglish/1547728988_158224.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found this explanation wanting</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With the help of the Guadamur City Hall, Rojas embarked on an investigation that led to the establishment of an archeological site that the public can now visit.</p>\n<p>During recent years, the walls of a building more than 30 meters long have been unearthed as well as a basilica, the remains of what appears to have been a palace, a Visigoth graveyard and even a guest house for pilgrims. Rojas\u2019 research has led to the revelation that the place where the treasure was hidden was not a field at all but a religious complex not unlike the one at Lourdes, France, with its own healing water that sprung from the well where Morales cleaned the jewels. So, far from being buried in an ignominious field, the royal treasure had been hidden in a prestigious site whose own ceilings were decked with votive crowns.</p>\n<p>When its occupants found out about the unstoppable advance of the Muslim and Berber forces, they sought somewhere to hide the jewels and decided on the graveyard. Raising two tombstones, they removed the bodies, buried the treasure, covered it with cloths and sand and put the corpses back on top. When Escol\u00e1stica went to relieve herself at the spot more than 1,000 years later, she ducked behind what had once been the wall around the cemetery.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can see the crown of King Reccesvinth (649-672) in a <a href=\"http://viewer.spainisculture.com/hdimages/TESOROGUARRAZARCORONAI/viewer.html?lang=es&amp;__utma=1.1838412010.1548093210.1548093210.1548142376.2&amp;__utmb=1.1.10.1548142376&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1548142376.2.2.utmcsr=man.es|utmccn=(referral)|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=/man/coleccion/catalogo-cronologico/edad-media/guarrazar.html&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=2913328\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3D scan here</a>, another votive crown <a href=\"http://viewer.spainisculture.com/hdimages/TESOROGUARRAZARCORONAII/viewer.html?lang=es&amp;__utma=1.1838412010.1548093210.1548093210.1548142376.2&amp;__utmb=1.1.10.1548142376&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1548142376.2.2.utmcsr=man.es|utmccn=(referral)|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=/man/coleccion/catalogo-cronologico/edad-media/guarrazar.html&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=2913328\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and a third <a href=\"http://viewer.spainisculture.com/hdimages/TESOROGUARRAZARCORONAIII/viewer.html?lang=es&amp;__utma=1.1838412010.1548093210.1548093210.1548142376.2&amp;__utmb=1.1.10.1548142376&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1548142376.2.2.utmcsr=man.es|utmccn=(referral)|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=/man/coleccion/catalogo-cronologico/edad-media/guarrazar.html&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=2913328\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

Photo courtesy Ministry of Culture and Sports of the Hellenic Republic.\" width=\"200\"/></a>More than a century after it was lost, a 3rd century B.C. stele <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/236088/article/ekathimerini/life/ancient-nikouria-decree-missing-for-almost-a-century-rediscovered-on-amorgos\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has been rediscovered</a> embedded in the outer wall of a home on the island of Amorgos in the Cyclades. The Nikouria decree went missing in 1908 and many researchers have tried and failed to find it ever since. An archaeology student, Stelios Perakis, and archaeologist N. N. Fischer found the piece with the help of local residents. </p>\n<p>French archaeologist Th\u00e9ophile Homolle, then director of the French School at Athens, discovered the stele in 1893 in the Panagia Church on the islet of Nikouria in northeastern Amorgos. The inscription records a response to Ptolemy II Philadelphus\u2019 request that delegates be sent to Samos to discuss the Island League\u2019s participation in the games and religious rites in honor of his father Ptolemy I Soter. Ptolemy, friend and general to Alexander the Great and ruler of Egypt after his death in 323 B.C., had \u201cliberated\u201d (really it was more of a take-over) some of the city-states of the Cyclades, restoring their ancient constitutions and repealing their taxes. </p>\n<p>His son picked up where the father left off, expanding the Ptolemaic dominance in the Cyclades. The Island League was a political union of the Cycladic islands created by the Ptolemies to cement their influence. In the stele, the League agrees to send a mission to the sacred games held for Ptolemy in Alexandria. The Ptolemy games were also held every four years and the inscription explicitly addresses the obvious rival by stipulated that the members of the League hold the Ptolemaieia in equal importance to the Olympic games. The decree would be proclaimed in all the cities of the League. Ptolemy II would be gifted a gold crown at the cost of 1,000 staters. The stele then details how the island cities would pay for all this and names the three delegates they\u2019d send to Samos. (The name of the third is lost.)</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been a lot of debate among scholars about the dating of the Nikouria decree. The first date proffered in 1895 was ca. 285-3 based on a reference to Ptolemy II\u2019s accession to the throne, but Ptolemy didn\u2019t conquer Samos until after his victory in the battle of Kouroupedion in 281 B.C . Later scholars shifted the range to the 260s B.C., likely 262 when the Ptolemaieia was held.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The specific stele is considered important since it provides evidence concerning the balance of power during the first half of the 3rd century BC and the transition of control from the Macedonians to the Ptolemies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Belying its significance, the stele was not kept in a secure location after is discovery. It was stashed in a stable near the find site for years. That stable was its last known address when all records of its ceased in 1908. It was found again in the wall at a newly renovated home which had once belonged to Stamatis Gripsos, a shepherd from Nikouria. Perhaps he had access to the barnus delicti. The Nikouria decree will now be removed from the wall and moved to the Amorgos archaeological collection.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Missing Ancient Greek decree found in wall\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53791\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53791#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53506\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53506\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Ohio university returns looted mosaics to Turkey\">Ohio university returns looted mosaics to Turkey</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Sunday, December 2nd, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mosaic-of-Pan.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53523\" height=\"132\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mosaic-of-Pan-150x132.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mosaic-of-Pan-150x132.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mosaic-of-Pan-200x176.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mosaic-of-Pan-768x677.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mosaic-of-Pan-430x379.jpg 430w\" title=\"Mosaic of Pan.

The university bought the mosaics in 1965 for $35,000 from New York antiquities dealer Peter Marks. There was little paperwork on the provenance of these mosaics, but the claim was that they were from Antioch, modern-day Antakya also in Turkey, raised by Princeton University archaeologists in an approved excavation in the 1930s and exported legally as their share of the finds according to the old partage system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Owl-mosaic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-53518\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 148px) 100vw, 148px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Owl-mosaic-148x150.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Owl-mosaic-148x150.jpg 148w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Owl-mosaic-200x202.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Owl-mosaic-768x777.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Owl-mosaic-430x435.jpg 430w\" title=\"Owl mosaic.

Elderkin, discovered literally hundreds of mosaics in elite villas of the ancient city which had been one of the most important in the Roman Empire. Many of them were lifted, divided among the sponsors and either stored, exhibited or installed as architectural features. Princeton had a bit of mosaic fire sale in the early 1960s, and many <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/50922\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">smaller institutions</a> scored Antioch mosaic panels at that time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bacchanante-cut-from-same-floor.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53515\" height=\"118\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bacchanante-cut-from-same-floor-150x118.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bacchanante-cut-from-same-floor-150x118.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bacchanante-cut-from-same-floor-200x157.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bacchanante-cut-from-same-floor-768x604.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bacchanante-cut-from-same-floor-430x338.jpg 430w\" title=\"Bacchanante cut from same floor with cleaned up edges.

For example, the fact that 11 of the 12 mosaics panels were pulled up in a haphazard fashion with ragged, broken floral and geometric pieces attached the main figural panel should have raise red flags.

The monastery church, originally built in the 5th century, was renown for its early Byzantine mosaics depicting Jesus, Mary and the apostles. They were extremely rare, stylistically unique and some of the most important early Christian art in the world by virtue of having survived the Iconoclastic orgy of destruction during the 8th and 9th centuries. </p>\n<p>In the late 1970s, they were plundered and sold in pieces to unscrupulous dealers who sold them all over the world to equally unscrupulous buyers. With a great deal of work by heritage organizations, police and committed individuals, almost all of the mosaics have been found in the decades since the brutalization of Panagia Kanakaria. Most recently, the medallion of the apostle St. Andrew was <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/51262\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">repatriated this April</a> after four years of negotiation with a recalcitrant owner. It was the 11th of the 12 stolen apostle mosaics to be located and returned to Cyprus, leaving only St. Mark still on the lam.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Arthur-Brand-with-mosaic.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-53380\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Arthur-Brand-with-mosaic-200x149.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Arthur-Brand-with-mosaic-200x149.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Arthur-Brand-with-mosaic-150x112.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Arthur-Brand-with-mosaic-768x573.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Arthur-Brand-with-mosaic-430x321.jpg 430w\" title=\"Arthur Brand with recovered mosaic of Saint Mark.

With the support of the Church of Cyprus and the Cypriot government, he was able to follow the trail thanks to tips from informants and his own detecting skill. Finally Brand found St. Mark in Monaco.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt was in the possession of a British family, who bought the mosaic in good faith more than four decades ago,\u201d Mr Brand said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were horrified when they found out that it was in fact a priceless art treasure,\u201d Mr Brand said.[\u2026]</p>\n<p>The family agreed to return it \u201cto the people of Cyprus\u201d in return for a small fee to cover restoration and storage costs, he added.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Arthur Brand recovered the mosaic from Monaco last week. On Friday, November 16th, he formally returned it to the Embassy of Cyprus in The Hague, The Netherlands. On Sunday, November 18th, St. Mark was home. That leaves only one piece of the Panagia Kanakaria mosaics still missing: the feet of Christ. Brand is on it.</p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Recovered-mosaic-of-St-Mark.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-53377\" height=\"269\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Recovered-mosaic-of-St-Mark-430x269.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Recovered-mosaic-of-St-Mark-430x269.jpg 430w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Recovered-mosaic-of-St-Mark-150x94.jpg 150w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Recovered-mosaic-of-St-Mark-200x125.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Recovered-mosaic-of-St-Mark-768x480.jpg 768w\" title=\"Recovered mosaic of Saint Mark.

The museum acquired the statue in 1992 under the tenure of Marion True who would later be tried for her long history of buying looting antiquities from shady dealers. The Getty bought it from Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman, wealthy private collectors who had a $60 million collection of antiquities. They got this statue and many, many others like it from infamous loot dealer, perjurer and cheater <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/5469\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Robin Symes</a>. </p>\n<p>The lack of export paperwork or ownership history was no deterrent to these acquisitions, and the Getty only <a href=\"http://news.getty.edu/the-j-paul-getty-museum-and-italian-officials-announce-agreement-to-return-first-century-bc-sculpture-to-italy-1.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">agreed to return the statue in 2017</a>, five years after a missing piece of it was found by local archaeologists in the ancient resort town of Baiae, modern-day Bacoli. The statue was repatriated in June 2017 and put on display at the National Archeological Museum in Naples. In late October it was loaned to Archaeological Park of Campi Flegrei so it could take part in a new exhibition of artworks that once adorned the villas of the rich and powerful at Baiae and environs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zeus-enthroned-Casa-dei-Dioscuri-Pompeii.jpg\"><img alt=\"Fresco of Zeus enthroned inspired by Pheidias sculpture, Casa dei Dioscuri, Pompeii.

It was inspired by the colossal gold and ivory statue of the god at the temple of Zeus at Olympia made by sculptor Pheidias in 430 B.C. It was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. First century orator and philosopher Dio Chrysostom wrote about it in glowing terms in his <a href=\"http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/12*.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Olympic Discourse</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p> For verily even the irrational brute creation would be so struck with awe if they could catch merely a glimpse of yonder statue, not only the bulls which are being continually led to the altar, so that they would willingly submit themselves to the priests who perform the rites of sacrifice, if so they would be giving some pleasure to the god, but eagles too, and horses and lions, so that they would subdue their untamed and savage spirits and preserve perfect quiet, delighted by the vision; and of men, whoever is sore distressed in soul, having in the course of his life drained the cup of many misfortunes and griefs, nor ever winning sweet sleep \u2014 even this man, methinks, if he stood before this image, would forget all the terrors and hardships that fall to our human lot.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The temple of Zeus was abandoned in the 4th century when emperor Theodosius I banned the Olympic games and all the religious rituals attendant to them in 393 A.D. It\u2019s known when the statue was destroyed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Flavian-Jupiter.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-53354\" height=\"291\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Flavian-Jupiter-200x291.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Flavian-Jupiter-200x291.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Flavian-Jupiter-103x150.jpg 103w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Flavian-Jupiter-768x1118.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Flavian-Jupiter-430x626.jpg 430w\" title=\"Flavian-era Jupiter enthroned, late 1st century A.D. State Hermitage Museum.\" width=\"200\"/></a>By then, Pheidias\u2019 masterpiece had been considered the pinnacle of Classical Greek sculpture for 700 years and it was widely copied in the Greco-Roman world. A fresco of Zeus enthroned holding a statue of Nike (Victory), a scepter with an eagle by his side a fresco was found in the Casa dei Dioscuri in Pompeii and is now in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. A statue 11 feet high created in the 1st century A.D. and discovered at the villa of Emperor Domitian (now at the Hermitage Museum) meticulously copied the original, using marble, gilded wood and stucco to capture the beauty of the chryselephantine technique.</p>\n<p>The Zeus Enthroned sits on a throne, a high-backed one, and rests his feet on a stool. His right arm is raised high, his left by his side. His raised hand likely held a high scepter and his left a thunderbolt. If it precisely matched the Pheidias statue, however, the left hand would have held a statuette of the goddess of Victory. The attributes are long missing as is the right hand so it\u2019s hard to know what he carried.</p>\n<p>Evidence of marine life is rife on the right side of the statue and its condition is far more deteriorated there than on the left side. The statue was likely resting on its left side in the sand of the seabed. The sand protected it from the elements. Before then, it was probably part of a home shrine in one of the elegant country villas that were so popular among the wealthy of the late Roman Republic.</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-title=\"Enthroned Zeus returns home to Baiae\" data-a2a-url=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53351\"><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"><img alt=\"Share\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/sharesavesmall.png\"/></a></div></div> </div>\n<p class=\"postmetadata\">Posted in <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/ancient\" rel=\"category tag\">Ancient</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/looting\" rel=\"category tag\">Looting</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/category/museums\" rel=\"category tag\">Museums</a> |   <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53351#comments\">2 Comments \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post\">\n<h3 id=\"post-53305\"><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/53305\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link to Three stolen Moundville artifacts recovered\">Three stolen Moundville artifacts recovered</a></h3>\n<p class=\"prefix\">Wednesday, November 14th, 2018</p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>It\u2019s been almost 40 years since thieves broke into the Erskine Ramsey Archaeological Repository at the Moundville Archaeological Site near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and made off with 264 Native American artifacts, a fifth of the total number of artifacts excavated at the site and an agonizing 70% of the museum-quality pieces. Clay vessels exemplifying eight centuries of Mississippian artistry and craftsmanship were gone without a trace.</p>\n<p>Thirty-eight years passed. Not a single one of hundreds of stolen objects was found in all that time. An FBI investigation turned up nothing and ended in the late 1980s.

The Associates for the Return of Moundville Artifacts ultimately raised enough money for a $25,000 reward and established a confidential tip line (still active at 205-348-2800) for would-be informants to call.

It\u2019s not clear when the object was stolen \u2014 experts believe it was looted during the chaos of the Iraq War around 15 years ago. It surfaced in 2012 when the importer attempted to smuggle the piece into Britain with fake paperwork. The stone arrived at Heathrow airport in May 2012. The customs declaration claimed it was a carved stone made in Turkey worth $330. When a UK Border Force officer opened the box, he recognized the stone was no Turkish fake and that the claimed origin in the declaration had to be fraudulent. </p>\n<p>Experts at the British Museum quickly identified it from the copious cuneiform inscriptions as a 12th century B.C. kudurru, a ceremonial boundary stone recording a land grant from the king. There are only 200 known surviving examples of kudurrus, and this one is a stand-out. It describes a gift of land from Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I to one of his subjects in recognition of his distinguished service. The inscription indicates the stone came from Nippur, an ancient Sumerian city in what is now southern Iraq that was restored and expanded by Babylonian monarchs. Nippur suffered extensive looting in 2003 which is when experts believe the kudurru was stolen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front.jpg\" target=\"blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-54636\" height=\"232\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-200x232.jpg\" srcset=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-200x232.jpg 200w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-129x150.jpg 129w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-768x890.jpg 768w, http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/boundary-stone-front-430x499.jpg 430w\" title=\"Boundary stone engraved with depictions of gods Marduk and Enlil.

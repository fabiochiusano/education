Anyone who worked with him can testify to the apparent disarray of his lab and life. The humdrum cycle of the working week didn\u2019t impinge on Tony\u2019s habits. For Tony there was no such thing as \u2018work/life balance\u2019, there was just Life. Sometimes the most appropriate thing to do with life was to head out to sea on his beloved boat, at other times\u00a0the lab was the place to be. His wayward lifestyle made Tony a challenging person to work with; society doesn\u2019t care for chaos, it prefers tidy plans, filed reports and scheduled meetings.</p>\n<p>And so to many it was incredibly difficult to pinpoint how or why his group and indeed his mind worked so productively. It appeared to the outsider that disorder reigned. In fact true chaos ruled; chaos from which, as in nature itself, beauty and order emerges. Of course something is needed to trigger the emergence of order from a chaotic system. And in Tony\u2019s case the attractor around which order condensed was his unwavering insistence on experimental rigour and reproducibility.</p>\n<p>Inspiration, creativity, curiosity; Tony had these in spades. Everyone who ever worked with him couldn\u2019t help but admire his intellect, wit, charm and passion. And so they overlooked, as best they could, his social transgressions. Most of his exasperated superiors let him get on with his research, content with his prolific outputs, the wise garnered his genius. Meanwhile his PhD and post-docs rallied around trying to keep his admin on track by digging out the most important forms and documents hidden in his office\u2019s archaeological filing system (the deeper in a stack, the older the documents). This remained a workable system threatened only by the occasional\u00a0 tectonic movements that disrupted the order.</p>\n<p>Tony was an outstanding scientist. He received a SERC Personal Fellowship at 26, a Lister Fellowship at 36 and a personal chair at 41. Churning out seminal work in enzymology, protein engineering, protein folding and prion disease throughout his career. He retired through ill health at 55 with 183 papers, including 4 in <i>Nature </i>and 2 in <i>Science</i>, and\u00a0an H-index of 49 under his belt. \u00a0But the numbers don\u2019t do his achievements justice, his real legacy are the results of his infectious passion for science. He showed us that curiosity was key, that it was the exploratory process that was the interesting bit. Those that had the honour to work alongside him (for he always treated his charges as equals) are left with a life-long love of discovery. Tony burnt out early (his fondness for cigarette and a liquid diet hardly helped) but those of us whom he took along for the ride will benefit from his energy throughout our lives and careers.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps worth noting that within hours of his death the hundreds of people whose lives he touched, spread as they were over decades of scientific discovery and thousands of miles, had all learned of his passing. The \u201cClarke-collective\u201d had begun to grieve.</p>\n<p>The world is a far less interesting place without Tony Clarke. His family, friends, students and colleagues will miss him greatly.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe are able to find everything in our memory, which is like a dispensary or chemical laboratory in which chance

I a was a PhD student of his between 2000 and 2003 and I am not sure any other academic would have such an over whelming and universal outpouring of sadness and feeling of loss from all thoose he worked with. Generosity and humility came naturally to a man who achieved so very much, he would help anyone and everyone in the most altruistic of ways and would see the good in anyone, whilst paradoxically would not abide a fool lightly. It is quite telling how many of his ex colleagues continued to return to Bristol to collaborate professional or socially even many years after that had left. The reason for this is that he almost seemed part of the place, a sense of belonging that was just another small part of his charm as it became engendered to thoose about him. It\u2019s not just nostalgia either, because although looking back fondly to a friend like we have all been doing, I note we are all also recounting amusing tales and \u201cClarkisms\u201d, tempered with sadness that a pint in the Robin Hood will never taste quite so good again..</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Ed Jack\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611512#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611512\", \"611512\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611513\">\n<div id=\"comment-611513\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Binx Clarke</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611513\">\n                On July 13, 2016 @ 3:16 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Thank you so much for this, it\u2019s lovely.

But one of my favourite moments was standing in the lab in Bristol (where earlier I\u2019d been a post-doc) while Tony did possibly the first ever chaperoned protein refolding experiment in the UK, with GroEL which I\u2019d collected from Steve Wood in London and brought to Bristol on a scorching hot day by train.  He turned up several hours late for our agreed meeting (after I\u2019d fruitlessly mucked around with his equipment trying to do the experiment myself), and proceeded to mix the protein with some unfolded LDH. Picture the scene \u2013 Tony, wearing nothing but flip flops and shorts, tanned after a week in France, Gilson in one hand and ciggie in the other, shouting \u201cF*** me, it\u2019s working!\u201d.  Celebrations in the Robin Hood followed, and the paper that eventually emerged with Badders as first author and Tony as senior author is still one my my most highly cited.  </p>\n<p>RIP old chum and thanks for all the great science and good times.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Pete Lund\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611516#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611516\", \"611516\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611517\">\n<div id=\"comment-611517\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Sophie Jackson</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611517\">\n                On July 13, 2016 @ 10:04 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>A great scientist, huge fun, always shocking, enormously talented in lots of respects, Tony certainly loved life.  The sadness with which I write this is, to some small part, mitigated by the fact that I think in his all too-short 57 years, Tony lived life to the full.<br/>\nHaving for several years heard many stories about \u201cClarkey\u201d I first met Tony in a conference in San Francisco.  It was a very warm, if not hot day, and Tony was wearing a full tweed three-piece suit complete with cravat. It looked like it had been tailor-made and he did look terribly dapper. This wasn\u2019t what I had expected of the rebellious Prof. from Bristol that I had heard about.  The second time I met Tony was about year later in Bristol. He was wearing shorts, flip-flops and nothing else and had an enviable tan (I don\u2019t know where he had got it). just as Peter described him above. I can\u2019t remember whether he had a ciggie in his mouth but I remember thinking \u201cIs the same man I met in San Fran? Of course, it was.   I also remember him turning up for a Ph.D. viva for one of Alan\u2019s students in Cambridge wearing very similar attire. I was the other examiner and by that time nothing about Tony would have surprised me, so I wasn\u2019t phased.  I think someone should have warned the student though who looked rather taken aback!<br/>\nTony was always fun, a live wire, he had an incredibly contagious enthusiasm and love of life, so much so that he would manage to persuade a troupe of loyal followers to embark on all kinds of adventures with him.  I remember a conference in deepest West Virginia.  We were located in some rather remote holiday resort with no shops.   Tony ran out of ciggies, a disaster, and so he set out to walk the five miles to the nearest little town to buy some. The resort didn\u2019t sell them.  It was January, there was very deep snow on the ground. I remember him departing and waving him and his party off.  The party were inadequately dressed/attired for the weather and terrain but this didn\u2019t dampen their enthusiasm. They looked a little bit like rather amateurish, plucky but ill-prepared British explorers who would never quite make it to the Pole. Hours and hours and hours later they re-emerged out of the snow. Tony laughing because they had all got lost, but they had had an adventure and also got cigarettes (I think). That was the important thing, they had had an adventure.<br/>\nI can\u2019t imagine Clarkey old and grey and sitting in a comfortable chair in a care home. He would have hated it. He would, of course, have caused complete chaos, and had adventures, and got himself and other residents into trouble. Maybe he is someone in this vast Universe of ours, still creating havoc, still having fun.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Sophie Jackson\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611517#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611517\", \"611517\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611518\">\n<div id=\"comment-611518\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Sophie Jackson</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611518\">\n                On July 13, 2016 @ 10:10 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>PS.</p>\n<p>One of the funniest moments in my life (I almost wet my pants laughing) was in Warwick.

Clarkes inspirational approach to science certainly influenced all around him. He had an intuitive feel for kinetics and taught me that it was better to spend time thinking before doing the one killer experiment rather than bash away at a lot of mediocre badly designed experiments. </p>\n<p>My memories of working with Clarke include late night stopped flow sessions after a number of pints at the Robin Hood. Clarke smoking a fag, leftover kebab skewers floating in the water bath, discussing thoughts on kinetic isotope effects. Playing cricket in the lab (all our 2 litre measuring cylinders were cracked as they made perfect bats), Clarke bowling spin.

After an interview (in the Robin, I bought the beer!) I had an amazing three years. We laughed a LOT, drank to much, smoked too much. Lots of people have talked about what a brilliant scientist he was, and this is so true. He had an astonishing, intuitive grasp of biophysics and kinetics that I was totally in awe of then, and am totally envious of now. But more than anything I remember what a fantastic teacher he was. I learned how to do science with Clarke. I felt cleverer with him, and stupider without \u2013 ideas that were so clear and simple when he was explaining them seem to drip out of my ears on the way back to the lab. He is the reason I\u2019m a scientist today.</p>\n<p>He could be spectacularly, hilariously rude. I don\u2019t think any of my favourite stories are fit for consumption here! I\u2019m not aware that there was ever any filter between his brain and mouth. I think this is what Mark refers to as \u2018his social transgressions\u2019, but we did forgive that, partly because he was also warm, kind and funny, and partly because he had no sense of hierarchy. He loved \u2013 expected! \u2013 people to be rude right back and it didn\u2019t matter whether you were a PhD student or an FRS \u2013 a good idea was a good idea.</p>\n<p>The world is a duller place without him.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Neil Ranson\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611522#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611522\", \"611522\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611523\">\n<div id=\"comment-611523\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Corinne Smith</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611523\">\n                On July 13, 2016 @ 10:32 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Tony gave me the most amazing experience of science, something I remember fondly and wish I could return to. I first met Tony in 1986 in a second year undergraduate practical. I said \u2018Why isn\u2019t it working\u2019? He said \u2018It\u2019s because you\u2019ve buggered it, my dear!\u2019.  I was slightly taken aback, but not offended.  Later on I was lucky to get a summer placement as an undergraduate in the Holbrook lab where Tony was a research fellow.  Lab C101 had an interesting feel to it. A sense of anarchy prevailed \u2013 whether it was playing cricket in the lab, making ridiculous noises or doing an experiment that challenged received wisdom.  This was a truly exciting time for enzyme engineering and Tony was at the heart of it.  Not content with \u2018rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic\u2019, he always aimed to \u2018go for the throat\u2019 and do  \u2018the crunch experiment\u2019. In those days this involved mutating the active site of lactate dehydrogenase to understand how it worked and, later, to change the substrates it acted on.  These were audacious experiments that defied advice not to alter the enzyme active site in case that destabilized the whole enzyme.  Of course, the experiments worked, and produced some of the most spectacular enzyme engineering of the time. </p>\n<p>Tony was my mentor during my PhD with John Holbrook, advising me on my project on protein folding. But he was so much more than that. He represented a pioneering approach to science, which was bold and brave.  His scientific achievements required him to take risks and challenge the status quo, which he took great pleasure in doing!   And he combined this exciting approach with intense focus, scientific rigor and great personal warmth. I loved working with Tony. He was hilarious, amazing company and, at times, utterly outrageous. He gave me some of the best and funniest moments of my life and I will miss him enormously.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Corinne Smith\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611523#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611523\", \"611523\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611524\">\n<div id=\"comment-611524\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Stephen McLaughlin</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611524\">\n                On July 14, 2016 @ 6:29 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Tony was the inspiration that got me into research, when I was one of his first project students after he started his own lab.

He was eccentric, disorganized, highly intelligent, and very funny. The thing I think about most though is how he treated everyone the same, whether you were an undergraduate or a visiting professor. </p>\n<p>I first met Clarke in a second year undergraduate practical where we had been asked to purify LDH. We were running a column and as he passed by I asked him how we could be sure that our protein was still inside it. \u201cbecause dear boy, it sticks like shit to a blanket\u201d came the response. I later spent a whole summer working in the group as a Nuffield student. During that time I remember being both surprised and delighted to find he was a regular reader of Viz magazine and, like myself, an advocate of Roger\u2019s Profanisaurus. I stayed in the group to complete a PhD from 1997-2000. </p>\n<p>As others have already said, Clarke\u2019s group was such a unique and special space to work in. I don\u2019t think anyone outside of c101 could ever understand how such a seemingly chaotic group could be so productive. The truth is he brought out the best in people because his passion for the science was so infectious. That meant that like-minded talented people gravitated towards him, and I was lucky to share the laboratory with some of these excellent people. The fact that there was never a dull moment in his company didn\u2019t do any harm either. During afternoons (usually Fridays) he would often sit in on experiments to assist, and science certainly didn\u2019t stop in the lab; aided by liquid refreshments the scientific discussions would often continue well into the night at the Robin Hood.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll miss Clarke\u2019s brilliant mind, I\u2019ll miss not knowing what on earth he\u2019s going to say next, I\u2019ll miss those antics in the lab, but most of all I\u2019ll miss his great sense of humor and friendship.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Jody Mason\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611529#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611529\", \"611529\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611532\">\n<div id=\"comment-611532\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Stephen High</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611532\">\n                On July 15, 2016 @ 1:20 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>I knew Tony in the mid to late 80s when I was a PhD student, and then postdoc, in Bristol and  a few things popped into my head when I heard the sad news that he has died. Although we both worked in the same Biochemistry Department, I actually first met him in a nightclub somewhere near the docks in Bristol at about 2AM \u2013 I think more surprising I was out and about at that time than him. More importantly he was a fine cricketer and one of the few decent bowlers that our \u201cmolecular biology\u201d  cricket team every had when we took on Jeremy Tavare\u2019s all stars. When I moved to Manchester I was put in charge of the seminar programme for the Biochemistry Dept. and I invited Tony to come and give us a talk about his work. From what I remember he set off to travel to Manchester from Bristol about three hours before the seminar was due to start, and he was driving a 2CV. Needless to say at some point well after the seminar was due to start I got a phone call saying he was not going to make it. We rescheduled and we did get our seminar from Tony in the end.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Stephen High\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611532#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611532\", \"611532\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611533\">\n<div id=\"comment-611533\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Debbie Shoemark</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611533\">\n                On July 15, 2016 @ 6:23 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>This beautiful obituary encapsulates the experience of being one of Clarkey\u2019s PhD students.

Thank you Mark and everyone.</p>\n<p>I was Tony\u2019s fourth PhD student and first met him for an \u201cinterview\u201d at the Star and Garter in Montpelier in the days before 24h opening. This wasn\u2019t his usual venue, but it did do a lock-in, something of which he was well aware. I didn\u2019t get much of a word in that night, but I listened and learned a lot, and somehow did enough to make him take me on. Sometime after midnight he weaved off down the street in his MG Midget (whatever happened to that?) That was pretty much how it went for the next three and a half years\u2026</p>\n<p>In my mind\u2019s eye Clarke belongs on a sunny summer Friday afternoon in the C101 optics room. It usually took only a few pushes on the stopped-flow before he would appear at the door, shirt open to the waist (if worn at all), no shoes, still glowing from a lunchtime soaking up the sun in Royal Fort Gardens, and possibly still bringing with him the aroma of the previous night\u2019s excesses. He might claim to be looking for a place to hide from a Head of Department or building superintendent anxious to hold him to account for his latest transgression, and this might well be true, but in reality the sound of the ram was like some kind of dog-whistle he found it almost impossible to resist. Test Match Special on the radio, fag in hand, an expletive-laden running commentary as the traces accumulated, usually followed by a redesign on the fly. You could tell when this had happened from the pyramid of used pipette tips on the bench, topped off with a cigarette butt or two. Friday afternoons might be seen as a time to wind down, but for Clarke this was so far from the case. Friday afternoon was for the high-risk high-reward experiment, the one to test the hot idea that might just work, the one that led to an evening in the Robin Hood ripping apart beer mats to sketch out what it all meant. For someone who generated ideas at the rate he did, there were never enough Friday afternoons.</p>\n<p>As Neil says, he was also a great teacher. Not just an intuitive, incisive thinker, but able to cut through the complexity and make the rest of us understand too. And prepared to give up his time to do it again and again, for those of us who like me kept coming back to him years later with the same old questions. That so many from his lab are still doing science for a living years later testifies to his abilities better than anything I can write.</p>\n<p>Clarke pushed the boundaries in every way. Science is less exciting, and a lot quieter, for his passing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Jim Spencer\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611534#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611534\", \"611534\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611535\">\n<div id=\"comment-611535\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">David (H) Halsall</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611535\">\n                On July 15, 2016 @ 10:05 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Very moving obituary and responses, thanks to all.

It certainly captured the essence of his contributions and character.  I first met Tony at a SF conference.  As we crossed paths, he looked at my name tag and immediately launched into our mutual initial work in the chaperonin field.  I looked at his name tag and wondered \u201cWho the F**k is Neil Ranson\u201d.  It turned out Tony was wearing Neil\u2019s name tag to avoid paying the conference fees.  From there, we instantly became great friends because of our mutual \u201cworking man\u2019s/blue collar scientist\u201d demeanors. I was a roofer in a former life and he certainly possessed a working man\u2019s attitude and style.  This meant we said F**k a lot, even calmly intertwining that language style into our scientific discussions.  He would refer to me henceforth as \u201cThe F**king Fish\u201d.   I had spent an adventurous three weeks in Bristol living with Binx, Kate and Tony to attend numerous conferences on Prions and Chaperone Proteins, just in time for the Mad Cow Scare. It was a stimulating visit to say the least. There was literally never a dull moment.  We spend an inordinate amount of time trying to make each other blow tea or beer though our noses with our silly little antics (imitating the pompous) or stories (my past adventures in roofing and his summaries of general science faux pas).  On the flip side, Tony had an intensely serious and strong empathic streak that would often emerge throughout the course of the day.  When he would make it to the US colonies, we would sometimes go on long early morning hikes to go bird watching, hardly the habit you would expect from such a boisterous fellow since you had to be quiet for long periods of time.  Tony was a keen kineticist and enzymologist who relished in uncovering the allosteric complexity of the chaperonin machine in his most thorough manner. He avoided experimental fishing expeditions, or as he called them\u2026. \u201cStrolling along the chemical shelf\u201d.   He was, without a doubt, a brilliant and accomplished scientist.  He was an extremely complex man who enjoyed life to its fullest. I will miss my friend. His full-throated unabashed laughter will reverberate in my brain for the rest of my days.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Mark Fisher\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611538#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611538\", \"611538\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611540\">\n<div id=\"comment-611540\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Michael Liversidge</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611540\">\n                On July 18, 2016 @ 5:17 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>As a Bristol colleague, but not a scientist, perhaps I may be permitted to add a word about someone who was invariably exceptionally stimulating company.  I can\u2019t say anything about the scientist, but his interests went very widely across everything that was civilised and civilising \u2013 fine wines and great cuisine obviously, and also the creative arts in all their dimensions.  My subject being art history, it was always a delight to meet him by accident but really only too occasionally \u2013 he was always fascinated by what others were doing, and in my case we sometimes got deeply into a subject like \u201cSo, how can really know a Rembrandt is a Rembrandt?\u201d, and when science became such an important cornerstone of my own subject I was hugely fortunate to be able to ask him what must have been for him the most basic questions about pigment analysis and trace elements which he answered in ways that I could understand.  An amazing intellect \u2013 he knew I knew nothing about the science, but he explained it with infinite courtesy; and he paid me the compliment of asking about esoteric aspects of my own subject.  He genuinely had an eye for the aesthetic, and on the all too few occasions we met over the years there was often some image or artist that had caught his attention and he wanted to share his enthusiasm.  I can imagine what a vividly inspiring teacher he was, and like all really great teachers his passion for what he did carries on.  He may have seemed cavalier about administration, but his perceptions of those of us who thought we weren\u2019t bad at it were always astute, and I like to think that some of us realised he was better at seeing the absurdly Kafkaesque than we were, and that we could learn a lot about it from his wise and witty commentary.

However I never got around to it\u2026</p>\n<p>Tony wasn\u2019t my PhD supervisor.  JJ was my supervisor and Tony was only just being made a lecturer at that time.  (Did they realise what they were unleashing, I wonder?)  Even so I must have worked twice as much with Tony as I did with JJ.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve already heard mention of the time he reversed into a police car while drunk.  I think that was after he rescued me from a party where I too had become much drunker than I intended\u2013he drove me home, in spite of being well oiled himself.  I think after that he drove back to the party, finished the evening, and then in the small hours drove home so pissed that he was totally unaware of the police following closely behind with blue lights flashing and unable to believe their eyes.</p>\n<p>Another story is when he set off on holiday by driving to an airport in another city (Cardiff?) when his flight was actually departing from Bristol.</p>\n<p>But the best story is maybe the time when he pressed the 10,000V \u201cstrike\u201d button for the fluorometer arc lamp, without first bothering to check that the arc lamp was actually connected to the wires.  The wires were in fact resting on the metal table, so was the small PC that was used for data capture, and it rapidly became the unluckiest PC in World\u2026</p>\n<p>I believe the repair shop said it was easier to list the parts that weren\u2019t burned out e.g. the keyboard.</p>\n<p>He was the best man at my wedding (for carefully chosen values of \u201cbest\u201d), with Corinne standing by to double check that he hadn\u2019t lost or sold the rings.</p>\n<p>Mostly, however, I remember his office\u2026  the archaeological layers of documents (which only related to rearranging deckchairs and could therefore be ignored), the small random containers of cigarette ash, the copies of Viz and other relevant research documents with graphs and equations roughed out in the margins, the computer that everybody shared, the furniture that I seem to recall was rescued from a skip in the car-park\u2026</p>\n<p>You could wander in to the lab or office at any time, day or night, and the observable probability of Tony was pretty much the same (although the noise on the signal was higher late at night).  Those were definitely the days and it is terribly sad to know that they are now over.

During my PhD I would amble the corridors looking for any soft-hearted biochemist that would take pity on a dim-witted microbiologist that knew sod-all about enzyme kinetics \u2013 and yes, that guy was Clarke. Despite being a tour-de-force on enzymes he was never patronizing or condescending but would meet you at your level of understanding.  Quintessentially, he was the very best of teachers.  </p>\n<p>Over the years this irreverent but generous genius became a very good friend and we often played cricket together on summer evenings where recollections of leather on willow was eclipsed by the pining for local ales. A leader on and off the field, he was always graciously encouraging which was combined with a refreshingly self-depreciating, albeit very fruity, sense of humor.  </p>\n<p>He was blessed with an obscenely healthy attitude towards health and safety (Amen!) and was in every sense the purest of scholars \u2013 pontificating over several pints in the Robin Hood and scrawling great thoughts on the back of beer mats. He was the very essence of scholarship \u2013 utterly unfettered by bureaucracy and protocols. His bizarre sense of timekeeping was equally legendary. Once when collecting stop-flow data some second years appeared in the door to remind him he was 15 minutes late for his tutorial to which he retorted \u201cS**t, I didn\u2019t f**king forget again?\u201d \u2013 needless to say he was royally pardoned.   </p>\n<p>My last meeting with him was 4 years ago when I invited him over for a seminal lecturer to our post-grads at Cardiff. True to form, he bewitched and beguiled them with his casual but compelling delivery of scientific discoveries but, as always, met the audience halfway. That day, he and I both wore striped blazers and I was honored to be a member of \u201chis club\u201d.    </p>\n<p>When you mention his name, people respond with a knowing smile and a gaze of quite admiration. An administrative nightmare he may have been, but we all secretly, and not so secretly, aspire to his achievements and even more so, the very quiddity and essence that made Clarke\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.simply Clarke.   </p>\n<p>Thanks for the memories Tony, they are numerous and precious. R. I.P.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Tim Walsh\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611547#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611547\", \"611547\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611552\">\n<div id=\"comment-611552\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">J Hambleton</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611552\">\n                On July 30, 2016 @ 5:33 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Thinking of you all during this sad time.<br/>\nmany happy memories of growing up with my talented, wildly unconventional cousin.<br/>\nI take credit for introducing him to the value of good coffee!<br/>\nR.I.P.

When we met at a chaperone meeting in Spain, I was preparing myself for the drinking to follow by eating 4 pork steaks. When chucking into the 4th, I felt observed and looked up. There was Tony\u2019s face watching me \u201cMichael, I like your style!\u201d. Later that night, he was emerged into an intense discussion with Alan F. All of a sudden and without a word, both got up, staggered 5 yards to the sea, stoped, leaning against each other because they were unable to stand upright by themselves and \u201cwatertones\u201d were heard. After they finished, they turned around, walked back like siamese twins, to continue their discussion.<br/>\nHow he got away with his \u201cstyle\u201d is of course simply because of his outstanding brilliance, his deep friendliness and his exceptional creativity.<br/>\nBrother Tony, it\u2019s been a privilege!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Michael Ehrmann\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/?replytocom=611553#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-611553\", \"611553\", \"respond\", \"10485\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-611582\">\n<div id=\"comment-611582\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Kieron</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/#comment-611582\">\n                On September 23, 2016 @ 4:04 am</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Only just heard about Tonys death.

And so it is with great sadness that I heard my PhD supervisor Professor Anthony Russell Clarke, aged just 57, had passed away this week.  \n   Tony Clarke. Photo Credit. Emma Cordwell   \n   \n To his friends, students and colleagues Tony Clarke was chaos incarnate. Anyone who worked with him can testify to the apparent disarray of his lab and life. The humdrum cycle of the working week didn\u2019t impinge on Tony\u2019s habits. For Tony there was no such thing as \u2018work/life balance\u2019, there was just Life. Sometimes the most appropriate thing to do with life was to head out to sea on his beloved boat, at other times\u00a0the lab was the place to be. His wayward lifestyle made Tony a challenging person to work with; society doesn\u2019t care for chaos, it prefers tidy plans, filed reports and scheduled meetings.  \n And so to many it was incredibly difficult to pinpoint how or why his group and indeed his mind worked so productively. It appeared to the outsider that disorder reigned. In fact true chaos ruled; chaos from which, as in nature itself, beauty and order emerges. Of course something is needed to trigger the emergence of order from a chaotic system. And in Tony\u2019s case the attractor around which order condensed was his unwavering insistence on experimental rigour and reproducibility.  \n Inspiration, creativity, curiosity; Tony had these in spades. Everyone who ever worked with him couldn\u2019t help but admire his intellect, wit, charm and passion. And so they overlooked, as best they could, his social transgressions. Most of his exasperated superiors let him get on with his research, content with his prolific outputs, the wise garnered his genius. Meanwhile his PhD and post-docs rallied around trying to keep his admin on track by digging out the most important forms and documents hidden in his office\u2019s archaeological filing system (the deeper in a stack, the older the documents). This remained a workable system threatened only by the occasional\u00a0 tectonic movements that disrupted the order.  \n Tony was an outstanding scientist. He received a SERC Personal Fellowship at 26, a Lister Fellowship at 36 and a personal chair at 41. Churning out seminal work in enzymology, protein engineering, protein folding and prion disease throughout his career. He retired through ill health at 55 with 183 papers, including 4 in  Nature   and 2 in  Science  , and\u00a0an H-index of 49 under his belt. \u00a0But the numbers don\u2019t do his achievements justice, his real legacy are the results of his infectious passion for science. He showed us that curiosity was key, that it was the exploratory process that was the interesting bit. Those that had the honour to work alongside him (for he always treated his charges as equals) are left with a life-long love of discovery. Tony burnt out early (his fondness for cigarette and a liquid diet hardly helped) but those of us whom he took along for the ride will benefit from his energy throughout our lives and careers.  \n It is perhaps worth noting that within hours of his death the hundreds of people whose lives he touched, spread as they were over decades of scientific discovery and thousands of miles, had all learned of his passing. The \u201cClarke-collective\u201d had begun to grieve.  \n The world is a far less interesting place without Tony Clarke. His family, friends, students and colleagues will miss him greatly.  \n \u201cWe are able to find everything in our memory, which is like a dispensary or chemical laboratory in which chance steers our hand sometimes to a soothing drug and sometimes to a dangerous poison\u201d Marcel Proust.   \n  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/   \n  \n  \n  ", "title_html": "<h1 class=\"title\">\n<a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2016/07/12/professor-anthony-russell-clarke-1959-2016/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permalink to Professor Anthony Russell Clarke \u00a01959 \u2013 2016\">Professor Anthony Russell Clarke \u00a01959 \u2013 2016</a>\n</h1> <h3 class=\"title\">Recent Comments</h3> <h3 class=\"title\">Chemistry Twitterverse</h3> <h3 class=\"title\">Recent Comments</h3> <h3 class=\"title\">Recent Posts</h3> <h3 class=\"title\">Archives</h3> <h3 class=\"title\">Meta</h3> "}

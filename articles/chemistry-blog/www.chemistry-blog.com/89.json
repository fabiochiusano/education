Our cheap, durable and omni-present material had reached every corner of the globe, it had became part of the very fabric of the planet. Geologists coined a new type of sedimentary rock;\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/19/plastiglomerate_n_5496062.html\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/19/plastiglomerate_n_5496062.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plastiglomerate</a>\u00a0\u2013 part plastic pollution part stone.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1761\">For decades the litter had been building. The obvious detritus featured on every street corner, beach and country park. It became part of the scenery, we got used to it, ignored it, or mildly complained, whilst making sure we kept hydrated by sipping from our water bottles, that we clutched like life-support systems.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"92b1\">Then almost two decades into the 21st century the zeitgeist shifted.

The narrator blamed plastics. Our blinkers fell away, and we noticed the plastic as if it had just been dumped on our doorsteps.

Something much more radical was needed.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa25\">Gaia had the beginnings of an answer. She was used to cleaning up detritus. Over millions of years the myriad of micro-fauna have found biochemical ways to harness the resources from organic dead matter. But plastics had only been around for a few decades. So microorganisms simply hadn\u2019t had enough time to evolve the necessary biochemical tool kit to latch onto the plastic fibres, break them up and then utilise the resulting chemicals as a source of energy and carbon that they need to grow.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9b98\">Or so we thought.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4b0c\">But deep within a Japanese rubbish tip, devoid of organic matter on which to feed,\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://theconversation.com/new-plastic-munching-bacteria-could-fuel-a-recycling-revolution-55961\" href=\"https://theconversation.com/new-plastic-munching-bacteria-could-fuel-a-recycling-revolution-55961\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">evolutionary pressure had selected an organism with a new feeding strategy</a>. Nature it seemed, had quietly made a start on tackling our plastic plague. Somewhen, in the recent past, a bacteria had undergone a random mutation and a protein that normally allowed the bug to feed on fats had been converted into one that empowered it to digest plastics.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a320\">Not that the plastic waste was noticeably decomposing. The bacteria wasn\u2019t up to the scale of the job. After all, it was a mere evolutionary infants, taking the first tentative bites of a new food, still unequipped to make full use of it. It might have been decades or longer before anyone noticed the rubbish was rotting. Or maybe some other natural pressure may have been to much for the new species. It could so easily have gone extinct before anyone ever became aware of its existence.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a54f\">But for Prof Yoshiharu Kimura\u2019s eureka moment. Struck by an inspiration particle, it occurred to him that the obvious place to look for a plastic eating organism was in the heaps of rubbish. For five years he hunted through 100s of samples of soil, sludge and stagnant water seeping out of tips and recycling plants. Then, back in the lab, he painstakingly tried to grow something, anything, by feeding his soup of organisms little more than ground up polythene bottles. Miraculously, in just one dish a single bacteria flourished, multiplied and thrived. Soon he had a viable culture. Professor Kimura<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">\u00a0</strong>had found the needle in the plastic stack. He called it\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Ideonella_sakaiensis\" href=\"https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Ideonella_sakaiensis\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ideonella sakaiensis</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"024a\">For a while people were mildly interested, there was a\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/could-a-new-plastic-eating-bacteria-help-combat-this-pollution-scourge\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/could-a-new-plastic-eating-bacteria-help-combat-this-pollution-scourge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">flurry</a>\u00a0of\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-03-newly-bacteria-plastic-bottles.html\" href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-03-newly-bacteria-plastic-bottles.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">press</a>proclaiming the solution to the plastic problem may have been found. But soon the excitement died down, for this was still two years before the dead whale cub was beamed into homes around the world. And so the newly discovered\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I. sakeienis</em>\u00a0slipped from the folk mind. That was until, a second breakthrough came. Perfectly timed, on this occasion, coinciding with the new anti-plastic movement. Professor Kimura had been happily sharing his cultures with scientist far and wide, and and one group had accidentally genetically engineering the protein that empower\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I. sakeieni</em>s to be a much more efficient plastic digester. In those 24 months they had done what nature might have taken centuries to achieve. The bacteria hit the\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/04/17/pet-plastic-enzyme-research/\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/04/17/pet-plastic-enzyme-research/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">headlines</a>. They showed the world that by taking what Gaia started and combining it with 21st century biotechnology we could at last tackle the plastic problem of our own making.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"821c\">Genetically modification of organism, vilified for decades as the technology that would destroy our ecosystems, suddenly became the answer to all our worries. Folks who had ripped up experimental GM crops, fell over each other in their efforts to support genetically enhanced plastic munching microbes. After all, the plastics were unnatural and evil. And so, they reasoned, it was perfectly acceptable (at least in this case) to utilise GM bugs to clear up our mess. It might even be that we were just giving nature a helping hand, it was possible that some organisms might even have\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.iflscience.com/environment/bacteria-evolving-eat-plastic-dump-into-oceans/\" href=\"http://www.iflscience.com/environment/bacteria-evolving-eat-plastic-dump-into-oceans/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made a start on the plastics</a>\u00a0in the oceans.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2266\">The great cleanup began. Governments and eco-charities around the world throw money at the problem. What started with the odd publication here and there became a torrent of papers describing newly discovered and genetically enhanced bacteria, fungi and even worms. All equipped with an arsenal of plastic eating enzymes. Soon concerned citizens got in on the act.

Once out in the wild they were unable to distinguish between refuse and infrastructure.

The world was awash with plastic.

Our cheap, durable and omni-present material had reached every corner of the globe, it had became part of the very fabric of the planet. Geologists coined a new type of sedimentary rock;\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/19/plastiglomerate_n_5496062.html\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/19/plastiglomerate_n_5496062.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plastiglomerate</a>\u00a0\u2013 part plastic pollution part stone.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1761\">For decades the litter had been building. The obvious detritus featured on every street corner, beach and country park. It became part of the scenery, we got used to it, ignored it, or mildly complained, whilst making sure we kept hydrated by sipping from our water bottles, that we clutched like life-support systems.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"92b1\">Then almost two decades into the 21st century the zeitgeist shifted. Seemingly triggered by the haunting\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a8HGJid-Jo\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a8HGJid-Jo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">image of pilot whale grieving her dead cub</a>. The narrator blamed plastics. Our blinkers fell away, and we noticed the plastic as if it had just been dumped on our doorsteps. Unlike the invisible carbon dioxide, ravishing the climate and the oceans, we could point at this culprit.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c157\">Almost overnight plastic packaging became universally distasteful. Shoppers curled their lips when offered a plastic punnet of mushrooms and then stripped of the useless artificial skins from their purchases before dumping them\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-43559636\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-43559636\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in front of the supermarkets</a>.

One small island\u2019s war on<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43169004\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43169004\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0drinking straws\u00a0</a>did little more than remove a mole hill from the mountain of the world\u2019s plastic waste. Something much more radical was needed.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa25\">Gaia had the beginnings of an answer. She was used to cleaning up detritus. Over millions of years the myriad of micro-fauna have found biochemical ways to harness the resources from organic dead matter. But plastics had only been around for a few decades. So microorganisms simply hadn\u2019t had enough time to evolve the necessary biochemical tool kit to latch onto the plastic fibres, break them up and then utilise the resulting chemicals as a source of energy and carbon that they need to grow.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9b98\">Or so we thought.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4b0c\">But deep within a Japanese rubbish tip, devoid of organic matter on which to feed,\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://theconversation.com/new-plastic-munching-bacteria-could-fuel-a-recycling-revolution-55961\" href=\"https://theconversation.com/new-plastic-munching-bacteria-could-fuel-a-recycling-revolution-55961\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">evolutionary pressure had selected an organism with a new feeding strategy</a>. Nature it seemed, had quietly made a start on tackling our plastic plague. Somewhen, in the recent past, a bacteria had undergone a random mutation and a protein that normally allowed the bug to feed on fats had been converted into one that empowered it to digest plastics.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a320\">Not that the plastic waste was noticeably decomposing. The bacteria wasn\u2019t up to the scale of the job. After all, it was a mere evolutionary infants, taking the first tentative bites of a new food, still unequipped to make full use of it. It might have been decades or longer before anyone noticed the rubbish was rotting. Or maybe some other natural pressure may have been to much for the new species. It could so easily have gone extinct before anyone ever became aware of its existence.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a54f\">But for Prof Yoshiharu Kimura\u2019s eureka moment. Struck by an inspiration particle, it occurred to him that the obvious place to look for a plastic eating organism was in the heaps of rubbish. For five years he hunted through 100s of samples of soil, sludge and stagnant water seeping out of tips and recycling plants. Then, back in the lab, he painstakingly tried to grow something, anything, by feeding his soup of organisms little more than ground up polythene bottles. Miraculously, in just one dish a single bacteria flourished, multiplied and thrived. Soon he had a viable culture. Professor Kimura<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">\u00a0</strong>had found the needle in the plastic stack. He called it\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Ideonella_sakaiensis\" href=\"https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Ideonella_sakaiensis\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Ideonella sakaiensis</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"024a\">For a while people were mildly interested, there was a\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/could-a-new-plastic-eating-bacteria-help-combat-this-pollution-scourge\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/could-a-new-plastic-eating-bacteria-help-combat-this-pollution-scourge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">flurry</a>\u00a0of\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-03-newly-bacteria-plastic-bottles.html\" href=\"https://phys.org/news/2016-03-newly-bacteria-plastic-bottles.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">press</a>proclaiming the solution to the plastic problem may have been found. But soon the excitement died down, for this was still two years before the dead whale cub was beamed into homes around the world. And so the newly discovered\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I. sakeienis</em>\u00a0slipped from the folk mind. That was until, a second breakthrough came. Perfectly timed, on this occasion, coinciding with the new anti-plastic movement. Professor Kimura had been happily sharing his cultures with scientist far and wide, and and one group had accidentally genetically engineering the protein that empower\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">I. sakeieni</em>s to be a much more efficient plastic digester. In those 24 months they had done what nature might have taken centuries to achieve. The bacteria hit the\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/04/17/pet-plastic-enzyme-research/\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/04/17/pet-plastic-enzyme-research/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">headlines</a>. They showed the world that by taking what Gaia started and combining it with 21st century biotechnology we could at last tackle the plastic problem of our own making.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"821c\">Genetically modification of organism, vilified for decades as the technology that would destroy our ecosystems, suddenly became the answer to all our worries. Folks who had ripped up experimental GM crops, fell over each other in their efforts to support genetically enhanced plastic munching microbes. After all, the plastics were unnatural and evil. And so, they reasoned, it was perfectly acceptable (at least in this case) to utilise GM bugs to clear up our mess. It might even be that we were just giving nature a helping hand, it was possible that some organisms might even have\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.iflscience.com/environment/bacteria-evolving-eat-plastic-dump-into-oceans/\" href=\"http://www.iflscience.com/environment/bacteria-evolving-eat-plastic-dump-into-oceans/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made a start on the plastics</a>\u00a0in the oceans.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2266\">The great cleanup began. Governments and eco-charities around the world throw money at the problem. What started with the odd publication here and there became a torrent of papers describing newly discovered and genetically enhanced bacteria, fungi and even worms. All equipped with an arsenal of plastic eating enzymes. Soon concerned citizens got in on the act. School science fairs featured projects dreamt up by keen children attempting to\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/teens-use-science-worm-through-plastic-waste\" href=\"https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/teens-use-science-worm-through-plastic-waste\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">breed plastic-eating creatures</a>, the maker movement got involved, as they discovered\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://makezine.com/2017/04/11/how-to-set-up-your-own-lab/\" href=\"https://makezine.com/2017/04/11/how-to-set-up-your-own-lab/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">home bio-hack kits</a>\u00a0could be used to tinker with microbes molecular machinery.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cc13\">By 2022 we had identified thousands of organisms, both naturally evolved and artificially enhanced, equipped with the molecular and mechanical machinery required to set to work on our poly-materials. In just a few more years the impact was tangible. Recycling plants quickly harnessed the new biotech boom to turn rubbish into fuel and chemical feedstocks used to create, amongst other things, fresh virgin plastics.

There was a collective sigh of relief.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"36f4\">Except it wasn\u2019t just the rubbish the new breed of bugs were eating. Once out in the wild they were unable to distinguish between refuse and infrastructure. Whether the plastic-munching organisms escaped from the recycling plants, the amatuer bio-hackers\u2019 sheds, or just naturally evolved, we can\u2019t be sure.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"3baa\">The world was once crisscrossed with polythene pipes delivering gas and water to homes and industry.

The world was awash with plastic. From obvious fragments of polystyrene packaging, to polyethene shopping bags, and discarded PVC furniture to the microscopic micro-fibres shed\u00a0 from our polyester clothing during every wash  . It accumulated in great, becalmed\u00a0 garbage patches  \u00a0in the middle of our oceans or washed up as vast invasions of flotsam, where it was consumed by wildlife, mistaking our discarded packaging for food.  \n Meanwhile the currents and geological forces abraded the jet-sum into tiny fragments that found their way into, well everything. Our cheap, durable and omni-present material had reached every corner of the globe, it had became part of the very fabric of the planet. Geologists coined a new type of sedimentary rock;\u00a0 plastiglomerate  \u00a0\u2013 part plastic pollution part stone.  \n For decades the litter had been building. The obvious detritus featured on every street corner, beach and country park. It became part of the scenery, we got used to it, ignored it, or mildly complained, whilst making sure we kept hydrated by sipping from our water bottles, that we clutched like life-support systems.  \n Then almost two decades into the 21st century the zeitgeist shifted. Seemingly triggered by the haunting\u00a0 image of pilot whale grieving her dead cub  . The narrator blamed plastics. Our blinkers fell away, and we noticed the plastic as if it had just been dumped on our doorsteps. Unlike the invisible carbon dioxide, ravishing the climate and the oceans, we could point at this culprit.  \n Almost overnight plastic packaging became universally distasteful. Shoppers curled their lips when offered a plastic punnet of mushrooms and then stripped of the useless artificial skins from their purchases before dumping them\u00a0 in front of the supermarkets  . Companies raced to see\u00a0 who could strip the plastic from their products  \u00a0the quickest. Listicle blogs sprang up providing tips on\u00a0 how to throw the ultimate plastic free dinner party  . And, much to children\u2019s dismay,\u00a0 drinking straws disappeared from cafes  \u00a0across the land.  \n Politicians were as quick to jump on the bandwagon, keen to cash in on the voters\u2019 new plastic outrage, they\u00a0 vilified cotton buds  , toothpicks and\u00a0 wet wipes  .  \n But all this outrage, bans and boycotts was just tinkering around the edges. One small island\u2019s war on \u00a0drinking straws\u00a0  did little more than remove a mole hill from the mountain of the world\u2019s plastic waste. Something much more radical was needed.  \n Gaia had the beginnings of an answer. She was used to cleaning up detritus. Over millions of years the myriad of micro-fauna have found biochemical ways to harness the resources from organic dead matter. But plastics had only been around for a few decades. So microorganisms simply hadn\u2019t had enough time to evolve the necessary biochemical tool kit to latch onto the plastic fibres, break them up and then utilise the resulting chemicals as a source of energy and carbon that they need to grow.  \n Or so we thought.  \n But deep within a Japanese rubbish tip, devoid of organic matter on which to feed,\u00a0 evolutionary pressure had selected an organism with a new feeding strategy  . Nature it seemed, had quietly made a start on tackling our plastic plague. Somewhen, in the recent past, a bacteria had undergone a random mutation and a protein that normally allowed the bug to feed on fats had been converted into one that empowered it to digest plastics.  \n Not that the plastic waste was noticeably decomposing. The bacteria wasn\u2019t up to the scale of the job. After all, it was a mere evolutionary infants, taking the first tentative bites of a new food, still unequipped to make full use of it. It might have been decades or longer before anyone noticed the rubbish was rotting. Or maybe some other natural pressure may have been to much for the new species. It could so easily have gone extinct before anyone ever became aware of its existence.  \n But for Prof Yoshiharu Kimura\u2019s eureka moment. Struck by an inspiration particle, it occurred to him that the obvious place to look for a plastic eating organism was in the heaps of rubbish. For five years he hunted through 100s of samples of soil, sludge and stagnant water seeping out of tips and recycling plants. Then, back in the lab, he painstakingly tried to grow something, anything, by feeding his soup of organisms little more than ground up polythene bottles. Miraculously, in just one dish a single bacteria flourished, multiplied and thrived. Soon he had a viable culture. Professor Kimura \u00a0  had found the needle in the plastic stack. He called it\u00a0 Ideonella sakaiensis   .   \n For a while people were mildly interested, there was a\u00a0 flurry  \u00a0of\u00a0 press  proclaiming the solution to the plastic problem may have been found. But soon the excitement died down, for this was still two years before the dead whale cub was beamed into homes around the world. And so the newly discovered\u00a0 I. sakeienis  \u00a0slipped from the folk mind. That was until, a second breakthrough came. Perfectly timed, on this occasion, coinciding with the new anti-plastic movement. Professor Kimura had been happily sharing his cultures with scientist far and wide, and and one group had accidentally genetically engineering the protein that empower\u00a0 I. sakeieni  s to be a much more efficient plastic digester. In those 24 months they had done what nature might have taken centuries to achieve. The bacteria hit the\u00a0 headlines  . They showed the world that by taking what Gaia started and combining it with 21st century biotechnology we could at last tackle the plastic problem of our own making.  \n Genetically modification of organism, vilified for decades as the technology that would destroy our ecosystems, suddenly became the answer to all our worries. Folks who had ripped up experimental GM crops, fell over each other in their efforts to support genetically enhanced plastic munching microbes. After all, the plastics were unnatural and evil. And so, they reasoned, it was perfectly acceptable (at least in this case) to utilise GM bugs to clear up our mess. It might even be that we were just giving nature a helping hand, it was possible that some organisms might even have\u00a0 made a start on the plastics  \u00a0in the oceans.  \n The great cleanup began. Governments and eco-charities around the world throw money at the problem. What started with the odd publication here and there became a torrent of papers describing newly discovered and genetically enhanced bacteria, fungi and even worms. All equipped with an arsenal of plastic eating enzymes. Soon concerned citizens got in on the act. School science fairs featured projects dreamt up by keen children attempting to\u00a0 breed plastic-eating creatures  , the maker movement got involved, as they discovered\u00a0 home bio-hack kits  \u00a0could be used to tinker with microbes molecular machinery.  \n By 2022 we had identified thousands of organisms, both naturally evolved and artificially enhanced, equipped with the molecular and mechanical machinery required to set to work on our poly-materials. In just a few more years the impact was tangible. Recycling plants quickly harnessed the new biotech boom to turn rubbish into fuel and chemical feedstocks used to create, amongst other things, fresh virgin plastics. Plastics production and recycling had at last become a truly \u00a0circular economy  . It even became economically viable, with the help of\u00a0 solar powered drone barges  , to sweep up the great ocean garbage patches.  \n The oceanic rubbish rafts shrank, plastics slowly rotted on our beaches, reports of\u00a0 plastiglomerate  \u00a0dwindled. There was a collective sigh of relief.  \n Except it wasn\u2019t just the rubbish the new breed of bugs were eating. Once out in the wild they were unable to distinguish between refuse and infrastructure. Whether the plastic-munching organisms escaped from the recycling plants, the amatuer bio-hackers\u2019 sheds, or just naturally evolved, we can\u2019t be sure.  \n The world was once crisscrossed with polythene pipes delivering gas and water to homes and industry. PVC insulated electrical cables and sheathed the world\u2019s fibre optic communication networks. The many uses of plastics were incalculable. At its peak\u00a0 350 million metric tonne  s of plastic materials produced annually had formed the fabric of not just our single use packages, that we so quickly discarded, but also the very structure of our civilisation. And now that fabric rots like so much soft-wood.  \n  \n  \n  ", "title_html": "<h1 class=\"title\">\n<a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2018/05/08/2050-a-world-without-plastics/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permalink to 2050 \u2013 A world without plastics\">2050 \u2013 A world without plastics</a>\n</h1> <h3 class=\"title\">Recent Comments</h3> <h3 class=\"title\">Recent Posts</h3> <h3 class=\"title\">Archives</h3> <h3 class=\"title\">Meta</h3> "}

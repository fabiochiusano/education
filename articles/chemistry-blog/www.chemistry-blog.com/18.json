{"content_html": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>I thought I\u2019d take you on a little journey though the process of making a <strong><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/dictionary/\">chemistry dictionary</a></strong> from scratch.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty good story, I think.</p>\n<p>It started with searching online for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=chemistry+glossaries\">chemistry glossaries</a>.\u00a0 I figured that would be a good repository of chemistry-related words.\u00a0 And, as a bonus, their definitions could give me even more words to add to my list.\u00a0 I copied the six or seven glossaries I liked into one long Word document.\u00a0 It was a messy document.\u00a0 Random lists of words.\u00a0 Some with definitions, some without.\u00a0 Mainly words that are recognized by the standard dictionary, but many words that were prime candidates for my list.</p>\n<p>(rest of the story below the jump.

id=\"more-709\"></span></p>\n<p>It was relatively easy to take this long document and convert it into a list of words that Word considered \u2018misspelled.\u2019\u00a0 I scrolled through the document looking for red underlined words.\u00a0 I selected and deleted all the words in between the \u2018misspelled\u2019 words, so all I had at the end was a list of \u2018misspelled\u2019 words.</p>\n<p>From here, it gets a bit tricky.\u00a0 Many of the glossaries contained duplicate words.\u00a0 Enter Excel.\u00a0 I piped the list over to Excel and executed two of Excel\u2019s built-in functions \u2013 one that I already knew about and one that was new to me.\u00a0 I <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100739471033.aspx\">sorted the list alphabetically</a>, which is something I\u2019ve done numerous times in other circumstances.\u00a0 Then I clicked on \u2018<a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100739431033.aspx\">remove duplicates</a>.\u2019\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen this feature before, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s new to the Office 2007 suite or not\u2026 but it\u2019s awesome.\u00a0 One clicked removed all the duplicate entries in my list.</p>\n<p>After that, I just had to comb the list for obvious actual misspellings and version 1.0 was done.\u00a0 Lots of chemistry words in lots of parts of speech.\u00a0 It took about a month to make a list of about 8,000 words.</p>\n<p>But there was one gaping hole I knew I wasn\u2019t filling.\u00a0 Iterations.\u00a0 Most glossaries aren\u2019t going to include iterations of compounds.\u00a0 I\u2019m an organic chemist, so the first thing I thought of was that I needed a list of iterative substituent changes to common chemical backbones.\u00a0 I needed a list that included methylbenzene, ethylbenzene, dimethylbenzene, fluorobenzene, etc.\u00a0 I needed a list that included a number of substituents on a number of backbones.\u00a0 I envisioned an array of chemicals created from two lists:\u00a0 imagine substituents across the top of a grid and backbones along the side of a grid.\u00a0 I needed to merge the grid such that each substituent was appended to each backbone\u2026 but I didn\u2019t want to do it by hand.</p>\n<p>Now, I consider myself fairly adept at navigating Excel and getting it to do what I want it to do.\u00a0 But I\u2019m nothing compared to my dad.\u00a0 So I asked him if he knew how to fill my array quickly and easily.\u00a0 Of course he did.\u00a0 I needed the <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100625621033.aspx\">concatenate function</a>.\u00a0 The concatenate function allows you to pull text from any number of cells and join them together.\u00a0 Exactly what I needed (thanks, Dad).\u00a0 I wrote the formula for the top left cell, and it concatenated the first iteration perfectly.\u00a0 All I had to do was copy and paste the formula to the rest of the grid.\u00a0 10,000 more chemicals were systematically created in less than a second.\u00a0 Awesome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/concatenate.bmp\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/concatenate.bmp\" width=\"166\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now I just needed to convert the table to a list\u2026\u00a0 I wrote a few lines of code in a Macro to help me out with this one.\u00a0 I knew how many columns I had, so I opened a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zxkf5z4b(VS.71).aspx\">for\u2026next loop</a> and had it copy the contents of the top left cell to the bottom of the growing vertical list, then move to the cell to the right and repeat.\u00a0 I knew how many rows I had, so I nested the first for\u2026next loop inside a second for\u2026next loop.\u00a0 When the inner loop had finished copying the contents of the first row to the growing list, the outer loop just moved the focus to the next row and the inner loop started all over again.\u00a0 In a single afternoon, I grew the dictionary from 8,000 words to 18,000 words.</p>\n<p>At this point the dictionary was released on <a href=\"http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/chemistry-dictionary.html\">Sciencebase</a>.\u00a0 A commenter suggested I protect it with a Creative Commons license, and I did.\u00a0 It\u2019s protected under the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/\">Attribution license</a>.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the release of the first version of the dictionary, David Bradley at Sciencebase introduced me to Antony Williams of <a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com\">ChemSpider</a>.\u00a0 Completely coincidentally, we happen to live in the same area and were able to meet one afternoon.\u00a0 He agreed to help the effort and release a list of the 1.3 million identifiers in the ChemSpider database (Thanks, Tony).</p>\n<p>Integrating the list meant sifting through 1.3 million entries that all read something like \u201c<a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.20022431.html\">(4aS,8aS)-2-[3-((R)-5-benzyl-3-cyclohex-2-enyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-decahydro-isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid tert-butylamide</a>.\u201d\u00a0 First order of business was to remove all extraneous characters and break the individual entries into several fragment strings.\u00a0 The above would need the numbers, dashes, brackets, and parentheses removed and would be transformed into thirteen unique strings: benzyl, cyclohex, enyl, oxo, etc.\u00a0 I needed to do this 1.3 million times\u2026 then remove all the duplicates.</p>\n<p>This is probably my favorite part of the story.\u00a0 I wrote a macro in Word to do most of the work for me.\u00a0 It consisted of a series of Find\u2026Replace operations.\u00a0 The first would find all hyphens and replace them with a Paragraph Mark.\u00a0 That is, it would stop the entry at the point of the hyphen and continue the entry on the next line with the hyphen removed.\u00a0 I used several Find\u2026Replace operations to find all the hyphens, parentheses, numbers, etc. and replace them with Paragraph Marks.</p>\n<p>That did two things, one good, one bad.\u00a0 It removed all the extraneous characters, but now I had all these words with lots of empty lines between them.\u00a0 Imagine: for an entry like <a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.80762.html\">3-methyl-2-cyclohexene-1-ol</a>, the macro would find the hyphens and continue the entry on the next line.\u00a0 It would find the numbers and continue the entry on the next line, too.\u00a0 So between methyl and cyclohexene there were three empty lines.\u00a0 I ended the macro with a final series of Find\u2026Replace operations.\u00a0 Every time it found multiple Paragraph Mark in a row (that is, whenever there was more than one line between entries) it would replace it with a single Paragraph Mark.\u00a0 This truncated the list and removed all the extra lines between words.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/iterations.bmp\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/iterations.bmp\" width=\"166\"/></a></p>\n<p>When Word was finished extracting just the useful identifiers from a small piece, I piped the list over to Excel.\u00a0 I used the same two Sort and Remove Duplicate functions and my list would slowly turn from 1.3 million long and complex entries into a smaller list of single entries.</p>\n<p>Thanks to this amazing automation, I sifted the 1.3 million identifiers in five days.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t do all 1.3 million at once, I had to do it in pieces.\u00a0 But 1.3 million entries like \u201c(4aS,8aS)-2-[3-((R)-5-benzyl-3-cyclohex-2-enyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-decahydro-isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid tert-butylamide\u201d were turned into a list of more than 100,000 unique fragments, after the duplicates were removed.</p>\n<p>One other cool tech note that deserves mention.\u00a0 I had this list of &gt;100,000 entries.\u00a0 Littered throughout this list were words that were already in the first dictionary or the built-in dictionary.\u00a0 I wanted to sort those out to save some work in the next section.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t going to be as trivial as it was when I removed correctly-spelled words from the glossary list.\u00a0 I wanted a macro to go cell by cell and determine if the word is correctly spelled or not.\u00a0 If it was, I wanted it to return a \u201ctrue\u201d value in the cell next to it, and a \u201cfalse\u201d if it wasn\u2019t in a dictionary already.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know how to do that, and unfortunately neither did my dad.\u00a0 But we brainstormed for a while and found <a href=\"http://en.allexperts.com/q/Excel-1059/Excel-Spellcheck-Macro.htm\">a macro someone else had written to do exactly what I needed done</a>.\u00a0 I applied it to my list then sorted the second column alphabetically.\u00a0 This clumped all the words already in a dictionary together, and I was able to delete them as one unit.\u00a0 <strong>**End of TechTalk.\u00a0 (I promise)**</strong></p>\n<p>Next, I needed to individually read through the remaining &gt;100,000 entries to remove obvious mistakes, foreign words, nonsense entries, etc.\u00a0 That was the hard part.\u00a0 Wow, it was tedious.\u00a0 No macro for this one\u2026\u00a0 On a good day, I could get through about 5,000 entries.\u00a0 Most days were not good days.\u00a0 It took the better part of 10 months to finally look at each and every one of the more than 100,000 entries and decide if it should stay or go.\u00a0 In the end, around 20,000 were manually deleted from that list.</p>\n<p>To finish up, I needed to combine the old and new lists.\u00a0 I also added a small, non-exhaustive list of American and European chemists\u2019 names to the mix for fun.\u00a0 To test my dictionary, I copied the html versions of the recent JACS, JOC, and Org Lett ASAPs into Word and turned the dictionary on.\u00a0 Any words that were still showing up as misspelled, I reviewed and added to the dictionary. (<a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2008/12/17/chemistry-dictionary-for-word-processors-version-20/\">Download the dictionary here</a>)</p>\n<p>One of the biggest things I noticed during this vetting was the use of plurals in scientific writing.\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.12999.html\">Cyclopentenone</a> is an actual compound and is in the dictionary.\u00a0 If your research requires you to make a family of cyclopentenones, then the plural was probably not in the dictionary (it is now, though).\u00a0 Although, that raises an interesting question: can you pluralize compounds like that?\u00a0 Or is it more correct to say that a library of cyclopentenone <em>derivatives </em>was made?\u00a0 Same thing with families of natural products.\u00a0 Are they members of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=brevetoxin\">brevetoxins</a>?\u00a0 Or are they more correctly members of the brevetoxin <em>family of natural products</em>?\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure I know the answer to that one.\u00a0 One thing I do know is that I did not include plurals of elements.\u00a0 Your <sup>13</sup>C NMR doesn\u2019t tell you that you have 2 carbonyl carbons.\u00a0 It tells you that you have 2 carbonyl carbon <em>atoms</em>.</p>\n<p>For fun, I thought I\u2019d leave you with some simple analysis I did on the final list of words (again, with the help of awesome Excel formula operations).\u00a0 I\u2019ve also included a before and after picture to show the utility of the dictionary.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After being combined with the previous list (as well as a list of common reagents and chemists), the list is 104,502 entries long.<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100625691033.aspx\">longest</a> entry is 56 letters long (<a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.20058268.html\">acetyltyrosylseryltyrosylphenylalanylprolylserylvalinate</a>)<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The longest non-protein entry is 50 letters long (<a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.19967187.html\">methylsulfinylphenyloxooxazolidinylmethylacetamide</a>)<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14,109 entries <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100698401033.aspx\">start</a> with the letter \u2018d\u2019.\u00a0 Second place is \u2018p\u2019 with 9,971.\u00a0 Last place is \u2018j\u2019 with 73.<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My favorite entry is <a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.3959.html\">tetraazaadamantane</a> because it contains the string \u2018aazaa\u2019, which is not a mistake or misspelling.<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The final list is 430 pages in Microsoft Word, one entry per line.</p>\n<p>For the Before and After pictures, I copied the html versions of the ASAPs from an ACS journal into Word and took a screencap with and without the dictionary active.  Notice how the After picture makes it clear that the technical were spelled correctly, but processes was NOT!  What\u2019s even more startling is that the typo makes it all the way to the published PDF version of the ASAP.  Anyone at ACS reading this?  This would make a great last-minute Christmas present for your favorite ACS copy editor.

(Download the dictionary here) \n One of the biggest things I noticed during this vetting was the use of plurals in scientific writing.\u00a0 Cyclopentenone is an actual compound and is in the dictionary.\u00a0 If your research requires you to make a family of cyclopentenones, then the plural was probably not in the dictionary (it is now, though).\u00a0 Although, that raises an interesting question: can you pluralize compounds like that?\u00a0 Or is it more correct to say that a library of cyclopentenone derivatives was made?\u00a0 Same thing with families of natural products.\u00a0 Are they members of the brevetoxins?\u00a0 Or are they more correctly members of the brevetoxin family of natural products?\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure I know the answer to that one.\u00a0 One thing I do know is that I did not include plurals of elements.\u00a0 Your 13C NMR doesn\u2019t tell you that you have 2 carbonyl carbons.\u00a0 It tells you that you have 2 carbonyl carbon atoms. \n For fun, I thought I\u2019d leave you with some simple analysis I did on the final list of words (again, with the help of awesome Excel formula operations).\u00a0 I\u2019ve also included a before and after picture to show the utility of the dictionary. \n \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After being combined with the previous list (as well as a list of common reagents and chemists), the list is 104,502 entries long.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The longest entry is 56 letters long (acetyltyrosylseryltyrosylphenylalanylprolylserylvalinate)\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The longest non-protein entry is 50 letters long (methylsulfinylphenyloxooxazolidinylmethylacetamide)\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14,109 entries start with the letter \u2018d\u2019.\u00a0 Second place is \u2018p\u2019 with 9,971.\u00a0 Last place is \u2018j\u2019 with 73.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My favorite entry is tetraazaadamantane because it contains the string \u2018aazaa\u2019, which is not a mistake or misspelling.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The final list is 430 pages in Microsoft Word, one entry per line. \n For the Before and After pictures, I copied the html versions of the ASAPs from an ACS journal into Word and took a screencap with and without the dictionary active.  Notice how the After picture makes it clear that the technical were spelled correctly, but processes was NOT!  What\u2019s even more startling is that the typo makes it all the way to the published PDF version of the ASAP.  Anyone at ACS reading this?  This would make a great last-minute Christmas present for your favorite ACS copy editor.  I noticed these kinds of actual typos happening an uncomfortable number of times. \n BEFORE:\n\nAFTER\n\nPDF\n \n  \n  \n", "url":

<strong><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/dictionary/\">chemistry dictionary</a></strong> from scratch.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty good story, I think.</p>\n<p>It started with searching online for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=chemistry+glossaries\">chemistry glossaries</a>.\u00a0 I figured that would be a good repository of chemistry-related words.\u00a0 And, as a bonus, their definitions could give me even more words to add to my list.\u00a0 I copied the six or seven glossaries I liked into one long Word document.\u00a0 It was a messy document.\u00a0 Random lists of words.\u00a0 Some with definitions, some without.\u00a0 Mainly words that are recognized by the standard dictionary, but many words that were prime candidates for my list.</p>\n<p>(rest of the story below the jump.  It gets a bit technical in the middle\u2026 but keep with it for the cool pictures (click the images for larger versions) and a Christmas idea for your favorite ACS copy editor!)</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-709\"></span></p>\n<p>It was relatively easy to take this long document and convert it into a list of words that Word considered \u2018misspelled.\u2019\u00a0 I scrolled through the document looking for red underlined words.\u00a0 I selected and deleted all the words in between the \u2018misspelled\u2019 words, so all I had at the end was a list of \u2018misspelled\u2019 words.</p>\n<p>From here, it gets a bit tricky.\u00a0 Many of the glossaries contained duplicate words.\u00a0 Enter Excel.\u00a0 I piped the list over to Excel and executed two of Excel\u2019s built-in functions \u2013 one that I already knew about and one that was new to me.\u00a0 I <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100739471033.aspx\">sorted the list alphabetically</a>, which is something I\u2019ve done numerous times in other circumstances.\u00a0 Then I clicked on \u2018<a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100739431033.aspx\">remove duplicates</a>.\u2019\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen this feature before, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s new to the Office 2007 suite or not\u2026 but it\u2019s awesome.\u00a0 One clicked removed all the duplicate entries in my list.</p>\n<p>After that, I just had to comb the list for obvious actual misspellings and version 1.0 was done.\u00a0 Lots of chemistry words in lots of parts of speech.\u00a0 It took about a month to make a list of about 8,000 words.</p>\n<p>But there was one gaping hole I knew I wasn\u2019t filling.\u00a0 Iterations.\u00a0 Most glossaries aren\u2019t going to include iterations of compounds.\u00a0 I\u2019m an organic chemist, so the first thing I thought of was that I needed a list of iterative substituent changes to common chemical backbones.\u00a0 I needed a list that included methylbenzene, ethylbenzene, dimethylbenzene, fluorobenzene, etc.\u00a0 I needed a list that included a number of substituents on a number of backbones.\u00a0 I envisioned an array of chemicals created from two lists:\u00a0 imagine substituents across the top of a grid and backbones along the side of a grid.\u00a0 I needed to merge the grid such that each substituent was appended to each backbone\u2026 but I didn\u2019t want to do it by hand.</p>\n<p>Now, I consider myself fairly adept at navigating Excel and getting it to do what I want it to do.\u00a0 But I\u2019m nothing compared to my dad.\u00a0 So I asked him if he knew how to fill my array quickly and easily.\u00a0 Of course he did.\u00a0 I needed the <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100625621033.aspx\">concatenate function</a>.\u00a0 The concatenate function allows you to pull text from any number of cells and join them together.\u00a0 Exactly what I needed (thanks, Dad).\u00a0 I wrote the formula for the top left cell, and it concatenated the first iteration perfectly.\u00a0 All I had to do was copy and paste the formula to the rest of the grid.\u00a0 10,000 more chemicals were systematically created in less than a second.\u00a0 Awesome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/concatenate.bmp\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/concatenate.bmp\" width=\"166\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now I just needed to convert the table to a list\u2026\u00a0 I wrote a few lines of code in a Macro to help me out with this one.\u00a0 I knew how many columns I had, so I opened a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zxkf5z4b(VS.71).aspx\">for\u2026next loop</a> and had it copy the contents of the top left cell to the bottom of the growing vertical list, then move to the cell to the right and repeat.\u00a0 I knew how many rows I had, so I nested the first for\u2026next loop inside a second for\u2026next loop.\u00a0 When the inner loop had finished copying the contents of the first row to the growing list, the outer loop just moved the focus to the next row and the inner loop started all over again.\u00a0 In a single afternoon, I grew the dictionary from 8,000 words to 18,000 words.</p>\n<p>At this point the dictionary was released on <a href=\"http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/chemistry-dictionary.html\">Sciencebase</a>.\u00a0 A commenter suggested I protect it with a Creative Commons license, and I did.\u00a0 It\u2019s protected under the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/\">Attribution license</a>.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the release of the first version of the dictionary, David Bradley at Sciencebase introduced me to Antony Williams of <a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com\">ChemSpider</a>.\u00a0 Completely coincidentally, we happen to live in the same area and were able to meet one afternoon.\u00a0 He agreed to help the effort and release a list of the 1.3 million identifiers in the ChemSpider database (Thanks, Tony).</p>\n<p>Integrating the list meant sifting through 1.3 million entries that all read something like \u201c<a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.20022431.html\">(4aS,8aS)-2-[3-((R)-5-benzyl-3-cyclohex-2-enyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-decahydro-isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid tert-butylamide</a>.\u201d\u00a0 First order of business was to remove all extraneous characters and break the individual entries into several fragment strings.\u00a0 The above would need the numbers, dashes, brackets, and parentheses removed and would be transformed into thirteen unique strings: benzyl, cyclohex, enyl, oxo, etc.\u00a0 I needed to do this 1.3 million times\u2026 then remove all the duplicates.</p>\n<p>This is probably my favorite part of the story.\u00a0 I wrote a macro in Word to do most of the work for me.\u00a0 It consisted of a series of Find\u2026Replace operations.\u00a0 The first would find all hyphens and replace them with a Paragraph Mark.\u00a0 That is, it would stop the entry at the point of the hyphen and continue the entry on the next line with the hyphen removed.\u00a0 I used several Find\u2026Replace operations to find all the hyphens, parentheses, numbers, etc. and replace them with Paragraph Marks.</p>\n<p>That did two things, one good, one bad.\u00a0 It removed all the extraneous characters, but now I had all these words with lots of empty lines between them.\u00a0 Imagine: for an entry like <a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.80762.html\">3-methyl-2-cyclohexene-1-ol</a>, the macro would find the hyphens and continue the entry on the next line.\u00a0 It would find the numbers and continue the entry on the next line, too.\u00a0 So between methyl and cyclohexene there were three empty lines.\u00a0 I ended the macro with a final series of Find\u2026Replace operations.\u00a0 Every time it found multiple Paragraph Mark in a row (that is, whenever there was more than one line between entries) it would replace it with a single Paragraph Mark.\u00a0 This truncated the list and removed all the extra lines between words.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/iterations.bmp\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/iterations.bmp\" width=\"166\"/></a></p>\n<p>When Word was finished extracting just the useful identifiers from a small piece, I piped the list over to Excel.\u00a0 I used the same two Sort and Remove Duplicate functions and my list would slowly turn from 1.3 million long and complex entries into a smaller list of single entries.</p>\n<p>Thanks to this amazing automation, I sifted the 1.3 million identifiers in five days.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t do all 1.3 million at once, I had to do it in pieces.\u00a0 But 1.3 million entries like \u201c(4aS,8aS)-2-[3-((R)-5-benzyl-3-cyclohex-2-enyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-decahydro-isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid tert-butylamide\u201d were turned into a list of more than 100,000 unique fragments, after the duplicates were removed.</p>\n<p>One other cool tech note that deserves mention.\u00a0 I had this list of &gt;100,000 entries.\u00a0 Littered throughout this list were words that were already in the first dictionary or the built-in dictionary.\u00a0 I wanted to sort those out to save some work in the next section.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t going to be as trivial as it was when I removed correctly-spelled words from the glossary list.\u00a0 I wanted a macro to go cell by cell and determine if the word is correctly spelled or not.\u00a0 If it was, I wanted it to return a \u201ctrue\u201d value in the cell next to it, and a \u201cfalse\u201d if it wasn\u2019t in a dictionary already.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know how to do that, and unfortunately neither did my dad.\u00a0 But we brainstormed for a while and found <a href=\"http://en.allexperts.com/q/Excel-1059/Excel-Spellcheck-Macro.htm\">a macro someone else had written to do exactly what I needed done</a>.\u00a0 I applied it to my list then sorted the second column alphabetically.\u00a0 This clumped all the words already in a dictionary together, and I was able to delete them as one unit.\u00a0 <strong>**End of TechTalk.\u00a0 (I promise)**</strong></p>\n<p>Next, I needed to individually read through the remaining &gt;100,000 entries to remove obvious mistakes, foreign words, nonsense entries, etc.\u00a0 That was the hard part.\u00a0 Wow, it was tedious.\u00a0 No macro for this one\u2026\u00a0 On a good day, I could get through about 5,000 entries.\u00a0 Most days were not good days.\u00a0 It took the better part of 10 months to finally look at each and every one of the more than 100,000 entries and decide if it should stay or go.\u00a0 In the end, around 20,000 were manually deleted from that list.</p>\n<p>To finish up, I needed to combine the old and new lists.\u00a0 I also added a small, non-exhaustive list of American and European chemists\u2019 names to the mix for fun.\u00a0 To test my dictionary, I copied the html versions of the recent JACS, JOC, and Org Lett ASAPs into Word and turned the dictionary on.\u00a0 Any words that were still showing up as misspelled, I reviewed and added to the dictionary. (<a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2008/12/17/chemistry-dictionary-for-word-processors-version-20/\">Download the dictionary here</a>)</p>\n<p>One of the biggest things I noticed during this vetting was the use of plurals in scientific writing.\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.12999.html\">Cyclopentenone</a> is an actual compound and is in the dictionary.\u00a0 If your research requires you to make a family of cyclopentenones, then the plural was probably not in the dictionary (it is now, though).\u00a0 Although, that raises an interesting question: can you pluralize compounds like that?\u00a0 Or is it more correct to say that a library of cyclopentenone <em>derivatives </em>was made?\u00a0 Same thing with families of natural products.\u00a0 Are they members of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=brevetoxin\">brevetoxins</a>?\u00a0 Or are they more correctly members of the brevetoxin <em>family of natural products</em>?\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure I know the answer to that one.\u00a0 One thing I do know is that I did not include plurals of elements.\u00a0 Your <sup>13</sup>C NMR doesn\u2019t tell you that you have 2 carbonyl carbons.\u00a0 It tells you that you have 2 carbonyl carbon <em>atoms</em>.</p>\n<p>For fun, I thought I\u2019d leave you with some simple analysis I did on the final list of words (again, with the help of awesome Excel formula operations).\u00a0 I\u2019ve also included a before and after picture to show the utility of the dictionary.</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After being combined with the previous list (as well as a list of common reagents and chemists), the list is 104,502 entries long.<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100625691033.aspx\">longest</a> entry is 56 letters long (<a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.20058268.html\">acetyltyrosylseryltyrosylphenylalanylprolylserylvalinate</a>)<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The longest non-protein entry is 50 letters long (<a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.19967187.html\">methylsulfinylphenyloxooxazolidinylmethylacetamide</a>)<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14,109 entries <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100698401033.aspx\">start</a> with the letter \u2018d\u2019.\u00a0 Second place is \u2018p\u2019 with 9,971.\u00a0 Last place is \u2018j\u2019 with 73.<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My favorite entry is <a href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.3959.html\">tetraazaadamantane</a> because it contains the string \u2018aazaa\u2019, which is not a mistake or misspelling.<br/>\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The final list is 430 pages in Microsoft Word, one entry per line.</p>\n<p>For the Before and After pictures, I copied the html versions of the ASAPs from an ACS journal into Word and took a screencap with and without the dictionary active.  Notice how the After picture makes it clear that the technical were spelled correctly, but processes was NOT!  What\u2019s even more startling is that the typo makes it all the way to the published PDF version of the ASAP.  Anyone at ACS reading this?  This would make a great last-minute Christmas present for your favorite ACS copy editor.  I noticed these kinds of actual typos happening an uncomfortable number of times.</p>\n<p><strong>BEFORE:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/processsesnospellcheck.bmp\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"307\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/processsesnospellcheck.bmp\" width=\"380\"/></a><br/>\n<strong>AFTER</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/processsesyesspellcheck.bmp\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"308\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/processsesyesspellcheck.bmp\" width=\"382\"/></a><br/>\n<strong>PDF</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/processsespdf.bmp\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"205\" src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/processsespdf.bmp\" width=\"390\"/></a></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div><!-- / .entry -->\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div><!-- #post-709 -->\n<div class=\"share_box\">\n<h3>Share this post</h3>\n<div class=\"share_btn\"><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-url=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2008/12/19/on-making-a-chemistry-dictionary-or-why-excel-and-macros-are-awesome/\" href=\"http://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a><script src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></div>\n<div class=\"share_btn\"><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chemistry-blog.com%2F2008%2F12%2F19%2Fon-making-a-chemistry-dictionary-or-why-excel-and-macros-are-awesome%2F&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=1000&amp;action=like&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=21\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:80px; height:21px;\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"share_btn\"><g:plusone size=\"medium\"></g:plusone></div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post_author\">\n<span class=\"link\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/author/azmanam/\" rel=\"author\" title=\"Posts by azmanam\">azmanam</a></span>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<span class=\"author_links\">\n<ul>\n<li>Visit Author:</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com\">Website</a></li>\n<li><span class=\"separator\"></span><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/author/azmanam/\">All Posts</a></li>\n</ul>\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div id=\"comments\">\n<h3>10 Comments</h3>\n<ol class=\"commentlist\">\n<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-3251\">\n<div id=\"comment-3251\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">Macman104</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2008/12/19/on-making-a-chemistry-dictionary-or-why-excel-and-macros-are-awesome/#comment-3251\">\n                On December 19, 2008 @ 7:18 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>So many kinds of cool, thanks!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reply\">\n<a aria-label=\"Reply to Macman104\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2008/12/19/on-making-a-chemistry-dictionary-or-why-excel-and-macros-are-awesome/?replytocom=3251#respond\" onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"comment-3251\", \"3251\", \"respond\", \"709\" )' rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/themes/startingup/images/quick-reply-button.png\"/></a> </div><!-- .reply -->\n</div><!-- #comment-##  -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"post pingback\">\n<p>Pingback: <a class=\"url\" href=\"http://www.chemspider.com/blog/a-chemical-dictionary-from-adam-azman-with-help-from-chemspider.html\" rel=\"external nofollow\">ChemSpider Blog \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb A Chemical Dictionary from Adam Azman with Help from ChemSpider</a></p>\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-3292\">\n<div id=\"comment-3292\">\n<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n<cite class=\"fn\">ChemE</cite> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\n<div class=\"comment-meta commentmetadata\"><a href=\"http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2008/12/19/on-making-a-chemistry-dictionary-or-why-excel-and-macros-are-awesome/#comment-3292\">\n                On December 21, 2008 @ 10:51 pm</a>\n</div><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata -->\n</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n<div class=\"comment-body\"><p>Don\u2019t stop the tech talk, that\u2019s a pretty awesome use of macros.

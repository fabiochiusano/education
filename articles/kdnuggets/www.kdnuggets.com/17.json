{"content": "\n  comments \n By Kristen Kehrer, DataMovesMe. \n  \n Asking questions can sometimes seem scary. No one wants to appear \u201csilly.\u201d But I assure you: \n \nYou\u2019re not silly.\nIt\u2019s\u00a0waymore scary if you\u2019re not asking questions.\n \n Data Science is a constant collaboration with the business and a series of questions and answers that allow you to deliver the analysis/model/data product that the business has in their head. \n Questions are required to fully understand what the business wants and not find yourself making assumptions about what others are thinking. \n Asking the right questions, like those you identified here is what separate Data Scientists that know \u2018why\u2019 from folks that only know what (tools and technologies). \n -Kayode Ayankoya \n We\u2019re going to answer the following questions: \n \nWhere do we ask questions?\nWhat are great questions?\n \n I had posted on LinkedIn recently about asking great questions in data science and received a ton of thought provoking comments. I will add a couple of my favorite comments/quotes throughout this article. \n Where do we ask questions? \n Basically every piece of the pipeline can be expressed as a question: \n And each of these questions could involve a plethora of follow up questions. \n To touch the tip of the iceberg, Kate Strachnyi posted a great assortment of questions that we typically ask (or want to consider) when scoping an analysis: \n Few questions to ask yourself:\u00a0\u00a0\nHow will the results be used? (make business decision, invest in product category, work with a vendor, identify risks, etc)\nWhat questions will the audience have about our analysis? (ability to filter on key segments, look at data across time to identify trends, drill-down into details, etc)\nHow should the questions be prioritized to derive the most value?\nWho should be able to access the information? think about confidentiality/ security concerns\nDo I have the required permissions or credentials to access the data necessary for analysis?\nWhat are the different data sources, which variables do I need, and how much data will I need to get from each one?\nDo I need all the data for more granular analysis, or do I need a subset to ensure faster performance? \n -Kate Strachnyi \n Kate\u2019s questions spanned both: \n \nQuestions you\u2019d ask stakeholders/different departments\nQuestions you\u2019d ask internally on the data science/analytics team.\n \n Any of the questions above could yield a variety of answers, so it is imperative that you\u2019re asking questions. Just because you have something in your mind that is an awesome idea for approaching the problem, does not mean that other people don\u2019t similarly have awesome ideas that need to be heard an discussed. At the end of the day, data science typically functions as a support function to other areas of the business. Meaning we can\u2019t just go rogue. \n In addition to getting clarification and asking questions of stakeholders of the project, you\u2019ll also want to collaborate and ask questions of those on your data science team. \n Even the most seasoned data scientist will still find themselves creating a methodology or solution that isn\u2019t in their area of expertise or is a unique use case of an algorithm that would benefit from the thoughts of other data subject matter experts. Often times the person listening to your proposed methodology will just give you the thumbs up, but when you\u2019ve been staring at your computer for hours there is also a chance that you haven\u2019t considered one of the underlying assumptions of your model or you\u2019re introducing bias somewhere. Someone with fresh eyes can give a new perspective and save you from realizing your error AFTER you\u2019ve presented your results. \n Keeping your methodology a secret until you deliver the results will not do you any favors. If anything, sharing your thoughts upfront and asking for feedback will help to ensure a successful outcome. \n What are great questions? \n Great questions are the ones that get asked. However, there is an art and science to asking good questions and also a learning process involved. Especially when you\u2019re starting at a new job, ask everything. Even if it\u2019s something that you believe you should already know, it\u2019s better to ask and course-correct, than to not ask. You could potentially lose hours working on an analysis and then have your boss tell you that you misunderstood the request. \n It is helpful to also pose questions in a way that requires more than a \u201cyes/no\u201d response, so you can open up a dialogue and receive more context and information. \n How we formulate the questions is also very important. I\u2019ve often found that people feel judged by my questions. I have to reassure them that all I want is to understand how they work and what are their needs and that my intention is not to judge them or criticize them. \n -Karlo Jimenez \n I\u2019ve experienced what Karlo mentioned myself. Being direct can sometimes come off as judgement.\u00a0 We definitely need to put on our \u201cbusiness acumen\u201d hats on to the best of our ability to come across as someone who is genuinely trying to understand and deliver to their needs. I\u2019ve found that if I can pose the question as \u201clooking for their valuable feedback\u201d, it\u2019s a win-win for everyone involved. \n As you build relationships with your team and stakeholders, this scenario is much less likely to occur. Once everyone realizes your personality and you\u2019ve built a rapport, people will expect your line of questioning. \n Follow up questions, in its various forms, are absolutely critical. Probing gives you an opportunity to paraphrase the ask and gain consensus before moving forward. \n -Toby Baker \n Follow-up questions feel good. When a question prompts another question you feel like you\u2019re really getting somewhere. Peeling back another layer of the onion if you will. You\u2019re collaborating, you\u2019re listening, you\u2019re in the zone. \n In Summary \n The main takeaway here is that there are a TON of questions you need to ask to effectively produce something that the business wants. Once you start asking questions, it\u2019ll become second nature and you\u2019ll immediately see the value and find yourself asking even more questions as you gain more experience. \n Questioning has been instrumental to my career. An additional benefit is that I\u2019ve found my \u2018voice\u2019 over the years. I feel heard in meetings and my opinion is valued. A lot of this growth has come from getting comfortable asking questions and I\u2019ve also learned a ton about a given business/industry through asking these questions. \n I\u2019ve learned a lot about diversity of viewpoints and that people express information in different ways. This falls under the \u201cbusiness acumen\u201d piece of data science that we\u2019re not often taught in school. But I hope you can go forward and fearlessly ask a whole bunch of questions. \n Bio: Kristen Kehrer is the founder of DataMovesMe, with the following areas of expertise: Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, Cluster Analysis, Segmentation, Regression Analysis, Neural Network models, Decision Trees, Text Analysis, Full Factorial MVT, Survival Analysis. \n Resources: \n \nOn-line and web-based: Analytics, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning education\nSoftware for Analytics, Data Science, Data Mining, and Machine Learning\n \n Related: \n \nData Scientists: Why are they so expensive to hire?\nCracking the Data Scientist Interview\nThe Data Science Gold Rush: Top Jobs in Data Science and How to Secure Them\n \n  \n  \n \n var disqus_shortname = 'kdnuggets'; \n (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = 'https://kdnuggets.disqus.com/embed.js';\n (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })();\n  \n", "title": "Asking Great Questions as a Data Scientist", "content_html": "<div class=\"post\" id=\"post-\">\n<div align=\"right\"><img alt=\"c\" height=\"12\" src=\"/images/comment.gif\" width=\"16\"/> <a href=\"#comments\">comments</a></div>\n<p><b>By <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristen-kehrer-datamovesme/\">Kristen Kehrer</a>, <a href=\"https://datamovesme.com/\">DataMovesMe</a></b>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Data Scientist\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84509\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-1.jpg 700w, https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/data-scientist-1-300x187.jpg 300w\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>Asking questions can sometimes seem scary.

No one wants to appear \u201csilly.\u201d But I assure you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You\u2019re not silly.</li>\n<li>It\u2019s\u00a0<em>way</em>more scary if you\u2019re not asking questions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Data Science is a constant collaboration with the business and a series of questions and answers that allow you to deliver the analysis/model/data product that the business has in their head.</p>\n<p>Questions are required to fully understand what the business wants and not find yourself making assumptions about what others are thinking.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Asking the right questions, like those you identified here is what separate Data Scientists that know \u2018why\u2019 from folks that only know what (tools and technologies).</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>-Kayode Ayankoya</p>\n<p>We\u2019re going to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where do we ask questions?</li>\n<li>What are great questions?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I had posted on LinkedIn recently about asking great questions in data science and received a ton of thought provoking comments. I will add a couple of my favorite comments/quotes throughout this article.</p>\n<h3>Where do we ask questions?</h3>\n<p>Basically every piece of the pipeline can be expressed as a question:</p>\n<p>And each of these questions could involve a plethora of follow up questions.</p>\n<p>To touch the tip of the iceberg, Kate Strachnyi posted a great assortment of questions that we typically ask (or want to consider) when scoping an analysis:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Few questions to ask yourself:\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>How will the results be used? (make business decision, invest in product category, work with a vendor, identify risks, etc)</em></p>\n<p><em>What questions will the audience have about our analysis? (ability to filter on key segments, look at data across time to identify trends, drill-down into details, etc)</em></p>\n<p><em>How should the questions be prioritized to derive the most value?</em></p>\n<p><em>Who should be able to access the information? think about confidentiality/ security concerns</em></p>\n<p><em>Do I have the required permissions or credentials to access the data necessary for analysis?</em></p>\n<p><em>What are the different data sources, which variables do I need, and how much data will I need to get from each one?</em></p>\n<p><em>Do I need all the data for more granular analysis, or do I need a subset to ensure faster performance?</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>-Kate Strachnyi</p>\n<p>Kate\u2019s questions spanned both:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions you\u2019d ask stakeholders/different departments</li>\n<li>Questions you\u2019d ask internally on the data science/analytics team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any of the questions above could yield a variety of answers, so it is imperative that you\u2019re asking questions. Just because you have something in your mind that is an awesome idea for approaching the problem, does not mean that other people don\u2019t similarly have awesome ideas that need to be heard an discussed. At the end of the day, data science typically functions as a support function to other areas of the business. Meaning we can\u2019t just go rogue.</p>\n<p>In addition to getting clarification and asking questions of stakeholders of the project, you\u2019ll also want to collaborate and ask questions of those on your data science team.</p>\n<p>Even the most seasoned data scientist will still find themselves creating a methodology or solution that isn\u2019t in their area of expertise or is a unique use case of an algorithm that would benefit from the thoughts of other data subject matter experts. Often times the person listening to your proposed methodology will just give you the thumbs up, but when you\u2019ve been staring at your computer for hours there is also a chance that you haven\u2019t considered one of the underlying assumptions of your model or you\u2019re introducing bias somewhere. Someone with fresh eyes can give a new perspective and save you from realizing your error AFTER you\u2019ve presented your results.</p>\n<p>Keeping your methodology a secret until you deliver the results will not do you any favors. If anything, sharing your thoughts upfront and asking for feedback will help to ensure a successful outcome.</p>\n<h3>What are great questions?</h3>\n<p>Great questions are the ones that get asked. However, there is an art and science to asking good questions and also a learning process involved. Especially when you\u2019re starting at a new job, ask everything. Even if it\u2019s something that you believe you should already know, it\u2019s better to ask and course-correct, than to not ask. You could potentially lose hours working on an analysis and then have your boss tell you that you misunderstood the request.</p>\n<p>It is helpful to also pose questions in a way that requires more than a \u201cyes/no\u201d response, so you can open up a dialogue and receive more context and information.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>How we formulate the questions is also very important. I\u2019ve often found that people feel judged by my questions. I have to reassure them that all I want is to understand how they work and what are their needs and that my intention is not to judge them or criticize them.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>-Karlo Jimenez</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve experienced what Karlo mentioned myself. Being direct can sometimes come off as judgement.\u00a0 We definitely need to put on our \u201cbusiness acumen\u201d hats on to the best of our ability to come across as someone who is genuinely trying to understand and deliver to their needs. I\u2019ve found that if I can pose the question as \u201clooking for their valuable feedback\u201d, it\u2019s a win-win for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>As you build relationships with your team and stakeholders, this scenario is much less likely to occur. Once everyone realizes your personality and you\u2019ve built a rapport, people will expect your line of questioning.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Follow up questions, in its various forms, are absolutely critical. Probing gives you an opportunity to paraphrase the ask and gain consensus before moving forward.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>-Toby Baker</p>\n<p>Follow-up questions feel good. When a question prompts another question you feel like you\u2019re really getting somewhere. Peeling back another layer of the onion if you will. You\u2019re collaborating, you\u2019re listening, you\u2019re in the zone.</p>\n<h3>In Summary</h3>\n<p>The main takeaway here is that there are a TON of questions you need to ask to effectively produce something that the business wants. Once you start asking questions, it\u2019ll become second nature and you\u2019ll immediately see the value and find yourself asking even more questions as you gain more experience.</p>\n<p>Questioning has been instrumental to my career. An additional benefit is that I\u2019ve found my \u2018voice\u2019 over the years. I feel heard in meetings and my opinion is valued. A lot of this growth has come from getting comfortable asking questions and I\u2019ve also learned a ton about a given business/industry through asking these questions.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve learned a lot about diversity of viewpoints and that people express information in different ways. This falls under the \u201cbusiness acumen\u201d piece of data science that we\u2019re not often taught in school. But I hope you can go forward and fearlessly ask a whole bunch of questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Bio</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristen-kehrer-datamovesme/\">Kristen Kehrer</a> is the

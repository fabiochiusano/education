Things that make you say \u201cwow\u201d or even \u201cwhat a time to be alive!\u201d (as the creator of\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg\">Two Minute Papers</a>\u00a0always says)</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I\u2019m not using any rigorous definition of \u201cmind-blowing\u201d or \u201cbreakthrough\u201d; it\u2019s a casual list.. and I might use less rigorous terminology to make this post more accessible</p>\n<h3>Amazingly accurate estimates from seemingly unusable information</h3>\n<h4>Through-wall human pose estimation</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"http://rfpose.csail.mit.edu/\" href=\"http://rfpose.csail.mit.edu/\">Website/video by MIT researchers, 2018</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*uqi7O3ByIKTsf6Ps.png\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>We can accurately estimate how a human on the other side of a wall is standing/sitting/walking just from perturbations in Wifi signals caused by that human.</p>\n<h4>Gauging materials\u2019 physical properties from\u00a0video</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2015/visual-microphone-identifies-structural-defects-0521\" href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2015/visual-microphone-identifies-structural-defects-0521\">Article/video by MIT researchers, 2015</a></p>\n<p>The researchers first\u00a0<a data-href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804\" href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804\">demonstrated in 2014\u00a0</a>that they can e.g. reproduce human speech from video (with no audio) of a potato chip bag based on the vibrations. This part was done without machine learning. In 2015, they used machine learning to show that you can estimate the stiffness, elasticity, weight per unit area, etc. of materials just from a video (in some cases just the vibrations caused by the ordinary circulation of air was sufficient).</p>\n<h4>Estimating keystrokes from a smartphone next to the\u00a0keyboard</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2015/papers/p142-liuA.pdf\" href=\"https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2015/papers/p142-liuA.pdf\">Paper, 2015</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*O9Kq4tclO75FZLiZVMkdDg.png\" width=\"70%\"/></p>\n<p>Researchers showed that with the audio recorded by a single, off-the-shelf smartphone placed next to a keyboard, one can estimate with\u00a0<strong>94% accuracy</strong>\u00a0the individual keystrokes. Unlike previous approaches that used supervised deep learning with many microphones placed around the keyboard, this paper actually uses a relatively simple machine learning technique (K-means clustering) and\u00a0<strong>unsupervised</strong>\u00a0learning.</p>\n<h3>Generative models</h3>\n<h4>Realistic face generation, style-mixing, and interpolation</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948\">Paper</a>/<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA\">video</a>\u00a0by NVIDIA researchers, 2018</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*eeFaGLx96mlbQcrK.gif\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>The researchers combined a new architecture with tons of GPUs to create extremely photo-realistic artificial faces that are interpolations between other faces or applications of the \u201cstyle\u201d of one face to another face. The work builds upon past work on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs were invented in 2014 and have seen an explosion in research since then. The most basic concept of GANs is two neural networks dueling against each other (e.g. one that classifies images as \u201creal\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d and a second neural network that generates images in a way that attempts to \u201ctrick\u201d the first neural network into wrongly classifying fake images as real\u2026hence the second neural network is an \u201cadversary\u201d to the first).</p>\n<p>In general, there is a lot of\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-adversarial-machine-learning\" href=\"https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-adversarial-machine-learning\">awesome research</a>\u00a0about adversarial machine learning, which has been around for more than a decade. There are many creepy implications for cybersecurity etc. But I digress.</p>\n<h4>Teaching machines to\u00a0draw</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/teaching-machines-to-draw.html\" href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/teaching-machines-to-draw.html\">Blog post by Google Brain, 2017</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*m_S6mdQhp1Xz8G7V.png\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>Interpolation between 2\u00a0drawings</p>\n<p>My acquaintance\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://twitter.com/hardmaru\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hardmaru\">David Ha at Google Brain</a>\u00a0used a generative recurrent neural network (RNN) to make drawings that are vector-based graphics (I think of this as Adobe Illustrator except automated).</p>\n<h4>Transferring great dance moves to poor\u00a0dancers</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://carolineec.github.io/everybody_dance_now/\" href=\"https://carolineec.github.io/everybody_dance_now/\">Website</a>/<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCBTZh41Ris\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCBTZh41Ris\">video</a>\u00a0from UC Berkeley researchers, 2018</p>\n<p>Think \u201cAuto-Tune for dancing.\u201d Using pose estimation and generative adversarial training, the researchers were able to make a fake video of any real person (the \u201ctarget\u201d person) dancing with great dance skills. The required input was only:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a short video of someone with great dance skills dancing</li>\n<li>a few minutes of video of the target person dancing (typically poorly since most people suck at dancing)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also saw Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, show a video (made with this technique) of himself dancing like Michael Jackson. I\u2019m glad I attended the GPU Tech Conference, haha.</p>\n<h3>Reinforcement learning</h3>\n<h4>World models\u200a\u2014\u200aAI learning inside its own\u00a0dream</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://worldmodels.github.io/\" href=\"https://worldmodels.github.io/\">Website by Google Brain, 2018</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*t6x7EEUGlErd8nLb.jpeg\" width=\"70%\"/></p>\n<p>Humans do not actually know or think about all the details of the world we live in. We behave based on the abstraction of the world that is in our heads. For example, if I ride on a bike, I don\u2019t think of the gears/nuts/bolts of the bike; I just have a rough sense of where the wheels, seat, and handle are and how to interact with them. Why not use a similar approach for AI?</p>\n<p>This \u201cworld models\u201d approach (again, created by David Ha et al) allows the \u201cagent\u201d (e.g. an AI that controls a car in a racing game) to create a generative model of the world/environment around it which is a simplification/abstraction of the actual environment. So, you can think of the world model as a dream that lives in the head of the AI. Then the AI can train via reinforcement learning in this \u201cdream\u201d to achieve better performance. So this approach is actually combining generative ML with reinforcement learning. By doing this, the researchers were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain video game-playing tasks.</p>\n<p>[Update 2019/2/15] Building upon the above \u201cworld models\u201d approach, Google just revealed\u00a0<a data-href=\"http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-planet-deep-planning.html\" href=\"http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-planet-deep-planning.html\">PlaNet: Deep Planning Network for Reinforcement Learning</a>, which achieved 5000% better data efficiency than previous approaches.</p>\n<h4>AlphaStar\u200a\u2014\u200aStarcraft II AI that beats the top pro\u00a0players</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/\" href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/\">Blog post</a>,\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTMhmVh1qs\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTMhmVh1qs\">e-sports-ish video</a>\u00a0by DeepMind (Google), 2019</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve come a long way from the\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol\">historic Go matches between Lee Sedol and DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo</a>\u00a0that rocked the world, which was a mere 3 years ago in 2016 (check out the\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://www.netflix.com/jp-en/title/80190844\" href=\"https://www.netflix.com/jp-en/title/80190844\">NetFlix documentary</a>, which made some people cry). Then, it was even more amazing that AlphaZero in 2017 became better than AlphaGo at Go (and better than any other algorithm at chess, shogi AKA Japanese chess, etc.) despite not using any training data from human matches. But AlphaStar in 2019 is even\u00a0<strong>more</strong>\u00a0amazing.</p>\n<p>Being a StarCraft fan myself since 1998, I can appreciate how the \u201c\u2026need to balance short and long-term goals and adapt to unexpected situations\u2026 poses a huge challenge.\u201d It\u2019s truly a difficult and complex game which requires understanding at multiple levels to play well. Research on Starcraft-playing algorithms have been ongoing since 2009.</p>\n<p>AlphaStar essentially used a combination of supervised learning (from human matches) and reinforcement learning (playing against itself) to achieve its results.</p>\n<h3>Humans training\u00a0robots</h3>\n<h4>Teaching tasks to machines with a single human demonstration</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://news.developer.nvidia.com/new-ai-technique-helps-robots-work-alongside-humans/\" href=\"https://news.developer.nvidia.com/new-ai-technique-helps-robots-work-alongside-humans/\">Article</a>/<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=B7ZT5oSnRys\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=B7ZT5oSnRys\">video</a>\u00a0by NVIDIA researchers, 2018</p>\n<p>I can think of 3 typical approaches to teaching robots to do something, but all take a lot of time/labor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manually program the robot\u2019s joint rotations etc. for each situation</li>\n<li>Let the robot try the task many, many times (reinforcement learning)</li>\n<li>Demonstrate a task to the robot many, many times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically, one major criticism of deep learning is that it\u2019s very costly to produce the millions of examples (data) that make the computer perform well. But increasingly, there are ways to not rely on such costly data.</p>\n<p>The researchers figured out a way for a robot arm to successfully perform a task (such as \u201cpick up the blocks and stack them so that they are in the order: red block, blue block, orange block\u201d) based on a\u00a0<strong>single\u00a0</strong>video of a\u00a0<strong>single\u00a0</strong>human demonstration (a physical real human hand moving the blocks), even if the video was shot from a different angle. The algorithm actually generates a human-readable description of the task it plans to do, which is great for troubleshooting. The algorithm relies on object detection with pose estimation, synthetic training data generation, and simulation-to-reality transfer.</p>\n<h3>Unsupervised machine translation</h3>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://code.fb.com/ai-research/unsupervised-machine-translation-a-novel-approach-to-provide-fast-accurate-translations-for-more-languages/\" href=\"https://code.fb.com/ai-research/unsupervised-machine-translation-a-novel-approach-to-provide-fast-accurate-translations-for-more-languages/\">Blog post by Facebook AI Research, 2018</a></p>\n<p>Typically, you would need a huge training dataset of translated documents (e.g. professional translations of United Nations proceedings) to do machine translation well (i.e.\u00a0<strong>supervised</strong>\u00a0learning). Of course, many topics and language pairs don\u2019t have high-quality, plentiful training data. In this paper, researchers showed that it\u2019s possible to use\u00a0<strong>unsupervised</strong>\u00a0learning (i.e. using no translation data and just using unrelated corpuses of text in each language), it\u2019s possible to reach the translation quality of state-of-the-art\u00a0<strong>supervised</strong>\u00a0learning approaches. Wow.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that, in any language, certain words/concepts will tend to appear in close proximity (e.g. \u201cfurry\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d). They describe this as \u201cembeddings of words in different languages share similar neighborhood structure.\u201d I mean, OK, I get the idea, but it\u2019s still mind-blowing that using this approach they can reach such high translation quality without training on translation datasets.</p>\n<h3>Closing</h3>\n<p>I hope this post made you more excited about developments in ML/AI, if you weren\u2019t already. Maybe I\u2019ll write another similar post in a year from now.

SmartNews</b>.</p>\n<p>Compared to other fields, machine learning / artificial intelligence seems to have a much higher frequency of super-interesting developments these days. Things that make you say \u201cwow\u201d or even \u201cwhat a time to be alive!\u201d (as the creator of\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg\">Two Minute Papers</a>\u00a0always says)</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I\u2019m not using any rigorous definition of \u201cmind-blowing\u201d or \u201cbreakthrough\u201d; it\u2019s a casual list.. and I might use less rigorous terminology to make this post more accessible</p>\n<h3>Amazingly accurate estimates from seemingly unusable information</h3>\n<h4>Through-wall human pose estimation</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"http://rfpose.csail.mit.edu/\" href=\"http://rfpose.csail.mit.edu/\">Website/video by MIT researchers, 2018</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*uqi7O3ByIKTsf6Ps.png\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>We can accurately estimate how a human on the other side of a wall is standing/sitting/walking just from perturbations in Wifi signals caused by that human.</p>\n<h4>Gauging materials\u2019 physical properties from\u00a0video</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2015/visual-microphone-identifies-structural-defects-0521\" href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2015/visual-microphone-identifies-structural-defects-0521\">Article/video by MIT researchers, 2015</a></p>\n<p>The researchers first\u00a0<a data-href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804\" href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804\">demonstrated in 2014\u00a0</a>that they can e.g. reproduce human speech from video (with no audio) of a potato chip bag based on the vibrations. This part was done without machine learning. In 2015, they used machine learning to show that you can estimate the stiffness, elasticity, weight per unit area, etc. of materials just from a video (in some cases just the vibrations caused by the ordinary circulation of air was sufficient).</p>\n<h4>Estimating keystrokes from a smartphone next to the\u00a0keyboard</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2015/papers/p142-liuA.pdf\" href=\"https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2015/papers/p142-liuA.pdf\">Paper, 2015</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*O9Kq4tclO75FZLiZVMkdDg.png\" width=\"70%\"/></p>\n<p>Researchers showed that with the audio recorded by a single, off-the-shelf smartphone placed next to a keyboard, one can estimate with\u00a0<strong>94% accuracy</strong>\u00a0the individual keystrokes. Unlike previous approaches that used supervised deep learning with many microphones placed around the keyboard, this paper actually uses a relatively simple machine learning technique (K-means clustering) and\u00a0<strong>unsupervised</strong>\u00a0learning.</p>\n<h3>Generative models</h3>\n<h4>Realistic face generation, style-mixing, and interpolation</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948\">Paper</a>/<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA\">video</a>\u00a0by NVIDIA researchers, 2018</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*eeFaGLx96mlbQcrK.gif\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>The researchers combined a new architecture with tons of GPUs to create extremely photo-realistic artificial faces that are interpolations between other faces or applications of the \u201cstyle\u201d of one face to another face. The work builds upon past work on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs were invented in 2014 and have seen an explosion in research since then. The most basic concept of GANs is two neural networks dueling against each other (e.g. one that classifies images as \u201creal\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d and a second neural network that generates images in a way that attempts to \u201ctrick\u201d the first neural network into wrongly classifying fake images as real\u2026hence the second neural network is an \u201cadversary\u201d to the first).</p>\n<p>In general, there is a lot of\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-adversarial-machine-learning\" href=\"https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-adversarial-machine-learning\">awesome research</a>\u00a0about adversarial machine learning, which has been around for more than a decade. There are many creepy implications for cybersecurity etc. But I digress.</p>\n<h4>Teaching machines to\u00a0draw</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/teaching-machines-to-draw.html\" href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/teaching-machines-to-draw.html\">Blog post by Google Brain, 2017</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*m_S6mdQhp1Xz8G7V.png\" width=\"100%\"/></p>\n<p>Interpolation between 2\u00a0drawings</p>\n<p>My acquaintance\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://twitter.com/hardmaru\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hardmaru\">David Ha at Google Brain</a>\u00a0used a generative recurrent neural network (RNN) to make drawings that are vector-based graphics (I think of this as Adobe Illustrator except automated).</p>\n<h4>Transferring great dance moves to poor\u00a0dancers</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://carolineec.github.io/everybody_dance_now/\" href=\"https://carolineec.github.io/everybody_dance_now/\">Website</a>/<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCBTZh41Ris\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCBTZh41Ris\">video</a>\u00a0from UC Berkeley researchers, 2018</p>\n<p>Think \u201cAuto-Tune for dancing.\u201d Using pose estimation and generative adversarial training, the researchers were able to make a fake video of any real person (the \u201ctarget\u201d person) dancing with great dance skills. The required input was only:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a short video of someone with great dance skills dancing</li>\n<li>a few minutes of video of the target person dancing (typically poorly since most people suck at dancing)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also saw Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, show a video (made with this technique) of himself dancing like Michael Jackson. I\u2019m glad I attended the GPU Tech Conference, haha.</p>\n<h3>Reinforcement learning</h3>\n<h4>World models\u200a\u2014\u200aAI learning inside its own\u00a0dream</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://worldmodels.github.io/\" href=\"https://worldmodels.github.io/\">Website by Google Brain, 2018</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*t6x7EEUGlErd8nLb.jpeg\" width=\"70%\"/></p>\n<p>Humans do not actually know or think about all the details of the world we live in. We behave based on the abstraction of the world that is in our heads. For example, if I ride on a bike, I don\u2019t think of the gears/nuts/bolts of the bike; I just have a rough sense of where the wheels, seat, and handle are and how to interact with them. Why not use a similar approach for AI?</p>\n<p>This \u201cworld models\u201d approach (again, created by David Ha et al) allows the \u201cagent\u201d (e.g. an AI that controls a car in a racing game) to create a generative model of the world/environment around it which is a simplification/abstraction of the actual environment. So, you can think of the world model as a dream that lives in the head of the AI. Then the AI can train via reinforcement learning in this \u201cdream\u201d to achieve better performance. So this approach is actually combining generative ML with reinforcement learning. By doing this, the researchers were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain video game-playing tasks.</p>\n<p>[Update 2019/2/15] Building upon the above \u201cworld models\u201d approach, Google just revealed\u00a0<a data-href=\"http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-planet-deep-planning.html\" href=\"http://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-planet-deep-planning.html\">PlaNet: Deep Planning Network for Reinforcement Learning</a>, which achieved 5000% better data efficiency than previous approaches.</p>\n<h4>AlphaStar\u200a\u2014\u200aStarcraft II AI that beats the top pro\u00a0players</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/\" href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/\">Blog post</a>,\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTMhmVh1qs\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTMhmVh1qs\">e-sports-ish video</a>\u00a0by DeepMind (Google), 2019</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve come a long way from the\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol\">historic Go matches between Lee Sedol and DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo</a>\u00a0that rocked the world, which was a mere 3 years ago in 2016 (check out the\u00a0<a data-href=\"https://www.netflix.com/jp-en/title/80190844\" href=\"https://www.netflix.com/jp-en/title/80190844\">NetFlix documentary</a>, which made some people cry). Then, it was even more amazing that AlphaZero in 2017 became better than AlphaGo at Go (and better than any other algorithm at chess, shogi AKA Japanese chess, etc.) despite not using any training data from human matches. But AlphaStar in 2019 is even\u00a0<strong>more</strong>\u00a0amazing.</p>\n<p>Being a StarCraft fan myself since 1998, I can appreciate how the \u201c\u2026need to balance short and long-term goals and adapt to unexpected situations\u2026 poses a huge challenge.\u201d It\u2019s truly a difficult and complex game which requires understanding at multiple levels to play well. Research on Starcraft-playing algorithms have been ongoing since 2009.</p>\n<p>AlphaStar essentially used a combination of supervised learning (from human matches) and reinforcement learning (playing against itself) to achieve its results.</p>\n<h3>Humans training\u00a0robots</h3>\n<h4>Teaching tasks to machines with a single human demonstration</h4>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://news.developer.nvidia.com/new-ai-technique-helps-robots-work-alongside-humans/\" href=\"https://news.developer.nvidia.com/new-ai-technique-helps-robots-work-alongside-humans/\">Article</a>/<a data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=B7ZT5oSnRys\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=B7ZT5oSnRys\">video</a>\u00a0by NVIDIA researchers, 2018</p>\n<p>I can think of 3 typical approaches to teaching robots to do something, but all take a lot of time/labor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manually program the robot\u2019s joint rotations etc. for each situation</li>\n<li>Let the robot try the task many, many times (reinforcement learning)</li>\n<li>Demonstrate a task to the robot many, many times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically, one major criticism of deep learning is that it\u2019s very costly to produce the millions of examples (data) that make the computer perform well. But increasingly, there are ways to not rely on such costly data.</p>\n<p>The researchers figured out a way for a robot arm to successfully perform a task (such as \u201cpick up the blocks and stack them so that they are in the order: red block, blue block, orange block\u201d) based on a\u00a0<strong>single\u00a0</strong>video of a\u00a0<strong>single\u00a0</strong>human demonstration (a physical real human hand moving the blocks), even if the video was shot from a different angle. The algorithm actually generates a human-readable description of the task it plans to do, which is great for troubleshooting. The algorithm relies on object detection with pose estimation, synthetic training data generation, and simulation-to-reality transfer.</p>\n<h3>Unsupervised machine translation</h3>\n<p><a data-href=\"https://code.fb.com/ai-research/unsupervised-machine-translation-a-novel-approach-to-provide-fast-accurate-translations-for-more-languages/\" href=\"https://code.fb.com/ai-research/unsupervised-machine-translation-a-novel-approach-to-provide-fast-accurate-translations-for-more-languages/\">Blog post by Facebook AI Research, 2018</a></p>\n<p>Typically, you would need a huge training dataset of translated documents (e.g. professional translations of United Nations proceedings) to do machine translation well (i.e.\u00a0<strong>supervised</strong>\u00a0learning). Of course, many topics and language pairs don\u2019t have high-quality, plentiful training data. In this paper, researchers showed that it\u2019s possible to use\u00a0<strong>unsupervised</strong>\u00a0learning (i.e. using no translation data and just using unrelated corpuses of text in each language), it\u2019s possible to reach the translation quality of state-of-the-art\u00a0<strong>supervised</strong>\u00a0learning approaches. Wow.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that, in any language, certain words/concepts will tend to appear in close proximity (e.g. \u201cfurry\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d). They describe this as \u201cembeddings of words in different languages share similar neighborhood structure.\u201d I mean, OK, I get the idea, but it\u2019s still mind-blowing that using this approach they can reach such high translation quality without training on translation datasets.</p>\n<h3>Closing</h3>\n<p>I hope this post made you more excited about developments in ML/AI, if you weren\u2019t already. Maybe I\u2019ll write another similar post in a year from now.

Chi  , Data Science Manager at SmartNews  .  \n Compared to other fields, machine learning / artificial intelligence seems to have a much higher frequency of super-interesting developments these days. Things that make you say \u201cwow\u201d or even \u201cwhat a time to be alive!\u201d (as the creator of\u00a0 Two Minute Papers  \u00a0always says)  \n Disclaimer: I\u2019m not using any rigorous definition of \u201cmind-blowing\u201d or \u201cbreakthrough\u201d; it\u2019s a casual list.. and I might use less rigorous terminology to make this post more accessible  \n Amazingly accurate estimates from seemingly unusable information  \n Through-wall human pose estimation  \n Website/video by MIT researchers, 2018   \n   \n We can accurately estimate how a human on the other side of a wall is standing/sitting/walking just from perturbations in Wifi signals caused by that human.  \n Gauging materials\u2019 physical properties from\u00a0video  \n Article/video by MIT researchers, 2015   \n The researchers first\u00a0 demonstrated in 2014\u00a0  that they can e.g. reproduce human speech from video (with no audio) of a potato chip bag based on the vibrations. This part was done without machine learning. In 2015, they used machine learning to show that you can estimate the stiffness, elasticity, weight per unit area, etc. of materials just from a video (in some cases just the vibrations caused by the ordinary circulation of air was sufficient).  \n Estimating keystrokes from a smartphone next to the\u00a0keyboard  \n Paper, 2015   \n   \n Researchers showed that with the audio recorded by a single, off-the-shelf smartphone placed next to a keyboard, one can estimate with\u00a0 94% accuracy  \u00a0the individual keystrokes. Unlike previous approaches that used supervised deep learning with many microphones placed around the keyboard, this paper actually uses a relatively simple machine learning technique (K-means clustering) and\u00a0 unsupervised  \u00a0learning.  \n Generative models  \n Realistic face generation, style-mixing, and interpolation  \n Paper  / video  \u00a0by NVIDIA researchers, 2018  \n   \n The researchers combined a new architecture with tons of GPUs to create extremely photo-realistic artificial faces that are interpolations between other faces or applications of the \u201cstyle\u201d of one face to another face. The work builds upon past work on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs were invented in 2014 and have seen an explosion in research since then. The most basic concept of GANs is two neural networks dueling against each other (e.g. one that classifies images as \u201creal\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d and a second neural network that generates images in a way that attempts to \u201ctrick\u201d the first neural network into wrongly classifying fake images as real\u2026hence the second neural network is an \u201cadversary\u201d to the first).  \n In general, there is a lot of\u00a0 awesome research  \u00a0about adversarial machine learning, which has been around for more than a decade. There are many creepy implications for cybersecurity etc. But I digress.  \n Teaching machines to\u00a0draw  \n Blog post by Google Brain, 2017   \n   \n Interpolation between 2\u00a0drawings  \n My acquaintance\u00a0 David Ha at Google Brain  \u00a0used a generative recurrent neural network (RNN) to make drawings that are vector-based graphics (I think of this as Adobe Illustrator except automated).  \n Transferring great dance moves to poor\u00a0dancers  \n Website  / video  \u00a0from UC Berkeley researchers, 2018  \n Think \u201cAuto-Tune for dancing.\u201d Using pose estimation and generative adversarial training, the researchers were able to make a fake video of any real person (the \u201ctarget\u201d person) dancing with great dance skills. The required input was only:  \n \n a short video of someone with great dance skills dancing  \n a few minutes of video of the target person dancing (typically poorly since most people suck at dancing)  \n  \n I also saw Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, show a video (made with this technique) of himself dancing like Michael Jackson. I\u2019m glad I attended the GPU Tech Conference, haha.  \n Reinforcement learning  \n World models\u200a\u2014\u200aAI learning inside its own\u00a0dream  \n Website by Google Brain, 2018   \n   \n Humans do not actually know or think about all the details of the world we live in. We behave based on the abstraction of the world that is in our heads. For example, if I ride on a bike, I don\u2019t think of the gears/nuts/bolts of the bike; I just have a rough sense of where the wheels, seat, and handle are and how to interact with them. Why not use a similar approach for AI?  \n This \u201cworld models\u201d approach (again, created by David Ha et al) allows the \u201cagent\u201d (e.g. an AI that controls a car in a racing game) to create a generative model of the world/environment around it which is a simplification/abstraction of the actual environment. So, you can think of the world model as a dream that lives in the head of the AI. Then the AI can train via reinforcement learning in this \u201cdream\u201d to achieve better performance. So this approach is actually combining generative ML with reinforcement learning. By doing this, the researchers were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain video game-playing tasks.  \n [Update 2019/2/15] Building upon the above \u201cworld models\u201d approach, Google just revealed\u00a0 PlaNet: Deep Planning Network for Reinforcement Learning  , which achieved 5000% better data efficiency than previous approaches.  \n AlphaStar\u200a\u2014\u200aStarcraft II AI that beats the top pro\u00a0players  \n Blog post  ,\u00a0 e-sports-ish video  \u00a0by DeepMind (Google), 2019  \n We\u2019ve come a long way from the\u00a0 historic Go matches between Lee Sedol and DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo  \u00a0that rocked the world, which was a mere 3 years ago in 2016 (check out the\u00a0 NetFlix documentary  , which made some people cry). Then, it was even more amazing that AlphaZero in 2017 became better than AlphaGo at Go (and better than any other algorithm at chess, shogi AKA Japanese chess, etc.) despite not using any training data from human matches. But AlphaStar in 2019 is even\u00a0 more  \u00a0amazing.  \n Being a StarCraft fan myself since 1998, I can appreciate how the \u201c\u2026need to balance short and long-term goals and adapt to unexpected situations\u2026 poses a huge challenge.\u201d It\u2019s truly a difficult and complex game which requires understanding at multiple levels to play well. Research on Starcraft-playing algorithms have been ongoing since 2009.  \n AlphaStar essentially used a combination of supervised learning (from human matches) and reinforcement learning (playing against itself) to achieve its results.  \n Humans training\u00a0robots  \n Teaching tasks to machines with a single human demonstration  \n Article  / video  \u00a0by NVIDIA researchers, 2018  \n I can think of 3 typical approaches to teaching robots to do something, but all take a lot of time/labor:  \n \n Manually program the robot\u2019s joint rotations etc. for each situation  \n Let the robot try the task many, many times (reinforcement learning)  \n Demonstrate a task to the robot many, many times  \n  \n Typically, one major criticism of deep learning is that it\u2019s very costly to produce the millions of examples (data) that make the computer perform well. But increasingly, there are ways to not rely on such costly data.  \n The researchers figured out a way for a robot arm to successfully perform a task (such as \u201cpick up the blocks and stack them so that they are in the order: red block, blue block, orange block\u201d) based on a\u00a0 single\u00a0  video of a\u00a0 single\u00a0  human demonstration (a physical real human hand moving the blocks), even if the video was shot from a different angle. The algorithm actually generates a human-readable description of the task it plans to do, which is great for troubleshooting. The algorithm relies on object detection with pose estimation, synthetic training data generation, and simulation-to-reality transfer.  \n Unsupervised machine translation  \n Blog post by Facebook AI Research, 2018   \n Typically, you would need a huge training dataset of translated documents (e.g. professional translations of United Nations proceedings) to do machine translation well (i.e.\u00a0 supervised  \u00a0learning). Of course, many topics and language pairs don\u2019t have high-quality, plentiful training data. In this paper, researchers showed that it\u2019s possible to use\u00a0 unsupervised  \u00a0learning (i.e. using no translation data and just using unrelated corpuses of text in each language), it\u2019s possible to reach the translation quality of state-of-the-art\u00a0 supervised  \u00a0learning approaches. Wow.  \n The basic idea is that, in any language, certain words/concepts will tend to appear in close proximity (e.g. \u201cfurry\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d). They describe this as \u201cembeddings of words in different languages share similar neighborhood structure.\u201d I mean, OK, I get the idea, but it\u2019s still mind-blowing that using this approach they can reach such high translation quality without training on translation datasets.  \n Closing  \n I hope this post made you more excited about developments in ML/AI, if you weren\u2019t already. Maybe I\u2019ll write another similar post in a year from now.

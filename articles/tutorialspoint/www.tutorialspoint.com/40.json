Computers can be protected from viruses if the operator utilizes good virus prevention software and keeps the virus definitions up to date. Most viruses are not programmed to spread themselves. They have to be sent to another computer by e-mail, sharing, or applications.The worm is an exception, because it is programmed to replicate itself by sending copies to other computers listed in the e-mail address book in the computer. There are many kinds of viruses, for example:</p>\n<ul class=\"list\">\n<li><p>Boot viruses place some of their code in the start-up disk sector to automatically execute when booting. Therefore, when an infected machine boots, the virus loads and runs.</p></li>\n<li><p>File viruses attached to program files (files with the extension .exe). When you run the infected program, the virus code executes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Macro viruses copy their macros to templates and/or other application document files.</p></li>\n<li><p>Trojan Horse is a malicious, security-breaking program that is disguised as something being such as a screen saver or game.</p></li>\n<li><p>Worm launches an application that destroys information on your hard drive. It also sends a copy of the virus to everyone in the computer's e-mail address book.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a id=\"wa\" name=\"wa\"></a>WAV</h2>\n<p>A sound format (pronounced wave) used to reproduce sounds on a computer.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"we\" name=\"we\"></a>Webcam</h2>\n<p>A video camera/computer setup that takes live images and sends them to a Web browser.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"wi\" name=\"wi\"></a>Window</h2>\n<p>A portion of a computer display used in a graphical interface that enables users to select commands by pointing to illustrations or symbols with a mouse. \"Windows\" is also the name Microsoft adopted for its popular operating system.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"wow\" name=\"wow\"></a>World Wide Web (\"WWW\" or \"the Web\")</h2>\n<p>A network of servers on the Internet that use hypertext-linked databases and files. It was developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, and is now the primary platform of the Internet. The feature that distinguishes the Web from other Internet applications is its ability to display graphics in addition to text.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"wop\" name=\"wop\"></a>Word processor</h2>\n<p>A computer system or program for setting, editing, revising, correcting, storing, and printing text.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"wo\" name=\"wo\"></a>Worm</h2>\n<p>See <a href=\"/computer_glossary/index.htm#vi\">virus</a>.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"wy\" name=\"wy\"></a>WYSIWYG</h2>\n<p>What You See Is What You Get.

web page.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"pre-btn\">\n<a href=\"/index.htm\"><i class=\"icon icon-arrow-circle-o-left big-font\"></i> Previous Page</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"print-btn\">\n<a

The three-year-old company recently announced it raised <strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/softbanks-next-bet-940m-into-autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro/\">$940 million in financing</a></strong> from the SoftBank Vision Fund.</p> <p>Harris, during his typical gumshoeing, uncovers what Nuro might do with all that capital. It\u2019s more than just \u201cscaling up\u201d and \u201chiring talent\u201d \u2014 the go-to declarations from startups flush with venture funding. No, Nuro\u2019s founders have some grand ideas, from automated kitchens and autonomous latte delivery to smaller robots that can cross lawns or climb stairs to drop off packages.

Absolutely nothing. Except they\u2019re both worth highlighting this week.</p> <p>First up is an article by TechCrunch\u2019s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/devin-coldewey/\"><strong>Devin Coldewey</strong></a> on a company called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/gates-backed-lumotive-upends-lidar-conventions-using-metamaterials/\"><strong>Lumotive that has backing from Bill Gates and</strong> <strong>Intellectual Ventures</strong></a>. The names <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"bill-gates\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/bill-gates\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Gates <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Intellectual Ventures aren\u2019t the most interesting components of the story. Nope, it\u2019s metamaterials.</p> <p>Let us explain. Most autonomous vehicles, robots and drones use lidar (or light detection and ranging radar) to sense their surroundings. Lidar basically works by bouncing light off the environment and measuring how and when it returns; in short, lidar helps create a 3D map of the world. (Here\u2019s a complete primer on <strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/\">WTF is lidar</a></strong>).</p> <p>However, there are limitations to lidar sensors, which rely on mechanical platforms to move the laser emitter or mirror. That\u2019s where metamaterials come in. In simple terms, metamaterials are specially engineered surfaces that have embedded microscopic structures and work as a single device. Metamaterials remove the mechanical piece of the problem, and allow lidar to scan when and where it wants within its field of view.</p> <p>Metamaterials deliver the whole package: they\u2019re durable and compact, solve problems with existing lidar systems and are not prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>If they\u2019re so great why isn\u2019t everyone using them? For one, it\u2019s a new and emerging technology. Lumotive\u2019s product is just a prototype. And <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"intellectual-ventures\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/intellectual-ventures\" target=\"_blank\">Intellectual Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> (IV) holds the patents for known techniques, Coldewey recently explained to me. IV is granting Lumotive an exclusive license to the tech \u2014 something it has done with other metamaterial-based startups it has spun out.</p> <p>Automakers are rolling out increasingly robust advanced driver-assistance systems in production cars. These new levels of automation are creating a conflict of sorts. One on hand, features like adaptive cruise control and lane steering can make commutes less stressful and arguably safer. And yet, they also can cause overconfidence in the system and complacency among drivers. (Even Tesla CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"elon-musk\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has noted that complacency is a problem among owners using its advanced ADAS feature called Autopilot). (And yes, I wrote advanced ADAS; it sounds repetitive, but it\u2019s meant to express higher levels of automation and a term I recently encountered from two respected sources.)</p> <p>Some argue that automakers shouldn\u2019t deploy these kinds of automated features unless vehicles are equipped with driver-monitoring systems (DMS are essentially an in-car camera and accompanying software) that can ensure drivers are paying attention. Volvo is taking that a step further.</p> <p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1801355\" style=\"width: 5110px\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1801355\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1801355 size-full\" height=\"3400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5100px) 100vw, 5100px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg 5100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"5100\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1801355\">Driver Monitoring Camera in a Volvo research vehicle</p></div></p> <p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1801355\">Driver Monitoring Camera in a Volvo research vehicle</p> <p>The company announced this week that it will integrate DMS into its next-gen, SPA2-based vehicles beginning in the early 2020s and, more importantly, enable its system to take action if the driver is distracted or intoxicated. The camera and other sensors will monitor the driver and will intervene if a clearly intoxicated or distracted driver does not respond to warning signals and is risking an accident involving serious injury or death. Under this scenario, Volvo could limit the car\u2019s speed, call the Volvo on Call service on behalf of the driver or cause the vehicle to slow down and park itself on the roadside.</p> <p>Volvo\u2019s plans raise all kinds of questions, including privacy concerns and liability. The intent is to add a layer of safety. But it also adds complexity, which could compromise Volvo\u2019s mission. On Autonocast, a podcast I co-host with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"alex-roy\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/alex-roy\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Roy <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Ed Niedermeyer, we talk about Volvo\u2019s plans in our latest episode. <strong><a href=\"http://www.autonocast.com/blog/2019/3/22/136-lessons-learned-in-the-year-since-the-death-of-elaine-herzberg\">Check it out</a></strong>.</p> <p>We hear a lot.

The mostly dirt knoll, dotted with some trees and a handful of structures known out here as ramadas, was hardly remarkable. Just one other car sat in the disintegrating asphalt parking lot, the result of so many sun-baked days. A group of homeless people had set up at the picnic tables under a few of the structures, their dogs lolling nearby.</p> <p>And yet, it was here, or specifically on the gleaming road below, that something extraordinary had indeed happened. Just days before, Elaine Herzberg was crossing Mill Avenue south of Curry Road when an <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"uber\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber\" target=\"_blank\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> self-driving vehicle struck and killed her. The vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the collision, with a human test driver behind the wheel.</p> <p>I had been in the Phoenix area, a hub for testing autonomous-vehicle technology, to moderate a panel on that very subject. But the panel had been hastily canceled by organizers worried about the optics of such a discussion. And so I picked up Starsky Robotics CEO Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, who also was in town for this now-canceled panel, and we drove to the site where Herzberg died.</p> <p>I wrote at the time that \u201c<span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">March 18 changed everything</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u2014and nothing\u2014in the frenzied and nascent world of autonomous vehicles.\u201d One year later, those words are still correct. The incident dumped a bucket of ice water over the figurative heads of autonomous-vehicle developers. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Everyone it seemed, had sobered up. Testing was paused, dozens of companies assessed their own safety protocols. Earnest blogs were written. Lawsuits were filed.</span></p> <p>And yet, the cogs on the AV machine haven\u2019t stopped turning. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Innovation can sometimes \u201cmake the world a better place.\u201d But it\u2019s rarely delivered in a neat little package, no strings attached.</p> <p>I\u2019m hardly the first to reflect or write about this one-year anniversary. There are many takes, some of them hot, others not so much. And there are a few insightful ones; Autonocast co-host Niedermeyer has one entitled <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/tech/27023/10-lessons-from-ubers-fatal-self-driving-car-crash\"><strong>10 Lessons From Uber\u2019s Fatal Self-Driving Car Crash</strong></a> that\u2019s worth reading.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m more interested in those lessons that haven\u2019t been learned yet.\u00a0It\u2019s partly what prompted us to launch this newsletter, a weekly post that aims to be more than a historical record or a medium to evangelize AV technology.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06px;\">Tiny but mighty micromobility</span></em></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s been said before, but we\u2019ll say it again.

The layoffs were part of Bird\u2019s annual performance review process and only affected U.S.-based employees, TechCrunch learned. Those laid off are eligible for severance, including health and medical benefits.

Take a look at the map pictured above. See the red line? That\u2019s Interstate 15 in southern California.

Interstate 15 and the heavy traffic on it is putting pressure on the gene pool. In the past 15 years, at least seven cougars have crossed I-15. Just one sired 11 kittens. This lack of genetic diversity \u2014 the lowest documented for the species outside of the endangered Florida panther \u2014 could have devastating effects on mountain lions here. A study <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">published in the journal </span><strong><a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19395582\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" target=\"_blank\">Ecological Applications</a></strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> predicts extinction probabilities of 16 percent to 28 percent over the next 50 years for these lions.</span></p> <p>In this specific case, the last natural wildlife corridor in the area \u2014 and perhaps the difference between survival and extinction \u2014\u00a0 is little Temecula Creek.</p> <p>This phenomenon is happening in other areas as well, causing communities to toy with possible solutions. One option: shuttling the lions over to the other side, a move that could cause all sorts of problems.

We love the reader feedback. Keep it coming.  Never heard of TechCrunch\u2019s Transportation Weekly?  Read the first edition here  .   As I\u2019ve written before, consider this a soft launch. Follow me on Twitter  @kirstenkorosec    to ensure you see it each week.  An email subscription is coming!   This week, we\u2019re shoving as much transportation news, tidbits and insights in here as possible in hopes that it will satiate you through the end of the month. That\u2019s right,  TechCrunch\u2019s mobility team is on vacation next week.   You can expect to learn about metamaterials, how traffic is creating genetic peril, the rise of scooter docks in a dockless world, new details on autonomous delivery startup  Nuro     and a look back at the first self-driving car fatality.  There are OEMs in the automotive world. And here, (wait for it) there are ONMs \u2014 original news manufacturers. (Cymbal clash!) This is where investigative reporting, enterprise pieces and analysis on transportation live.      Mark Harris    is here again with an insider look into autonomous-vehicle delivery bot startup Nuro. The three-year-old company recently announced it raised  $940 million in financing    from the SoftBank Vision Fund.  Harris, during his typical gumshoeing, uncovers what Nuro might do with all that capital. It\u2019s more than just \u201cscaling up\u201d and \u201chiring talent\u201d \u2014 the go-to declarations from startups flush with venture funding. No, Nuro\u2019s founders have some grand ideas, from automated kitchens and autonomous latte delivery to smaller robots that can cross lawns or climb stairs to drop off packages. Nuro recently told the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration     that it wants to introduce up to 5,000 upgraded vehicles called the R2X over the next two years.  The company\u2019s origin story and how it\u2019s tied to  autonomous trucking startup Ike    is just as notable as its \u201cbig ideas.\u201d  Come for the autonomous lattes; stay for the story \u2026  How Nuro plans to spend Softbank\u2019s money   .  What do metamaterials and Volvo have in common? Absolutely nothing. Except they\u2019re both worth highlighting this week.  First up is an article by TechCrunch\u2019s  Devin Coldewey    on a company called  Lumotive that has backing from Bill Gates and    Intellectual Ventures   . The names  Bill Gates     and Intellectual Ventures aren\u2019t the most interesting components of the story. Nope, it\u2019s metamaterials.  Let us explain. Most autonomous vehicles, robots and drones use lidar (or light detection and ranging radar) to sense their surroundings. Lidar basically works by bouncing light off the environment and measuring how and when it returns; in short, lidar helps create a 3D map of the world. (Here\u2019s a complete primer on  WTF is lidar   ).  However, there are limitations to lidar sensors, which rely on mechanical platforms to move the laser emitter or mirror. That\u2019s where metamaterials come in. In simple terms, metamaterials are specially engineered surfaces that have embedded microscopic structures and work as a single device. Metamaterials remove the mechanical piece of the problem, and allow lidar to scan when and where it wants within its field of view.  Metamaterials deliver the whole package: they\u2019re durable and compact, solve problems with existing lidar systems and are not prohibitively expensive.  If they\u2019re so great why isn\u2019t everyone using them? For one, it\u2019s a new and emerging technology. Lumotive\u2019s product is just a prototype. And  Intellectual Ventures     (IV) holds the patents for known techniques, Coldewey recently explained to me. IV is granting Lumotive an exclusive license to the tech \u2014 something it has done with other metamaterial-based startups it has spun out.  Automakers are rolling out increasingly robust advanced driver-assistance systems in production cars. These new levels of automation are creating a conflict of sorts. One on hand, features like adaptive cruise control and lane steering can make commutes less stressful and arguably safer. And yet, they also can cause overconfidence in the system and complacency among drivers. (Even Tesla CEO  Elon Musk     has noted that complacency is a problem among owners using its advanced ADAS feature called Autopilot). (And yes, I wrote advanced ADAS; it sounds repetitive, but it\u2019s meant to express higher levels of automation and a term I recently encountered from two respected sources.)  Some argue that automakers shouldn\u2019t deploy these kinds of automated features unless vehicles are equipped with driver-monitoring systems (DMS are essentially an in-car camera and accompanying software) that can ensure drivers are paying attention. Volvo is taking that a step further.    Driver Monitoring Camera in a Volvo research vehicle    Driver Monitoring Camera in a Volvo research vehicle  The company announced this week that it will integrate DMS into its next-gen, SPA2-based vehicles beginning in the early 2020s and, more importantly, enable its system to take action if the driver is distracted or intoxicated. The camera and other sensors will monitor the driver and will intervene if a clearly intoxicated or distracted driver does not respond to warning signals and is risking an accident involving serious injury or death. Under this scenario, Volvo could limit the car\u2019s speed, call the Volvo on Call service on behalf of the driver or cause the vehicle to slow down and park itself on the roadside.  Volvo\u2019s plans raise all kinds of questions, including privacy concerns and liability. The intent is to add a layer of safety. But it also adds complexity, which could compromise Volvo\u2019s mission. On Autonocast, a podcast I co-host with  Alex Roy     and Ed Niedermeyer, we talk about Volvo\u2019s plans in our latest episode.  Check it out   .  We hear a lot. But we\u2019re not selfish. Let\u2019s share.     Remember two weeks ago when we dug into  Waymo\u2019s laser bears    and wondered whether we had reached \u201cpeak\u201d lidar? (Last year, there were 28 VC deals in lidar technology valued at $650 million. The number of deals was slightly lower than in 2017, but the values jumped by nearly 34 percent.)  It doesn\u2019t look like we have. We\u2019re hearing about several funding deals in the works or recently closed, a revelation that shows investors still see opportunity in startups trying to bring the next generation of light ranging and detection sensors to market.  Spotted   \u2026. Former Zoox CEO and co-founder Tim Kentley-Klay was spotted at the Self-Racing Car event at Thunderhill Raceway near Willows, Calif., this weekend.  Got a tip or overheard something in the world of transportation? Email me or send a direct message to\u00a0 @kirstenkorosec   .  Lyft     set the terms for its highly anticipated initial public offering and announced it will kick off the  roadshow for its IPO   . That means the initial public offering will likely occur in the next two weeks. Here\u2019s the  S-1 that Lyft    filed in early March. This latest announcement also revealed new details, including that its ticker symbol will be\u00a0 \u201cLYFT\u201d \u2014 as one might expect \u2014 and that the IPO range is set for between $62 and $68 per share to sell 30,770,000 shares of Class A common stock. Lyft could raise up to $2.1 billion at the higher end of that range, or $1.9 billion at the lower end.  The Lyft news was big \u2014 and it\u2019s a story we\u2019ll be following for awhile. However, we wanted to highlight another one of  Ingrid Lunden\u2019s     articles because it underscores a point I\u2019ve been pushing for awhile: not every important move in the world of autonomous vehicles occurs in the big three of Detroit, Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley.     This week,\u00a0 Yandex   , the Russian search giant that has been working on self-driving car technology,  inked a partnership    with Hyundai to develop software and hardware for autonomous car systems. This is Yandex\u2019s first partnership with an OEM. But it\u2019s not Hyundai\u2019s first collaboration with an autonomous-vehicle startup. (Hyundai has a partnership with Aurora, too.)  Yandex     will work with Hyundai Mobis, the car giant\u2019s OEM parts and service division, \u201cto create a self-driving platform that can be used by any car manufacturer or taxi fleet\u201d that will cover both a prototype as well as parts for other car makers.  Other deals  :     One year ago, I parked on a small rise overlooking Mill Avenue in Tempe, Ariz. The mostly dirt knoll, dotted with some trees and a handful of structures known out here as ramadas, was hardly remarkable. Just one other car sat in the disintegrating asphalt parking lot, the result of so many sun-baked days. A group of homeless people had set up at the picnic tables under a few of the structures, their dogs lolling nearby.  And yet, it was here, or specifically on the gleaming road below, that something extraordinary had indeed happened. Just days before, Elaine Herzberg was crossing Mill Avenue south of Curry Road when an  Uber     self-driving vehicle struck and killed her. The vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the collision, with a human test driver behind the wheel.  I had been in the Phoenix area, a hub for testing autonomous-vehicle technology, to moderate a panel on that very subject. But the panel had been hastily canceled by organizers worried about the optics of such a discussion. And so I picked up Starsky Robotics CEO Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, who also was in town for this now-canceled panel, and we drove to the site where Herzberg died.  I wrote at the time that \u201c March 18 changed everything  \u2014and nothing\u2014in the frenzied and nascent world of autonomous vehicles.\u201d One year later, those words are still correct. The incident dumped a bucket of ice water over the figurative heads of autonomous-vehicle developers.   Everyone it seemed, had sobered up. Testing was paused, dozens of companies assessed their own safety protocols. Earnest blogs were written. Lawsuits were filed.   And yet, the cogs on the AV machine haven\u2019t stopped turning. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Innovation can sometimes \u201cmake the world a better place.\u201d But it\u2019s rarely delivered in a neat little package, no strings attached.  I\u2019m hardly the first to reflect or write about this one-year anniversary. There are many takes, some of them hot, others not so much. And there are a few insightful ones; Autonocast co-host Niedermeyer has one entitled  10 Lessons From Uber\u2019s Fatal Self-Driving Car Crash    that\u2019s worth reading.  Right now, I\u2019m more interested in those lessons that haven\u2019t been learned yet.\u00a0It\u2019s partly what prompted us to launch this newsletter, a weekly post that aims to be more than a historical record or a medium to evangelize AV technology.  Tiny but mighty micromobility    It\u2019s been said before, but we\u2019ll say it again. Data is queen. This past week,   mobility management startup Passport partnered    with Charlotte, N.C., Detroit, Mich. and Omaha, Neb. and Lime to create a framework to apply parking principles, data analysis and more to the plethora of shared micromobility services.   And, in case you missed it,  Bird had to let some people go  . We\u2019ve learned a few more details since the news broke. That came out to about 40 people out of the ~900-person company. The layoffs were part of Bird\u2019s annual performance review process and only affected U.S.-based employees, TechCrunch learned. Those laid off are eligible for severance, including health and medical benefits. Despite the layoffs, Bird is actively looking to hire for more than 100 positions throughout the company.   Meanwhile, Ford-owned  Spin partnered with mobility startup Zagster    to deploy scooters in 100+ new cities and campuses by the end of this year.   \u2014  Megan Rose Dickey   Traffic affects more than people. Take a look at the map pictured above. See the red line? That\u2019s Interstate 15 in southern California. To the east are inland communities and eventually the San Bernardino National Forest and San Jacinto Mountains.  To the west are the Santa Ana Mountains and an increasingly isolated family of 20 cougars, the  Los Angeles Times reports this week   . Interstate 15 and the heavy traffic on it is putting pressure on the gene pool. In the past 15 years, at least seven cougars have crossed I-15. Just one sired 11 kittens. This lack of genetic diversity \u2014 the lowest documented for the species outside of the endangered Florida panther \u2014 could have devastating effects on mountain lions here. A study  published in the journal   Ecological Applications    predicts extinction probabilities of 16 percent to 28 percent over the next 50 years for these lions.   In this specific case, the last natural wildlife corridor in the area \u2014 and perhaps the difference between survival and extinction \u2014\u00a0 is little Temecula Creek.  This phenomenon is happening in other areas as well, causing communities to toy with possible solutions. One option: shuttling the lions over to the other side, a move that could cause all sorts of problems. In other places, such as an area near the Santa Monica Mountains, a wildlife overpass has been proposed.  Meanwhile, digital and mobile ticketing and payment company CellPoint Mobile released a report this week that examines the rising cost of acquiring new riders, mobile technology limitations and outdated procurement processes. The titillatingly named report \u2014  Challenges Facing Municipal, Regional and National Transit Agencies in the United States    \u2014 surveyed 103 ground and mass transit operators in the United States.  Some takeaways and key findings:  Other items of note:      Dockless scooters have been all the rage; now it seems that cities and scooter startups are considering whether free-floating micromobility might need to be reined in a skosh.  Lyft, which has scooters in 13 cities, recently experimented with parking racks. These parking racks or docks are designed specifically for scooters. The company set up these docking stations in Austin during SXSW and released a handy  Guide to Good Scootiquette    to encourage better and safer rider behavior.  Meanwhile, an industry around scooter management is emerging.  Swiftmile   , a startup that developed light electric vehicle charging systems for bike share, has new solar-powered charging platforms for scooters. TechCrunch met Swiftmile CEO Colin Roche in Austin earlier this month and learned that a number of cities are interested in deploying these systems. Swiftmile\u2019s system not only charges the scooters, it also can provide scooter companies with diagnostics and keep the device locked in the dock if it\u2019s malfunctioning. The docks can be programmed to lock up the scooters during certain hours \u2014 bar closing time would seem like an optimal time \u2014 to keep them from being misused. Systems like these could help scooter companies like Bird and Lime extend the life of their scooters and keep local officials happy.  ENWAY and Nanyang Technological University are deploying autonomous street sweepers in the inner city of Singapore as part of a project with\u00a0  National Environmental Agency Singapore. The project began this month and will run into September 2020.  Under the pilot, ENWAY\u2019s autonomous sweeper will clean an area of more than 12 kilometers of roads every day. The sweeper is equipped with numerous sensors, including 2D and 3D lidars, 3D cameras and GNSS. The base vehicle is a retrofitted all-electric compact road sweeper from Swiss manufacturer Bucher Municipal.  The company aims to commercialize autonomous cleaning on public ground in Singapore and abroad.  A demo of the sweeper is in the video below.     On the other end of the transportation spectrum, Silvercar by  Audi     has rolled out a delivery and pickup service in downtown locations in New York and San Francisco.  Silvercar customers can request their rental be dropped off and picked up at home or a location of their choosing for an additional fee. Silvercar also announced plans to bring its premium rental experience to Boston at Logan International Airport on April 15.   If you\u2019ve never heard of Silvercar, you\u2019re forgiven.

Also, the PAVE Coalition is hosting  its first\u00a0 public demonstration event     April 5-7 at the Cobo Center in downtown Detroit.\u00a0  The public will have an opportunity to ride in a self-driving car, and interactive displays will help visitors understand the technology behind self-driving cars and their potential benefits.   Finally, one electric vehicle thing we\u2019ve been following.  Columbus, Ohio won the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s first-ever  Smart City Challenge   and we\u2019ve been tracking the city\u2019s progress and its efforts to increase electric vehicle adoption.    One of the organizers told TechCrunch that since the beginning of 2017, the cumulative new EV registrations in the Columbus metropolitan area have increased by 121 percent. New EV registrations over this period outpaced the 82 percent expansion in the Midwest region and the 94 percent growth seen across the U.S. over the same time period.   Thanks for reading.

Absolutely nothing. Except they\u2019re both worth highlighting this week.</p>\n<p>First up is an article by TechCrunch\u2019s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/devin-coldewey/\"><strong>Devin Coldewey</strong></a> on a company called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/gates-backed-lumotive-upends-lidar-conventions-using-metamaterials/\"><strong>Lumotive that has backing from Bill Gates and</strong> <strong>Intellectual Ventures</strong></a>. The names <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"bill-gates\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/bill-gates\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Gates <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Intellectual Ventures aren\u2019t the most interesting components of the story. Nope, it\u2019s metamaterials.</p>\n<p>Let us explain. Most autonomous vehicles, robots and drones use lidar (or light detection and ranging radar) to sense their surroundings. Lidar basically works by bouncing light off the environment and measuring how and when it returns; in short, lidar helps create a 3D map of the world. (Here\u2019s a complete primer on <strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/\">WTF is lidar</a></strong>).</p>\n<p>However, there are limitations to lidar sensors, which rely on mechanical platforms to move the laser emitter or mirror. That\u2019s where metamaterials come in. In simple terms, metamaterials are specially engineered surfaces that have embedded microscopic structures and work as a single device. Metamaterials remove the mechanical piece of the problem, and allow lidar to scan when and where it wants within its field of view.</p>\n<p>Metamaterials deliver the whole package: they\u2019re durable and compact, solve problems with existing lidar systems and are not prohibitively expensive.</p>\n<p>If they\u2019re so great why isn\u2019t everyone using them? For one, it\u2019s a new and emerging technology. Lumotive\u2019s product is just a prototype. And <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"intellectual-ventures\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/intellectual-ventures\" target=\"_blank\">Intellectual Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> (IV) holds the patents for known techniques, Coldewey recently explained to me. IV is granting Lumotive an exclusive license to the tech \u2014 something it has done with other metamaterial-based startups it has spun out.</p>\n<h2>Shifting gears to Volvo</h2>\n<p>Automakers are rolling out increasingly robust advanced driver-assistance systems in production cars. These new levels of automation are creating a conflict of sorts. One on hand, features like adaptive cruise control and lane steering can make commutes less stressful and arguably safer. And yet, they also can cause overconfidence in the system and complacency among drivers. (Even Tesla CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"elon-musk\" data-type=\"person\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has noted that complacency is a problem among owners using its advanced ADAS feature called Autopilot). (And yes, I wrote advanced ADAS; it sounds repetitive, but it\u2019s meant to express higher levels of automation and a term I recently encountered from two respected sources.)</p>\n<p>Some argue that automakers shouldn\u2019t deploy these kinds of automated features unless vehicles are equipped with driver-monitoring systems (DMS are essentially an in-car camera and accompanying software) that can ensure drivers are paying attention. Volvo is taking that a step further.</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1801355\" style=\"width: 5110px\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1801355\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1801355 size-full\" height=\"3400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5100px) 100vw, 5100px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg 5100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"5100\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1801355\">Driver Monitoring Camera in a Volvo research vehicle</p></div></p>\n<p>The company announced this week that it will integrate DMS into its next-gen, SPA2-based vehicles beginning in the early 2020s and, more importantly, enable its system to take action if the driver is distracted or intoxicated. The camera and other sensors will monitor the driver and will intervene if a clearly intoxicated or distracted driver does not respond to warning signals and is risking an accident involving serious injury or death. Under this scenario, Volvo could limit the car\u2019s speed, call the Volvo on Call service on behalf of the driver or cause the vehicle to slow down and park itself on the roadside.</p>\n<p>Volvo\u2019s plans raise all kinds of questions, including privacy concerns and liability.

The mostly dirt knoll, dotted with some trees and a handful of structures known out here as ramadas, was hardly remarkable. Just one other car sat in the disintegrating asphalt parking lot, the result of so many sun-baked days. A group of homeless people had set up at the picnic tables under a few of the structures, their dogs lolling nearby.</p>\n<p>And yet, it was here, or specifically on the gleaming road below, that something extraordinary had indeed happened. Just days before, Elaine Herzberg was crossing Mill Avenue south of Curry Road when an <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"uber\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber\" target=\"_blank\">Uber <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> self-driving vehicle struck and killed her. The vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the collision, with a human test driver behind the wheel.</p>\n<p>I had been in the Phoenix area, a hub for testing autonomous-vehicle technology, to moderate a panel on that very subject. But the panel had been hastily canceled by organizers worried about the optics of such a discussion. And so I picked up Starsky Robotics CEO Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, who also was in town for this now-canceled panel, and we drove to the site where Herzberg died.</p>\n<p>I wrote at the time that \u201c<span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">March 18 changed everything</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u2014and nothing\u2014in the frenzied and nascent world of autonomous vehicles.\u201d One year later, those words are still correct.

The base vehicle is a retrofitted all-electric compact road sweeper from Swiss manufacturer Bucher Municipal.</p>\n<p>The company aims to commercialize autonomous cleaning on public ground in Singapore and abroad.</p>\n<p>A demo of the sweeper is in the video below.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dVzvH8odFIY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h2>Silvercar scales up</h2>\n<p>On the other end of the transportation spectrum, Silvercar by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"audi\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/audi\" target=\"_blank\">Audi <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has rolled out a delivery and pickup service in downtown locations in New York and San Francisco. <span class=\"s1\">Silvercar customers can request their rental be dropped off and picked up at home or a location of their choosing for an additional fee. Silvercar also announced plans to bring its premium rental experience to Boston at Logan International Airport on April 15.</span></p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never heard of Silvercar, you\u2019re forgiven. It\u2019s not exactly widespread. The company aims to remove the headache of traditional car rental. I recently tried it out in Austin during SXSW and found that it is convenient, and works pretty well, but doesn\u2019t remove some of the annoying pinch points of car rentals. Yes, there are no lines. When I got off the plane in Austin, I received a message that my car was ready and to hail my driver, who picked me up curbside, drove me to the Silvercar operation and brought me to my Audi. I used the app to unlock the vehicle.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s cool. What would be even better is skipping all those steps and being able to access the vehicle right there in the airport without interacting with anyone. (Granted, not everyone wants that.) This new delivery and pickup service in New York and San Francisco gets closer to that sweet spot.</p>\n<p><strong>Other stuff</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/optimus-ride-brings-self-driving-cars-to/\"><strong>Optimus Ride brings self-driving cars to private communities</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div>\n<hr/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>On our radar</em></h2>\n<p>New York Auto Show is coming up and I\u2019ll be in the city right before the show.

Absolutely nothing. Except they&#8217;re both worth highlighting this week.<\\/p>\\n<p>First up is an article by TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/author\\/devin-coldewey\\/\\\"><strong>Devin Coldewey<\\/strong><\\/a> on a company called <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/03\\/22\\/gates-backed-lumotive-upends-lidar-conventions-using-metamaterials\\/\\\"><strong>Lumotive that has backing from Bill Gates and<\\/strong> <strong>Intellectual Ventures<\\/strong><\\/a>.

Nope, it&#8217;s metamaterials.<\\/p>\\n<p>Let us explain. Most autonomous vehicles, robots and drones use lidar (or light detection and ranging radar) to sense their surroundings. Lidar basically works by bouncing light off the environment and measuring how and when it returns; in short, lidar helps create a 3D map of the world. (Here&#8217;s a complete primer on <strong><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2017\\/02\\/12\\/wtf-is-lidar\\/\\\">WTF is lidar<\\/a><\\/strong>).<\\/p>\\n<p>However, there are limitations to lidar sensors, which rely on mechanical platforms to move the laser emitter or mirror. That&#8217;s where metamaterials come in. In simple terms, metamaterials are specially engineered surfaces that have embedded microscopic structures and work as a single device. Metamaterials remove the mechanical piece of the problem, and allow lidar to scan when and where it wants within its field of view.<\\/p>\\n<p>Metamaterials deliver the whole package: they&#8217;re durable and compact, solve problems with existing lidar systems and are not prohibitively expensive.<\\/p>\\n<p>If they&#8217;re so great why isn&#8217;t everyone using them? For one, it&#8217;s a new and emerging technology. Lumotive&#8217;s product is just a prototype. And <a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/intellectual-ventures\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-type=\\\"organization\\\" data-entity=\\\"intellectual-ventures\\\">Intellectual Ventures <span class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> (IV) holds the patents for known techniques, Coldewey recently explained to me. IV is granting Lumotive an exclusive license to the tech \\u2014 something it has done with other metamaterial-based startups it has spun out.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Shifting gears to Volvo<\\/h2>\\n<p>Automakers are rolling out increasingly robust advanced driver-assistance systems in production cars. These new levels of automation are creating a conflict of sorts. One on hand, features like adaptive cruise control and lane steering can make commutes less stressful and arguably safer. And yet, they also can cause overconfidence in the system and complacency among drivers. (Even Tesla CEO <a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase.com\\/person\\/elon-musk\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-type=\\\"person\\\" data-entity=\\\"elon-musk\\\">Elon Musk <span class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> has noted that complacency is a problem among owners using its advanced ADAS feature called Autopilot). (And yes, I wrote advanced ADAS; it sounds repetitive, but it&#8217;s meant to express higher levels of automation and a term I recently encountered from two respected sources.)<\\/p>\\n<p>Some argue that automakers shouldn&#8217;t deploy these kinds of automated features unless vehicles are equipped with driver-monitoring systems (DMS are essentially an in-car camera and accompanying software) that can ensure drivers are paying attention. Volvo is taking that a step further.<\\/p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_1801355\\\" style=\\\"width: 5110px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-1801355\\\" class=\\\"breakout wp-image-1801355 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"5100\\\" height=\\\"3400\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg 5100w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/250104_Volvo_Cars_to_deploy_in-car_cameras_and_intervention_against_intoxication.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 5100px) 100vw, 5100px\\\" \\/><\\/a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-1801355\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Driver Monitoring Camera in a Volvo research vehicle<\\/p><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p>The company announced this week that it will integrate DMS into its next-gen, SPA2-based vehicles beginning in the early 2020s and, more importantly, enable its system to take action if the driver is distracted or intoxicated. The camera and other sensors will monitor the driver and will intervene if a clearly intoxicated or distracted driver does not respond to warning signals and is risking an accident involving serious injury or death. Under this scenario, Volvo could limit the car&#8217;s speed, call the Volvo on Call service on behalf of the driver or cause the vehicle to slow down and park itself on the roadside.<\\/p>\\n<p>Volvo&#8217;s plans raise all kinds of questions, including privacy concerns and liability.

The mostly dirt knoll, dotted with some trees and a handful of structures known out here as ramadas, was hardly remarkable. Just one other car sat in the disintegrating asphalt parking lot, the result of so many sun-baked days. A group of homeless people had set up at the picnic tables under a few of the structures, their dogs lolling nearby.<\\/p>\\n<p>And yet, it was here, or specifically on the gleaming road below, that something extraordinary had indeed happened. Just days before, Elaine Herzberg was crossing Mill Avenue south of Curry Road when an <a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/uber\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-type=\\\"organization\\\" data-entity=\\\"uber\\\">Uber <span class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> self-driving vehicle struck and killed her. The vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the collision, with a human test driver behind the wheel.<\\/p>\\n<p>I had been in the Phoenix area, a hub for testing autonomous-vehicle technology, to moderate a panel on that very subject. But the panel had been hastily canceled by organizers worried about the optics of such a discussion. And so I picked up Starsky Robotics CEO Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, who also was in town for this now-canceled panel, and we drove to the site where Herzberg died.<\\/p>\\n<p>I wrote at the time that &#8220;<span class=\\\"s1\\\" style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">March 18 changed everything<\\/span><span style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">\\u2014and nothing\\u2014in the frenzied and nascent world of autonomous vehicles.&#8221; One year later, those words are still correct.

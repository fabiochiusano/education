Our goal has to be to drive down the whole world\u2019s emissions.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Most Effective Climate Policy in the World</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can the US drive down the emissions of other countries? We can do it by making clean technologies irresistible to the entire world. And there we can take a lesson from the most effective climate policy of all time \u2013 Germany\u2019s early subsidies of solar and wind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solar panels and electricity-producing wind farms have been around for decades. Yet, for most of that time, they\u2019ve been a far more expensive way to produce electricity than burning coal or natural gas. Germany changed that. Starting in 2010, Germany\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Energiewende </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">legislation heavily subsidized solar and wind. That, in turn, drove utilities and home owners and corporations to purchase solar and wind. And that, in turn, made the technology cheaper. As prices fell, other nations \u2013 first European nations, then the US, and then China \u2013 jumped into the fray, enacting more ambitious policies that further brought down the price of solar and wind (and now batteries and electric cars). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why did subsidies bring down the price of technology? Because industry scale leads to industry learning and innovation, and that, in turn, leads to lower cost ways to manufacture, deploy, and manage new technologies. We\u2019ve seen this for a century. Almost all technologies improve via Wright\u2019s Law, often referred to as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">learning curve </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experience curve</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u00a0In the late 1930s, Theodore Paul Wright, an aeronautical engineer, observed that every doubling of production of US aircraft brought down prices by 13%. \u00a0Since then, a similar effect has been found in nearly every technology area, going back to the Ford Model T.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1783641\" height=\"484\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.24.50-AM.png\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.24.50-AM.png 2254w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.24.50-AM.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.24.50-AM.png?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.24.50-AM.png?resize=768,363 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.24.50-AM.png?resize=680,322 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.24.50-AM.png?resize=50,24 50w\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electricity from solar power, meanwhile, </span><a href=\"http://www.rapidshift.net/solar-pv-shows-a-record-learning-rate-28-5-reduction-in-cost-per-watt-for-every-doubling-of-cumulative-capacity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drops in cost by 25-30% for every doubling in scale</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The government has a vital role to play. At the same time, the incredible, unprecedented decline in cost of solar power, wind power, batteries, and electric cars has happened both because of early government R&amp;D, and because private sector companies, incentivized by governments, have brought these technologies to market and been forced to compete with one another to provide the best technology at the lowest price. Ignoring this is to ignore what brought us the very best progress we\u2019ve seen in cleaning up the way we produce energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FAQ I reference has been retracted. The Green New Deal hasn\u2019t yet become a detailed roadmap or legislation. As it does, I urge you, Green New Deal legislators and architects: Craft policies that create incentives to build and deploy clean technologies. Then use the market for what it\u2019s good at: fierce competition that delivers ever-better products at ever-lower prices.</span></p>\n<p><b style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Tackling the Hardest, Least-Solved Problems</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Green New Deal resolution is really quite comprehensive.

On average, a US car gets replaced </span><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=36914\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when it\u2019s around 10 years old</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That means that, even if electric vehicles were 100% of new sales today, it would take around 20 years for them to replace all gasoline cars. That needs to happen faster. Congress can help.</span></span>\u00a0\n<p>First, for individually owned vehicles, Congress should improve the federal electric vehicle tax credit. Today\u2019s $7,500 federal tax credit is capped at 200,000 electric vehicles per manufacturer. That\u2019s an absurdly low number in a country that has 260 million cars on the road.

Congress ought to put electric vehicles on the same footing as solar, wind, and batteries: A 30% tax credit \u2013 like the solar ITC \u2013 with no limit on the number of vehicles its applied to would be simple, clear, and consistent. For individuals buying their own vehicles, that tax credit ought to be structured so it can be taken off the purchase price of the vehicle directly, rather than waiting for tax season.</span></span>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second, the same tax credit ought to apply to fleet operators who buy or build electric vehicles to offer rides to consumers. While the pace at which consumers buy new cars is slow, the pace at which they switch <i style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">miles of transport </i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can be far faster, as they switch some of their travel to fleets like Uber, Lyft, and whatever comes after.

They have only a little impact on industry, almost </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> impact on transportation, and usually aren\u2019t applied to agriculture. If a carbon tax magically passed Congress, I\u2019d cheer, and it could be an effective way to fund some of the proposals here. It\u2019s not a silver bullet, though, and it doesn\u2019t address the hardest sectors.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Carbon Capture</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. People mean a wide variety of things when they say \u201ccarbon capture\u201d. \u00a0If we mean retrofitting coal power plants with equipment to capture their carbon emissions and store it, that\u2019s probably a waste of time. Coal is economically dead, even before adding on the cost of carbon capture. On the other hand, the NetPower design for an </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/1/17416444/net-power-natural-gas-carbon-air-pollution-allam-cycle\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advanced natural gas plant that has carbon capture built right in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could be a great complement to solar and wind, filling in for them during wind droughts in winter. (Though keeping </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sort of natural gas in use also requires that we address </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/natural-gas-could-warm-planet-much-coal-short-term?r3f_986=https://www.google.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the serious \u00a0problem of methane leaks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from natural gas wells and infrastructure.) \u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important type of carbon capture, though, is being able to capture carbon directly from the air.

I\u2019m also cheered to see the tax credit Congress created to encourage carbon capture. That said, overwhelmingly the most affordable ways to capture carbon, today, are the ones the Green New Deal talks about: \u00a0returning carbon to the natural environment, by enriching soils and planting trees. Enriching farm soils and planting trees </span><a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12102018/global-warming-solutions-negative-emissions-carbon-capture-technology-ipcc-climate-change-report\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost ten times less than fancier methods of carbon capture</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and could capture a billion tons of carbon a year in the US alone. What\u2019s more, the US could make those methods even cheaper by spurring new technology \u2013 like </span><a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/drones-plant-trees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tree-planting drones</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or </span><a href=\"https://nori.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">transparent digital markets for carbon capture</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 in a way that increases the adoption of carbon capture into natural ecosystems around the world. \u00a0Ultimately, we may need to draw even </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carbon out of the air than soils and trees can handle. \u00a0We should do the R&amp;D for higher tech methods that can do so, and encourage their deployment, even as we use the cheapest methods of soils and forests first.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1783666\" style=\"width: 1808px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1783666\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1783666 size-full\" height=\"1504\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1798px) 100vw, 1798px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.55.42-AM.png\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.55.42-AM.png 1798w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.55.42-AM.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.55.42-AM.png?resize=300,251 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.55.42-AM.png?resize=768,642 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.55.42-AM.png?resize=680,569 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-7.55.42-AM.png?resize=50,42 50w\" width=\"1798\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1783666\">The cheapest ways to capture carbon are on the bottom of this chart \u2013 in soils and forests.</p></div></p>\n<p><b>What About Climate Justice</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Green New Deal advances a plan to fight climate change and to ensure that we do so through a just transition. Here, I think a few principles clearly apply.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, </span><b>the cost of the transition shouldn\u2019t be paid by those with the lowest income</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or who\u2019ve contributed the least to the problem. In the long term, transitioning to a clean economy will make energy, transportation, and the rest of the goods we consume </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cheaper. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, in the short run, (when we\u2019re using subsidies to scale out new technologies to drive their costs down) there\u2019s any temporary increase in the cost of life\u2019s necessities, that shouldn\u2019t be passed on to low-income Americans. If costs for basic necessities go up, that needs to be offset by policies that buffer lower-income Americans against those changes.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, </span><b>if we need new taxes to pay for these programs, those taxes should be highly progressive</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If those taxes are on income, they should come in at the higher tax brackets. This also has to inform our view of a carbon tax. Carbon taxes are, on their own, highly regressive. Lower-income Americans spend a larger fraction of their paycheck on electricity, heating, transportation, and other carbon-intensive goods than wealthier Americans do. Rural Americans, who also tend to be </span><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/12/differences-in-income-growth-across-united-states-counties.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lower income</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and who have the </span><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/12/differences-in-income-growth-across-united-states-counties.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highest rates of poverty in America</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/transportation-economic-trends/tet-2017-chapter-6-household\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spend even more of their paycheck on transportation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So raising the price of energy, transportation, and other goods hits low-income Americans and rural Americans the hardest. If we use a carbon tax, we can offset it by sending a flat dividend check to every woman, man, and child in America. In Washington State, in our 2016 ballot initiative, we used another approach, using carbon tax revenue to boost the federal Earned Income Tax Credit \u2013 a tax credit that goes to low-income working families, and which is the closest thing to a basic income we have now.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third</span><b>, we need to help Americans in the most vulnerable communities with climate resistance and climate adaptation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Whether those are communities that are vulnerable to climate-related flooding, crop losses from extreme weather, heat and drought, or to wildfires that will get worse as temperatures rise, society ought to invest in boosting the resilience of these communities, and, if necessary, in helping individuals and communities relocate to areas that are less vulnerable to climate. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth, </span><b>massive investment in new clean energy, industry, transportation, and agriculture will pour trillions into the US economy</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. What\u2019s more, it has the potential to turn the US into an exporter of new clean technology. Together, they\u2019ll create the opportunity for potentially millions of new jobs. That opportunity ought to be open to all \u2013 to workers in dirty industries like coal who have their jobs displaced, to lower income Americans who have fewer opportunities today, and to immigrants willing to come to America and work. Job training programs, and programs to bridge the gap between the end of an old career and the start of a new one \u2013 are a win/win for America. They help us produce the labor pool to transition to this clean economy, and they provide a means for millions of Americans to uplift themselves with new, highly in-demand skills. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of that is fully in alignment with the Green New Deal resolution. \u00a0The GND goes further, though, making the case for universal healthcare, universal higher education, universal housing, a job guarantee for all people in the United States, strengthening unions, reducing discrimination in the workplace, respect for Native American rights and sovereignty, and stopping the transfer of jobs overseas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of those policies are ones I support, or at least where I support the motivations behind them. Yet I am not at all certain those policies should be coupled with climate action. Coupling a long list of liberal priorities with climate action would seem to make it </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">harder </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to get the bipartisan support we\u2019ll probably need to enact these climate policies. \u00a0That said, the Green New Deal resolution is a high level map, not a specific bill. The original New Deal wasn\u2019t one piece of legislation \u2013 it was made up of </span><a href=\"https://www.albert.io/blog/ultimate-ap-us-history-new-deal-programs-list/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than 30 separate bills</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Democrats should approach the Green New Deal the same way. They ought to embrace the idea that the overall effort may take multiple years and multiple Congresses to enact, and that it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to support some parts of the Green New Deal and not others. They ought to embrace alliances and assistance \u2013 including bipartisan alliances \u2013 to pass parts of the Green New Deal where they can. </span></p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1779983\" style=\"width: 1034px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1779983\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1779983\" height=\"683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"1024\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1779983\">(Photo by Ira L.

Climate change is a slow, insidious, and massive threat to human well-being. It\u2019s also profoundly unjust. Americans may only emit 15% of carbon emissions </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">today, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but all the CO2 we\u2019ve emitted in the past will linger in the atmosphere for roughly a century from when it was released. Add up all the carbon the US has emitted over time, and </span><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#the-long-run-history-cumulative-co2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the US remains the largest cumulative emitter of greenhouse gases on the planet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We Americans are more responsible for climate change than any other nation, even those with many times our population.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, two billion people live in countries that have emitted the least carbon dioxide over history \u2013 the poorest countries on planet earth \u2013 which are also the countries where people </span><a href=\"https://skepticalscience.com/Those-who-contribute-the-least-greenhouse-gases-will-be-most-impacted-by-climate-change.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are likely to suffer the most from climate change</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Climate change itself is a deep inequity. The most just thing we can do is to address climate change as rapidly as possible, and to produce and spread the tools that also boost climate resilience around the developing world. Indeed, most of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of fighting climate change don\u2019t go to Americans at all. Americans </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefit. But the largest benefits of fighting climate change go to the billions around the world who have the fewest resources and who live in the nations with the greatest vulnerability.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1784748\" height=\"767\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Climate-vulnerability-vs-carbon-emissions-the-people-most-vulnerable-to-climate-emitted-the-least-greenhouse-gases.jpg\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Climate-vulnerability-vs-carbon-emissions-the-people-most-vulnerable-to-climate-emitted-the-least-greenhouse-gases.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Climate-vulnerability-vs-carbon-emissions-the-people-most-vulnerable-to-climate-emitted-the-least-greenhouse-gases.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Climate-vulnerability-vs-carbon-emissions-the-people-most-vulnerable-to-climate-emitted-the-least-greenhouse-gases.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Climate-vulnerability-vs-carbon-emissions-the-people-most-vulnerable-to-climate-emitted-the-least-greenhouse-gases.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Climate-vulnerability-vs-carbon-emissions-the-people-most-vulnerable-to-climate-emitted-the-least-greenhouse-gases.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Climate-vulnerability-vs-carbon-emissions-the-people-most-vulnerable-to-climate-emitted-the-least-greenhouse-gases.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" width=\"1024\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower income Americans also stand to suffer more from climate change than do wealthier Americans. A lower-income American in Detroit isn\u2019t as vulnerable as a subsistence farmer in Botswana \u2013 not by a long shot. At the same time, it\u2019s hard to deny that Katrina, for example, hit the poor of New Orleans harder than it did the rich. Wealthier Americans can relocate more easily, can pay energy bills more easily, can rebuild from climate disasters more easily. And here again, the most just thing we can do is to act on climate, as rapidly as possible.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should we find ways to use the fight against climate change to also address the long history of inequality and injustice, and the differences in wealth and income that exist in the US? If so, should we stop there? Climate change is global. Carbon emissions and the harm they cause know no national borders. The harm of American (and European, and more recently Chinese) carbon emissions will fall most heavily on the poor of the developing world. Should climate policy aim to decarbonize the world as rapidly as possible? Or should it aim to decarbonize </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> address other global ills? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, the answer is clear. Climate change itself is so unjust, so lopsided in who has benefited from burning fossil fuels and who will suffer the most from that combustion, that addressing climate change is, itself, to help undo an injustice \u2013 one that threatens </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">billions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of people around the world.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s tackle all the world\u2019s other problems too. As we do so, let\u2019s keep in mind that addressing climate change, even if we don\u2019t succeed at everything else, is a major, vital, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">necessary </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">step towards a more just world. \u00a0</span></p>\n\n<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n<input class=\"shortlink\" readonly=\"\" title=\"Article

Good Policy Isn\\u2019t, Either.<\\/b><\\/li>\\n<\\/ol>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The conventional wisdom on climate policy is straightforward. Every nation uses its policies to reduce its own emissions. This conventional wisdom is wrong. Carbon dioxide doesn\\u2019t honor national boundaries. Climate change is global.

Yet, for most of that time, they\\u2019ve been a far more expensive way to produce electricity than burning coal or natural gas. Germany changed that.

That, in turn, drove utilities and home owners and corporations to purchase solar and wind. And that, in turn, made the technology cheaper. As prices fell, other nations &#8211; first European nations, then the US, and then China \\u2013 jumped into the fray, enacting more ambitious policies that further brought down the price of solar and wind (and now batteries and electric cars). <\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Why did subsidies bring down the price of technology? Because industry scale leads to industry learning and innovation, and that, in turn, leads to lower cost ways to manufacture, deploy, and manage new technologies. We\\u2019ve seen this for a century.

The government has a vital role to play. At the same time, the incredible, unprecedented decline in cost of solar power, wind power, batteries, and electric cars has happened both because of early government R&amp;D, and because private sector companies, incentivized by governments, have brought these technologies to market and been forced to compete with one another to provide the best technology at the lowest price.

That means that, even if electric vehicles were 100% of new sales today, it would take around 20 years for them to replace all gasoline cars. That needs to happen faster. Congress can help.<\\/span><\\/span>&nbsp;\\n<p>First, for individually owned vehicles, Congress should improve the federal electric vehicle tax credit. Today\\u2019s $7,500 federal tax credit is capped at 200,000 electric vehicles per manufacturer. That\\u2019s an absurdly low number in a country that has 260 million cars on the road. General Motors CEO Mary Barra <a style=\\\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.freep.com\\/story\\/money\\/cars\\/general-motors\\/2018\\/12\\/10\\/electric-car-tax-credit\\/2262410002\\/\\\">recently called for the cap to be removed<\\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. Congress ought to put electric vehicles on the same footing as solar, wind, and batteries: A 30% tax credit \\u2013 like the solar ITC &#8211; with no limit on the number of vehicles its applied to would be simple, clear, and consistent. For individuals buying their own vehicles, that tax credit ought to be structured so it can be taken off the purchase price of the vehicle directly, rather than waiting for tax season.<\\/span><\\/span>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n<p>Second, the same tax credit ought to apply to fleet operators who buy or build electric vehicles to offer rides to consumers. While the pace at which consumers buy new cars is slow, the pace at which they switch <i style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">miles of transport <\\/i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">can be far faster, as they switch some of their travel to fleets like Uber, Lyft, and whatever comes after. Those fleets, today, are mostly gasoline engine vehicles of hybrids. As electric vehicles increasingly become the <\\/span><i style=\\\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">cheapest per mile, <\\/i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">those app-based transport fleets will go electric.

That means each electric vehicle deployed as a taxi can have the impact of four individually owned vehicles.<\\/span><\\/span>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n<p>Finally, Congress ought to accelerate the deployment of autonomous cars on the nation\\u2019s roads. Why? Because an autonomous vehicle, by taking out the cost of the driver, can cut the cost per mile by half. Some calculations show that an autonomous electric taxi, by 2025, <a style=\\\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.marketwatch.com\\/story\\/demand-for-driverless-cars-could-boost-uber-to-2016-09-19\\\">could cost 35 cents per mile<\\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.

Here, I think a few principles clearly apply.<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">First, <\\/span><b>the cost of the transition shouldn\\u2019t be paid by those with the lowest income<\\/b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> or who\\u2019ve contributed the least to the problem. In the long term, transitioning to a clean economy will make energy, transportation, and the rest of the goods we consume <\\/span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">cheaper. <\\/span><\\/i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If, in the short run, (when we\\u2019re using subsidies to scale out new technologies to drive their costs down) there\\u2019s any temporary increase in the cost of life\\u2019s necessities, that shouldn\\u2019t be passed on to low-income Americans. If costs for basic necessities go up, that needs to be offset by policies that buffer lower-income Americans against those changes.<\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Second, <\\/span><b>if we need new taxes to pay for these programs, those taxes should be highly progressive<\\/b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. If those taxes are on income, they should come in at the higher tax brackets. This also has to inform our view of a carbon tax. Carbon taxes are, on their own, highly regressive. Lower-income Americans spend a larger fraction of their paycheck on electricity, heating, transportation, and other carbon-intensive goods than wealthier Americans do. Rural Americans, who also tend to be <\\/span><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.census.gov\\/library\\/stories\\/2018\\/12\\/differences-in-income-growth-across-united-states-counties.html\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">lower income<\\/span><\\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> and who have the <\\/span><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.census.gov\\/library\\/stories\\/2018\\/12\\/differences-in-income-growth-across-united-states-counties.html\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">highest rates of poverty in America<\\/span><\\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, <\\/span><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.bts.gov\\/browse-statistical-products-and-data\\/transportation-economic-trends\\/tet-2017-chapter-6-household\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">spend even more of their paycheck on transportation<\\/span><\\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. So raising the price of energy, transportation, and other goods hits low-income Americans and rural Americans the hardest. If we use a carbon tax, we can offset it by sending a flat dividend check to every woman, man, and child in America. In Washington State, in our 2016 ballot initiative, we used another approach, using carbon tax revenue to boost the federal Earned Income Tax Credit \\u2013 a tax credit that goes to low-income working families, and which is the closest thing to a basic income we have now.<\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Third<\\/span><b>, we need to help Americans in the most vulnerable communities with climate resistance and climate adaptation<\\/b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. Whether those are communities that are vulnerable to climate-related flooding, crop losses from extreme weather, heat and drought, or to wildfires that will get worse as temperatures rise, society ought to invest in boosting the resilience of these communities, and, if necessary, in helping individuals and communities relocate to areas that are less vulnerable to climate. <\\/span><\\/li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Fourth, <\\/span><b>massive investment in new clean energy, industry, transportation, and agriculture will pour trillions into the US economy<\\/b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. What\\u2019s more, it has the potential to turn the US into an exporter of new clean technology. Together, they\\u2019ll create the opportunity for potentially millions of new jobs. That opportunity ought to be open to all \\u2013 to workers in dirty industries like coal who have their jobs displaced, to lower income Americans who have fewer opportunities today, and to immigrants willing to come to America and work. Job training programs, and programs to bridge the gap between the end of an old career and the start of a new one \\u2013 are a win\\/win for America. They help us produce the labor pool to transition to this clean economy, and they provide a means for millions of Americans to uplift themselves with new, highly in-demand skills. <\\/span><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">All of that is fully in alignment with the Green New Deal resolution. \\u00a0The GND goes further, though, making the case for universal healthcare, universal higher education, universal housing, a job guarantee for all people in the United States, strengthening unions, reducing discrimination in the workplace, respect for Native American rights and sovereignty, and stopping the transfer of jobs overseas. <\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Many of those policies are ones I support, or at least where I support the motivations behind them. Yet I am not at all certain those policies should be coupled with climate action. Coupling a long list of liberal priorities with climate action would seem to make it <\\/span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">harder <\\/span><\\/i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">to get the bipartisan support we\\u2019ll probably need to enact these climate policies. \\u00a0That said, the Green New Deal resolution is a high level map, not a specific bill. The original New Deal wasn\\u2019t one piece of legislation \\u2013 it was made up of <\\/span><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.albert.io\\/blog\\/ultimate-ap-us-history-new-deal-programs-list\\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">more than 30 separate bills<\\/span><\\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. Democrats should approach the Green New Deal the same way. They ought to embrace the idea that the overall effort may take multiple years and multiple Congresses to enact, and that it\\u2019s perfectly acceptable to support some parts of the Green New Deal and not others. They ought to embrace alliances and assistance \\u2013 including bipartisan alliances \\u2013 to pass parts of the Green New Deal where they can. <\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_1779983\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-1779983\\\" class=\\\"breakout size-full wp-image-1779983\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"683\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg 6000w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/GettyImages-1096582116.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" \\/><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-1779983\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">(Photo by Ira L.

Climate change is a slow, insidious, and massive threat to human well-being. It\\u2019s also profoundly unjust.

A lower-income American in Detroit isn\\u2019t as vulnerable as a subsistence farmer in Botswana \\u2013 not by a long shot. At the same time, it\\u2019s hard to deny that Katrina, for example, hit the poor of New Orleans harder than it did the rich. Wealthier Americans can relocate more easily, can pay energy bills more easily, can rebuild from climate disasters more easily. And here again, the most just thing we can do is to act on climate, as rapidly as possible.<\\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><br \\/>\\n<\\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><br \\/>\\n<\\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Should we find ways to use the fight against climate change to also address the long history of inequality and injustice, and the differences in wealth and income that exist in the US? If so, should we stop there? Climate change is global. Carbon emissions and the harm they cause know no national borders. The harm of American (and European, and more recently Chinese) carbon emissions will fall most heavily on the poor of the developing world. Should climate policy aim to decarbonize the world as rapidly as possible? Or should it aim to decarbonize <\\/span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">and<\\/span><\\/i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> address other global ills? <\\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><br \\/>\\n<\\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><br \\/>\\n<\\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">For me, the answer is clear.

I think a much more serious issue is nitrous oxide. There is a huge amount of nitrogen being fixed in the form of ammonia. The paths for nitrogen as ammonia to return to the atmosphere are varied, but virtually all of them end up sooner or later producing nitrous oxide which is WAY more potent of a GHG than carbon dioxide and even ten times more potent than methane. Yet if we stop making ammonia crop yields will decline. We need to find ways to grow more efficiently (with less use of ammonia), and perhaps to eliminate some concentrated points of nitrous oxide emissions.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/02\\/15\\/how-to-decarbonize-america-and-the-world\\/#comment-652755\",\"type\":\"comment\",\"author_avatar_urls\":{\"24\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/451cc3db303e1327eb971410b2c3d0a7?s=24&d=identicon&r=g\",\"48\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/451cc3db303e1327eb971410b2c3d0a7?s=48&d=identicon&r=g\",\"96\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/451cc3db303e1327eb971410b2c3d0a7?s=96&d=identicon&r=g\"},\"techcrunch\":{\"avatar\":\"https:\\/\\/ct.yimg.com\\/cy\\/1768\\/39361574426_98028a_64sq.jpg\",\"company\":\"(no company found)\",\"title\":\"(no title found)\",\"user\":\"MNTNQNHI25U5FYD2YKKXXOXWUQ\"},\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/652755\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\"}],\"up\":[{\"embeddable\":true,\"post_type\":\"post\",\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/1783480\"}]}},{\"id\":652762,\"parent\":0,\"author\":0,\"author_name\":\"Herr Trigger\",\"author_url\":\"\",\"date\":\"2019-02-15T15:29:08\",\"content\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>This is the most common sense article on the issue I think TC has ever produced, so thank you Ramez. I&#8217;m going to ignore for a moment that you said that &#8220;The US, overwhelmingly, is the country most responsible for climate change&#8221; and then follow that with a huge graphic showing US responsible for 15% while China responsible for 28% of CO2 emissions. I understand the leftist urge to blame America for all the world&#8217;s problems, but at least don&#8217;t immediately contradict yourself. That&#8217;s where I almost stopped reading, but I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t.<\\/p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m also astonished that you actually admitted that Republicans don&#8217;t hate clean energy, and even support it. Thank you for being intellectually honest on that point. The main sticking points that are keeping us from completely agreeing though are 1. Is climate change a manufactured crisis? and 2. How do we pay for it.<\\/p>\\n<p>1. You could say that every scientist in the world agrees on climate change, and I would disagree, because they don&#8217;t all agree, and there is a great difference of opinion on just how much we are actually effecting &#8220;climate change&#8221; and also what that climate change will look like in the near or distant future if nothing is done. I would disagree that it is a settled science. But I&#8217;m willing, for argument&#8217;s sake, to say that it is as bad as you think it will be.<\\/p>\\n<p>2. How do we pay for it? Tax the rich. That&#8217;s always the answer, and I&#8217;m tired of that always being the answer. There is so much government waste and bloated budgets that could be cut from the government, it&#8217;s insane. Democrats and Republicans have to come together to truly address government excess and put forward an actual, real budget that we stick to. I&#8217;m not saying cut all welfare and government assistance programs, because we can&#8217;t nor should we. But maybe, maybe agree to help stop the influx of immigrants at our southern border so that we don&#8217;t have more and more people needing government assistance and healthcare. Maybe, maybe support our corporations who create jobs and put people to work and not run businesses out of town, a la Amazon. Maybe, maybe don&#8217;t tax the rich so heavily that they have no reason to keep themselves or their businesses here in the US. Hell, I&#8217;d raise taxes on the rich, not 70% like AOC suggested, but I&#8217;d reasonably raise taxes on the rich if you would agree to some of these things. Sadly, I don&#8217;t see you agreeing to this. For whatever reason, the left is insistent on letting illegal immigrants into the country and it makes absolutely no sense, accept to keep bolstering the number of liberal voters every year so that they can stay in power. They&#8217;re also insistent on making villains out of the rich and big corporations.<\\/p>\\n<p>Also, I&#8217;m going to completely agree with you that universal healthcare, universal jobs, and economic security for all have no place in the Green New Deal. They are arguments for another time and place. Those suggestions are what brought the toughest scrutiny because it made the Deal seem like a wish list for libs. Also, can we really pay to redesign every building in America? No. Can we really stop all air travel? No, at least not in the near future. These were ridiculous suggestions to begin with and they deserve the criticism they got.<\\/p>\\n<p>The rest of your article, if we can agree on a way to fund it, sounded to me like decent policies. Really well researched and intellectually honest. Find ways to make agriculture cleaner, just don&#8217;t take away my meat please. One last thing, can we stop with the &#8220;Climate change itself is so unjust&#8221; line. Stop create a whole new victim class please. If climate change is going to be as bad as you apparently seem to believe, we&#8217;re all screwed.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/02\\/15\\/how-to-decarbonize-america-and-the-world\\/#comment-652762\",\"type\":\"comment\",\"author_avatar_urls\":{\"24\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/f4ecc781fe64569634096aeb362220c7?s=24&d=identicon&r=g\",\"48\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/f4ecc781fe64569634096aeb362220c7?s=48&d=identicon&r=g\",\"96\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/f4ecc781fe64569634096aeb362220c7?s=96&d=identicon&r=g\"},\"techcrunch\":{\"avatar\":\"https:\\/\\/ct.yimg.com\\/cy\\/1768\\/39361574426_98028a_64sq.jpg\",\"company\":\"(no company found)\",\"title\":\"(no title found)\",\"user\":\"CLXFIPBXZGQG6FJMUBFYXBBZZP\"},\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/652762\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\"}],\"up\":[{\"embeddable\":true,\"post_type\":\"post\",\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/1783480\"}],\"children\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments?parent=652762\"}]}},{\"id\":652830,\"parent\":0,\"author\":0,\"author_name\":\"Micah Parker\",\"author_url\":\"\",\"date\":\"2019-02-16T06:47:02\",\"content\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>A lot of good information in this.

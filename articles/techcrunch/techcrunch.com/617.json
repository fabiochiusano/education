And here, (wait for it) there are ONMs \u2014\u00a0original news manufacturers. (Cymbal clash!) This is where investigative reporting, enterprise pieces and analysis on transportation lives.</em></p>\n<p>This week, we\u2019ve got some insider info on Didi,\u00a0China\u2019s largest ride-hailing firm. China-based TechCrunch reporter\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/rita-liao/\"><strong>Rita Liao</strong></a> learned from sources that Didi plans to lay off 15 percent of its employees, or about 2,000 people this year.\u00a0CEO Cheng Wei made the announcement during an internal meeting Friday morning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/didi-lay-off-15-percent-staff/\"><strong>Read about it here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Didi\u2019s troubles with regulators and its backlash from two high-profile passenger murders last year don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Their struggles are in line with what is happening in the ride-hailing industry, particularly in more mature markets where the novelty has worn off and cities have woken up.</p>\n<p>For companies like Didi, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"uber\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber\" target=\"_blank\">Uber, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Lyft and other emerging players, this means more resources (capital and people) spent working with cities as well as looking for ways to diversify their businesses. All the while, they must still plug away at the nagging problems of reducing costs and keeping drivers and riders.</p>\n<p>Just look at Uber. As <strong>Megan Rose Dickey</strong> reports,\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/15/uber-reports-3b-in-q4-revenue-rising-operating-losses/\">Uber\u2019s stiff losses</a> continued in the fourth quarter.

But naturally, human movement is a bit more complex than that. Few companies advertise the exact level of detail with which they resolve human shapes and movement. This level of granularity seems beyond what we\u2019ve seen.</p>\n<p>UM\u2019s new system uses LiDar and stereo camera systems to estimate not just the trajectory of a person, but their pose and gait. Pose can indicate whether a person is looking towards or away from the car, or using a cane, or stooped over a phone; gait indicates speed and intention.</p>\n<p>Is someone glancing over their shoulder? Maybe they\u2019re going to turn around, or walk into traffic. This additional data helps a system predict motion and makes for a more complete set of navigation plans and contingencies.</p>\n<p>Importantly, it performs well with only a handful of frames to work with \u2014 perhaps comprising a single step and swing of the arm. That\u2019s enough to make a prediction that beats simpler models handily, a critical measure of performance as one cannot assume that a pedestrian will be visible for any more than a few frames between obstructions.</p>\n<p>Not too much can be done with this noisy, little-studied data right now, but perceiving and cataloguing it is the first step to making it an integral part of an AV\u2019s vision system.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>\u2014 Devin Coldewey</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A little bird \u2026</em></h2>\n<p>We hear a lot.

How (and when) Nuro met Softbank is almost as big a story as the funding round itself. OK, well maybe not AS BIG.

Sources wouldn\u2019t elaborate whether Cruise was seeking to acquire Nuro or take a minority stake in the company.</p>\n<p>It all worked out in the end, though. The folks at Cruise introduced Nuro to Softbank. That means Cruise and Nuro now share the same investor. Softbank agreed in May 2018 to\u00a0invest\u00a0$2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings LLC.</p>\n<p>Got a tip or overheard something in the world of transportation?

Why auto loans?\u00a0Because auto loan data can be one of the canaries in the coal mine that is the automotive industry and on a larger scale, the economy.\u00a0 And, delinquency rates ripple through the rest of the transportation world, affecting public transit and ride-hailing too.</p>\n<p>The New York Federal Reserve this week released a <a href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/02/just-released-auto-loans-in-high-gear.html\">collection of economic data</a>, including auto loans, which have been climbing since 2011. Auto loans increased by $9 billion this year, a figure boosted by historically strong levels of newly originated loans that will put 2018 in the record books. There were\u00a0$584\u00a0billion in new auto loans and leases appearing on credit reports in 2018, the highest level in the 19-year history of the loan origination data.</p>\n<p>Why I\u2019m watching this?

Let me explain.</p>\n<p>This week, the California Department of Motor Vehicles released the <a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/disengagement_report_2018\">\u201cdisengagement reports</a>\u201d of autonomous vehicle companies with permits to test on public roads in the state. These reports are meant to track each time a self-driving vehicle disengages out of autonomous mode.\u00a0There are 48 companies that issued reports, which when you combine all the data, drove more than 2 million miles on public roads in autonomous mode between December\u00a02017 and November 2018. That\u2019s a four-fold increase from the year before.</p>\n<p>Companies that receive AV testing permits in California, which are issued by the DMV, are required to submit these annually. It\u2019s not that these reports are worthless. They are useful to determine if a company is\u00a0ramping up its testing on public roads, adding more AVs to its fleet, helpful for spotting trends like \u2018why did disengagements suddenly end?\u2019 or to determine if a company is even testing anymore.</p>\n<p>And I\u2019ve discovered some interesting information that will become bigger stories or end up as footnotes in the world of AVs. (For instance, Faraday Future says it will begin <a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/bcefe117-15b7-4e0a-b9bd-b4c27b2ebd8a/FaradayFutureInc.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=\">testing on public roads</a> late this year).</p>\n<p>But disengagement reports are not a meaningful way to make comparisons on how companies stack up against each other.\u00a0Why? Because it\u2019s not an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison for one, companies report the data in different ways and there is no transparency into the specifics of when and where each disengagement occurred.</p>\n<p>Another problem is the miles-per-disengagement figure that we (the media) typically focus on. This data isn\u2019t super useful on its own. This shouldn\u2019t be treated like a report card. As one engineer told me once, you learn only from occasions in which the system does, or wants to do, something different from a good human. The smart AV companies will take the disengagement data and combine it with other information taken from simulation and other forms of offline testing.</p>\n<p>The \u201cmiles per disengagement\u201d data point doesn\u2019t start to mean anything on its own until a company reaches the validation phase, which is when miles driven are the truest representation of naturalistic driving in the domain and application of interest. How many are at this point? I\u2019m hearing one or two.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Testing and deployments</em></h2>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQewm2-t2HM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Much of the talk and marketing materials around flying cars, or eVTOLs, focuses on well-dressed business folks standing on top of skyscrapers, preparing to be whisked away \u2014 up and over the terrible traffic below. Other startups have focused on last-mile delivery. But what about long-distance cargo delivery to remote and urban areas?</p>\n<p>Elroy Air is one company that is working on this problem. The San Francisco-based startup has been developing an autonomous vertical takeoff and landing\u00a0cargo transport system that can operate outside of airport infrastructure and carry up to 500 pounds of cargo over 300 miles. Elroy Air just closed a $9.2 million round that included investors Catapult Ventures,\u00a0Levitate Capital,\u00a0Lemnos,\u00a0Precursor Ventures,\u00a0Haystack, Shasta Ventures, Homebrew, 122West, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"amplify-partners\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/amplify-partners\" target=\"_blank\">Amplify Partners, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Hemisphere Ventures, the E14 Fund and DiamondStream Partners.</p>\n<p>The company said this week it will begin testing its unmanned vertical-takeoff-and-landing drone for commercial deliveries \u2014 called the Chaparral \u2014 this year and launch a commercial shipping service\u00a0 in 2020.</p>\n<p>These vehicles will be monitored by trained operators at all times during the testing phase, the company said.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>On our radar</em></h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s not forget that people are using buses and trains everyday. Not in a year. Not in 10. Right now. These transit systems, many of which need expensive upgrades, carry millions of people every day. One of the more interesting examples of the challenges with transit is the L train shutdown in New York.</p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs to\u00a0repair a subway tunnel under the East River and initially had planned to shut down the entire tunnel for 15 months, starting in late April. The L train carries 275,000 people between Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, the effected section, every day.</p>\n<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo intervened and now there\u2019s a new plan, which involves running\u00a0trains through one tunnel tube while repairs are carried out in the other tube. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/nyregion/l-train-shutdown.html\">NYT has the back story</a>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an upcoming \u201cL Train Shutdown\u201d event this month in Brooklyn that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. URBAN-X, the startup accelerator backed by automotive brand MINI, is hosting a discussion on the future\u00a0of the L-train and alternative modes of transport.

But naturally, human movement is a bit more complex than that. Few companies advertise the exact level of detail with which they resolve human shapes and movement. This level of granularity seems beyond what we&#8217;ve seen.<\\/p>\\n<p>UM&#8217;s new system uses LiDar and stereo camera systems to estimate not just the trajectory of a person, but their pose and gait. Pose can indicate whether a person is looking towards or away from the car, or using a cane, or stooped over a phone; gait indicates speed and intention.<\\/p>\\n<p>Is someone glancing over their shoulder? Maybe they&#8217;re going to turn around, or walk into traffic. This additional data helps a system predict motion and makes for a more complete set of navigation plans and contingencies.<\\/p>\\n<p>Importantly, it performs well with only a handful of frames to work with \\u2014 perhaps comprising a single step and swing of the arm. That&#8217;s enough to make a prediction that beats simpler models handily, a critical measure of performance as one cannot assume that a pedestrian will be visible for any more than a few frames between obstructions.<\\/p>\\n<p>Not too much can be done with this noisy, little-studied data right now, but perceiving and cataloguing it is the first step to making it an integral part of an AV&#8217;s vision system.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: right;\\\"><em>\\u2014 Devin Coldewey<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<hr \\/>\\n<h2 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em>A little bird &#8230;<\\/em><\\/h2>\\n<p>We hear a lot.

Sources wouldn&#8217;t elaborate whether Cruise was seeking to acquire Nuro or take a minority stake in the company.<\\/p>\\n<p>It all worked out in the end, though. The folks at Cruise introduced Nuro to Softbank. That means Cruise and Nuro now share the same investor.

Auto loans increased by $9 billion this year, a figure boosted by historically strong levels of newly originated loans that will put 2018 in the record books. There were\\u00a0$584\\u00a0billion in new auto loans and leases appearing on credit reports in 2018, the highest level in the 19-year history of the loan origination data.<\\/p>\\n<p>Why I&#8217;m watching this?

The company tested 200 of these scooter in Washington, D.C. (and later rolled out to San Francisco) to monitor whether people were riding on the sidewalk and generally riding safely. At the time, Skip said it wasn&#8217;t sure what it would do with the data collected from the cameras.<\\/p>\\n<p>In other words, Skip&#8217;s cameras are on. How they intend to use that data \\u2014 whether via a warning to the rider, a message after the ride is complete, or remotely slowing the scooter down, isn&#8217;t clear.<\\/p>\\n<p>One startup that is poised to capture this new market of scooter accountability is\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.fantasmo.io\\/\\\">Fantasmo<\\/a>.

Let me explain.<\\/p>\\n<p>This week, the California Department of Motor Vehicles released the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.dmv.ca.gov\\/portal\\/dmv\\/detail\\/vr\\/autonomous\\/disengagement_report_2018\\\">&#8220;disengagement reports<\\/a>&#8221; of autonomous vehicle companies with permits to test on public roads in the state. These reports are meant to track each time a self-driving vehicle disengages out of autonomous mode.\\u00a0There are 48 companies that issued reports, which when you combine all the data, drove more than 2 million miles on public roads in autonomous mode between December\\u00a02017 and November 2018. That&#8217;s a four-fold increase from the year before.<\\/p>\\n<p>Companies that receive AV testing permits in California, which are issued by the DMV, are required to submit these annually. It&#8217;s not that these reports are worthless. They are useful to determine if a company is\\u00a0ramping up its testing on public roads, adding more AVs to its fleet, helpful for spotting trends like &#8216;why did disengagements suddenly end?&#8217; or to determine if a company is even testing anymore.<\\/p>\\n<p>And I&#8217;ve discovered some interesting information that will become bigger stories or end up as footnotes in the world of AVs. (For instance, Faraday Future says it will begin <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.dmv.ca.gov\\/portal\\/wcm\\/connect\\/bcefe117-15b7-4e0a-b9bd-b4c27b2ebd8a\\/FaradayFutureInc.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=\\\">testing on public roads<\\/a> late this year).<\\/p>\\n<p>But disengagement reports are not a meaningful way to make comparisons on how companies stack up against each other.\\u00a0Why? Because it&#8217;s not an &#8220;apples-to-apples&#8221; comparison for one, companies report the data in different ways and there is no transparency into the specifics of when and where each disengagement occurred.<\\/p>\\n<p>Another problem is the miles-per-disengagement figure that we (the media) typically focus on. This data isn&#8217;t super useful on its own. This shouldn&#8217;t be treated like a report card. As one engineer told me once, you learn only from occasions in which the system does, or wants to do, something different from a good human. The smart AV companies will take the disengagement data and combine it with other information taken from simulation and other forms of offline testing.<\\/p>\\n<p>The &#8220;miles per disengagement&#8221; data point doesn&#8217;t start to mean anything on its own until a company reaches the validation phase, which is when miles driven are the truest representation of naturalistic driving in the domain and application of interest. How many are at this point? I&#8217;m hearing one or two.<\\/p>\\n<hr \\/>\\n<h2 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em>Testing and deployments<\\/em><\\/h2>\\n<p><span class=\\\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center; display: block;\\\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\\/html' width='640' height='360' src='https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/embed\\/zQewm2-t2HM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\\/iframe><\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p>Much of the talk and marketing materials around flying cars, or eVTOLs, focuses on well-dressed business folks standing on top of skyscrapers, preparing to be whisked away \\u2014 up and over the terrible traffic below.

Not in a year. Not in 10. Right now. These transit systems, many of which need expensive upgrades, carry millions of people every day. One of the more interesting examples of the challenges with transit is the L train shutdown in New York.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs to\\u00a0repair a subway tunnel under the East River and initially had planned to shut down the entire tunnel for 15 months, starting in late April.

"content": "Welcome back to the TechCrunch transportation newsletter; I\u2019m your host Kirsten Korosec, senior transportation reporter at TechCrunch. This is the second edition and seriously people, what happened this week? Too much. Too much!  Never heard of TechCrunch\u2019s Transportation Weekly?  Catch up here   . As I\u2019ve written before, consider this a soft launch. Follow me on Twitter\u00a0 @kirstenkorosec   \u00a0to ensure you see it each week. (An email subscription is coming).  Off we go \u2026  vroom  .     There are OEMs in the automotive world. And here, (wait for it) there are ONMs \u2014\u00a0original news manufacturers. (Cymbal clash!) This is where investigative reporting, enterprise pieces and analysis on transportation lives.   This week, we\u2019ve got some insider info on Didi,\u00a0China\u2019s largest ride-hailing firm. China-based TechCrunch reporter\u00a0 Rita Liao    learned from sources that Didi plans to lay off 15 percent of its employees, or about 2,000 people this year.\u00a0CEO Cheng Wei made the announcement during an internal meeting Friday morning.  Read about it here   .  Didi\u2019s troubles with regulators and its backlash from two high-profile passenger murders last year don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Their struggles are in line with what is happening in the ride-hailing industry, particularly in more mature markets where the novelty has worn off and cities have woken up.  For companies like Didi,  Uber,     Lyft and other emerging players, this means more resources (capital and people) spent working with cities as well as looking for ways to diversify their businesses. All the while, they must still plug away at the nagging problems of reducing costs and keeping drivers and riders.  Just look at Uber. As  Megan Rose Dickey   reports,\u00a0 Uber\u2019s stiff losses   continued in the fourth quarter. The upshot:\u00a0Its losses can be attributed to increased competition and significant investment in bigger bets like micro mobility and Elevate. And apparently legal fees. Uber,\u00a0 The Verge reports   , sued NYC on Friday to overturn a law that caps drivers.  This week, TechCrunch editor  Devin Coldewey    digs into the development of a system that can estimate not just where a pedestrian is headed, but their pose and gait too.       The University of Michigan, well known for its efforts in self-driving car tech, has been working on an improved algorithm for predicting the movements of pedestrians.  These algorithms can be as simple as identifying a human and seeing how many pixels move over a few frames, then extrapolating from there. But naturally, human movement is a bit more complex than that. Few companies advertise the exact level of detail with which they resolve human shapes and movement. This level of granularity seems beyond what we\u2019ve seen.  UM\u2019s new system uses LiDar and stereo camera systems to estimate not just the trajectory of a person, but their pose and gait. Pose can indicate whether a person is looking towards or away from the car, or using a cane, or stooped over a phone; gait indicates speed and intention.  Is someone glancing over their shoulder? Maybe they\u2019re going to turn around, or walk into traffic. This additional data helps a system predict motion and makes for a more complete set of navigation plans and contingencies.  Importantly, it performs well with only a handful of frames to work with \u2014 perhaps comprising a single step and swing of the arm. That\u2019s enough to make a prediction that beats simpler models handily, a critical measure of performance as one cannot assume that a pedestrian will be visible for any more than a few frames between obstructions.  Not too much can be done with this noisy, little-studied data right now, but perceiving and cataloguing it is the first step to making it an integral part of an AV\u2019s vision system.  \u2014 Devin Coldewey   We hear a lot. But we\u2019re not selfish. Let\u2019s share.     Every big funding round has an origin story \u2014 that magic moment when planets align and a capitally-flush investor gazes across a room at just the right time and spots the perfect company in need of funds and guidance.  One of this week\u2019s biggest deals \u2014 see below \u2014 was the $940 million that Softbank Vision Fund invested in autonomous delivery robot Nuro. How (and when) Nuro met Softbank is almost as big a story as the funding round itself. OK, well maybe not AS BIG. But interesting, nonetheless.    It turns out that\u00a0Cruise, the self-driving unit of GM, was in early talks with Nuro, but the parties couldn\u2019t quite meet in the middle, people familiar with the deal told me. Sources wouldn\u2019t elaborate whether Cruise was seeking to acquire Nuro or take a minority stake in the company.  It all worked out in the end, though. The folks at Cruise introduced Nuro to Softbank. That means Cruise and Nuro now share the same investor. Softbank agreed in May 2018 to\u00a0invest\u00a0$2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings LLC.  Got a tip or overheard something in the world of transportation? Email me or send a direct message to\u00a0 @kirstenkorosec   .     We have a tie this week, which began with news that Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund  invested in autonomous delivery robot Nuro  . The week closed with electric automaker  Rivian announcing a $700 million funding round   led by Amazon.  First Nuro.\u00a0Michael Ronen, managing partner at\u00a0SoftBank Investment Advisers, and the same person who was a big part of its investment in Cruise, told TechCrunch that the winners in this market will need to address a diverse mix of technological questions. In his view, that\u2019s Nuro.  \u201cNuro has built a team of brilliant problem solvers whose combined backgrounds in robotics, machine learning, autonomous driving and consumer electronics give them a compelling advantage,\u201d Ronen said.  Amazon\u2019s investment in Rivian is important, particularly when you step back and take a more holistic and historic view. Consider this:\u00a0The logistics giant stealthily acquired an  urban delivery robot startup   called Dispatch in 2017 (a discovery Mark Harris made and reported for us last week). Amazon showed off\u00a0the fruit of that acquisition \u2014 its own\u00a0 delivery robot Scout  \u00a0\u2014 in January 2018.  Last week, self-driving vehicle startup  Aurora     raised  more than\u00a0$530 million   in a Series B funding round\u00a0led by\u00a0Sequoia and with \u201csignificant\u201d investments from Amazon and T. Rowe Price. Now, Amazon is backing Rivian.  Based on the deals that we  know   about, Amazon\u2019s hands are now deep into autonomous delivery, self-driving vehicle software and electric vehicles.\u00a0Let that sink in.  Other deals that got our attention this week  :     Sure, TechCrunch focuses on startups. Why auto loans?\u00a0Because auto loan data can be one of the canaries in the coal mine that is the automotive industry and on a larger scale, the economy.\u00a0 And, delinquency rates ripple through the rest of the transportation world, affecting public transit and ride-hailing too.  The New York Federal Reserve this week released a  collection of economic data  , including auto loans, which have been climbing since 2011. Auto loans increased by $9 billion this year, a figure boosted by historically strong levels of newly originated loans that will put 2018 in the record books. There were\u00a0$584\u00a0billion in new auto loans and leases appearing on credit reports in 2018, the highest level in the 19-year history of the loan origination data.  Why I\u2019m watching this? Because according to the  Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit   :  Tiny but mighty micro mobility    It was a bit quiet on the micro-mobility front this week, but here\u2019s what jumped out. Unsurprisingly,   San Francisco denied Lime\u2019s appeal    to operate electric scooters in the city. This is the same decision the city landed on pertaining to both Uber\u2019s Jump and Ford\u2019s Spin appeals. On the bright side for these companies, there may be hope for them to deploy scooters during phase two of the city\u2019s pilot program, which starts in April.   Also in the SF Bay Area,   Lyft donated $700,000 to TransForm   , an organization focused on improving access to transportation in underserved areas throughout California. In partnership with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, Lyft and TransForm will invest in a free bike library and community \u201cparklets\u201d in Oakland, Calif.    Meanwhile,   over in Tel Aviv   , Lime deployed its electric scooters, joining electric scooter startup Bird. Lime also reportedly plans to deploy its scooters throughout the country of Israel. Next up will be cities in the Gush Dan region.   In case you thought e-scooters were a new thing, here's a lady riding one in 1916. Timing is everything. https://t.co/bb6NtmThTC    pic.twitter.com/UyzIKapbk3   \u2014 David E. Weekly \ud83d\ude81 (@dweekly)  February 15, 2019    Also in micro mobility \u2026   We read corporate updates to terms of service in our spare time. And this week, Skip sent out an update that included an interesting nugget. It reads:  We\u2019ve updated specific provisions on camera footage.  \u00a0We\u2019ve updated and made more clear that our scooters may be equipped with video camera equipment which we may use to help ensure that our scooters are used properly and in accordance with laws, rules, regulations and policies, to protect against crimes such as theft and vandalism, to help us determine if scooters are being used properly at speeds, locations and on surfaces that are proper and allowed as well as to improve our Services.  In December, Skip\u00a0unveiled two new scooters \u2014 one with a  rear-facing camera  . The company tested 200 of these scooter in Washington, D.C. (and later rolled out to San Francisco) to monitor whether people were riding on the sidewalk and generally riding safely. At the time, Skip said it wasn\u2019t sure what it would do with the data collected from the cameras.  In other words, Skip\u2019s cameras are on. How they intend to use that data \u2014 whether via a warning to the rider, a message after the ride is complete, or remotely slowing the scooter down, isn\u2019t clear.  One startup that is poised to capture this new market of scooter accountability is\u00a0 Fantasmo  . The augmented reality mapping startup has a new\u00a0 scooter positioning camera  \u00a0that captures video and then matches that against a map to reliably identify how the scooter is being used. Fantasmo\u2019s camera system is not being used by Skip.  If you\u2019re waiting for the big autonomous vehicle disengagement hot take story from me, you\u2019ll be waiting for awhile. Let me explain.  This week, the California Department of Motor Vehicles released the  \u201cdisengagement reports  \u201d of autonomous vehicle companies with permits to test on public roads in the state. These reports are meant to track each time a self-driving vehicle disengages out of autonomous mode.\u00a0There are 48 companies that issued reports, which when you combine all the data, drove more than 2 million miles on public roads in autonomous mode between December\u00a02017 and November 2018. That\u2019s a four-fold increase from the year before.  Companies that receive AV testing permits in California, which are issued by the DMV, are required to submit these annually. It\u2019s not that these reports are worthless. They are useful to determine if a company is\u00a0ramping up its testing on public roads, adding more AVs to its fleet, helpful for spotting trends like \u2018why did disengagements suddenly end?\u2019 or to determine if a company is even testing anymore.  And I\u2019ve discovered some interesting information that will become bigger stories or end up as footnotes in the world of AVs. (For instance, Faraday Future says it will begin  testing on public roads   late this year).  But disengagement reports are not a meaningful way to make comparisons on how companies stack up against each other.\u00a0Why? Because it\u2019s not an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison for one, companies report the data in different ways and there is no transparency into the specifics of when and where each disengagement occurred.  Another problem is the miles-per-disengagement figure that we (the media) typically focus on. This data isn\u2019t super useful on its own. This shouldn\u2019t be treated like a report card. As one engineer told me once, you learn only from occasions in which the system does, or wants to do, something different from a good human. The smart AV companies will take the disengagement data and combine it with other information taken from simulation and other forms of offline testing.  The \u201cmiles per disengagement\u201d data point doesn\u2019t start to mean anything on its own until a company reaches the validation phase, which is when miles driven are the truest representation of naturalistic driving in the domain and application of interest. How many are at this point? I\u2019m hearing one or two.     Much of the talk and marketing materials around flying cars, or eVTOLs, focuses on well-dressed business folks standing on top of skyscrapers, preparing to be whisked away \u2014 up and over the terrible traffic below. Other startups have focused on last-mile delivery. But what about long-distance cargo delivery to remote and urban areas?  Elroy Air is one company that is working on this problem. The San Francisco-based startup has been developing an autonomous vertical takeoff and landing\u00a0cargo transport system that can operate outside of airport infrastructure and carry up to 500 pounds of cargo over 300 miles. Elroy Air just closed a $9.2 million round that included investors Catapult Ventures,\u00a0Levitate Capital,\u00a0Lemnos,\u00a0Precursor Ventures,\u00a0Haystack, Shasta Ventures, Homebrew, 122West,  Amplify Partners,     Hemisphere Ventures, the E14 Fund and DiamondStream Partners.  The company said this week it will begin testing its unmanned vertical-takeoff-and-landing drone for commercial deliveries \u2014 called the Chaparral \u2014 this year and launch a commercial shipping service\u00a0 in 2020.  These vehicles will be monitored by trained operators at all times during the testing phase, the company said.  Let\u2019s not forget that people are using buses and trains everyday. Not in a year. Not in 10. Right now. These transit systems, many of which need expensive upgrades, carry millions of people every day. One of the more interesting examples of the challenges with transit is the L train shutdown in New York.  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs to\u00a0repair a subway tunnel under the East River and initially had planned to shut down the entire tunnel for 15 months, starting in late April. The L train carries 275,000 people between Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, the effected section, every day.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo intervened and now there\u2019s a new plan, which involves running\u00a0trains through one tunnel tube while repairs are carried out in the other tube. The  NYT has the back story  .  There\u2019s an upcoming \u201cL Train Shutdown\u201d event this month in Brooklyn that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. URBAN-X, the startup accelerator backed by automotive brand MINI, is hosting a discussion on the future\u00a0of the L-train and alternative modes of transport. Some interesting folks will be participating, including Lime\u2019s chief program officer Scott Kubly. The event will be held 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm, Feb. 19 at\u00a0A/D/O, 29 Norman Ave, Brooklyn, NY.

China-based TechCrunch reporter\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/rita-liao/\"><strong>Rita Liao</strong></a> learned from sources that Didi plans to lay off 15 percent of its employees, or about 2,000 people this year.\u00a0CEO Cheng Wei made the announcement during an internal meeting Friday morning.</p> <p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/didi-lay-off-15-percent-staff/\"><strong>Read about it here</strong></a>.</p> <p>Didi\u2019s troubles with regulators and its backlash from two high-profile passenger murders last year don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Their struggles are in line with what is happening in the ride-hailing industry, particularly in more mature markets where the novelty has worn off and cities have woken up.</p> <p>For companies like Didi, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"uber\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber\" target=\"_blank\">Uber, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Lyft and other emerging players, this means more resources (capital and people) spent working with cities as well as looking for ways to diversify their businesses. All the while, they must still plug away at the nagging problems of reducing costs and keeping drivers and riders.</p> <p>Just look at Uber.

But naturally, human movement is a bit more complex than that. Few companies advertise the exact level of detail with which they resolve human shapes and movement. This level of granularity seems beyond what we\u2019ve seen.</p> <p>UM\u2019s new system uses LiDar and stereo camera systems to estimate not just the trajectory of a person, but their pose and gait. Pose can indicate whether a person is looking towards or away from the car, or using a cane, or stooped over a phone; gait indicates speed and intention.</p> <p>Is someone glancing over their shoulder? Maybe they\u2019re going to turn around, or walk into traffic. This additional data helps a system predict motion and makes for a more complete set of navigation plans and contingencies.</p> <p>Importantly, it performs well with only a handful of frames to work with \u2014 perhaps comprising a single step and swing of the arm. That\u2019s enough to make a prediction that beats simpler models handily, a critical measure of performance as one cannot assume that a pedestrian will be visible for any more than a few frames between obstructions.</p> <p>Not too much can be done with this noisy, little-studied data right now, but perceiving and cataloguing it is the first step to making it an integral part of an AV\u2019s vision system.</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>\u2014 Devin Coldewey</em></p> <p>We hear a lot.

On the bright side for these companies, there may be hope for them to deploy scooters during phase two of the city\u2019s pilot program, which starts in April.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also in the SF Bay Area, </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/lyft-puts-700k-toward-oaklands-underserved-communities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lyft donated $700,000 to TransForm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an organization focused on improving access to transportation in underserved areas throughout California. In partnership with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, Lyft and TransForm will invest in a free bike library and community \u201cparklets\u201d in Oakland, Calif. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, </span><a href=\"https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-lime-e-scooters-officially-launches-israel-operations-1001272352\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over in Tel Aviv</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Lime deployed its electric scooters, joining electric scooter startup Bird.

Timing is everything.<a href=\"https://t.co/bb6NtmThTC\">https://t.co/bb6NtmThTC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/UyzIKapbk3\">pic.twitter.com/UyzIKapbk3</a></p> <p>\u2014 David E. Weekly \ud83d\ude81 (@dweekly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dweekly/status/1096553765522399232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 15, 2019</a></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Also in micro mobility \u2026</strong></p> <p>We read corporate updates to terms of service in our spare time. And this week, Skip sent out an update that included an interesting nugget. It reads:</p> <p><strong>We\u2019ve updated specific provisions on camera footage.</strong>\u00a0We\u2019ve updated and made more clear that our scooters may be equipped with video camera equipment which we may use to help ensure that our scooters are used properly and in accordance with laws, rules, regulations and policies, to protect against crimes such as theft and vandalism, to help us determine if scooters are being used properly at speeds, locations and on surfaces that are proper and allowed as well as to improve our Services.</p> <p>In December, Skip\u00a0unveiled two new scooters \u2014 one with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/skip-unveils-scooters-with-locks-and-cameras/\">rear-facing camera</a>. The company tested 200 of these scooter in Washington, D.C. (and later rolled out to San Francisco) to monitor whether people were riding on the sidewalk and generally riding safely. At the time, Skip said it wasn\u2019t sure what it would do with the data collected from the cameras.</p> <p>In other words, Skip\u2019s cameras are on. How they intend to use that data \u2014 whether via a warning to the rider, a message after the ride is complete, or remotely slowing the scooter down, isn\u2019t clear.</p> <p>One startup that is poised to capture this new market of scooter accountability is\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.fantasmo.io/\">Fantasmo</a>. The augmented reality mapping startup has a new\u00a0<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jaymstr/8bfdaf63fbdd\">scooter positioning camera</a>\u00a0that captures video and then matches that against a map to reliably identify how the scooter is being used. Fantasmo\u2019s camera system is not being used by Skip.</p> <p>If you\u2019re waiting for the big autonomous vehicle disengagement hot take story from me, you\u2019ll be waiting for awhile. Let me explain.</p> <p>This week, the California Department of Motor Vehicles released the <a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/disengagement_report_2018\">\u201cdisengagement reports</a>\u201d of autonomous vehicle companies with permits to test on public roads in the state. These reports are meant to track each time a self-driving vehicle disengages out of autonomous mode.\u00a0There are 48 companies that issued reports, which when you combine all the data, drove more than 2 million miles on public roads in autonomous mode between December\u00a02017 and November 2018. That\u2019s a four-fold increase from the year before.</p> <p>Companies that receive AV testing permits in California, which are issued by the DMV, are required to submit these annually. It\u2019s not that these reports are worthless. They are useful to determine if a company is\u00a0ramping up its testing on public roads, adding more AVs to its fleet, helpful for spotting trends like \u2018why did disengagements suddenly end?\u2019 or to determine if a company is even testing anymore.</p> <p>And I\u2019ve discovered some interesting information that will become bigger stories or end up as footnotes in the world of AVs. (For instance, Faraday Future says it will begin <a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/bcefe117-15b7-4e0a-b9bd-b4c27b2ebd8a/FaradayFutureInc.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=\">testing on public roads</a> late this year).</p> <p>But disengagement reports are not a meaningful way to make comparisons on how companies stack up against each other.\u00a0Why? Because it\u2019s not an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison for one, companies report the data in different ways and there is no transparency into the specifics of when and where each disengagement occurred.</p> <p>Another problem is the miles-per-disengagement figure that we (the media) typically focus on. This data isn\u2019t super useful on its own. This shouldn\u2019t be treated like a report card. As one engineer told me once, you learn only from occasions in which the system does, or wants to do, something different from a good human. The smart AV companies will take the disengagement data and combine it with other information taken from simulation and other forms of offline testing.</p> <p>The \u201cmiles per disengagement\u201d data point doesn\u2019t start to mean anything on its own until a company reaches the validation phase, which is when miles driven are the truest representation of naturalistic driving in the domain and application of interest. How many are at this point? I\u2019m hearing one or two.</p> <p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"youtube-player\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQewm2-t2HM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" style=\"border:0;\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\"></iframe></span></p> <p>Much of the talk and marketing materials around flying cars, or eVTOLs, focuses on well-dressed business folks standing on top of skyscrapers, preparing to be whisked away \u2014 up and over the terrible traffic below. Other startups have focused on last-mile delivery. But what about long-distance cargo delivery to remote and urban areas?</p> <p>Elroy Air is one company that is working on this problem. The San Francisco-based startup has been developing an autonomous vertical takeoff and landing\u00a0cargo transport system that can operate outside of airport infrastructure and carry up to 500 pounds of cargo over 300 miles. Elroy Air just closed a $9.2 million round that included investors Catapult Ventures,\u00a0Levitate Capital,\u00a0Lemnos,\u00a0Precursor Ventures,\u00a0Haystack, Shasta Ventures, Homebrew, 122West, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"amplify-partners\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/amplify-partners\" target=\"_blank\">Amplify Partners, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Hemisphere Ventures, the E14 Fund and DiamondStream Partners.</p> <p>The company said this week it will begin testing its unmanned vertical-takeoff-and-landing drone for commercial deliveries \u2014 called the Chaparral \u2014 this year and launch a commercial shipping service\u00a0 in 2020.</p> <p>These vehicles will be monitored by trained operators at all times during the testing phase, the company said.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget that people are using buses and trains everyday. Not in a year. Not in 10. Right now. These transit systems, many of which need expensive upgrades, carry millions of people every day. One of the more interesting examples of the challenges with transit is the L train shutdown in New York.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs to\u00a0repair a subway tunnel under the East River and initially had planned to shut down the entire tunnel for 15 months, starting in late April. The L train carries 275,000 people between Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, the effected section, every day.</p> <p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo intervened and now there\u2019s a new plan, which involves running\u00a0trains through one tunnel tube while repairs are carried out in the other tube. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/nyregion/l-train-shutdown.html\">NYT has the back story</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s an upcoming \u201cL Train Shutdown\u201d event this month in Brooklyn that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. URBAN-X, the startup accelerator backed by automotive brand MINI, is hosting a discussion on the future\u00a0of the L-train and alternative modes of transport. Some interesting folks will be participating, including Lime\u2019s chief program officer Scott Kubly. The event will be held 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm, Feb. 19 at\u00a0A/D/O, 29 Norman Ave, Brooklyn, NY.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading. There might be content you like or something you hate.

Others include actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.</p> <p>For McGlashan especially, whose job is ostensibly to make a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact, the charges are particularly damning, highlighting as they do how wealthy families sometimes use their financial muscle in socially unjust ways \u2014 in this case, paying to secure spots at colleges and depriving deserving students of admission in the process.</p> <p>Indeed, TPG seemingly had little choice but separating from McGlashan, at least for now. In making its case against McGlashan and the others, the Justice Department has laid bare each party\u2019s alleged wrongdoings with<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1142876/download\"> painstaking specificity</a>.</p> <p>For his part, McGlashan has been charged with both participating in a college entrance exam cheating scheme and recruitment scheme, including by trying to bribe the senior athletic director at USC, and by paying test center administrators willing to accept bribes to give his oldest son more time to take a college entrance exam than is usually allotted students \u2014 and in a special test center where his answers would be corrected after he had completed the test (unbeknownst to him).</p> <p>McGlashan also allegedly signed-off on plans to doctor a photo that would make McGlashan\u2019s son look like a football recruit and, as McGlashan was told, thus more desirable to the specialty program in arts, technology and business at USC that his son hoped to attend.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t all theoretical. According to the Justice Department, after McGlashan\u2019s son took the test in Florida and after the proctor corrected his answers to produce a score of 34 out of 36, it was provided as part of his application to Northeastern University in Boston.</p> <p>Worse for McGlashan, according to the Justice Department\u2019s complaint, McGlashan discussed with these outside parties repeating the ACT cheating scheme for his two younger children, and parts of these conversations were recorded via a court-authorized wiretap. Here\u2019s just one outtake of many with a participant turned cooperating witness (identified as CW-1):</p> <p><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: One other, just family question, with [my younger son] now entering his sophomore year, and sort of, the process is beginning, we have him on time and a half. I told [my spouse] yesterday, and [my daughter] by the way, who is the, who I think is the one who needs the most time, has no extra time currently. And [my spouse] is talking to the doctor that assessed them, to get her to ask, to request time for [my daughter]. I told her she should be requesting double time for all of them. </span></em></p> <p><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: 100% multiple days. No matter what, multiple days.

As remarkably, after McGlashan tells him that his family has images of the teenager playing lacrosse and is told by the cooperating witness that USC doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> a lacrosse team, McGlashan is then told that a picture of his son \u201cdoing something\u201d \u2013 \u2013 anything vaguely sporty, in other words \u2013 \u2013 will \u201cbe fine.\u201d</p> <p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: I have to do a profile for him in a sport, which is fine, I\u2019ll create it.

Others include actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.</p>\n<p>For McGlashan especially, whose job is ostensibly to make a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact, the charges are particularly damning, highlighting as they do how wealthy families sometimes use their financial muscle in socially unjust ways \u2014 in this case, paying to secure spots at colleges and depriving deserving students of admission in the process.</p>\n<p>Indeed, TPG seemingly had little choice but separating from McGlashan, at least for now. In making its case against McGlashan and the others, the Justice Department has laid bare each party\u2019s alleged wrongdoings with<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1142876/download\"> painstaking specificity</a>.</p>\n<p>For his part, McGlashan has been charged with both participating in a college entrance exam cheating scheme and recruitment scheme, including by trying to bribe the senior athletic director at USC, and by paying test center administrators willing to accept bribes to give his oldest son more time to take a college entrance exam than is usually allotted students \u2014 and in a special test center where his answers would be corrected after he had completed the test (unbeknownst to him).</p>\n<p>McGlashan also allegedly signed-off on plans to doctor a photo that would make McGlashan\u2019s son look like a football recruit and, as McGlashan was told, thus more desirable to the specialty program in arts, technology and business at USC that his son hoped to attend.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t all theoretical. According to the Justice Department, after McGlashan\u2019s son took the test in Florida and after the proctor corrected his answers to produce a score of 34 out of 36, it was provided as part of his application to Northeastern University in Boston.</p>\n<p>Worse for McGlashan, according to the Justice Department\u2019s complaint, McGlashan discussed with these outside parties repeating the ACT cheating scheme for his two younger children, and parts of these conversations were recorded via a court-authorized wiretap. Here\u2019s just one outtake of many with a participant turned cooperating witness (identified as CW-1):</p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: One other, just family question, with [my younger son] now entering his sophomore year, and sort of, the process is beginning, we have him on time and a half. I told [my spouse] yesterday, and [my daughter] by the way, who is the, who I think is the one who needs the most time, has no extra time currently. And [my spouse] is talking to the doctor that assessed them, to get her to ask, to request time for [my daughter]. I told her she should be requesting double time for all of them. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: 100% multiple days. No matter what, multiple days. So, even if it\u2019s 50%, time and a half, multiple days. </span></em></p>\n<p>During the call, McGlashan also tries to ensure that his son won\u2019t know that his scores have been tampered with, or the degree to which McGlashan has inserted himself into the process.</p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Now does he, here\u2019s the only question, does he know? Is there a way to do it in a way that he doesn\u2019t know that happened? </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: Oh yeah. Oh he\u2013 </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Great. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: What he would know is, that I\u2019m going to take his stuff, and I\u2019m going to get him some help, okay? </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: So that, that he would have no issue with. You lobbying for him. You helping use your network. No issue. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: That letter, that letter comes to you. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Yup. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: So, my families want to know this is done. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Yup. </span></em></p>\n<p>Somewhat unbelievably, the cooperating witness goes on to explain that to take advantage of a \u201cside door\u201d that could further strengthen the odds that McGlashan\u2019s son will be accepted at USC, he will need to create a fake athletic profile for McGlashan\u2019s son, which he says he has done \u201ca million times\u201d for other families. As remarkably, after McGlashan tells him that his family has images of the teenager playing lacrosse and is told by the cooperating witness that USC doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> a lacrosse team, McGlashan is then told that a picture of his son \u201cdoing something\u201d \u2013 \u2013 anything vaguely sporty, in other words \u2013 \u2013 will \u201cbe fine.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: I have to do a profile for him in a sport, which is fine, I\u2019ll create it. You know, I just need him\u2013 I\u2019ll pick a sport and we\u2019ll do a picture of him, or he can, we\u2019ll put his face on the picture whatever. Just so that he plays whatever. I\u2019ve already done that a million times. So\u2013 </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Well, we have images of him in lacrosse. I don\u2019t know if that matters. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: They don\u2019t have a lacrosse team. But as long as I can see him doing something, that would be fine. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Yeah. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: And then what happens is, then what you have to do, because this would be a specialty program, is that you have to then talk to the department and say, \u201cHey listen, can you take him in the department? We\u2019ve gotten him accepted into the university.\u201d </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Yup. Well I can handle, I think I, I mean, I\u2019ll know after this lunch. I think I can handle them at Iovine and Young. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: Right. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Yeah. Which is where he really wants to go. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: Right. So you\u2019re saying, \u201cHey listen, I think I can get him into this school.\u201d </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Yup. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: Now, now, can you, \u2019cause they\u2019re going to come to you and say, this is a selective program, would you want this kid? And he\u2019s quote an \u201cathlete\u201d who\u2019s coming to you. In fact, would you take him? And the department says yes.</span></em></p>\n<p>Again, McGlashan worries about his son learning of his involvement and wonders if he should try USC\u2019s board instead, where he knows \u201chalf\u201d the directors. He\u2019s advised against reaching out to his contacts there, however.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Now, would he see that, \u2019cause that, he\u2019s going to be fairly well seen at the school, because half the board knows me, and I\u2019m going to be sort of 64 calling in and asking people to help, you know [Board Member 1] and [Board Member 2], and all those guys? </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: But, so\u2013 what I would suggest is, have you called them? Any of them yet? </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: No. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: Good, don\u2019t. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Okay. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: Because you don\u2019t need, because when this, the way this, the quieter it, the quieter this is, the better it is, so people don\u2019t say, \u201cWell, okay, this guy, why are all these people calling us? The kid\u2019s already been accepted. He\u2019s coming here as an athlete. He\u2019s already in.\u201d What you just want is, the person you\u2019re meeting with on Friday to say, you know, what we want [is] this kid. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: So he doesn\u2019t have to know how he got in. Is that the case? </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: What I would say to him, if you want to have that discussion now with [your son] there, that we have friends in athletics, they are going to help us, because [he] is an athlete, and they\u2019re going to help us. From the\u2013 </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: But I can\u2019t say that in front of [my son], \u2019cause he knows he\u2019s not. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: No, no, right. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Yeah. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: And just say, you know what, we\u2019re going to get, we\u2019re going to get some, we\u2019re going to get people to help us. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">McGLASHAN: Why wouldn\u2019t, why wouldn\u2019t I say, \u201cLook, leave it to me to worry about getting him in, \u2019cause I have a lot of friends involved in the school.\u201d </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">CW-1: Perfect, perfect.\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p>Ultimately, McGlashan shelled out more than $250,000 in the scheme. Unfortunately for everyone involved, the decision to get involved in his son\u2019s college admissions process may wind up costing much more than that.</p>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"article-footer\">\n<input class=\"shortlink\" readonly=\"\" title=\"Article Shortlink\" type=\"text\" value=\"\"/>\n</footer>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div><!-- end React-root duplication div -->\n</div><!--end #root-->\n<noscript style=\"display:none;\">\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&amp;ev=PageView&amp;noscript=1\" width=\"1\"/>\n</noscript>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t// Configure the PARSELY window global to disable auto-tracking.\n\t\t// Must load before the Parse.ly script itself.\n\t\twindow.PARSELY = {\n\t\t\tautotrack: false,\n\t\t\tonload:    this.onload,\n\t\t};\n\t</script>\n<script data-parsely-site=\"techcrunch.com\" id=\"parsely-cfg\" src=\"//d1z2jf7jlzjs58.cloudfront.net/keys/techcrunch.com/p.js\"></script>\n<!-- JSON-LD -->\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n\t\t{\"@context\":\"http:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"TechCrunch\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"imageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/themes\\/techcrunch-2017\\/images\\/logo-json-ld.png\",\"width\":\"600\",\"height\":\"60\"}},\"@type\":\"NewsArticle\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/03\\/12\\/tpgs-bill-mcglashan-is-put-on-indefinite-leave-after-being-caught-up-in-a-gigantic-college-admissions-cheating-scandal\\/\"},\"headline\":\"TPG&#8217;s Bill McGlashan is put on indefinite leave after being charged in a giant college admissions cheating scandal\",\"image\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/03\\/Screenshot-2019-03-12-15.28.49.png?w=680\",\"width\":680,\"height\":452},\"datePublished\":\"2019-03-12T22:49:48+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2019-03-19T23:19:24+00:00\",\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Connie Loizos\"}],\"description\":\"Bill McGlashan, who built his career as a top investor at the private equity firm TPG, has been put on &#8220;indefinite administrative leave, effective immediately,&#8221; says the firm after McGlashan was caught up in what the Justice Department said today is the largest college admissions scandal it has ever prosecuted.

built his career as a top investor at the private equity firm <a class=\\\"crunchbase-link\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/texas-pacific-group\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-type=\\\"organization\\\" data-entity=\\\"texas-pacific-group\\\">TPG, <span class=\\\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\\\"><\\/span><\\/a> has been put on &#8220;indefinite administrative leave, effective immediately,&#8221; says the firm after McGlashan was caught up in what the Justice Department said today is the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2019\\/03\\/12\\/us\\/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-massimo-giannulli.html\\\">largest college admissions scandal<\\/a> it has ever prosecuted.<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\\\">McGlashan is among 49 others accused of participating in a bribery ring involving parents, admissions counselors, and athletic coaches at Yale, Wake Forest, and the University of Southern California (USC), among other institutions, in an effort to secure spots for their children at the schools.<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\\\">\\u201cAs a result of the charges of personal misconduct&#8221; against McGlashan, said the firm just now, Jim Coulter, Co-CEO of TPG, will be &#8220;interim managing partner&#8221; of the parts of TPG that McGlashan oversees, including TPG Growth and The Rise Fund.<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\\\">&#8220;Mr. Coulter will, in partnership with the organization\\u2019s executive team, lead all investment work for both going forward,&#8221; according to a statement sent us by the firm.<\\/p>\\n<p id=\\\"speakable-summary\\\">McGlashan, who joined the private equity giant TPG in 2003, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.strictlyvc.com\\/2015\\/05\\/01\\/tpg-growths-bill-mcglashan-were-no-stranger-to-startups\\/\\\">first to rethink and lead its earlier-stage strategy<\\/a> and, in more recent years, to <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2016\\/12\\/19\\/business\\/dealbook\\/a-new-fund-seeks-both-financial-and-social-returns.html\\\">lead its social impact strategy<\\/a> under the Rise Fund brand, is one of 33 parents being accused of trying to buy their kids&#8217; admission. Others include actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.<\\/p>\\n<p>For McGlashan especially, whose job is ostensibly to make a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact, the charges are particularly damning, highlighting as they do how wealthy families sometimes use their financial muscle in socially unjust ways &#8212; in this case, paying to secure spots at colleges and depriving deserving students of admission in the process.<\\/p>\\n<p>Indeed, TPG seemingly had little choice but separating from McGlashan, at least for now. In making its case against McGlashan and the others, the Justice Department has laid bare each party&#8217;s alleged wrongdoings with<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.justice.gov\\/file\\/1142876\\/download\\\"> painstaking specificity<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>For his part, McGlashan has been charged with both participating in a college entrance exam cheating scheme and recruitment scheme, including by trying to bribe the senior athletic director at USC, and by paying test center administrators willing to accept bribes to give his oldest son more time to take a college entrance exam than is usually allotted students &#8212; and in a special test center where his answers would be corrected after he had completed the test (unbeknownst to him).<\\/p>\\n<p>McGlashan also allegedly signed-off on plans to doctor a photo that would make McGlashan&#8217;s son look like a football recruit and, as McGlashan was told, thus more desirable to the specialty program in arts, technology and business at USC that his son hoped to attend.<\\/p>\\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t all theoretical. According to the Justice Department, after McGlashan&#8217;s son took the test in Florida and after the proctor corrected his answers to produce a score of 34 out of 36, it was provided as part of his application to Northeastern University in Boston.<\\/p>\\n<p>Worse for McGlashan, according to the Justice Department&#8217;s complaint, McGlashan discussed with these outside parties repeating the ACT cheating scheme for his two younger children, and parts of these conversations were recorded via a court-authorized wiretap. Here&#8217;s just one outtake of many with a participant turned cooperating witness (identified as CW-1):<\\/p>\\n<p><em><span class=\\\"s1\\\">McGLASHAN: One other, just family question, with [my younger son] now entering his sophomore year, and sort of, the process is beginning, we have him on time and a half. I told [my spouse] yesterday, and [my daughter] by the way, who is the, who I think is the one who needs the most time, has no extra time currently. And [my spouse] is talking to the doctor that assessed them, to get her to ask, to request time for [my daughter]. I told her she should be requesting double time for all of them. <\\/span><\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><em><span class=\\\"s1\\\">CW-1: 100% multiple days. No matter what, multiple days. So, even if it\\u2019s 50%, time and a half, multiple days. <\\/span><\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p>During the call, McGlashan also tries to ensure that his son won&#8217;t know that his scores have been tampered with, or the degree to which McGlashan has inserted himself into the process.<\\/p>\\n<p><em><span class=\\\"s1\\\">McGLASHAN: Now does he, here\\u2019s the only question, does he know? Is there a way to do it in a way that he doesn\\u2019t know that happened? <\\/span><\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><em><span class=\\\"s1\\\">CW-1: Oh yeah. Oh he&#8211; <\\/span><\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><em><span class=\\\"s1\\\">McGLASHAN: Great. <\\/span><\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><em><span class=\\\"s1\\\">CW-1: What he would know is, that I\\u2019m going to take his stuff, and I\\u2019m going to get him some help, okay? <\\/span><\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><em><span class=\\\"s1\\\">McGLASHAN: So that, that he would have no issue with.

As remarkably, after McGlashan tells him that his family has images of the teenager playing lacrosse and is told by the cooperating witness that USC doesn&#8217;t <em>have<\\/em> a lacrosse team, McGlashan is then told that a picture of his son &#8220;doing something&#8221; &#8211; &#8211; anything vaguely sporty, in other words &#8211; &#8211; will &#8220;be fine.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><em><span class=\\\"s1\\\">CW-1: I have to do a profile for him in a sport, which is fine, I\\u2019ll create it.

And the department says yes.<\\/span><\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p>Again, McGlashan worries about his son learning of his involvement and wonders if he should try USC&#8217;s board instead, where he knows &#8220;half&#8221; the directors.

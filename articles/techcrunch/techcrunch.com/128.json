{"content_html": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">I\u2019ve been podcasting</span> in various forms for about a dozen years now. Sometimes it has been within the corporate confines of the various publications I\u2019ve worked for and sometimes it has just been for myself. That\u2019s the beauty of podcasting \u2014 there\u2019s no overhead.</p> <p>It can be recorded on a terrible Skype line or meticulously crafted by an army of producers. You can do it for five listeners or five million. Do a five-episode miniseries or suddenly look at the calendar one day and realize you\u2019ve been putting up an episode a week for five years.</p> <p><a href=\"http://riylcast.tumblr.com/\">My current podcast, RiYL</a>, falls into the latter category. Episode 322 just posted this weekend. That\u2019s a lifetime in podcast years, and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say there\u2019s no way the show would have lasted this long had I not assembled the proper gear.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that doing the show has been an ongoing process of refining my setup, both in terms of recording hardware and the software workflow, but the core components have been in place for a while. A number of my more successful friends have invested thousands to build home studios that sound as professional as any NPR affiliate.</p> <p>For me, however, the key has always been mobility. I\u2019ve fine-tuned a podcasting rig that sounds good, but is small enough to slip into a laptop sleeve. Leave no trace, as the saying goes.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Always keep a podcasting rig you can fit in a laptop sleeve. <a href=\"https://t.co/BAwbHAuzKG\">pic.twitter.com/BAwbHAuzKG</a></p> <p>\u2014 Brian Heater (@bheater) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1088595645013864448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 25, 2019</a></p> <p></p> <p>The motivation dates back to the show\u2019s humble beginnings (though, for the record, the first few episodes <em>were</em> done over Skype as I was still figuring things out). I realized pretty early on that getting touring artists and musicians to come to my place in Queens (with a few exceptions) was going to be a non-starter.</p> <p>Piecing together a lightweight rig has given me the flexibility to meet people where they are, be it a hotel room, bar or their PR rep\u2019s conference room. And now that I travel pretty regularly for work, it means I can easily slip the setup into a carry-on, so I can meet guests in their hometowns.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a photo of upcoming guest Hannibal Buress, recorded in my hotel room in Lagos, Nigeria. My setup is placed gingerly atop my overturned suitcase on a coffee table. He\u2019s clearly impressed.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781600\" height=\"510\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p> <p>The other thing the setup has helped me realize is that people\u2019s expectations for professionalism has shifted considerably in recent decades. My rig is small and simple, but various guests have commented over the years that they\u2019re impressed. The last person who interviewed them had them speak into their iPhone.</p> <p>At the very least, this is certainly better than that.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the end-all, be-all, by any stretch of the imagination. This is just what has worked for me. Over the years, I\u2019ve had plenty of people \u2014 guests and otherwise \u2014 ask me what I use. Also, in the wake of last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/why-spotify-is-betting-big-on-podcasting/\">Spotify acquisition of Anchor and Gimlet</a>, podcasts are, once again, the hot newness. So now seemed like as good a time as any to get this all down on paper.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781594\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?w=500\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" width=\"500\"/></p> <p><strong>TASCAM DR-40 4-Track Portable Digital Recorder ($170):</strong> This was my first acquisition and the one piece of hardware I\u2019ve held onto through the duration of the show (though for the record, I\u2019ve purchased it twice after an unfortunate incident with a lost backpack).</p> <p>Zoom and Roland also make solid multi-track recorders that will probably be interchangeable for most. The key is finding a system you like that sports dual XLR mic inputs that you can monitor on the fly. They pretty much all have built-in mics, but you\u2019re not going to want to rely on room mics for a podcast. It sounds like crap and it\u2019s a nightmare to edit if you\u2019ve got more than one speaker.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781601\" height=\"453\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p> <p>Recording works like a charm. The system records each mic to a left and right channel, which it saves as a WAV file on an SD card. Just make sure the mics are placed at a sufficient distance, so you don\u2019t pick up too much cross talk.</p> <p>Of course, here you\u2019re limited to two mics. That\u2019s been an issue at points when entire bands have wanted to join in on the fun. The aforementioned companies do make recorders with more inputs. Those are generally larger and a lot pricier, though.</p> <p>Honorable mention here goes to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/the-rodecaster-pro-is-a-perfect-centerpiece-to-a-home-podcasting-studio/\">Rodecaster</a>. The board is really great at what it does. We recorded an episode of TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/23/original-content-roma/\">Original Content</a> on the thing, with it doing guest duties and producing in real time. The recent addition of multi-track recording makes this thing an absolute killer.</p> <p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200px\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" src=\"https://embed.simplecast.com/568d68e6\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p> <p>It has eight channels, including multiple mic inputs, triggerable sound pads and the ability to beam someone in via phone.\u00a0If I was setting up a home studio on the cheap, I would shell out for one of these, no questions asked. That said, it\u2019s just way too large for my current needs.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781596\" height=\"550\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.53-PM.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.53-PM.png 1006w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.53-PM.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.53-PM.png?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.53-PM.png?resize=768,621 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.53-PM.png?resize=680,550 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.53-PM.png?resize=50,40 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p> <p><strong>Weymic New Wm57 ($10):</strong> Okay, true story. Right after I bought the TASCAM, I invested in a pair of super-cheap mics. They sounded\u2026 OK, but the presentation was lacking. One afternoon, I went to Reggie Watts\u2019 Brooklyn apartment to record an episode. I handed him a mic. He looked it over, moved it around in his hand a bit, then slyly unplugged it and reached into a drawer behind him, grabbed a mic and popped it on.</p> <p>The guy knows from microphones.</p> <p>My takeaway here is that presentation is important. Looks matter, as does weight. A microphone should have some heft to it. People\u2019s expectations have lowered with regards to what an audio setup looks like, but you need good mics if pros are going to take you seriously.</p> <p>I\u2019ve since been through various mics, and lately I\u2019ve settled on these things. For the record, they\u2019re a wholesale knock-off of the Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphone \u2014 the go-to microphone for podcasters. The SM57 is the thing I assume Marc Maron and Terry Gross would talk about if they had to share an Uber Pool to Silver Lake.</p> <p>The Weymic looks nearly identical and sounds great for one-tenth the price. Don\u2019t ask me how. And hey, I\u2019m not exactly swimming in Casper ad revenue here. Also do yourself a favor and invest in a couple of foam windscreens to cut down on sibilance. You can get a bunch in a pack for cheap.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781597\" height=\"525\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png 981w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=50,39 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p> <p><strong>Universal Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand Portable Foldable Tripod (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Adjustable-Microphone-Portable-Foldable/dp/B01H248DQ4\">Two for $15</a>):</strong> I\u2019m embarrassed to admit how long it took me to add these to the repertoire. Guests jostle mics a lot during long interviews, and that stuff picks up. I\u2019ve also had a number of older guests on the show, and asking them to hold a microphone for 45 minutes to an hour is just cruel.</p> <p>These, picked up from Amazon, are super-cheap and fold up into nothing, making them perfect for my laptop-sleeve constraints. The only issues are: 1) They\u2019re not great for super-tall guests. I recently had a member of the band Health on the show and ended up sticking the stand precariously atop a pile of several books; and 2) The screws loosen themselves like crazy for some reason, so I just purchased a pair of keychain screw drivers to keep them in check.</p> <p>I pair all of that with a couple of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNLTTKS/\">six-foot XLR mic cables</a>\u00a0($7 a piece for Amazon basics) and some velcro ties. Those fit nicely in the outside pocket of the laptop sleeve, along with backup batteries.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781598\" height=\"510\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p> <p><strong>Audacity/Garage Band:</strong> Sometimes you just stick with the workflow you\u2019ve got. I should probably upgrade to <strong>Adobe Audition</strong>\u00a0(maybe this article will be what motivates me) one of these days, but I\u2019ve been using Audacity for like 10 years at this point. It\u2019s simple and it works fine for chopping up a show. That\u2019s my biggest complaint with a number of the free apps like Anchor \u2014 they mostly suck when it comes to editing a show.</p> <p>And editing is important. It\u2019s true that another one of the wonderful things about podcasts is they can be as long or as short as you want, but everything can benefit from a little tightening up. I also spend a lot of time adjusting levels (often on the subway ride home). And make sure to record a little room tone to get rid of ambient noise in post.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781599\" height=\"510\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p> <p>After the show is edited, I export it as a single track and import it into my show template in Garage Band. That\u2019s where I add the music beds, outros and the like.</p> <p><strong>Podbean:</strong> A couple of friends are launching a podcast soon. They asked me who I use for hosting. Podbean is something I found early on. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend the service, but I\u2019m 300+ episodes deep at this point. There are a lot of options out there, so shop around a bit. Anchor is compelling for novices, including its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/anchor-wants-a-future-where-everyone-reads-squarespace-ads/\">built-in ad-servicing</a> (though I\u2019m a little wary of how the Spotify acquisition will play out) and a lot of my friends swear by Libsyn for more popular shows. Heck, even SoundCloud has a decent option.</p> <p>Everyone has an embedded player and the means with which to syndicate to iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, et al.</p> <p>I\u2019ve found Podbean to be a bit clunky and the service has experienced a handful of outages. That said, recent additions have streamlined the program, and they\u2019ve added some pretty decent analytics to the backend, so it\u2019s definitely headed in the right direction.

You can do it for five listeners or five million. Do a five-episode miniseries or suddenly look at the calendar one day and realize you\u2019ve been putting up an episode a week for five years.  My current podcast, RiYL  , falls into the latter category. Episode 322 just posted this weekend. That\u2019s a lifetime in podcast years, and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say there\u2019s no way the show would have lasted this long had I not assembled the proper gear.  It\u2019s true that doing the show has been an ongoing process of refining my setup, both in terms of recording hardware and the software workflow, but the core components have been in place for a while. A number of my more successful friends have invested thousands to build home studios that sound as professional as any NPR affiliate.  For me, however, the key has always been mobility. I\u2019ve fine-tuned a podcasting rig that sounds good, but is small enough to slip into a laptop sleeve. Leave no trace, as the saying goes.  Always keep a podcasting rig you can fit in a laptop sleeve.  pic.twitter.com/BAwbHAuzKG   \u2014 Brian Heater (@bheater)  January 25, 2019    The motivation dates back to the show\u2019s humble beginnings (though, for the record, the first few episodes  were   done over Skype as I was still figuring things out). I realized pretty early on that getting touring artists and musicians to come to my place in Queens (with a few exceptions) was going to be a non-starter.  Piecing together a lightweight rig has given me the flexibility to meet people where they are, be it a hotel room, bar or their PR rep\u2019s conference room. And now that I travel pretty regularly for work, it means I can easily slip the setup into a carry-on, so I can meet guests in their hometowns.  Here\u2019s a photo of upcoming guest Hannibal Buress, recorded in my hotel room in Lagos, Nigeria. My setup is placed gingerly atop my overturned suitcase on a coffee table. He\u2019s clearly impressed.    The other thing the setup has helped me realize is that people\u2019s expectations for professionalism has shifted considerably in recent decades. My rig is small and simple, but various guests have commented over the years that they\u2019re impressed. The last person who interviewed them had them speak into their iPhone.  At the very least, this is certainly better than that.  It\u2019s not the end-all, be-all, by any stretch of the imagination. This is just what has worked for me. Over the years, I\u2019ve had plenty of people \u2014 guests and otherwise \u2014 ask me what I use. Also, in the wake of last week\u2019s  Spotify acquisition of Anchor and Gimlet  , podcasts are, once again, the hot newness. So now seemed like as good a time as any to get this all down on paper.    TASCAM DR-40 4-Track Portable Digital Recorder ($170):   This was my first acquisition and the one piece of hardware I\u2019ve held onto through the duration of the show (though for the record, I\u2019ve purchased it twice after an unfortunate incident with a lost backpack).  Zoom and Roland also make solid multi-track recorders that will probably be interchangeable for most. The key is finding a system you like that sports dual XLR mic inputs that you can monitor on the fly. They pretty much all have built-in mics, but you\u2019re not going to want to rely on room mics for a podcast. It sounds like crap and it\u2019s a nightmare to edit if you\u2019ve got more than one speaker.    Recording works like a charm. The system records each mic to a left and right channel, which it saves as a WAV file on an SD card. Just make sure the mics are placed at a sufficient distance, so you don\u2019t pick up too much cross talk.  Of course, here you\u2019re limited to two mics. That\u2019s been an issue at points when entire bands have wanted to join in on the fun. The aforementioned companies do make recorders with more inputs. Those are generally larger and a lot pricier, though.  Honorable mention here goes to the  Rodecaster  . The board is really great at what it does. We recorded an episode of TechCrunch  Original Content   on the thing, with it doing guest duties and producing in real time. The recent addition of multi-track recording makes this thing an absolute killer.    It has eight channels, including multiple mic inputs, triggerable sound pads and the ability to beam someone in via phone.\u00a0If I was setting up a home studio on the cheap, I would shell out for one of these, no questions asked. That said, it\u2019s just way too large for my current needs.    Weymic New Wm57 ($10):   Okay, true story. Right after I bought the TASCAM, I invested in a pair of super-cheap mics. They sounded\u2026 OK, but the presentation was lacking. One afternoon, I went to Reggie Watts\u2019 Brooklyn apartment to record an episode. I handed him a mic. He looked it over, moved it around in his hand a bit, then slyly unplugged it and reached into a drawer behind him, grabbed a mic and popped it on.  The guy knows from microphones.  My takeaway here is that presentation is important. Looks matter, as does weight. A microphone should have some heft to it. People\u2019s expectations have lowered with regards to what an audio setup looks like, but you need good mics if pros are going to take you seriously.  I\u2019ve since been through various mics, and lately I\u2019ve settled on these things. For the record, they\u2019re a wholesale knock-off of the Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphone \u2014 the go-to microphone for podcasters. The SM57 is the thing I assume Marc Maron and Terry Gross would talk about if they had to share an Uber Pool to Silver Lake.  The Weymic looks nearly identical and sounds great for one-tenth the price. Don\u2019t ask me how. And hey, I\u2019m not exactly swimming in Casper ad revenue here. Also do yourself a favor and invest in a couple of foam windscreens to cut down on sibilance. You can get a bunch in a pack for cheap.    Universal Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand Portable Foldable Tripod ( Two for $15  ):   I\u2019m embarrassed to admit how long it took me to add these to the repertoire. Guests jostle mics a lot during long interviews, and that stuff picks up. I\u2019ve also had a number of older guests on the show, and asking them to hold a microphone for 45 minutes to an hour is just cruel.  These, picked up from Amazon, are super-cheap and fold up into nothing, making them perfect for my laptop-sleeve constraints. The only issues are: 1) They\u2019re not great for super-tall guests. I recently had a member of the band Health on the show and ended up sticking the stand precariously atop a pile of several books; and 2) The screws loosen themselves like crazy for some reason, so I just purchased a pair of keychain screw drivers to keep them in check.  I pair all of that with a couple of  six-foot XLR mic cables  \u00a0($7 a piece for Amazon basics) and some velcro ties. Those fit nicely in the outside pocket of the laptop sleeve, along with backup batteries.    Audacity/Garage Band:   Sometimes you just stick with the workflow you\u2019ve got. I should probably upgrade to  Adobe Audition  \u00a0(maybe this article will be what motivates me) one of these days, but I\u2019ve been using Audacity for like 10 years at this point. It\u2019s simple and it works fine for chopping up a show. That\u2019s my biggest complaint with a number of the free apps like Anchor \u2014 they mostly suck when it comes to editing a show.  And editing is important. It\u2019s true that another one of the wonderful things about podcasts is they can be as long or as short as you want, but everything can benefit from a little tightening up. I also spend a lot of time adjusting levels (often on the subway ride home). And make sure to record a little room tone to get rid of ambient noise in post.    After the show is edited, I export it as a single track and import it into my show template in Garage Band. That\u2019s where I add the music beds, outros and the like.  Podbean:   A couple of friends are launching a podcast soon. They asked me who I use for hosting. Podbean is something I found early on. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend the service, but I\u2019m 300+ episodes deep at this point. There are a lot of options out there, so shop around a bit. Anchor is compelling for novices, including its  built-in ad-servicing   (though I\u2019m a little wary of how the Spotify acquisition will play out) and a lot of my friends swear by Libsyn for more popular shows. Heck, even SoundCloud has a decent option.  Everyone has an embedded player and the means with which to syndicate to iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, et al.  I\u2019ve found Podbean to be a bit clunky and the service has experienced a handful of outages. That said, recent additions have streamlined the program, and they\u2019ve added some pretty decent analytics to the backend, so it\u2019s definitely headed in the right direction. Once uploaded, I  embed that into a Tumblr post  .  This week on RiYL, a frank discussion with  @michaelfranti   about the power of human connections and optimism in a difficult world.  https://t.co/Q8Y6joNlCy    #riylcast    pic.twitter.com/PoVseiihWf   \u2014 Brian Heater (@bheater)  February 11, 2019    Headliner:     I\u2019ve tried a number of speech visualizers for promoting the show. I found Anchor\u2019s clunky.  Wavve\u2019s was decent  , but they start charging you after your first 30-second clip. I only just started using Headliner this week, and it\u2019s terrific. Easy to use, highly customizable and, best of all, free.  The transcriptions are okay for a free service (you\u2019re going to have to clean them up) and the online editing tools are great. I think I\u2019m sticking with this one for a while.  Additional shout-outs to  Google Drive.   The first thing I do after transferring files from my desktop is back them up here. It\u2019s the one place where I\u2019ve got all my files and has helped quite a bit with scheduling episodes.  YouTube   is another  recent experiment for me  . I\u2019ve been syndicating the show to all of the usual places, as mentioned above, but it recently occurred to me that people use the video platform to listen to audio programs. I asked a bunch of folks on Facebook and found it to be surprisingly popular. This will become increasingly important as more people purchase screen-sporting assistants like Google Home Hub and the Amazon Show. It\u2019s a new thing for me and I\u2019ve only got a handful of subscribers at the moment, but I\u2019ll let you know how that goes.  I do still find myself recording remotely from time to time.  Auto podcaster   extraordinaire\u00a0 Kirsten   recently introduced me to  Zencastr  , which is great for this purpose, recording each caller remotely and backing up those files to a server. If I\u2019m using Skype, I go with the old standby,  Ecamm\u2019s Call Recorder  , to record locally.    I\u2019ve also become attached to  Blue\u2019s Raspberry USB mic   \u00a0for this purpose. It\u2019s adorable and tiny, so you can stash it in a backpack for travel. It\u2019s not the best-sounding mic, but it\u2019s good for its size and it sounds a hell of a lot better than the company\u2019s  Yeti Nano  . Rode\u2019s got  a company of models   with optional windscreens I\u2019ve been meaning to check out as well, but I\u2019ve heard good things.  If you\u2019re hip to any new tools you think I should check out, hit me up on Twitter at  @bheater.  \u00a0I\u2019m always looking for ways to step up my game.

That\u2019s the beauty of podcasting \u2014 there\u2019s no overhead.</p>\n<p>It can be recorded on a terrible Skype line or meticulously crafted by an army of producers. You can do it for five listeners or five million. Do a five-episode miniseries or suddenly look at the calendar one day and realize you\u2019ve been putting up an episode a week for five years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://riylcast.tumblr.com/\">My current podcast, RiYL</a>, falls into the latter category. Episode 322 just posted this weekend. That\u2019s a lifetime in podcast years, and I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say there\u2019s no way the show would have lasted this long had I not assembled the proper gear.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true that doing the show has been an ongoing process of refining my setup, both in terms of recording hardware and the software workflow, but the core components have been in place for a while. A number of my more successful friends have invested thousands to build home studios that sound as professional as any NPR affiliate.</p>\n<p>For me, however, the key has always been mobility. I\u2019ve fine-tuned a podcasting rig that sounds good, but is small enough to slip into a laptop sleeve. Leave no trace, as the saying goes.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Always keep a podcasting rig you can fit in a laptop sleeve. <a href=\"https://t.co/BAwbHAuzKG\">pic.twitter.com/BAwbHAuzKG</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Brian Heater (@bheater) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1088595645013864448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 25, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p></div>\n<p>The motivation dates back to the show\u2019s humble beginnings (though, for the record, the first few episodes <em>were</em> done over Skype as I was still figuring things out). I realized pretty early on that getting touring artists and musicians to come to my place in Queens (with a few exceptions) was going to be a non-starter.</p>\n<p>Piecing together a lightweight rig has given me the flexibility to meet people where they are, be it a hotel room, bar or their PR rep\u2019s conference room. And now that I travel pretty regularly for work, it means I can easily slip the setup into a carry-on, so I can meet guests in their hometowns.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a photo of upcoming guest Hannibal Buress, recorded in my hotel room in Lagos, Nigeria. My setup is placed gingerly atop my overturned suitcase on a coffee table. He\u2019s clearly impressed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781600\" height=\"510\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/48277441_10156211137898737_2236341062450806784_n.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p>\n<p>The other thing the setup has helped me realize is that people\u2019s expectations for professionalism has shifted considerably in recent decades. My rig is small and simple, but various guests have commented over the years that they\u2019re impressed. The last person who interviewed them had them speak into their iPhone.</p>\n<p>At the very least, this is certainly better than that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the end-all, be-all, by any stretch of the imagination. This is just what has worked for me. Over the years, I\u2019ve had plenty of people \u2014 guests and otherwise \u2014 ask me what I use. Also, in the wake of last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/why-spotify-is-betting-big-on-podcasting/\">Spotify acquisition of Anchor and Gimlet</a>, podcasts are, once again, the hot newness. So now seemed like as good a time as any to get this all down on paper.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781594\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?w=500\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/H76810000000000-00-500x500.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<p><strong>TASCAM DR-40 4-Track Portable Digital Recorder ($170):</strong> This was my first acquisition and the one piece of hardware I\u2019ve held onto through the duration of the show (though for the record, I\u2019ve purchased it twice after an unfortunate incident with a lost backpack).</p>\n<p>Zoom and Roland also make solid multi-track recorders that will probably be interchangeable for most. The key is finding a system you like that sports dual XLR mic inputs that you can monitor on the fly. They pretty much all have built-in mics, but you\u2019re not going to want to rely on room mics for a podcast. It sounds like crap and it\u2019s a nightmare to edit if you\u2019ve got more than one speaker.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781601\" height=\"453\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3Q5A6055.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p>\n<p>Recording works like a charm. The system records each mic to a left and right channel, which it saves as a WAV file on an SD card. Just make sure the mics are placed at a sufficient distance, so you don\u2019t pick up too much cross talk.</p>\n<p>Of course, here you\u2019re limited to two mics. That\u2019s been an issue at points when entire bands have wanted to join in on the fun. The aforementioned companies do make recorders with more inputs. Those are generally larger and a lot pricier, though.</p>\n<p>Honorable mention here goes to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/the-rodecaster-pro-is-a-perfect-centerpiece-to-a-home-podcasting-studio/\">Rodecaster</a>. The board is really great at what it does. We recorded an episode of TechCrunch <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/23/original-content-roma/\">Original Content</a> on the thing, with it doing guest duties and producing in real time.

Right after I bought the TASCAM, I invested in a pair of super-cheap mics. They sounded\u2026 OK, but the presentation was lacking. One afternoon, I went to Reggie Watts\u2019 Brooklyn apartment to record an episode. I handed him a mic. He looked it over, moved it around in his hand a bit, then slyly unplugged it and reached into a drawer behind him, grabbed a mic and popped it on.</p>\n<p>The guy knows from microphones.</p>\n<p>My takeaway here is that presentation is important. Looks matter, as does weight. A microphone should have some heft to it. People\u2019s expectations have lowered with regards to what an audio setup looks like, but you need good mics if pros are going to take you seriously.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve since been through various mics, and lately I\u2019ve settled on these things. For the record, they\u2019re a wholesale knock-off of the Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphone \u2014 the go-to microphone for podcasters. The SM57 is the thing I assume Marc Maron and Terry Gross would talk about if they had to share an Uber Pool to Silver Lake.</p>\n<p>The Weymic looks nearly identical and sounds great for one-tenth the price. Don\u2019t ask me how. And hey, I\u2019m not exactly swimming in Casper ad revenue here. Also do yourself a favor and invest in a couple of foam windscreens to cut down on sibilance. You can get a bunch in a pack for cheap.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781597\" height=\"525\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png 981w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=50,39 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Universal Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand Portable Foldable Tripod (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Adjustable-Microphone-Portable-Foldable/dp/B01H248DQ4\">Two for $15</a>):</strong> I\u2019m embarrassed to admit how long it took me to add these to the repertoire. Guests jostle mics a lot during long interviews, and that stuff picks up. I\u2019ve also had a number of older guests on the show, and asking them to hold a microphone for 45 minutes to an hour is just cruel.</p>\n<p>These, picked up from Amazon, are super-cheap and fold up into nothing, making them perfect for my laptop-sleeve constraints. The only issues are: 1) They\u2019re not great for super-tall guests. I recently had a member of the band Health on the show and ended up sticking the stand precariously atop a pile of several books; and 2) The screws loosen themselves like crazy for some reason, so I just purchased a pair of keychain screw drivers to keep them in check.</p>\n<p>I pair all of that with a couple of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNLTTKS/\">six-foot XLR mic cables</a>\u00a0($7 a piece for Amazon basics) and some velcro ties. Those fit nicely in the outside pocket of the laptop sleeve, along with backup batteries.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781598\" height=\"510\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0988.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Audacity/Garage Band:</strong> Sometimes you just stick with the workflow you\u2019ve got. I should probably upgrade to <strong>Adobe Audition</strong>\u00a0(maybe this article will be what motivates me) one of these days, but I\u2019ve been using Audacity for like 10 years at this point. It\u2019s simple and it works fine for chopping up a show. That\u2019s my biggest complaint with a number of the free apps like Anchor \u2014 they mostly suck when it comes to editing a show.</p>\n<p>And editing is important. It\u2019s true that another one of the wonderful things about podcasts is they can be as long or as short as you want, but everything can benefit from a little tightening up. I also spend a lot of time adjusting levels (often on the subway ride home). And make sure to record a little room tone to get rid of ambient noise in post.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781599\" height=\"510\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3873.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" width=\"680\"/></p>\n<p>After the show is edited, I export it as a single track and import it into my show template in Garage Band. That\u2019s where I add the music beds, outros and the like.</p>\n<p><strong>Podbean:</strong> A couple of friends are launching a podcast soon. They asked me who I use for hosting. Podbean is something I found early on. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend the service, but I\u2019m 300+ episodes deep at this point. There are a lot of options out there, so shop around a bit. Anchor is compelling for novices, including its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/anchor-wants-a-future-where-everyone-reads-squarespace-ads/\">built-in ad-servicing</a> (though I\u2019m a little wary of how the Spotify acquisition will play out) and a lot of my friends swear by Libsyn for more popular shows. Heck, even SoundCloud has a decent option.</p>\n<p>Everyone has an embedded player and the means with which to syndicate to iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, et al.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found Podbean to be a bit clunky and the service has experienced a handful of outages. That said, recent additions have streamlined the program, and they\u2019ve added some pretty decent analytics to the backend, so it\u2019s definitely headed in the right direction.

I\u2019ve been syndicating the show to all of the usual places, as mentioned above, but it recently occurred to me that people use the video platform to listen to audio programs. I asked a bunch of folks on Facebook and found it to be surprisingly popular. This will become increasingly important as more people purchase screen-sporting assistants like Google Home Hub and the Amazon Show. It\u2019s a new thing for me and I\u2019ve only got a handful of subscribers at the moment, but I\u2019ll let you know how that goes.</p>\n<p>I do still find myself recording remotely from time to time. <a href=\"http://www.autonocast.com/\">Auto podcaster</a> extraordinaire\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec\">Kirsten</a> recently introduced me to <strong>Zencastr</strong>, which is great for this purpose, recording each caller remotely and backing up those files to a server.

I podcast\"},\"content\":{\"rendered\":\"<p id=\\\"speakable-summary\\\"><span class=\\\"featured__span-first-words\\\">I\\u2019ve been podcasting<\\/span> in various forms for about a dozen years now. Sometimes it has been within the corporate confines of the various publications I\\u2019ve worked for and sometimes it has just been for myself. That\\u2019s the beauty of podcasting &#8212; there\\u2019s no overhead.<\\/p>\\n<p>It can be recorded on a terrible Skype line or meticulously crafted by an army of producers. You can do it for five listeners or five million. Do a five-episode miniseries or suddenly look at the calendar one day and realize you\\u2019ve been putting up an episode a week for five years.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/riylcast.tumblr.com\\/\\\">My current podcast, RiYL<\\/a>, falls into the latter category. Episode 322 just posted this weekend. That\\u2019s a lifetime in podcast years, and I\\u2019m not exaggerating when I say there\\u2019s no way the show would have lasted this long had I not assembled the proper gear.<\\/p>\\n<p>It\\u2019s true that doing the show has been an ongoing process of refining my setup, both in terms of recording hardware and the software workflow, but the core components have been in place for a while. A number of my more successful friends have invested thousands to build home studios that sound as professional as any NPR affiliate.<\\/p>\\n<p>For me, however, the key has always been mobility. I\\u2019ve fine-tuned a podcasting rig that sounds good, but is small enough to slip into a laptop sleeve. Leave no trace, as the saying goes.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-width=\\\"550\\\" data-dnt=\\\"true\\\">\\n<p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Always keep a podcasting rig you can fit in a laptop sleeve. <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/t.co\\/BAwbHAuzKG\\\">pic.twitter.com\\/BAwbHAuzKG<\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>&mdash; Brian Heater (@bheater) <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/bheater\\/status\\/1088595645013864448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\\">January 25, 2019<\\/a><\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p><script async src=\\\"https:\\/\\/platform.twitter.com\\/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"><\\/script><\\/div>\\n<p>The motivation dates back to the show\\u2019s humble beginnings (though, for the record, the first few episodes <em>were<\\/em> done over Skype as I was still figuring things out). I realized pretty early on that getting touring artists and musicians to come to my place in Queens (with a few exceptions) was going to be a non-starter.<\\/p>\\n<p>Piecing together a lightweight rig has given me the flexibility to meet people where they are, be it a hotel room, bar or their PR rep\\u2019s conference room. And now that I travel pretty regularly for work, it means I can easily slip the setup into a carry-on, so I can meet guests in their hometowns.<\\/p>\\n<p>Here&#8217;s a photo of upcoming guest Hannibal Buress, recorded in my hotel room in Lagos, Nigeria. My setup is placed gingerly atop my overturned suitcase on a coffee table.

My rig is small and simple, but various guests have commented over the years that they\\u2019re impressed. The last person who interviewed them had them speak into their iPhone.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the very least, this is certainly better than that.<\\/p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s not the end-all, be-all, by any stretch of the imagination. This is just what has worked for me. Over the years, I\\u2019ve had plenty of people \\u2014 guests and otherwise \\u2014 ask me what I use. Also, in the wake of last week\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/02\\/06\\/why-spotify-is-betting-big-on-podcasting\\/\\\">Spotify acquisition of Anchor and Gimlet<\\/a>, podcasts are, once again, the hot newness.

The key is finding a system you like that sports dual XLR mic inputs that you can monitor on the fly.

The system records each mic to a left and right channel, which it saves as a WAV file on an SD card. Just make sure the mics are placed at a sufficient distance, so you don\\u2019t pick up too much cross talk.<\\/p>\\n<p>Of course, here you&#8217;re limited to two mics.

Right after I bought the TASCAM, I invested in a pair of super-cheap mics. They sounded\\u2026 OK, but the presentation was lacking. One afternoon, I went to Reggie Watts\\u2019 Brooklyn apartment to record an episode. I handed him a mic. He looked it over, moved it around in his hand a bit, then slyly unplugged it and reached into a drawer behind him, grabbed a mic and popped it on.<\\/p>\\n<p>The guy knows from microphones.<\\/p>\\n<p>My takeaway here is that presentation is important. Looks matter, as does weight. A microphone should have some heft to it. People&#8217;s expectations have lowered with regards to what an audio setup looks like, but you need good mics if pros are going to take you seriously.<\\/p>\\n<p>I\\u2019ve since been through various mics, and lately I\\u2019ve settled on these things. For the record, they\\u2019re a wholesale knock-off of the Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphone \\u2014 the go-to microphone for podcasters. The SM57 is the thing I assume Marc Maron and Terry Gross would talk about if they had to share an Uber Pool to Silver Lake.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Weymic looks nearly identical and sounds great for one-tenth the price. Don\\u2019t ask me how. And hey, I\\u2019m not exactly swimming in Casper ad revenue here. Also do yourself a favor and invest in a couple of foam windscreens to cut down on sibilance. You can get a bunch in a pack for cheap.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1781597\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?w=680\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"525\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png 981w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=150,116 150w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=300,231 300w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=768,593 768w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=680,525 680w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/02\\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-11-at-8.01.16-PM.png?resize=50,39 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Universal Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand Portable Foldable Tripod (<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Universal-Adjustable-Microphone-Portable-Foldable\\/dp\\/B01H248DQ4\\\">Two for $15<\\/a>):<\\/strong> I\\u2019m embarrassed to admit how long it took me to add these to the repertoire. Guests jostle mics a lot during long interviews, and that stuff picks up. I\\u2019ve also had a number of older guests on the show, and asking them to hold a microphone for 45 minutes to an hour is just cruel.<\\/p>\\n<p>These, picked up from Amazon, are super-cheap and fold up into nothing, making them perfect for my laptop-sleeve constraints. The only issues are: 1) They\\u2019re not great for super-tall guests. I recently had a member of the band Health on the show and ended up sticking the stand precariously atop a pile of several books; and 2) The screws loosen themselves like crazy for some reason, so I just purchased a pair of keychain screw drivers to keep them in check.<\\/p>\\n<p>I pair all of that with a couple of <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/gp\\/product\\/B01JNLTTKS\\/\\\">six-foot XLR mic cables<\\/a>\\u00a0($7 a piece for Amazon basics) and some velcro ties.

Podbean is something I found early on. I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d recommend the service, but I\\u2019m 300+ episodes deep at this point. There are a lot of options out there, so shop around a bit. Anchor is compelling for novices, including its <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/11\\/29\\/anchor-wants-a-future-where-everyone-reads-squarespace-ads\\/\\\">built-in ad-servicing<\\/a> (though I\\u2019m a little wary of how the Spotify acquisition will play out) and a lot of my friends swear by Libsyn for more popular shows. Heck, even SoundCloud has a decent option.<\\/p>\\n<p>Everyone has an embedded player and the means with which to syndicate to iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, et al.<\\/p>\\n<p>I\\u2019ve found Podbean to be a bit clunky and the service has experienced a handful of outages. That said, recent additions have streamlined the program, and they\\u2019ve added some pretty decent analytics to the backend, so it\\u2019s definitely headed in the right direction.

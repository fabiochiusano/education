Rather than all pitches happening on one stage, they were split across two stages (the \u201cPioneer\u201d and \u201cMission\u201d stages) running in parallel. So even if you were in the building, you couldn\u2019t see  all   the pitches in person.  We were there \u2014 and as we do with each class, we\u2019ve brought back our notes on everything we saw. You can check out write-ups of  all 88 startups from Day 2   plus  our favorite picks  . Here are the 85+ companies that pitched today, and click here to check out  our top 10 picks   from Day 1.

Career Karma gives them a placement quiz and gets them accepted at coding bootcamps and other training programs that pay the startup $1,000 per student. With income-sharing agreements growing in popularity, plenty of job skill providers will be willing to pay to enroll the highest potential students.   VanGo   : An on-demand ride service for getting your kids and teens around.

They plan to expand into other verticals to help parents down the road.     Team Mobot   : Simulated user interface testing doesn\u2019t catch all the bugs and can be complex for less tech savvy companies to perform. Team Mobot offers a fleet of robots that physically test any app\u2019s UI on real devices to perform QA testing and spot bugs.

Thirty-eight percent of customers come from referrals.   Basilica   : Most teams trying to build artificial intelligence systems don\u2019t have enough data, and that data can be expensive to collect. Basilica says its transfer learning method allows businesses to create accurate AI with just 1,000 data points instead of 1 million. Basilica generates network effect by using data from across its clients to improve efficiency for each vertical that teams will need to keep up with Google.    Keynua   : In Latin America, signing documents requires tedious identity verifications.

With a CEO who was a Navy Seal who went on to study computer science plus experts in augmented reality and selling hardware to the Department Of Defense, Ravn could deliver the inevitable future of soldier heads-up displays.   54gene   : 54gene aims to be 23andMe for Africa.

Sunsama   : A task manager that integrates with SaaS tools like Trello, JIRA and Asana to help workers identify and manage the tasks they should be working on a specific day.     Kalshi   : Instead of just betting on sports, Kalshi lets anyone bet on anything, like whether Brexit will happen by the end of the month or who will win an Oscar.

This advising role was cleared with AOL and TechCrunch's editors and has concluded. Constine's fianc\\u00e9e Andee Gardiner co-founded startup accelerator Founders Embassy. Constine's cousin Darren Lachtman is the founder of influencer advertising startup Niche that was acquired by Twitter, and he's since left and founded teen content studio Brat. Constine does not write about Founders Embassy or Brat. Constine has personal acquaintances stemming from college housing circa 2007 with founders at Skybox Imaging (now Terra Bella), Hustle, Snapchat, and Robinhood, but does not maintain close social ties with them nor does that influence his writing. Constine occasionally does paid speaking engagements at conferences, but only those funded by companies he does not cover. Constine owns a small position in Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, does not day-trade, and discloses his positions directly in articles where appropriate.

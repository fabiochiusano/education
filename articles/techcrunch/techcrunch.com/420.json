Facebook sidesteps the App Store and rewards teenagers and adults to download the Research app and give it root access to network traffic in what may be a violation of Apple policy so the social network can decrypt and analyze their phone activity, a TechCrunch investigation confirms.</p> <p>Facebook admitted to TechCrunch it was running the Research program to gather data on usage habits.</p> <p>Since 2016, Facebook has been paying users ages 13 to 35 up to $20 per month plus referral fees to sell their privacy by installing the iOS or Android \u201cFacebook Research\u201d app.\u00a0Facebook even asked users to screenshot their Amazon order history page. The program is administered through beta testing services Applause, BetaBound and uTest to cloak Facebook\u2019s involvement, and is referred to in some documentation as \u201cProject Atlas\u201d \u2014 a fitting name for Facebook\u2019s effort to map new trends and rivals around the globe.</p> <p>Seven hours after this story was published, Facebook told TechCrunch it would shut down the iOS version of its Research app in the wake of our report. But on Wednesday morning, an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/\">Apple spokesperson confirmed that Facebook violated its policies, and it had blocked Facebook\u2019s Research app</a>\u00a0on Tuesday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily (without mentioning it was forced to do so).

Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple. Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s Research program will continue to run on Android. [Update 2/21/19: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/facebook-removes-onavo/\">Facebook will pull Onavo from the Google Play store and eventually shut it down</a>. It will also cease to recruit users for the Android version of its Research app, though it plans other paid research initiatives.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s Research app requires users to \u2018Trust\u2019 it with extensive access to their dataWe asked\u00a0Guardian Mobile Firewall\u2019s security expert Will Strafach to dig into the Facebook Research app, and he told us that \u201cIf Facebook makes full use of the level of access they are given by asking users to install the Certificate, they will have the ability to continuously collect the\u00a0following types of data: private messages in social media apps, chats from in instant messaging apps \u2013 including photos/videos sent to others, emails, web\u00a0searches, web browsing activity, and even ongoing location information by tapping into the feeds of any location tracking apps you may have installed.\u201d It\u2019s unclear exactly what data Facebook is concerned with, but it gets nearly limitless access to a user\u2019s device once they install the app.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1775664 size-full\" height=\"934\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1667px) 100vw, 1667px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png 1667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" width=\"1667\"/></p> <p>The strategy shows how far Facebook is willing to go and how much it\u2019s willing to pay to protect its dominance \u2014 even at the risk of breaking the rules of Apple\u2019s iOS platform on which it depends. Apple may have asked Facebook to discontinue distributing its Research app.</p> <p>A more stringent punishment would be to revoke Facebook\u2019s permission to offer employee-only apps. The situation could further chill relations between the tech giants. Apple\u2019s Tim Cook has repeatedly criticized Facebook\u2019s data collection practices. Facebook disobeying iOS policies to slurp up more information could become a new talking point.</p> <p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1775572\" style=\"width: 810px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1775572\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1775572\" height=\"414\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?w=680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=768,398 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" width=\"800\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1775572\">Facebook\u2019s Research program is referred to as Project Atlas on sign-up sites that don\u2019t mention Facebook\u2019s involvement</p></div></p> <p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1775572\">Facebook\u2019s Research program is referred to as Project Atlas on sign-up sites that don\u2019t mention Facebook\u2019s involvement</p> <p>\u201cThe fairly technical sounding \u2018install our Root Certificate\u2019 step is appalling,\u201d Strafach tells us. \u201cThis hands Facebook continuous access to the most sensitive data about you, and\u00a0most users are going to be unable to reasonably consent to this regardless of any agreement they sign, because there is no good way to articulate just how much\u00a0power is handed to Facebook when you do this.\u201d</p> <p>Facebook first got into the data-sniffing business when it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/13/facebook-buys-mobile-analytics-company-onavo-and-finally-gets-its-office-in-israel/\">acquired Onavo</a> for around $120 million in 2014. The VPN app helped users track and minimize their mobile data plan usage, but also gave Facebook deep analytics about what other apps they were using. Internal documents acquired by Charlie Warzel and Ryan Mac of\u00a0<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/12/facebook-starts-pushing-its-data-tracking-onavo-vpn-within-its-main-mobile-app/\">BuzzFeed News</a> reveal that Facebook was able to leverage Onavo to learn that WhatsApp was sending more than twice as many messages per day as Facebook Messenger. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" data-entity=\"onavo\" data-type=\"organization\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/onavo\" target=\"_blank\">Onavo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> allowed Facebook to spot WhatsApp\u2019s meteoric rise and justify paying $19 billion to buy the chat startup in 2014.

By 2018, Facebook was promoting the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/12/facebook-starts-pushing-its-data-tracking-onavo-vpn-within-its-main-mobile-app/\">Onavo app in a Protect</a> bookmark of the main Facebook app in hopes of scoring more users to snoop on. Facebook also launched the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/facebook-launches-another-deceptive-security-app-design-1823650981\">Onavo Bolt app</a> that let you lock apps behind a passcode or fingerprint while it surveils you, but Facebook shut down the app the day it was discovered following privacy criticism.\u00a0Onavo\u2019s main app remains available on Google Play and has been installed more than 10 million times.</p> <p>The backlash heated up after security expert <a href=\"https://medium.com/@chronic_9612/notes-on-analytics-and-tracking-in-onavo-protect-for-ios-904bdff346c0\">Strafach detailed</a>\u00a0in March how Onavo Protect was reporting to Facebook when a user\u2019s screen was on or off, and its Wi-Fi and cellular data usage in bytes even when the VPN was turned off. In June, Apple updated its developer policies to ban collecting data about usage of other apps or data that\u2019s not necessary for an app to function. Apple proceeded to inform Facebook in August that Onavo Protect violated those data collection policies and that the social network needed to remove it from the App Store, which it did, Deepa Seetharaman of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-remove-data-security-app-from-apple-store-1534975340\">WSJ</a> reported.</p> <p>But that didn\u2019t stop Facebook\u2019s data collection.</p> <p>TechCrunch recently received a tip that despite Onavo Protect being banished by Apple, Facebook was paying users to sideload a similar VPN app under the Facebook Research moniker from outside of the App Store. We investigated, and learned Facebook was working with three app beta testing services to distribute the Facebook Research app: BetaBound, uTest and Applause. Facebook began distributing the Research VPN app in 2016. It has been referred to as Project Atlas since at least mid-2018, around when backlash to Onavo Protect magnified and Apple instituted its new rules that prohibited Onavo. Previously, a similar program was called Project Kodiak. Facebook didn\u2019t want to stop collecting data on people\u2019s phone usage and so the Research program continued, in disregard for Apple banning Onavo Protect.</p> <p><div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_1775666\" style=\"width: 349px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1775666\" class=\"wp-image-1775666 size-large\" height=\"359\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?w=339\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png 339w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=283,300 283w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=47,50 47w\" width=\"339\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1775666\">Facebook\u2019s Research App on iOS</p></div></p> <p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1775666\">Facebook\u2019s Research App on iOS</p> <p>Ads (shown below) for the program run by uTest on Instagram and Snapchat sought teens 13-17 years old for a \u201cpaid social media research study.\u201d The <a href=\"http://smrsignup.applause.com/refer\">sign-up page</a> for the Facebook Research program administered by Applause doesn\u2019t mention Facebook, but seeks users \u201cAge: 13-35 (parental consent required for ages 13-17).\u201d If minors try to sign-up, they\u2019re asked to get their parents\u2019 permission with a form that reveal\u2019s Facebook\u2019s involvement and says \u201cThere are no known risks associated with the project, however you acknowledge that the inherent nature of the project involves the tracking of personal information via your child\u2019s use of apps.

Updated with comment from Facebook, and on Wednesday with a statement from Apple.\u00a0</em></p> ", "content": "Desperate for data on its competitors,  Facebook     has been secretly paying people to install a \u201cFacebook Research\u201d VPN that lets the company suck in all of a user\u2019s phone and web activity, similar to Facebook\u2019s Onavo Protect app that Apple banned in June and that was removed in August. Facebook sidesteps the App Store and rewards teenagers and adults to download the Research app and give it root access to network traffic in what may be a violation of Apple policy so the social network can decrypt and analyze their phone activity, a TechCrunch investigation confirms.  Facebook admitted to TechCrunch it was running the Research program to gather data on usage habits.  Since 2016, Facebook has been paying users ages 13 to 35 up to $20 per month plus referral fees to sell their privacy by installing the iOS or Android \u201cFacebook Research\u201d app.\u00a0Facebook even asked users to screenshot their Amazon order history page. The program is administered through beta testing services Applause, BetaBound and uTest to cloak Facebook\u2019s involvement, and is referred to in some documentation as \u201cProject Atlas\u201d \u2014 a fitting name for Facebook\u2019s effort to map new trends and rivals around the globe.  Seven hours after this story was published, Facebook told TechCrunch it would shut down the iOS version of its Research app in the wake of our report. But on Wednesday morning, an  Apple spokesperson confirmed that Facebook violated its policies, and it had blocked Facebook\u2019s Research app  \u00a0on Tuesday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily (without mentioning it was forced to do so). You can read our full report on the development  here.   Apple bans Facebook\u2019s Research app that paid users for data     An Apple spokesperson provided this statement. \u201cWe designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization. Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple. Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.\u201d  Facebook\u2019s Research program will continue to run on Android. [Update 2/21/19:  Facebook will pull Onavo from the Google Play store and eventually shut it down  . It will also cease to recruit users for the Android version of its Research app, though it plans other paid research initiatives.  Facebook\u2019s Research app requires users to \u2018Trust\u2019 it with extensive access to their dataWe asked\u00a0Guardian Mobile Firewall\u2019s security expert Will Strafach to dig into the Facebook Research app, and he told us that \u201cIf Facebook makes full use of the level of access they are given by asking users to install the Certificate, they will have the ability to continuously collect the\u00a0following types of data: private messages in social media apps, chats from in instant messaging apps \u2013 including photos/videos sent to others, emails, web\u00a0searches, web browsing activity, and even ongoing location information by tapping into the feeds of any location tracking apps you may have installed.\u201d It\u2019s unclear exactly what data Facebook is concerned with, but it gets nearly limitless access to a user\u2019s device once they install the app.    The strategy shows how far Facebook is willing to go and how much it\u2019s willing to pay to protect its dominance \u2014 even at the risk of breaking the rules of Apple\u2019s iOS platform on which it depends. Apple may have asked Facebook to discontinue distributing its Research app.  A more stringent punishment would be to revoke Facebook\u2019s permission to offer employee-only apps. The situation could further chill relations between the tech giants. Apple\u2019s Tim Cook has repeatedly criticized Facebook\u2019s data collection practices. Facebook disobeying iOS policies to slurp up more information could become a new talking point.   Facebook\u2019s Research program is referred to as Project Atlas on sign-up sites that don\u2019t mention Facebook\u2019s involvement    Facebook\u2019s Research program is referred to as Project Atlas on sign-up sites that don\u2019t mention Facebook\u2019s involvement  \u201cThe fairly technical sounding \u2018install our Root Certificate\u2019 step is appalling,\u201d Strafach tells us. \u201cThis hands Facebook continuous access to the most sensitive data about you, and\u00a0most users are going to be unable to reasonably consent to this regardless of any agreement they sign, because there is no good way to articulate just how much\u00a0power is handed to Facebook when you do this.\u201d  Facebook first got into the data-sniffing business when it  acquired Onavo   for around $120 million in 2014. The VPN app helped users track and minimize their mobile data plan usage, but also gave Facebook deep analytics about what other apps they were using. Internal documents acquired by Charlie Warzel and Ryan Mac of\u00a0 BuzzFeed News   reveal that Facebook was able to leverage Onavo to learn that WhatsApp was sending more than twice as many messages per day as Facebook Messenger.  Onavo     allowed Facebook to spot WhatsApp\u2019s meteoric rise and justify paying $19 billion to buy the chat startup in 2014. WhatsApp has since tripled its user base, demonstrating the power of Onavo\u2019s foresight.    Over the years since, Onavo clued Facebook in to what apps to copy, features to build and flops to avoid. By 2018, Facebook was promoting the  Onavo app in a Protect   bookmark of the main Facebook app in hopes of scoring more users to snoop on. Facebook also launched the  Onavo Bolt app   that let you lock apps behind a passcode or fingerprint while it surveils you, but Facebook shut down the app the day it was discovered following privacy criticism.\u00a0Onavo\u2019s main app remains available on Google Play and has been installed more than 10 million times.  The backlash heated up after security expert  Strafach detailed  \u00a0in March how Onavo Protect was reporting to Facebook when a user\u2019s screen was on or off, and its Wi-Fi and cellular data usage in bytes even when the VPN was turned off. In June, Apple updated its developer policies to ban collecting data about usage of other apps or data that\u2019s not necessary for an app to function. Apple proceeded to inform Facebook in August that Onavo Protect violated those data collection policies and that the social network needed to remove it from the App Store, which it did, Deepa Seetharaman of the  WSJ   reported.  But that didn\u2019t stop Facebook\u2019s data collection.  TechCrunch recently received a tip that despite Onavo Protect being banished by Apple, Facebook was paying users to sideload a similar VPN app under the Facebook Research moniker from outside of the App Store. We investigated, and learned Facebook was working with three app beta testing services to distribute the Facebook Research app: BetaBound, uTest and Applause. Facebook began distributing the Research VPN app in 2016. It has been referred to as Project Atlas since at least mid-2018, around when backlash to Onavo Protect magnified and Apple instituted its new rules that prohibited Onavo. Previously, a similar program was called Project Kodiak. Facebook didn\u2019t want to stop collecting data on people\u2019s phone usage and so the Research program continued, in disregard for Apple banning Onavo Protect.   Facebook\u2019s Research App on iOS    Facebook\u2019s Research App on iOS  Ads (shown below) for the program run by uTest on Instagram and Snapchat sought teens 13-17 years old for a \u201cpaid social media research study.\u201d The  sign-up page   for the Facebook Research program administered by Applause doesn\u2019t mention Facebook, but seeks users \u201cAge: 13-35 (parental consent required for ages 13-17).\u201d If minors try to sign-up, they\u2019re asked to get their parents\u2019 permission with a form that reveal\u2019s Facebook\u2019s involvement and says \u201cThere are no known risks associated with the project, however you acknowledge that the inherent nature of the project involves the tracking of personal information via your child\u2019s use of apps. You will be compensated by Applause for your child\u2019s participation.\u201d For kids short on cash, the payments could coerce them to sell their privacy to Facebook.  The Applause site explains what data could be collected by the Facebook Research app (emphasis mine):   \u201cBy installing the software, you\u2019re giving our client permission to collect data from your phone that will help them understand how you browse the internet, and how you use the features in the apps you\u2019ve installed . . .\u00a0This means you\u2019re  letting our client collect information such as which apps are on your phone, how and when you use them  , data about your activities and content within those apps, as well as how other people interact with you or your content within those apps. You are also  letting our client collect information about your internet browsing activity   (including the websites you visit and data that is exchanged between your device and those websites) and your use of other online services. There are some instances when  our client will collect this information even where the app uses encryption  , or from within secure browser sessions.\u201d   Meanwhile, the  BetaBound sign-up page   with a URL ending in \u201cAtlas\u201d explains that \u201cFor $20 per month (via e-gift cards), you will install an app on your phone and let it run in the background.\u201d It also offers $20 per friend you refer. That site also doesn\u2019t initially mention Facebook, but the instruction manual for installing Facebook Research reveals the company\u2019s involvement.   Facebook\u2019s intermediary uTest ran ads on Snapchat and Instagram, luring teens to the Research program with the promise of money    Facebook\u2019s intermediary uTest ran ads on Snapchat and Instagram, luring teens to the Research program with the promise of money  \u00a0  Facebook seems to have purposefully avoided TestFlight, Apple\u2019s official beta testing system, which requires apps to be reviewed by Apple and is limited to 10,000 participants. Instead, the instruction manual reveals that users download the app from r.facebook-program.com and are told to install an Enterprise Developer Certificate and VPN and \u201cTrust\u201d Facebook with root access to the data their phone transmits. Apple requires that developers agree to only use this certificate system for distributing internal corporate apps to their own employees. Randomly recruiting testers and paying them a monthly fee appears to violate the spirit of that rule.   Security expert Will Strafach found Facebook\u2019s Research app contains lots of code from Onavo Protect, the Facebook-owned app Apple banned last year    Security expert Will Strafach found Facebook\u2019s Research app contains lots of code from Onavo Protect, the Facebook-owned app Apple banned last year  Once installed, users just had to keep the VPN running and sending data to Facebook to get paid. The Applause-administered program requested that users screenshot their Amazon orders page. This data could potentially help Facebook tie browsing habits and usage of other apps with purchase preferences and behavior. That information could be harnessed to pinpoint ad targeting and understand which types of users buy what.  TechCrunch commissioned Strafach to analyze the Facebook Research app and find out where it was sending data. He confirmed that data is routed to\u00a0\u201c vpn-sjc1.v.facebook-program.  com  \u201d that is associated with Onavo\u2019s\u00a0IP address, and that the facebook-program.com domain is registered to Facebook, according to MarkMonitor. The app can update itself without interacting with the App Store, and is linked to the email address PeopleJourney@fb.com. He also discovered that the Enterprise Certificate first acquired in 2016 indicates Facebook renewed it on June 27th, 2018 \u2014 weeks after Apple announced its new rules that prohibited the similar Onavo Protect app.  \u201cIt is tricky to know what data Facebook is actually saving (without access to their servers). The only information that is knowable here is what access Facebook is\u00a0capable of based on the code in the app. And it paints a very worrisome picture,\u201d Strafach explains. \u201cThey might respond and claim to only actually retain/save very specific limited\u00a0data, and that could be true, it really boils down to how much you trust Facebook\u2019s word on it. The most charitable narrative of this situation would be that Facebook did not think too hard about the level of access they were granting to themselves . . .\u00a0which is a startling level of carelessness in itself if that is the case.\u201d  [Update: TechCrunch also found that  Google\u2019s Screenwise Meter surveillance app also breaks the Enterprise Certificate policy  , though it does a better job of revealing the company\u2019s involvement and how it works than Facebook does.]  Google will stop peddling a data collector through Apple\u2019s back door     In response to TechCrunch\u2019s inquiry, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed it\u2019s running the program to learn how people use their phones and other services. The spokesperson told us \u201cLike many companies, we invite people to participate in research that helps us identify things we can be doing better. Since this research is aimed at helping Facebook understand how people use their mobile devices, we\u2019ve provided extensive information about the type of data we collect and how they can participate. We don\u2019t share this information with others and people can stop participating at any time.\u201d   Facebook\u2019s Research app requires Root Certificate access, which Facebook gather almost any piece of data transmitted by your phone    Facebook\u2019s Research app requires Root Certificate access, which Facebook gather almost any piece of data transmitted by your phone  Facebook\u2019s spokesperson claimed that the Facebook Research app was in line with Apple\u2019s Enterprise Certificate program, but didn\u2019t explain how in the face of evidence to the contrary.

Facebook sidesteps the App Store and rewards teenagers and adults to download the Research app and give it root access to network traffic in what may be a violation of Apple policy so the social network can decrypt and analyze their phone activity, a TechCrunch investigation confirms.</p>\n<p>Facebook admitted to TechCrunch it was running the Research program to gather data on usage habits.</p>\n<p>Since 2016, Facebook has been paying users ages 13 to 35 up to $20 per month plus referral fees to sell their privacy by installing the iOS or Android \u201cFacebook Research\u201d app.\u00a0Facebook even asked users to screenshot their Amazon order history page. The program is administered through beta testing services Applause, BetaBound and uTest to cloak Facebook\u2019s involvement, and is referred to in some documentation as \u201cProject Atlas\u201d \u2014 a fitting name for Facebook\u2019s effort to map new trends and rivals around the globe.</p>\n<p>Seven hours after this story was published, Facebook told TechCrunch it would shut down the iOS version of its Research app in the wake of our report. But on Wednesday morning, an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/\">Apple spokesperson confirmed that Facebook violated its policies, and it had blocked Facebook\u2019s Research app</a>\u00a0on Tuesday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily (without mentioning it was forced to do so). You can read our full report on the development <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/\">here.</a></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HHVXXgsjjX\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/\">Apple bans Facebook\u2019s Research app that paid users for data</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HHVXXgsjjX\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/embed/#?secret=HHVXXgsjjX\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"\u201cApple bans Facebook\u2019s Research app that paid users for data\u201d \u2014 TechCrunch\" width=\"800\"></iframe></p></div>\n<p>An Apple spokesperson provided this statement. \u201cWe designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization. Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple. Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.\u201d</p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s Research program will continue to run on Android. [Update 2/21/19: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/facebook-removes-onavo/\">Facebook will pull Onavo from the Google Play store and eventually shut it down</a>. It will also cease to recruit users for the Android version of its Research app, though it plans other paid research initiatives.</p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s Research app requires users to \u2018Trust\u2019 it with extensive access to their dataWe asked\u00a0Guardian Mobile Firewall\u2019s security expert Will Strafach to dig into the Facebook Research app, and he told us that \u201cIf Facebook makes full use of the level of access they are given by asking users to install the Certificate, they will have the ability to continuously collect the\u00a0following types of data: private messages in social media apps, chats from in instant messaging apps \u2013 including photos/videos sent to others, emails, web\u00a0searches, web browsing activity, and even ongoing location information by tapping into the feeds of any location tracking apps you may have installed.\u201d It\u2019s unclear exactly what data Facebook is concerned with, but it gets nearly limitless access to a user\u2019s device once they install the app.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1775664 size-full\" height=\"934\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1667px) 100vw, 1667px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png 1667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Install1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" width=\"1667\"/></p>\n<p>The strategy shows how far Facebook is willing to go and how much it\u2019s willing to pay to protect its dominance \u2014 even at the risk of breaking the rules of Apple\u2019s iOS platform on which it depends.

The VPN app helped users track and minimize their mobile data plan usage, but also gave Facebook deep analytics about what other apps they were using.

By 2018, Facebook was promoting the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/12/facebook-starts-pushing-its-data-tracking-onavo-vpn-within-its-main-mobile-app/\">Onavo app in a Protect</a> bookmark of the main Facebook app in hopes of scoring more users to snoop on. Facebook also launched the <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/facebook-launches-another-deceptive-security-app-design-1823650981\">Onavo Bolt app</a> that let you lock apps behind a passcode or fingerprint while it surveils you, but Facebook shut down the app the day it was discovered following privacy criticism.\u00a0Onavo\u2019s main app remains available on Google Play and has been installed more than 10 million times.</p>\n<p>The backlash heated up after security expert <a href=\"https://medium.com/@chronic_9612/notes-on-analytics-and-tracking-in-onavo-protect-for-ios-904bdff346c0\">Strafach detailed</a>\u00a0in March how Onavo Protect was reporting to Facebook when a user\u2019s screen was on or off, and its Wi-Fi and cellular data usage in bytes even when the VPN was turned off. In June, Apple updated its developer policies to ban collecting data about usage of other apps or data that\u2019s not necessary for an app to function. Apple proceeded to inform Facebook in August that Onavo Protect violated those data collection policies and that the social network needed to remove it from the App Store, which it did, Deepa Seetharaman of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-remove-data-security-app-from-apple-store-1534975340\">WSJ</a> reported.</p>\n<p>But that didn\u2019t stop Facebook\u2019s data collection.</p>\n<h2>Project Atlas</h2>\n<p>TechCrunch recently received a tip that despite Onavo Protect being banished by Apple, Facebook was paying users to sideload a similar VPN app under the Facebook Research moniker from outside of the App Store. We investigated, and learned Facebook was working with three app beta testing services to distribute the Facebook Research app: BetaBound, uTest and Applause. Facebook began distributing the Research VPN app in 2016. It has been referred to as Project Atlas since at least mid-2018, around when backlash to Onavo Protect magnified and Apple instituted its new rules that prohibited Onavo. Previously, a similar program was called Project Kodiak. Facebook didn\u2019t want to stop collecting data on people\u2019s phone usage and so the Research program continued, in disregard for Apple banning Onavo Protect.</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_1775666\" style=\"width: 349px\"><img alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1775666\" class=\"wp-image-1775666 size-large\" height=\"359\" sizes=\"(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?w=339\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png 339w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=283,300 283w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=47,50 47w\" width=\"339\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1775666\">Facebook\u2019s Research App on iOS</p></div></p>\n<p>Ads (shown below) for the program run by uTest on Instagram and Snapchat sought teens 13-17 years old for a \u201cpaid social media research study.\u201d The <a href=\"http://smrsignup.applause.com/refer\">sign-up page</a> for the Facebook Research program administered by Applause doesn\u2019t mention Facebook, but seeks users \u201cAge: 13-35 (parental consent required for ages 13-17).\u201d If minors try to sign-up, they\u2019re asked to get their parents\u2019 permission with a form that reveal\u2019s Facebook\u2019s involvement and says \u201cThere are no known risks associated with the project, however you acknowledge that the inherent nature of the project involves the tracking of personal information via your child\u2019s use of apps.

Those include that developers \u201cDistribute Provisioning Profiles only to Your Employees and only in conjunction with Your Internal Use Applications for the purpose of developing and testing\u201d. The policy also states that \u201cYou may not use, distribute or otherwise make Your Internal Use Applications available to Your Customers\u201d unless under direct supervision of employees or on company premises. Given Facebook\u2019s customers are using the Enterprise Certificate-powered app without supervision, it appears Facebook is in violation.</p>\n<p>Seven hours after this report was first published, Facebook updated its position and told TechCrunch that it would shut down the iOS Research app. Facebook noted that the Research app was started in 2016 and was therefore not a replacement for Onavo Protect. However, they do share similar code and could be seen as twins running in parallel. A Facebook spokesperson also provided this additional statement:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cKey facts about this market research program are being ignored. Despite early reports, there was nothing \u2018secret\u2019 about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App. It wasn\u2019t \u2018spying\u2019 as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Facebook did not publicly promote the Research VPN itself and used intermediaries that often didn\u2019t disclose Facebook\u2019s involvement until users had begun the signup process. While users were given clear instructions and warnings, the program never stresses nor mentions the full extent of the data Facebook can collect through the VPN. A small fraction of the users paid may have been teens, but we stand by the newsworthiness of its choice not to exclude minors from this data collection initiative.</p>\n<p>Facebook disobeying Apple so directly and then pulling the app could hurt their relationship. \u201cThe code in this iOS app strongly indicates that it is simply a poorly re-branded build of the banned Onavo app, now using an Enterprise Certificate owned by\u00a0Facebook in direct violation of Apple\u2019s rules, allowing Facebook to distribute this app without Apple review to as many users as they want,\u201d Strafach tells us. ONV prefixes and mentions of graph.onavo.com, \u201conavoApp://\u201d and \u201conavoProtect://\u201d custom URL schemes litter the app. \u201cThis is an egregious\u00a0violation on many fronts, and I hope that Apple will act expeditiously in revoking the signing certificate to render the app inoperable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Facebook is particularly interested in what teens do on their phones as the demographic has increasingly abandoned the social network in favor of Snapchat, YouTube and Facebook\u2019s acquisition Instagram. Insights into how popular with teens is Chinese video music app TikTok and meme sharing led Facebook to launch a clone called Lasso and begin developing a meme-browsing feature called LOL, TechCrunch first reported. But Facebook\u2019s desire for data about teens riles critics at a time when the company has been battered in the press. Analysts on tomorrow\u2019s Facebook earnings call should inquire about what other ways the company has to collect competitive intelligence now that it\u2019s ceased to run the Research program on iOS.</p>\n<p>Last year when Tim Cook was asked what he\u2019d do in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s position in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-fires-back-apple-ceo-s-extremely-glib-comment-n862056\">he said</a> \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation . . . The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product.

and web activity, similar to Facebook&#8217;s Onavo Protect app that Apple banned in June and that was removed in August. Facebook sidesteps the App Store and rewards teenagers and adults to download the Research app and give it root access to network traffic in what may be a violation of Apple policy so the social network can decrypt and analyze their phone activity, a TechCrunch investigation confirms.<\\/p>\\n<p>Facebook admitted to TechCrunch it was running the Research program to gather data on usage habits.<\\/p>\\n<p>Since 2016, Facebook has been paying users ages 13 to 35 up to $20 per month plus referral fees to sell their privacy by installing the iOS or Android &#8220;Facebook Research&#8221; app.\\u00a0Facebook even asked users to screenshot their Amazon order history page. The program is administered through beta testing services Applause, BetaBound and uTest to cloak Facebook&#8217;s involvement, and is referred to in some documentation as &#8220;Project Atlas&#8221; &#8212; a fitting name for Facebook&#8217;s effort to map new trends and rivals around the globe.<\\/p>\\n<p>Seven hours after this story was published, Facebook told TechCrunch it would shut down the iOS version of its Research app in the wake of our report. But on Wednesday morning, an <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/01\\/30\\/apple-bans-facebook-vpn\\/\\\">Apple spokesperson confirmed that Facebook violated its policies, and it had blocked Facebook&#8217;s Research app<\\/a>\\u00a0on Tuesday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily (without mentioning it was forced to do so).

Apple may have asked Facebook to discontinue distributing its Research app.<\\/p>\\n<p>A more stringent punishment would be to revoke Facebook&#8217;s permission to offer employee-only apps. The situation could further chill relations between the tech giants. Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook has repeatedly criticized Facebook&#8217;s data collection practices. Facebook disobeying iOS policies to slurp up more information could become a new talking point.<\\/p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_1775572\\\" style=\\\"width: 810px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-1775572\\\" class=\\\"breakout wp-image-1775572\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?w=680\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"414\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg 6000w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=768,398 768w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Project-Atlas.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" \\/><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-1775572\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Facebook&#8217;s Research program is referred to as Project Atlas on sign-up sites that don&#8217;t mention Facebook&#8217;s involvement<\\/p><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fairly technical sounding \\u2018install our Root Certificate\\u2019 step is appalling,&#8221; Strafach tells us. &#8220;This hands Facebook continuous access to the most sensitive data about you, and\\u00a0most users are going to be unable to reasonably consent to this regardless of any agreement they sign, because there is no good way to articulate just how much\\u00a0power is handed to Facebook when you do this.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<h2>Facebook&#8217;s surveillance app<\\/h2>\\n<p>Facebook first got into the data-sniffing business when it <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2013\\/10\\/13\\/facebook-buys-mobile-analytics-company-onavo-and-finally-gets-its-office-in-israel\\/\\\">acquired Onavo<\\/a> for around $120 million in 2014.

By 2018, Facebook was promoting the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2018\\/02\\/12\\/facebook-starts-pushing-its-data-tracking-onavo-vpn-within-its-main-mobile-app\\/\\\">Onavo app in a Protect<\\/a> bookmark of the main Facebook app in hopes of scoring more users to snoop on. Facebook also launched the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/gizmodo.com\\/facebook-launches-another-deceptive-security-app-design-1823650981\\\">Onavo Bolt app<\\/a> that let you lock apps behind a passcode or fingerprint while it surveils you, but Facebook shut down the app the day it was discovered following privacy criticism.\\u00a0Onavo&#8217;s main app remains available on Google Play and has been installed more than 10 million times.<\\/p>\\n<p>The backlash heated up after security expert <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/medium.com\\/@chronic_9612\\/notes-on-analytics-and-tracking-in-onavo-protect-for-ios-904bdff346c0\\\">Strafach detailed<\\/a>\\u00a0in March how Onavo Protect was reporting to Facebook when a user&#8217;s screen was on or off, and its Wi-Fi and cellular data usage in bytes even when the VPN was turned off. In June, Apple updated its developer policies to ban collecting data about usage of other apps or data that&#8217;s not necessary for an app to function. Apple proceeded to inform Facebook in August that Onavo Protect violated those data collection policies and that the social network needed to remove it from the App Store, which it did, Deepa Seetharaman of the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.wsj.com\\/articles\\/facebook-to-remove-data-security-app-from-apple-store-1534975340\\\">WSJ<\\/a> reported.<\\/p>\\n<p>But that didn&#8217;t stop Facebook&#8217;s data collection.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Project Atlas<\\/h2>\\n<p>TechCrunch recently received a tip that despite Onavo Protect being banished by Apple, Facebook was paying users to sideload a similar VPN app under the Facebook Research moniker from outside of the App Store. We investigated, and learned Facebook was working with three app beta testing services to distribute the Facebook Research app: BetaBound, uTest and Applause. Facebook began distributing the Research VPN app in 2016. It has been referred to as Project Atlas since at least mid-2018, around when backlash to Onavo Protect magnified and Apple instituted its new rules that prohibited Onavo. Previously, a similar program was called Project Kodiak. Facebook didn&#8217;t want to stop collecting data on people&#8217;s phone usage and so the Research program continued, in disregard for Apple banning Onavo Protect.<\\/p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_1775666\\\" style=\\\"width: 349px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-1775666\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-1775666 size-large\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?w=339\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"339\\\" height=\\\"359\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png 339w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=142,150 142w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=283,300 283w, https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Facebook-Research-App-Icon.png?resize=47,50 47w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\\\" \\/><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-1775666\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Facebook&#8217;s Research App on iOS<\\/p><\\/div><\\/p>\\n<p>Ads (shown below) for the program run by uTest on Instagram and Snapchat sought teens 13-17 years old for a &#8220;paid social media research study.&#8221; The <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/smrsignup.applause.com\\/refer\\\">sign-up page<\\/a> for the Facebook Research program administered by Applause doesn&#8217;t mention Facebook, but seeks users &#8220;Age: 13-35 (parental consent required for ages 13-17).&#8221; If minors try to sign-up, they&#8217;re asked to get their parents&#8217; permission with a form that reveal&#8217;s Facebook&#8217;s involvement and says &#8220;There are no known risks associated with the project, however you acknowledge that the inherent nature of the project involves the tracking of personal information via your child&#8217;s use of apps.

Instead, the instruction manual reveals that users download the app from r.facebook-program.com and are told to install an Enterprise Developer Certificate and VPN and &#8220;Trust&#8221; Facebook with root access to the data their phone transmits. Apple requires that developers agree to only use this certificate system for distributing internal corporate apps to their own employees.

Those include that developers &#8220;Distribute Provisioning Profiles only to Your Employees and only in conjunction with Your Internal Use Applications for the purpose of developing and testing&#8221;. The policy also states that &#8220;You may not use, distribute or otherwise make Your Internal Use Applications available to Your Customers&#8221; unless under direct supervision of employees or on company premises. Given Facebook&#8217;s customers are using the Enterprise Certificate-powered app without supervision, it appears Facebook is in violation.<\\/p>\\n<p>Seven hours after this report was first published, Facebook updated its position and told TechCrunch that it would shut down the iOS Research app. Facebook noted that the Research app was started in 2016 and was therefore not a replacement for Onavo Protect. However, they do share similar code and could be seen as twins running in parallel. A Facebook spokesperson also provided this additional statement:<\\/p>\\n<p><i>\\u201cKey facts about this market research program are being ignored. Despite early reports, there was nothing &#8216;secret&#8217; about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App. It wasn&#8217;t &#8216;spying&#8217; as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.\\u201d<\\/i><\\/p>\\n<p>Facebook did not publicly promote the Research VPN itself and used intermediaries that often didn&#8217;t disclose Facebook&#8217;s involvement until users had begun the signup process. While users were given clear instructions and warnings, the program never stresses nor mentions the full extent of the data Facebook can collect through the VPN. A small fraction of the users paid may have been teens, but we stand by the newsworthiness of its choice not to exclude minors from this data collection initiative.<\\/p>\\n<p>Facebook disobeying Apple so directly and then pulling the app could hurt their relationship. \\u201cThe code in this iOS app strongly indicates that it is simply a poorly re-branded build of the banned Onavo app, now using an Enterprise Certificate owned by\\u00a0Facebook in direct violation of Apple\\u2019s rules, allowing Facebook to distribute this app without Apple review to as many users as they want,&#8221; Strafach tells us. ONV prefixes and mentions of graph.onavo.com, &#8220;onavoApp:\\/\\/&#8221; and &#8220;onavoProtect:\\/\\/&#8221; custom URL schemes litter the app. &#8220;This is an egregious\\u00a0violation on many fronts, and I hope that Apple will act expeditiously in revoking the signing certificate to render the app inoperable.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Facebook is particularly interested in what teens do on their phones as the demographic has increasingly abandoned the social network in favor of Snapchat, YouTube and Facebook&#8217;s acquisition Instagram. Insights into how popular with teens is Chinese video music app TikTok and meme sharing led Facebook to launch a clone called Lasso and begin developing a meme-browsing feature called LOL, TechCrunch first reported. But Facebook&#8217;s desire for data about teens riles critics at a time when the company has been battered in the press. Analysts on tomorrow&#8217;s Facebook earnings call should inquire about what other ways the company has to collect competitive intelligence now that it&#8217;s ceased to run the Research program on iOS.<\\/p>\\n<p>Last year when Tim Cook was asked what he&#8217;d do in Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s position in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.nbcnews.com\\/tech\\/tech-news\\/mark-zuckerberg-fires-back-apple-ceo-s-extremely-glib-comment-n862056\\\">he said<\\/a> &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be in this situation . . . The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product. We\\u2019ve elected not to do that.&#8221; Zuckerberg told Ezra Klein that he felt Cook&#8217;s comment was &#8220;extremely glib.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Now it&#8217;s clear that even after Apple&#8217;s warnings and the removal of Onavo Protect, Facebook was still aggressively collecting data on its competitors via Apple&#8217;s iOS platform. &#8220;I have never seen such open and flagrant defiance of Apple\\u2019s rules by an App\\u00a0Store developer,&#8221; Strafach concluded. Now that Facebook has ceased the program on iOS and its Android future is uncertain, it may either have to invent new ways to surveil our behavior amidst a climate of privacy scrutiny, or be left in the dark.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"HHVXXgsjjX\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/01\\/30\\/apple-bans-facebook-vpn\\/\\\">Apple bans Facebook&#8217;s Research app that paid users for data<\\/a><\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/01\\/30\\/apple-bans-facebook-vpn\\/embed\\/#?secret=HHVXXgsjjX\\\" data-secret=\\\"HHVXXgsjjX\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;Apple bans Facebook&#8217;s Research app that paid users for data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"><\\/iframe><\\/div>\\n<p><em>Additional reporting by Zack Whittaker.

This advising role was cleared with AOL and TechCrunch's editors and has concluded. Constine's fianc\\u00e9e Andee Gardiner co-founded startup accelerator Founders Embassy. Constine's cousin Darren Lachtman is the founder of influencer advertising startup Niche that was acquired by Twitter, and he's since left and founded teen content studio Brat. Constine does not write about Founders Embassy or Brat. Constine has personal acquaintances stemming from college housing circa 2007 with founders at Skybox Imaging (now Terra Bella), Hustle, Snapchat, and Robinhood, but does not maintain close social ties with them nor does that influence his writing. Constine occasionally does paid speaking engagements at conferences, but only those funded by companies he does not cover. Constine owns a small position in Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, does not day-trade, and discloses his positions directly in articles where appropriate. Constine does not do consulting, angel investing, or public stock trading beyond public stock invesments by his parents' estate that he has no role in managing or advising.]<\\/p>\",\"cbAvatar\":\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\\/image\\/upload\\/v1415412437\\/xje35licfau9iewxnf44.png\",\"twitter\":\"joshconstine\",\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\\/1603003\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\"}]}}],\"replies\":[[{\"id\":650765,\"parent\":0,\"author\":0,\"author_name\":\"Grant Case\",\"author_url\":\"\",\"date\":\"2019-01-29T15:58:30\",\"content\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Facebook has put Cook in a box.

He is currently an Editor-At-Large for TechCrunch and is available for speaking engagements.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Previously, Constine was the Lead Writer of Inside Facebook through its acquisition by WebMediaBrands, covering everything about the social network.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Constine graduated from Stanford University in 2009 with a Master's degree in Cybersociology, examining the influence of technology on social interaction. He researched the impact of privacy controls on the socialization of children, meme popularity cycles, and what influences the click through rate of links posted to Twitter.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Constine also received a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors from Stanford University in 2007, with a concentration in Social Psychology &amp; Interpersonal Processes.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Josh Constine is an experienced public speaker, and has moderated over 120 on-stage interviews in 15 countries with leaders including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whistleblower Edward Snowden (via on-stage video conference), and U.S. Senator Cory Booker. He is available to moderate panels and fireside chats, deliver keynotes, and judge hackathon and pitch competitions.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Constine has been quoted by The Wall Street Journal, CNN Money, The Atlantic, BBC World Magazine, Slate, and more, plus has been featured on television on Good Morning, America, The Today Show, China Central Television, and Fox News. Constine is ranked as the #1 most cited tech journalist on prestigious news aggregator Techmeme.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>[Disclosures: Josh Constine temporarily advised a college friend's social location-sharing startup codenamed 'Signal' that was based in San Francisco before dissolving in 2015. This advising role was cleared with AOL and TechCrunch's editors and has concluded. Constine's fianc\\u00e9e Andee Gardiner co-founded startup accelerator Founders Embassy. Constine's cousin Darren Lachtman is the founder of influencer advertising startup Niche that was acquired by Twitter, and he's since left and founded teen content studio Brat. Constine does not write about Founders Embassy or Brat. Constine has personal acquaintances stemming from college housing circa 2007 with founders at Skybox Imaging (now Terra Bella), Hustle, Snapchat, and Robinhood, but does not maintain close social ties with them nor does that influence his writing. Constine occasionally does paid speaking engagements at conferences, but only those funded by companies he does not cover. Constine owns a small position in Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, does not day-trade, and discloses his positions directly in articles where appropriate. Constine does not do consulting, angel investing, or public stock trading beyond public stock invesments by his parents' estate that he has no role in managing or advising.]<\\/p>\",\"cbAvatar\":\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\\/image\\/upload\\/v1415412437\\/xje35licfau9iewxnf44.png\",\"twitter\":\"joshconstine\",\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\\/1603003\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\"}]}}],\"wp:featuredmedia\":[{\"id\":1775663,\"date\":\"2019-01-29T11:14:19\",\"slug\":\"facebook-research-vpn-project-atlas\",\"type\":\"attachment\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2019\\/01\\/29\\/facebook-project-atlas\\/facebook-research-vpn-project-atlas\\/\",\"title\":{\"rendered\":\"facebook-research

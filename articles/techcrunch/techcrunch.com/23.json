This advising role was cleared with AOL and TechCrunch's editors and has concluded. Constine's fianc\\u00e9e Andee Gardiner co-founded startup accelerator Founders Embassy. Constine's cousin Darren Lachtman is the founder of influencer advertising startup Niche that was acquired by Twitter, and he's since left and founded teen content studio Brat. Constine does not write about Founders Embassy or Brat. Constine has personal acquaintances stemming from college housing circa 2007 with founders at Skybox Imaging (now Terra Bella), Hustle, Snapchat, and Robinhood, but does not maintain close social ties with them nor does that influence his writing. Constine occasionally does paid speaking engagements at conferences, but only those funded by companies he does not cover. Constine owns a small position in Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies, does not day-trade, and discloses his positions directly in articles where appropriate. Constine does not do consulting, angel investing, or public stock trading beyond public stock invesments by his parents' estate that he has no role in managing or advising.]<\\/p>\",\"cbAvatar\":\"https:\\/\\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\\/image\\/upload\\/v1415412437\\/xje35licfau9iewxnf44.png\",\"twitter\":\"joshconstine\",\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\\/1603003\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/wp-json\\/tc\\/v1\\/users\"}]}}],\"author\":[{\"id\":5188242,\"name\":\"Greg Kumparak\",\"url\":\"\",\"description\":\"\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/author\\/greg-kumparak\\/\",\"slug\":\"greg-kumparak\",\"avatar_urls\":{\"24\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9b107c9f9a43a21d8c93fcdefcc97dcd?s=24&d=identicon&r=g\",\"48\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9b107c9f9a43a21d8c93fcdefcc97dcd?s=48&d=identicon&r=g\",\"96\":\"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9b107c9f9a43a21d8c93fcdefcc97dcd?s=96&d=identicon&r=g\"},\"links\":{\"homepage\":\"http:\\/\\/www.kumparak.com\",\"twitter\":\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/grg\",\"crunchbase\":\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/person\\/greg-kumparak\"},\"position\":\"Editor\",\"cbDescription\":\"<p>Greg Kumparak is an editor at TechCrunch.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Greg started at TechCrunch in May of 2008.

No need to rate all of the listed posts!  Just rate any posts or op-eds you remember.  Each poll will also contain links to the original posts and op-eds so you can refresh your memory if you want.<p>\n\nIt would be a great help if you could answer some of these polls -- if only just to click \"a favorite\" next to a few you remember fondly.  I will take this input seriously in selecting what to include in the book.<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DPZJ638\">Today's poll, 11 selected posts on belief, desire, and self-knowledge</a>.<p>\n\nAlthough I've written more on self-knowledge and belief than any other topic, this is my shortest list among the seven categories -- maybe because so much of my work on this is already in longer papers?  Or maybe because my positions on these issues were already well worked out before I started blogging, so I had less of an impulse to toss out new ideas about them?

It doesn't exist.<p>\n\nNow I think there are basically <b>two different things that one could mean in saying \"consciousness doesn't exist\"</b>.<p>\n\n(A.) <b>One is something that seems to be patently absurd and decisively refuted by every moment of lived experience</b>: that there <i>is </i>no such thing as lived experience. If it sounds preposterous to deny that anyone ever has conscious experience, then you're probably understanding the claim correctly.  It is a radically strange claim.  Of course philosophers do sometimes defend radically strange, preposterous-sounding positions.  Among them, this would be a doozy.<p>\n\n(B.) Alternatively, you might think that when a philosopher says that consciousness exists (or \"phenomenal consciousness\" or \"lived, subjective experience\" or whatever) she's usually not just saying the almost undeniably obvious thing.  You might think that she's probably <i>also </i>regarding certain disputable properties as definitionally essential to consciousness.  You might hear her as saying not only that there is lived experience in the almost undeniable sense but also that the target phenomenon is irreducible to the merely physical, or is infallibly knowable through introspection, or is constantly accompanied by a self-representational element, or something like that. <b>Someone who hears the claim that \"consciousness exists\" in this stronger, more commissive sense might then deny that consciousness does exist, if they think that nothing exists that has those disputable properties.</b>  This might be an unintuitive claim, if it's intuitively plausible that consciousness does have those properties.  But it's not a jaw dropper.<p>\n\nAdmittedly, there has been some unclarity in how philosophers define \"consciousness\".  It's not entirely clear on the face of it what Frankish means to deny the existence of in the article linked above.  Is he going for the totally absurd sounding claim, or only the more moderate claim?  (Or maybe something somehow in between or slightly to the side of either of these?)<p>\n\nIn my view, <b>the best and most helpful definitions of \"consciousness\" are the less commissive ones.</b>  The usual approach is to point to some examples of conscious experiences, while also mentioning some synonyms or evocative phrases.  Examples include sensory experiences, dreams, vivid surges of emotion, and sentences spoken silently to oneself.  Near synonyms or evocative phrases include \"subjective quality\", \"stream of experience\", \"that in virtue of which it's <i>like </i>something to be a person\".  While you might quibble about any particular example or phrase, it is in this sense of \"consciousness\" that it seems to be undeniable or absurd to deny that consciousness exists.  It is in this sense that the existence of consciousness is, as <a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/scicon.html\">David Chalmers</a> says, a \"datum\" that philosophers and psychologists need to accept.<p>\n<b>\nStill, we might be dissatisfied with evocative phrases and pointing to examples.</b>  For one thing, such a definition doesn't seem very rigorous, compared to an analytic definition.  For another thing, you can't do very much <i>a priori</i> with such a thin definition, if you want to build an argument from the existence of consciousness to some bold philosophical conclusion (like the incompleteness of physical science or the existence of an immaterial soul).  So philosophers are understandably tempted to add more to the definition -- whatever further claims about consciousness seem plausible to them.  But then, of course, <b>they risk adding too much and losing the undeniability of the claim</b> that consciousness exists.<p>\n\nWhen I read Frankish's article in preprint, I wasn't sure how radical a claim he meant to defend, in denying the existence of phenomenal consciousness.  Was he going for the seemingly absurd claim?  Or only for the possibly-unintuitive-but-much-less-radical claim?<p>\n\nSo I wrote a <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/imp/jcs/2016/00000023/F0020011/art00018\">commentary </a>in which I tried to define \"phenomenal consciousness\" as innocently as possible, simply by appealing to what I hoped would be uncontroversial examples of it, while explicitly disavowing any definitional commitment to immateriality, introspective infallibility, irreducibility, etc. (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DefiningConsciousness.htm\">final MS version</a>).  Did Frankish mean to deny the existence of phenomenal consciousness in <i>that </i>sense?<p>\n\nIn one important respect, I should say, definition by example is necessarily substantive or commissive: <b>Definition by example cannot succeed if the examples are a mere hodgepodge without any important commonalities.</b>  Even if there isn't a single unifying essence among the examples, there must at least be some sort of \"family resemblance\" that ordinary people can latch on to, more or less.<p>\n\nFor instance, the following would fail as an attempted definition: By \"blickets\" I mean things like: this cup on my desk, my right shoe, the Eiffel tower, Mickey Mouse, and other things like those; but not this stapler on my desk, my left shoe, the Taj Mahal, Donald Duck, or other things like those.  What property could the first group possibly possess, that the second group lacks, which ordinary people could latch onto by means of contemplating these examples?  None, presumably (even if a clever philosopher or AI could find some such property).  <b>Defining \"consciousness\" by example requires there to be some shared property or family resemblance among the examples</b>, which is not present in things we normally regard as \"nonconscious\" (early visual processing, memories stored but not presently considered, and growth hormone release).  The putative examples cannot be a mere hodge-podge.<p>\n\nDefinition by example can be silent about what descriptive features all these conscious experiences share, just as a definition by example of \"furniture\" or \"games\" might be silent about what ties those concepts together.  Maybe all conscious experiences are in principle introspectively reportable, or nonphysical, or instantiated by 40 hertz neuronal oscillations.  Grant first that consciousness exists.  Argue about these other things later.<p>\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/imp/jcs/2016/00000023/F0020011/art00020\">his reply</a> to my commentary, <b>Frankish accepts the existence of \"phenomenal consciousness\" as I have defined it</b> -- which is really (I think) more or less how it is already defined and ought to be defined in the recent Anglophone \"phenomenal realist\" tradition.  (The \"phenomenal\" in \"phenomenal consciousness\", I think, serves as a usually unnecessary disambiguator, to prevent interpreting \"consciousness\" as some other less obvious but related thing like explicit self-consciousness or functional accessibility to cognition.)  If so, then Frankish is saying something less radical than it might at first seem when he rejects the existence of \"phenomenal consciousness\".<p>\n<b>So is consciousness an illusion?  No, not if you define \"consciousness\" as you ought to.</b><p>\n\nMaybe my dispute with Frankish is mainly terminological.  But it's a pretty important piece of terminology!<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/23094-spiral-circle-illusion-explained.html\">image source</a>, <a href=\"http://pec.sagepub.com/content/31/12/1501.full.pdf+html\">Pinna et al 2002</a>, <a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Pinna_illusion\">The Pinna Illusion</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-drsrI0U6TN8/WBoQmjY_8mI/AAAAAAAABmo/O0dlXfDSqLQoEl0YD5_8pm0n-4Vck1-3gCLcB/s1600/orangerind.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-drsrI0U6TN8/WBoQmjY_8mI/AAAAAAAABmo/O0dlXfDSqLQoEl0YD5_8pm0n-4Vck1-3gCLcB/s200/orangerind.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\nIn some of my published work, I have argued that:<p>\n\n(1.) <b>Attitudes, such as belief and desire, are best understood as clusters of dispositions.</b>  For example, to believe that there is beer in the fridge is nothing more or less than to be disposed (all else being equal or normal) to go to the fridge if one wants a beer, to feel surprised if one were to open the fridge and find no beer, to conclude that the fridge isn't empty if that question becomes relevant, etc, etc.  (See my essays <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AccountBel.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nAnd<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Only conscious experiences are introspectible.</b>  I characterize introspection as \"the dedication of central cognitive resources, or attention, to the task of arriving at a judgment about one's current, or very recently past, conscious experience, using or attempting to use some capacities that are unique to the first-person case... with the aim or intention that one's judgment reflect some relatively direct sensitivity to the target state\" (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrospectionWhat.htm\">2012, p. 42-43</a>).<p>\n\nNow it also seems correct that (3.) <b>dispositions, or clusters of dispositions, are not the same as conscious experiences</b>.  One can be disposed <i>to have</i> a certain conscious experience (e.g., disposed to experience a feeling of surprise if one were to see no beer), but dispositions and their manifestations are not metaphysically identical.  Oscar can be disposed to experience surprise if he were to see an empty fridge, even if he never actually sees an empty fridge and so never actually experiences surprise.<p>\n\nFrom these three claims <b>it follows that we cannot introspect attitudes such as belief and desire</b>.<p>\n<b>But it seems we <i>can </i>introspect them! </b> Right now, I'm craving a sip of coffee.  It seems like I am currently experiencing that desire in a directly introspectible way.  Or suppose I'm thinking aloud, in inner speech, \"X would be such a horrible president!\"  It seems like I can introspectively detect that belief, in all its passionate intensity, as it is occurs in my mind right now.<p>\n\nI don't want to deny this, exactly.  Instead, let me define relatively <i>strict </i>versus <i>permissive </i>conceptions of the targets of introspection.<p>\n\nTo warm up, consider a visual analogy: seeing an orange.  There the orange is, on the table.  You see it.  But do you really see the whole orange?  Speaking strictly, it might be better to say that you see the orange rind, or the part of the orange rind that is facing you, rather than the whole orange.  Arguably, you infer or assume that it's not just an empty rind, that it has a backside, that it has a juicy interior -- and usually that's a safe enough assumption.  It's reasonable to just say that you see the orange.  <b>In a relatively permissive sense, you see the whole orange; in a relatively strict sense you see only the facing part of the orange rind.</b><p>\n\nAnother example: From my office window I see the fire burning downtown.  Of course, I only see the smoke.  Even if I were to see the flames, in the strictest sense perhaps the visible light emitted from flames is only a contingent manifestation of the combustion process that truly constitutes a fire.  (Consider <a href=\"http://blog.chembark.com/2010/11/05/methanol-fires-are-invisible/\">invisible methanol fires</a>.)  More permissively, I see the fire when I see the smoke.  More strictly, I need to see the flames or maybe even (impossibly?) the combustion process itself.<p>\n\nNow consider psychological cases: In a relatively permissive sense, you see Sandra's anger.  In a stricter sense, you see her scowling face. <b> In a relatively permissive sense, you hear the shyness and social awkwardness in Shivani's voice.</b>  In a stricter sense you hear only her words and prosody.<p>\n\nTo be clear: I do not mean to imply that a stricter understanding of the targets of perception is more accurate or better than a more permissive understanding.  (Indeed, excessive strictness can collapse into absurdity: \"No, officer, I didn't see the stop sign.  Really, all I saw were patterns of light streaming through my vitreous humour!\")<p>\n<b>As anger can manifest in a scowl and as fire can manifest in smoke and visible flames, so also can attitudes manifest in conscious experience.</b>  The desire for coffee can manifest in a conscious experience that I would describe as an urge to take a sip; my attitude about X's candidacy can manifest in a momentary experience of inner speech.  In such cases, we can say that the attitudes present a <b><i>conscious face</i></b>.  If the conscious experience is distinctive enough to serve as an excellent sign of the real presence of the relevant dispositional structure constituting that attitude, then we can say that the attitude is (occurrently) conscious.<p>\n\nIt is important to my view that the conscious face of an attitude is not tantamount to the attitude itself, even if they normally co-occur.  If you have the conscious experience but not the underlying suite of relevant dispositions, you do not actually have the attitude.  (Let's bracket the question of whether such cases are realistically psychologically possible.)  Similarly, a scowl is not anger, smoke is not a fire, a rind is not an orange.<p>\n<b>Speaking relatively permissively, then, one can introspect an attitude by introspecting its conscious face</b>, much as I can see a whole orange by seeing the facing part of its rind and I can see a fire by seeing its smoke.  I rely upon the fact that the conscious experience wouldn't be there unless the whole dispositional structure were there.  If that reliance is justified and the attitude is really there, distinctively manifesting in that conscious experience, then I have successfully introspected it.  The exact metaphysical relationship between the strictly conceived target and the permissively conceived target is different among the various cases -- part-whole for the orange, cause-effect for the fire, and disposition-manifestation for the attitude -- but the general strategy is the same.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://ourbraggingwrites.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/just-an-orange-rind/\">image source</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Last week I posted \"<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-to-accidentally-become-zombie-robot.html\">How to Accidentally Become a Zombie Robot</a>\", discussing Susan Schneider's <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Can-A-Robot-Feel-Susan-Schneide#.V2rDcojGso8\">recent TEDx-talk</a> proposal for checking whether silicon chips can be conscious.  Susan has written the following reply, which she invited me to share on the blog.<p>\n\n---------------------------------------------<p>\n\nEric,<p>\n\nGreetings from a caf\u00e9 in Lisbon! Your new, seriously cool <i>I,Brain</i> case raises an important point about my original test in my Ted talk and is right out of a cyberpunk novel.  A few initial points, for readers, before I respond, as Ted talks don\u2019t give much philosophical detail:<p>\n\n1. It may be that the microchips are made of something besides silicon, (right now, e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene are alternate substrates under development). I don\u2019t think this matters \u2013 the issues that arise are the same.<p>\n\n2. It will be important that any chip test involve the <b>very kind of chip substrate and design</b> as that used in the AI in question.<p>\n\n3. Even if a kind of chip works in humans, there is still the issue of whether the AI in question has the right functional organization for consciousness. Since AI could be very different than us, and it is even difficult to figure out these issues in the case of biological creatures like the octopus, this may turn out to be very difficult.<p>\n\n4. For relation of the chip test to intriguing ideas of Ned Block and Dave Chalmers on this issue, see a paper on <a href=\"http://schneiderwebsite.com/Susan_Schneiders_Website/Research.html\">my website</a> (a section in \u201c<a href=\"http://schneiderwebsite.com/Susan_Schneiders_Website/Research_files/How%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind%20can%20Shape%20the%20Future.pdf\">The Future of Philosophy of Mind</a>\u201d, based on an earlier op-ed of mine.)<p>\n\n5. As Eric knows, it is probably a mistake to assume that brain chips will be functional isomorphs. I\u2019m concerned with the development of real, emerging technologies, because I am concerned with finding a solution to the problem of AI consciousness based on an actual test. Brain chips, already under development at DARPA, may eventually be faster and more efficient information processors, enhance human consciousness, or, they may be low fidelity copies of what a given minicolumn does.  This depends upon how medicine progresses...<p>\n \nBack to my original \u201cChip Test\u201d (in the Ted talk). It\u2019s 2045. You are ready to upgrade your aging brain.  You go to <i>I,Brain</i>. They can gradually replace parts of your biological brain with microchips.  You are awake during the surgery, suppose, and they replace a part of your biological brain that is responsible for some aspect of consciousness, with a microchip.  Do you lose consciousness of something (e.g., do you lose part of your visual field)? If so, you will probably notice. This would be a sign that the microchip is the wrong stuff. Science could try and try to engineer a better chip, but if after years of trying, they never could get it right, perhaps we should conclude that that kind of substrate (e.g., silicon) does not give rise to consciousness.<p>\n\nOn the other hand, if the chips work, that kind of substrate is in principle the right stuff (it can, in the right mental environment, give rise to qualia) although there is a further issue of whether a particular AI that has such chips has the right organization to be conscious (e.g., maybe it has nothing like a global workspace, like a Rodney Brooks style robot, or maybe it is superintelligent, and has mastered everything already and eliminated consciousness because it is too slow and inefficient).<p>\n\nEric, your test is different, and I agree that someone should not trust that test. This would involve a systematic deception. What kind of society would do this?  A <b>zombie dictatorship</b>, of course, which seeks to secretly eliminate conscious life from the planet.  :-) <p> \n\nBut I think you want to apply your larger point to the original test. Is the idea: couldn\u2019t a chip be devised that would falsely indicate consciousness to the person? (Let\u2019s call this a \u201csham qualia chip.\u201d ) I think it is, so here\u2019s a reply: God yes, in a dystopian world. We had better watch out! That would be horrible medicine\u2026and luckily, it would involve a good deal of expense and effort, (systematically fooling someone about say, their visual experience, would be a major undertaking), so science would likely first seek a genuine chip substitute that preserved consciousness. (Would a sham qualia chip even clear the FDA :-) ? Maybe only if microchips were not the right stuff and it was the best science could do. After all, people would always be missing lost visual qualia, and it is best that they not suffer like this....). But crucially, since this would involve a deliberate effort on the part of medical researchers, we would know this, and so we would know that the chip is not a true substitute. Unless, that is, we are inhabitants of a <b>zombie dictatorship</b>.<p>\n\nThe upshot: It would involve a lot of extra engineering effort to produce a <b><i>sham qualia chip</i></b>, and we would hopefully know that the sham chip was really a device designed to fool us. If this was done because the genuine chip substitute could not be developed, this would probably indicate that chips aren\u2019t the right stuff, or that science needs to go back to the drawing board.<p>\n\nI propose a global ban on sham qualia chips in interest of preserving democracy.<p>\n\n---------------------------------------------<p>\n\nI (Eric) have some thoughts in response.  I'm not sure it would be harder to make a sham qualia chip than a genuine qualia chip.  Rather than going into detail on that now, I'll let it brew for a future post.  Meanwhile, others' reactions welcomed too!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7GGnk3ukyM/Vw_tgEda6UI/AAAAAAAABVQ/UB4PUmkVhT4WFXGH3JeHXUSv1K-s31gggCLcB/s1600/reading.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7GGnk3ukyM/Vw_tgEda6UI/AAAAAAAABVQ/UB4PUmkVhT4WFXGH3JeHXUSv1K-s31gggCLcB/s200/reading.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\nMy student Alan T. Moore defends his dissertation today.  (Good thing we <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/XWorld.htm\">proved he exists</a>!)  One striking idea from his dissertation is that much of our consciousness might be, in his terminology, <i>paraphenomenal</i>.  <b>A conscious experience is paraphenomenal to the extent it is uncorrelated with cognitive and behavioral processes</b>.  (That's my own tweaking of his formulation, not quite how Alan phrases it himself.)<p>\n<b><i>Complete</i> paraphenomenality is a possibility so bizarre and skeptical that I'm unaware of any philosopher who has seriously contemplated it.</b>  (It seems likely, though, that <i>someone</i> has, so I welcome references!)  Complete paraphenomenality would mean having a stream of experience that was entirely uncorrelated with any functional, cognitive, or sensory input and entirely uncorrelated with any functional, cognitive, or behavioral output (including introspective self-report).  Imagine laying the stream of William James's conscious experience atop the behavior and cognitive life of Moctezuma II, or atop a stone -- simply no relationship between the non-phenomenal aspects of one's cognitive life and one's outward behavior (or lack of it) and the stream of lived experience.  Or imagine taking the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/\">philosophical zombie</a> scenario and instead of denying the zombies any experience, randomly scramble which body has which set of experiences, while holding all the physical and behavioral stuff constant in each body.<p>\n<i>Paraphenomenal</i> is not the same as <i>epiphenomenal</i>.  Epiphenomenalism about consciousness is the view that conscious experience has no causal influence, the view that consciousness is a causal dead-end.  But most epiphenomenalists believe, indeed emphasize, that conscious experience still <i>correlates</i> with causally efficacious brain processes.  On paraphenomenalism, in contrast, there aren't even correlations.<p>\n\nComplete paraphenomenalism is about as implausible a philosophical view as one is likely to find.  <b>However, <i>partial</i> paraphenomenalism has some plausibility as an interpretation of recent empirical evidence, from Moore and others.</b>  Partial paraphenomenalism is the view that the correlations between conscious experiences and cognitive processes are <b>weaker and more limited</b> than one might otherwise expect -- that, for example, presence or absence of the conscious experience of visual imagery is largely irrelevant to performance on the types of cognitive tasks that are ordinarily thought to be aided by imagery.  If so, this would be one way to explain empirical results suggesting that self-reported visual imagery abilities are largely uncorrelated with performance on \"imagery\" tasks like mental rotation and mental folding.  (See my discussion <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Imagery.htm\">here</a> and in Ch. 3 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262014904/\">my 2011 book</a>.)<p>\n\nEspecially strikingly to me are the vast differences in the experiences that people report in <a href=\"https://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/\">Russell T. Hurlburt</a>'s Descriptive Experience Sampling (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Inner-Experience-descriptive-Consciousness/dp/9027252009\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Describing-Inner-Experience-Philosophical-Psychology/dp/0262083663\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/heavey-hurlburt-2008.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Investigating-Pristine-Inner-Experience-Moments/dp/0521279127\">here</a>).  Hurlburt \"beeps\" people at random moments throughout their day.  When the beep sounds, their task is to recall their last moment of experience immediately before the beep.  Hurlburt then later interviews them about details of the targeted experience.  Some of Hurlburt's participants report conscious sensory experiences in almost all of their samples, while others almost never report sensory experiences.  Some of Hurlburt's participants report inner speech in almost all of their samples, while others almost never report inner speech.  Similarly for emotional feelings, imageless or \"unsymbolized\" thinking, and visual imagery -- some participants report these things in almost every sample, others never or almost never.  Huge, huge differences in the general reported arc of experience!  When functional cognitive capacities vary that much between people, it's immediately obvious (e.g., blind people vs. sighted people). But no such radical differences are evident among most of Hurlburt's participants.  Participants often even surprise themselves.  For example, it's not uncommon for people to initially say, before starting the sampling process, that they experience a stream of constant inner speech, but then report few or no instances of it when actually sampled.<p>\n\nIn his dissertation, <b>Moore finds very large differences in people's reported experiences while reading</b> (some of the preliminary data were reported <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-experience-of-reading-imagery-inner.html\">here</a>), <b>but those reported experiential differences don't seem to predict performance in plausibly related cognitive tasks</b> like recall of visual details from the story (for people reporting high visual imagery), rhyme disambiguation (for people reporting hearing the text in inner speech), or recall of details of the visual layout of the text (for people reporting visually experiencing the words on the page in front of them).<p>\n\nWhen faced with radical differences in experiential report that are largely uncorrelated with the expected outward behavior or cognitive skills, we seem to have three interpretative choices:<p>\n\n1. <b>We could decide that the assumed functional relationship shouldn't have been expected in the first place.</b>  For example, in the imagery literature, some researchers decided that it was a mistake to have expected mental rotation ability to correlate with conscious visual imagery.  Conscious visual imagery plays an important causal functional role in cognition, just not <i>that</i> role.<p>\n\n2. <b>We could challenge the accuracy of the subjective reports.</b>  This has tended to be my approach in the past.  Maybe people who deny having visual sensory experience of the scene before them in Hurlburt's and Moore's data really do have sensory experience but either forget that experience or fail to understand exactly what is being asked.<p>\n\n3. <b>We could adopt partial paraphenomenalism about the experience.</b>  Maybe people really are radically different in their streams of experience while reading, or while going about their daily life, but those differences have little systematic relationship to the remainder of their cognition or behavior (apart from their ability to generate reports).  I wouldn't initially have been much attracted to this idea, but I now think it's an important option to keep explicitly on the table.  Alan Moore's dissertation builds an interesting case!<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/EMOJI-Reading-Glasses-T-shirt-Black/dp/B017A5ED8C\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Tomorrow I'm off to the <a href=\"http://www.apaonline.org/events/event_details.asp?legacy=1&amp;id=322905\">Pacific APA</a> in San Francisco. Thursday 4-6 I'm commenting on Wayne Wu's \"Introspection as Attention and Action\".  This post is adapted from those comments.<p>\n\n(Also Wed 6 pm I'm presenting my paper \"A Pragmatic Approach to the Metaphysics of Belief\" and Sat 6-9 I'm critic in an author-meets-critics on Jay Garfield's <i>Engaging Buddhism</i>.  Feel free to stop by!)<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------<p>\n\nWhat does <b>introspective attention to one's perceptual experiences amount to?</b>  As I look at my desk, I can attend to or think about my ongoing sensory experiences, reaching judgments about their quality or character.  For example, I'm visually experiencing a brownish, slightly complicated oblong shape in my visual periphery (which I know to be my hat).  I'm having auditory experience of my coffee-maker spitting and bubbling as it brews the pot.  What exactly am I doing, in the process of reaching these judgments?<p>  \n\nOne thing that I'm <i>not </i>doing, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~waynewu/My_Academic_Site/Home.html\">Wayne Wu</a>, is launching a new process, distinct from the perceptual processes of seeing the hat and hearing the coffee-maker, which turns an \"attentional spotlight\" upon those perceptual processes.  <b>Introspective attention</b>, Wu argues -- and I agree -- <b>is a matter of applying phenomenal concepts in the course of ordinary perceiving</b>, with the goal of arriving at a judgment about your perceptual experience -- doing so in a way that isn't radically different from the way in which, according to your goals, you can aim to categorize the things you perceive along any of several different dimensions.<p>\n\nI hope the following is a Wu-friendly way of developing the idea.  Suppose you're looking at a coffee mug.  You can do so with any of a variety of perceptual goals in mind.  You can look at it with the aim of noticing details about its color -- its precise shade and how consistent or variable its color is across its face.  You can look at it with the aim of noticing details of its shape.  You can look at it with the aim of thinking about how it could effectively be used as a weapon.  You can look at it with a critical aesthetic eye.  Each of these aims is a way of attending differently to the mug, resulting in judgments that employ different conceptual categories.<p>\n\nYou can also look at the mug with an introspective aim, or rather with one of several introspective aims.  You can look at the mug with the aim of reaching conclusions about what your<i> visual experience</i> is as you look at the mug rather than with the aim of reaching conclusions about the physical mug itself.  You might be interested in noticing your experience of the mug's color, possibly distinct from mug's real color.  According to Wu, this is not a process radically different from ordinary acts of perception.  Introspection your visual experience of the color or shape of the mug is <b>not a two-stage process that consists of <i>first </i>perceiving the mug and then <i>second </i> of introspecting the experiences that arise in the course of that perceptual act.</b><p>\n\nThe approach Wu and I favor is especially attractive in thinking about what the early introspective psychologists <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_B._Titchener\">E.B. Titchener</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Boring\">E.G. Boring</a> called \"R-error\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1413768\">stimulus error</a>\".  Imagine that you're lying on your stomach and an experimenter is gently poking the bare skin of your back with either one or two toothpicks.  You might have one of two different tasks.  An <i>objective</i> task would be to guess whether you are being poked by only one toothpick or instead by both toothpicks at once.  You answer with either \"one\" or \"two\".  It's easy to tell that you're being poked by two if the toothpicks are several centimeters apart, but once they are brought close enough together, the task becomes difficult.  Two toothpicks placed within a centimeter of each other on your back are likely to feel like only a single toothpick.  The <i>objective</i> task would be to guess how many toothpicks you are being poked with in reality.<p>\n\nAn <i>introspective</i> task might be very similar but with a crucial difference: You are asked to report whether you have <i>tactile experience</i> of two separate regions of pressure or only one region.  Again you might answer \"one\" or \"two\".  This is of course not the same as the objective task.  You're reporting not on facts about the toothpicks but rather on facts about your experience of the toothpicks.  The objective task and the introspective task have different truth conditions.  For example if two toothpicks are pressed to your back only 6 millimeters apart and you say \"one\" you've given the wrong answer if your task is objective but quite possibly the right answer if your task is introspective.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_aa_x4C25wk/Vvq8f5yUg-I/AAAAAAAABT0/DsA8M8EIc-gZLta2my-42iXmo17gq-vOw/s1600/Edwin_G._Boring.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_aa_x4C25wk/Vvq8f5yUg-I/AAAAAAAABT0/DsA8M8EIc-gZLta2my-42iXmo17gq-vOw/s400/Edwin_G._Boring.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n[Edwin G. Boring in 1961]<p>\n\nHere's the thing that Titchener and Boring noticed, which they repeatedly warn against in their discussions of introspective methodology: People very easily slide back and forth between the introspective task and the objective task.  It's not entirely natural to keep them distinct in your mind over the course of a long series of stimuli.  You might be assigned the introspective task, for example, and start saying \"one\", \"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"two\", \"two\", \"two\" -- at first your intentions are clearly introspective, but then by the thirtieth trial you have slipped into the more familiar objective way of responding and you're just guessing how many toothpicks there actually are, rather than reporting introspectively.  If you've slipped from the introspective to the objective mode of reporting, you've committed what Titchener and Boring call <i>stimulus error</i>.<p>\n\nFor Wu's and my view, the crucial point is this: It's very easy to shift unintentionally between the two ways of deploying your perceptual faculties.  In fact I'm inclined to think -- I don't know if Wu would agree with me about this -- that <b>for substantial stretches of the experiment your intentions might be vague enough that there's no determinate fact about the content of your utterances.</b>  Is your \"one\" really a report about your experience or a report about the world outside?  It might be kind of muddy, kind of in-between.  You're just rolling along not very thoughtful of the distinction. <b> What distinguishes the introspective judgment from the perceptual judgment in this case is a kind of minor thing about your background intentions in making your report.</b><p>\n\nIntrospection of perceptual experience is perception with a twist, with an aim slightly different from the usual aim of reporting on the outside world.  That's the idea.  It's not a distinct cognitive process that begins after the perceptual act ends, ontologically distinct from the perceptual act and taking the perceptual act as its target.<p>\n\nWhen you know that your experience might be misleading, the difference can matter to your reporting.  For example, if you know that you're pretty bad at detecting two toothpicks when they're close together and you have reason to think that lots of the trials will have toothpicks close together, and if your focus is on objective reporting, you might say: \"Well, 50-50% -- might be one, might be two for all I know\".  For introspective reporting, in contrast, you might say something like \"Sure feels like one, though I know you might well actually be touching me with two\".<p>\n\nIn visual experience, noticing blurriness is similar.  Take off your glasses or cross your eyes.  You know enough about the world to know that your coffee mug hasn't become objectively vague-edged and blurry.  So you attribute the blurriness to your experience.  This is a matter of seeing the world and reaching judgments about your experience in the process.  You reach an experiential judgment rather than or in addition to an objective judgment just because of certain background facts about your cognition.  Imagine someone so naive and benighted as to think that maybe actual real-world coffee mugs do in fact become vague bordered and blurry edged when she takes off her glasses.  It seems conceivable that we could so bizarrely structure someone's environment that she actually came to adulthood thinking this.  That person might then not know whether to apply blurriness to the outward object or to her experience of the object.  <b>It's a similar perceptual act of looking at the mug, but given different background concepts and assumptions in one case she reaches an introspective attribution while in the other case she reaches an objective attribution.</b><p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Boring\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Related:<p></p></i>\n<li>\"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrospectionWhat.htm\">Introspection, What?</a>\" (2012), in D.

He focuses especially on arguments I developed in my 2011 book <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Perplexities.htm\">Perplexities of Consciousness</a>.<p>\n\nPeels considers arguments for the unreliability of introspection based on: the sometimes large effect of reporting method (e.g., button press vs. verbal report) on the content of introspective judgments; cultural variation in whether dreams are seen as colored; the poor correlation between self-reported visual imagery and performance on cognitive tasks often thought to be facilitated by visual imagery (such as mental rotation or folding tasks); people's ignorance of their capacity for echolocation; and people's ignorance of the lack of detail and precision in the visual field.  In each case, Peels presents the skeptic's argument in a couple of pages and then offers a couple of pages of objections.<p>\n\nFor example, Peels offers three responses to my observation that self-reports of mental imagery tend not to correlate with behavioral performance on seemingly related cognitive tasks.  First, he points out that since people don't have access to other people's imagery, terms like \"vivid\" might be interpreted quite differently between subjects -- and thus people might be accurate in their own idiolect even if not in an outwardly measurable way.  Second, he suggests that the aspects of mental imagery being reported (such as vividness) might not be relevant to the cognitive tasks at hand (like mental rotation), in which case lack of correlation is to be expected.  Third, he notes that some studies (a minority) do report positive correlations.  While in my discussion of this topic, I <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/Perplexities-Ch3-Imagery-091105.pdf\">have given reasons</a> to be leery of psychological findings that fail to replicate -- such as experimenter bias, \"file-drawer\" effects, the existence of confounding or intervening variables, and participants' tendency to confirm perceived research hypotheses -- Peels argues that I have presented insufficient positive evidence that such factors are at work in these cases.<p>\n\nThe imagery case is, I think, illustrative of the debate in two ways: First, <b>a lot hinges on examination of the empirical details</b>, such as the precise nature of the measures.  And second, a<b> lot hinges on judgments of plausibility about which reasonable people might differ</b>.  For example, looking at hundreds of studies of visual imagery self-report and cognitive performance, a literature with lots of null results and non-replications, does one think (as I do), \"That looks pretty bad for the reality of an underlying effect\" or does one think (as Peels seems to), \"There probably is an effect in there somewhere that the null studies aren't effectively getting at\".  This sort of thing is a matter of judgment.  (And no, I don't think the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2007/09/what-does-non-effect-look-like-meta.html\">typical statistical meta-analysis</a> will yield a straightforward answer that we should take at face value.)<p>\n\nOne's sense of plausibility, in such matters, comes close to being something like one's general academic worldview -- about philosophy, about psychology, and about their interaction.  Here, I find the introduction and conclusion of Peels' essay interesting.<p>\n\nIn the introduction, Peels lists four reasons the question of the reliability of introspection is important:\n\n<blockquote><p>(a.) Ordinary \"common sense\" tends to treat introspection as a reliable source of knowledge.  To reject its reliability is to <b>challenge common sense</b>.<p>\n\n(b.) There's a philosophical tradition from Descartes to Chalmers of taking introspection (appropriately restricted) as infallible.  To reject introspection's reliability means <b>abandoning the infallibilist tradition</b>.<p>\n\n(c.)There's a contrary \"scientistic\" tradition that emphasizes science as the only secure source of knowledge and regards introspection as non-scientific.  To reject introspection's reliability <b>plays into the hands of those who want to privilege the epistemic role of science</b>.<p>\n<p> (d.) There's a <b>debate <i>within </i>science about how to treat introspective self-reports</b>.</p></p></p></p></p></blockquote></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>April 2, I'll be a critic at a <a href=\"http://www.apaonline.org/events/event_details.asp?id=322900\">Pacific APA</a> author-meets-critics session on Quassim Cassam's book <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199657575.do\">Self-Knowledge for Humans</a>.  (Come!)  In the last chapter of the book, Cassam argues that self-knowledge is not intrinsically valuable.  It's only, he says, <i>derivatively </i>or <i>instrumentally</i> valuable -- valuable to the extent it helps deliver something <i>else</i>, like happiness.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-FesaV1JMROE/VNu3VTdjHaI/AAAAAAAAAwY/YFKN6LS_oS0/s1600/CassamCover.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-FesaV1JMROE/VNu3VTdjHaI/AAAAAAAAAwY/YFKN6LS_oS0/s320/CassamCover.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nI disagree. <b>Self-knowledge is intrinsically valuable!</b>  It's valuable even if it doesn't advance some other project, valuable even if it doesn't increase our happiness.  Cassam defends his view by objecting to three possible arguments for the intrinsic value of self-knowledge.  I'll spot him those objections.  Here are three other ways to argue for the intrinsic value of self-knowledge.<p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Transparency is a fun concept, as applied in the recent philosophical literature on self-knowledge (e.g., <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-knowledge/#2.3\">here</a>; see also these <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/01/two-approaches-to-transparency-about.html\">past</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/10/transparency-of-warped-windows.html\">posts</a>).  I want to extend the transparency metaphor to self-knowledge of personality traits, where philosophers haven't yet taken it (to my knowledge).<p>\n\nFirst, the established versions:<p>\n<b>Transparency 1: Sensory experience.</b>  As <a href=\"http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica\">G.E. Moore</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2214186\">Gilbert Harman</a> have noticed, when you try to attend to your visual experience you (usually? inevitably?) end up attending to external objects instead (or at least <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/SIEIET\">in addition</a>).  Attend to your experience of the computer screen.  In <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4321404\">some sense</a> it seems like your attention slips right through the experience itself, lodging upon the screen.<p>\n<b>Transparency 2: Attitudes.</b>  As <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Varieties-Reference-Clarendon-Paperbacks/dp/0198246862\">Gareth Evans</a> notices, when someone asks you if you think there will be a third world war, you typically answer by thinking about the outside world -- about the likelihood of war -- rather than by turning your attention inward toward your own mental states.  <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/GORARF\">More contentiously</a>, thinking about whether you want ice cream also seems to involve, mostly, thinking about the world -- about the advantages and disadvantages of eating ice cream.<p>\n\nIn both types of case, <b>you learn about <i>yourself </i>by attending to the <i>outside world</i>.</b>  One feature of this metaphor <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/10/transparency-of-warped-windows.html\">that I especially like</a> is that you can <b>learn about distortions in yourself</b> by noticing features of the world that don't align with your general knowledge.  Gazing through a window, if the trees are a weird color, you know the window is tinted; if the trees wiggle around as you shift head position, you know the window is warped.  If the lamplights at night radiate spears, you've learned something about distortions in your vision.  If your paper is The Best Thing Ever Published, you've learned something about your egocentric bias.<p>\n\nThis brings me to:<p>\n<b>Transparency 3: Personality.</b>  Since I think <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">personality traits and attitudes are basically the same thing</a>, I regard Transparency 3 as a natural extension of Transparency 2.  (And since 2 and 1 are also related, maybe we have 1 3/4 kinds of transparency rather than three kinds.)  <b>To find out if you're the kind of person who loves children, think about children.</b>  To find out if you're an extravert, think about parties.  Since your personality colors your view of the world, one way to learn about your personality is to look at a relevant part of the world and notice its color.  (You can also consider your past behavior; or directly try a label on for size; or ask friends for their frank opinion of you.  Transparency-style reflection on the world isn't the only, or even always a very good, route to self-knowledge.)<p>\n\nThis approach might work especially well for the \"<a href=\"http://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/bigfive.html\">Big Five</a>\" personality trait <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness\">Agreeableness</a>.  \"Agreeable\" people are those who self-rate, or are rated by others, as being concerned for other people, interested in them, sympathetic, helpful.  <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1081&amp;context=managementfacpub\">Several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20175628\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/37/9/1172.abstract\">studies</a> suggest that<b> people who self-rate as agreeable tend also to be more likely to rate others as agreeable (sympathetic, helpful, etc.)</b>, and also to rate other people positively in other ways too, especially if the other person is not very well known.  If you're a sweetheart, the world seems to be full mostly of sweethearts and interesting people; <a href=\"http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/if-youre-surrounded-by-idiots-guess-whos-the-jerk/\">if you're a jerk, the world seems to be full of jerks and fools</a>.  What I'm proposing to call the transparency approach to self-knowledge of personality simply involves running this observation the other direction: From the fact that the world seems full of uninteresting and disagreeable people, infer that you are a disagreeable person; from the fact that the world seems full of warm, loving, interesting people, infer that you are a relatively sympathetic, concerned person.<p>\n<b>Now it would be really interesting if it turned out that these sorts of <i>perceiver effects</i> were actually better predictors of underlying personality as constituted by patterns of real-world behavior than are the typical self-rating scales used in personality psychology</b> -- but it's probably too much to hope that the world would align so neatly with my own theoretical biases.  (Hm, what does that last judgment reveal about my personality?)</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>What is introspection?  Nothing!  Or rather, almost everything.<p>\n<b>A long philosophical tradition</b>, going back at least to Locke, <b>has held that there is a distinctive faculty</b> by means of which we know our own minds -- or at least our currently ongoing stream of conscious experience, our sensory experience, our imagery, our emotional experience and inner speech.  \"Reflection\" or \"inner sense\" or introspection is, in this common view, <b>a single type of process</b>, yielding highly reliable (maybe even infallibly certain) knowledge of our own minds.<p>\n\nCritics of this approach to introspection have tended to either:<p>\n\n(a.) radically deny the existence of the human capacity to discover a stream of inner experience (e.g., radical <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/\">behaviorism</a>);<p>\n\n(b.) attribute our supposedly excellent self-knowledge of experience to some distinctive process <i>other </i>than introspection (e.g., <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/introspection/#Exp\">expressivist</a> or <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/introspection/#Tra\">transparency approaches</a>, on which \"I think that...\" is just a dongle added to a judgment about the outside world, no inward attention or scanning required); or \n\n<p>(c.) be pluralistic in the sense that we have one introspective mechanism to scan our beliefs, another to scan our visual experiences, another to scan our emotional experiences....<p>\n\nBut here's another possibility: Introspective judgments arise from a range of processes that is <b>diverse both <i>within-case</i></b> (i.e., lots of different processes feeding any one judgment) <b>and <i>between-case</i></b> (i.e., very different sets of processes contributing to the judgment on different occasions) and yet also allows that <b>introspective judgments arise <i>partly </i>through a relatively direct sensitivity to the conscious experiences that they are judgments about</b>.<p>\n\nConsider an <b>analogy</b>:  You're at a science conference or a high school science fair, quickly trying to take in a poster.  <b>You have no dedicated faculty of poster-taking-in.</b>  Rather, you deploy a variety of cognitive resources: visually appreciating the charts, listening to the presenter's explanation, simultaneously reading pieces of the poster, charitably bringing general knowledge to bear, asking questions and listening to responses both for overt content and for emotional tone....  It needn't be the same set of resources every time (you needn't even use vision: sometimes you can just listen, if you're in the mood or visually impaired).  <b>Instead, you flexibly, opportunistically use a diverse range of resources</b>, dedicated to the question of <i>what are the main ideas of this poster</i>, in a way that aims to be relatively directly sensitive to the actual content of the poster.<p>\n\nIntrospection, in my view, is like that.  If I want to know what my visual experience is right now, or my emotional experience, or my auditory imagery, I engage not one cognitive process that was selected or developed primarily for the purpose of acquiring self-knowledge; rather I engage a diversity of processes that were primarily selected or developed for other purposes.  I look outward at the world and think about what, given that world, it would make sense for me to be experiencing right now; but also I am attuned to the possibility that I might not be experiencing that, ready to notice clues pointing a different direction.  I change and shape my experience in the very act of thinking about it, often (but not always) in a way that improves the match between my experience and my judgment about it.  I have memories (short- and long-term), associations, things that it seems more natural and less natural to say, views sometimes important to my self-image about what types of experience I tend to have, either in general or under certain conditions, emotional reactions that color or guide my response, spontaneous speech impulses that I can inhibit or disinhibit.  Etc.  <b>And any combination of these processes, and others besides, can swirl together to precipitate a judgment about my ongoing stream of experience.</b><p>\n\nNow the functional set-up of the mind is such that some processes' outputs are contingent upon the outputs of other processes.  <b>Pieces of the mind stay in sync with what is going on in other pieces</b>, keep a running bead on each other, with varying degrees of directness and accuracy.  And so also introspective judgments will be causally linked to a wide variety of other cognitive processes, including normally both relatively short and relatively circuitous links from the processes that give rise to the conscious experiences that the introspective judgments are judgments about.  But <b>these kinds of contingencies imply no distinctive introspective self-scanning faculty; it's just how the mind must work, if it is to be a single coherent mind,</b> and it happens preconsciously in systems no-one thinks of as introspective, e.g., in the early visual system, as well as farther downstream.<p>\n\n[For further exposition of this view, with detailed examples, see my essay <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrospectionWhat.htm\">Introspection, What?</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Recently, I've been arguing (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh6.htm\">here</a>) that we should be skeptical about any general theory of consciousness, whether philosophical or scientific.  Here's one way of putting the case.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-QoGv31ixJH4/UwUSMzNYH3I/AAAAAAAAAj0/Zj6GtWRGAe0/s1600/confusedbrain.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-QoGv31ixJH4/UwUSMzNYH3I/AAAAAAAAAj0/Zj6GtWRGAe0/s1600/confusedbrain.jpg\" width=\"168\"/></a></div>\nWhen we advance a general theory of consciousness, we must do so on some combination of empirical grounds (especially the study of actual conscious systems here on Earth) and armchair reflection (especially thought experiments).<p>\n\nOur empirical grounds are very limited: <b>We have only seen conscious systems as they exist on Earth</b>. To draw, on these grounds, universal conclusions about how any conscious system <i>must </i>be structured would be a reckless leap, <i>if </i>our theories are really supposed to be driven by empirical tests on conscious animals, which could have come out either way. Who knows how those crucial theory-driving experiments would have come out on very differently constructed beings from Andromeda Galaxy?<br/>\n<br/>\nA truly universal theory of consciousness seems more likely to succeed if it draws broadly from a range of hypothetical cases, abstracting away from empirical details of implementation on Earth. So we must sit in our armchairs. However, armchair reflection about the consciousness of hypothetical beings has two huge shortcomings:\n<br/>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Experts in the field reach very different conclusions</b> when asked to reflect on what sorts of hypothetical beings would be conscious (all the way from <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/\">panpsychism</a> to views that require highly sophisticated cognitive abilities).</li>\n<li><b>Our judgments about such cases must be grounded in some sort of prior knowledge</b>, such as our experience of beings here on Earth and our developmentally and socially and evolutionarily favored beliefs.  And there seems little reason to trust such judgments outside the run of normal cases, for example, about the <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">consciousness or not of large group entities</a> under various conditions.</li>\n</ol><p>\nIf you are moved by these concerns, you might think that the appropriate response is to restrict our theory to consciousness as it appears on Earth. But even just thinking about consciousness on Earth drops us into a huge methodological dilemma. If we treat introspective reportability as something close to a necessary condition for consciousness, then we end up with a very sparse view of the distribution of consciousness on Earth. And maybe that's right! <b>But it also seems reasonable to think that consciousness might be possible without introspective reportability, e.g., in dogs and babies. And then it becomes extremely unclear how we determine whether it is present without begging big theoretical questions.</b> How could we possibly determine whether an ant is conscious without begging the question against people with very different views than our own?<p>\n<b>Could we forget about non-human animals and babies and restrict our (increasingly less general) theory of consciousness just to adult humans? Even here, I incline toward pessimism</b>, at least for the medium-term future.<p>\n\nOne reason is this: <b>I see no near-term way to resolve the question of <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh6.htm\">whether consciousness abundantly outruns attention</a></b>. I think I can imagine two very different possibilities here. One possibility is that I have constant tactile experience of my feet in my shoes, constant auditory experience of the hum of the refrigerator, etc., but when I'm not attending to such matters, that experience drops out of memory so quickly and is so lightly processed that it is unreportable. Another possibility is that I usually have no tactile experience whatsoever of my feet in my shoes or auditory experience of the hum of the fridge unless these things capture my attention for some reason. These possibilities seem substantively distinct, and it's easy to see how a proponent of one can create a methodological error theory to explain away the judgments of a proponent of the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow maybe there's a way around these problems. Scientists have often found ingenious ways to embarrass earlier naysayers! But still, there's such a huge spread between the best neuroscientific approaches (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.architalbiol.org/aib/article/view/15056\">Tononi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027700001232\">Dehaene</a>) and such a huge spread between the best philosophical approaches (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Conscious-Mind-Fundamental-Philosophy/dp/0195117891\">Chalmers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661/\">Dennett</a>), that it's hard for me to envision a well-justified consensus emerging in my philosophical lifetime.<p>\n [HT <a href=\"http://rsbakker.wordpress.com/\">Scott Bakker</a>, who has been pushing me on these issues.]</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>In \"The Unreliability of Naive Introspection\" (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Naive.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh7.htm\">here</a>), I argue, contra a philosophical tradition going back at least to Descartes, <b> that we have much better knowledge of middle-sized objects in the world around us than we do of our stream of sensory experience while perceiving those objects</b>.<p>\n\nAs I write near the end of that paper:<blockquote>The tomato is stable.  My visual experience as I look at the tomato shifts with each saccade, each blink, each observation of a blemish, each alteration of attention, with the adaptation of my eyes to lighting and color.  My thoughts, my images, my itches, my pains \u2013 all bound away as I think about them, or remain only as interrupted, theatrical versions of themselves.  Nor can I hold them still even as artificial specimens \u2013 as I reflect on one aspect of the experience, it alters and grows, or it crumbles.  The unattended aspects undergo their own changes too.  If outward things were so evasive, they\u2019d also mystify and mislead.</blockquote>\n\nLast Saturday, I defended this view for three hours before commentator <a href=\"http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/carlottapavese.html\">Carlotta Pavese</a> and a number of other New York philosophers (including <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/\">Ned Block</a>, <a href=\"http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/paulboghossian\">Paul Boghossian</a>, <a href=\"http://consc.net/chalmers/\">David Chalmers</a>, <a href=\"http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/paulhorwich.html\">Paul Horwich</a>, <a href=\"http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/christopher-ab-peacocke\">Chris Peacocke</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jimpryor.net/\">Jim Pryor</a>).<p>\n\nOne question -- raised first, I think, by Paul B. then later by Jim -- was this: <b>Don't I know that I'm having a visual experience as of seeing a hat at least as well as I know that there is in fact a real hat in front of me?</b>  I could be wrong about the hat without being wrong about the visual experience as of seeing a hat, but to be wrong about having a visual experience as of seeing a hat, well, maybe it's not impossible but at least it's a weird, unusual case.<p>\n\nI was a bit rustier in answering this question than I would have been in 2009 -- partly, I suspect, because I never articulated in writing my standard response to that concern.  So let me do so now.<p>\n\nFirst, we need to know what kind of mental state this is about which I supposedly have excellent knowledge.  Here's one possibility: To have \"a visual experience as of seeing a hat\" is to have a visual experience of the type that is normally caused by seeing hats.  In other words, when I judge that I'm having this experience, I'm making a causal generalization about the normal origins of experiences of the present type.  But it seems doubtful that I know better what types of visual experiences normally arise in the course of seeing hats than I know that there is a hat in front of me.  In any case, such causal generalizations are not sort of thing defenders of introspection usually have in mind.<p>\n\nHere's another interpretative possibility: In judging that I am having a visual experience as of seeing a hat, I am reporting an inclination to reach a certain judgment.  I am reporting an inclination to judge that there is a hat in front of me, and I am reporting that that inclination is somehow caused by or grounded in my current visual experience.  On this reading of the claim, what I am accurate about is that I have a certain <i>attitude </i>-- an inclination to judge.  But attitudes are not conscious experiences.  Inclinations to judge are one thing; visual experiences another.  I might be very accurate in my judgment that I am inclined to reach a certain judgment about the world (and on such-and-such grounds), but that's not knowledge of my stream of sensory experience.<p>\n\n(In <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KnowOwnBel.htm\">a couple of</a> <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">other essays</a>, I discuss self-knowledge of attitudes.  I argue that our self-knowledge of our judgments is pretty good when the matter is of little importance to our self-conception and when the tendency to verbally espouse the content of the judgment is central to the dispositional syndrome constitutive of reaching that judgment.  Excellent knowledge of such partially self-fulfilling attitudes is quite a different matter from excellent knowledge of the stream of experience.)<p>\n\nSo how about this interpretative possibility?  To say I know that I am having a visual experience as of seeing a hat is to say that I am having a visual experience with such-and-such specific phenomenal features, e.g., this-shade-here, this-shape-here, this-piece-of-representational-content-there, and maybe this-holistic-character.  If we're careful to read such judgments purely as judgments about features of my current stream of visual experience, I see no reason to think we would be highly trustworthy in them.  Such structural features of the stream of experience are exactly the kinds of things about which I've argued we are apt to err: <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2006/05/do-tilted-coins-look-ellip_114850011009693840.html\">what it's like to see a tilted coin at an oblique angle</a>, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2008/01/peripheral-vision-mapping-color-onto.html\">how fast color and shape experience get hazy toward the periphery</a>, how stable or shifty the phenomenology of shape and color is, <a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ssiegel/papers/Precis%20of%20The%20Contents%20of%20Visual%20Experience.pdf\">how richly penetrated visual experience is with cognitive content</a>.  These are topics of confusion and dispute in philosophy and consciousness studies, not matters we introspect with near infallibility.<p>\n<b>Part of the issue here, I think, is that certain mental states have both a phenomenal face and a functional face.</b>  When I judge that I see something or that I'm hungry or that I want something, I am typically reaching a judgment that is in part about my stream of conscious experience and in part about my physiology, dispositions, and causal position in the world. <b> If we think carefully about even medium-sized features of the phenomenological face of such hybrid mental states </b>-- about what, exactly, <i>it's like</i> to experience hunger (how far does it spread in subjective bodily space, how much is it like a twisting or pressure or pain or...?) or about what, exactly, it's like to see a hat (how stable is that experience, how rich with detail, how do I experience the hat's non-canonical perspective...?), <b>we quickly reach the limits of introspective reliability</b>.  My judgments about even medium-sized features of my visual experience are dubious.  But I can easily answer a whole range of questions about comparably medium-sized features of the hat itself (its braiding, where the stitches are, its size and stability and solidity).<p>\n<i>Update, November 25 [revised 5:24 pm]:</i><p>\nPaul Boghossian writes:<blockquote>I haven't had a chance to think carefully about what you say, but I wanted to clarify the point I was making, which wasn't quite what you say on the blog, that it would be a weird, unusual case in which one misdescribes one's own perceptual states.<p>  \n\nI was imagining that one was given the task of carefully describing the surface of a table and giving a very attentive description full of detail of the whorls here and the color there.  One then discovers that all along one has just been a brain in a vat being fed experiences.  At that point, it would be very natural to conclude that one had been merely describing the visual images that one had enjoyed as opposed to any table.  Since one can so easily retreat from saying that one had been describing a table to saying that one had been describing one's mental image of a table, it's hard to see how one could be much better at the former than at the latter.<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~philos/white.html\">Roger White</a> then made the same point without using the brain in a vat scenario.  \n</p></p></blockquote>I do feel some sympathy for the thought that you get <i>something</i> right in such a case -- but <i>what </i>exactly you get right, and how dependably... well, that's the tricky issue!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>(by Alan T. Moore and Eric Schwitzgebel)<p>\n\nWhat do you usually experience when you read?<p>\n\nSome people say that they generally <b>hear the words of the text</b> in their heads, either in their own voice or in the voices of narrator or characters; others say they rarely do this.  Some people say they generally form <b>visual images of the scene or ideas</b> depicted; others say they rarely do this.  Some people say that when they are deeply enough absorbed in reading, <b>they no longer see the page</b>, instead playing the scene like a movie before their eyes; others say that even when fully absorbed they still always visually experience the words on the page.<p>\n\nSome quotes:\n\n<blockquote>Baars (2003): \u201cHuman beings talk to themselves every moment of the waking day.  Most readers of this sentence are doing it just now.\u201d<p>\n\nJaynes (1976): \u201cRight at this moment\u2026 as you read, you are not conscious of the letters or even of the words, or even of the syntax or the sentences, or the punctuation, but only of their meaning.\u201d<p>\n\nTitchener (1909): \u201cI instinctively arrange the facts or arguments in some visual pattern [such as] a suggestion of dull red\u2026 of angles rather than curves\u2026 pretty clearly, the picture of movement along lines, and of neatness or confusion where the moving lines come together.\u201d<p>\n\nWittgenstein (1946-1948): While reading \u201cI have impressions, see pictures in my mind\u2019s eye, etc.  I make the story pass before me like pictures, like a cartoon story.\u201d<p>\n\nBurke (1757): While reading \u201ca very diligent examination of my own mind, and getting others to consider theirs, I do not find that one in twenty times any such picture is formed.\u201d<p>\n\nHurlburt (2007): Some people \u201capparently simply read, comprehending the meaning without images or speech.  Melanie\u2019s general view\u2026 is that she starts a passage in inner speech and then \u201ctakes off\u201d into images.\u201d</p></p></p></p></p></blockquote>\n\nAlan and I can find no systematic studies of the issue.<p>\n\nWe recruited 414 U.S. <a href=\"https://www.mturk.com/mturk/\">mechanical Turk</a> workers to participate in a study on the experience of reading.  First we asked them for their general impressions about their own experiences while reading.  How often -- on a 1-7 scale from \"never\" to \"half of the time\" to \"always\" -- do they experience visual imagery?  Inner speech?  The words on the page?  (We briefly clarified these terms and gave examples.)<p>\n\nThe responses:<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-bKJ8mwJvnd8/Uhu4HIZ-4fI/AAAAAAAAAgc/RhVg7l1u8Y0/s1600/Imagery-130826.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-bKJ8mwJvnd8/Uhu4HIZ-4fI/AAAAAAAAAgc/RhVg7l1u8Y0/s400/Imagery-130826.jpg\"/></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fnt2iOBm8O0/Uhu4HJeiCNI/AAAAAAAAAgk/ALpOyLuUn88/s1600/InnerSpeech-130826.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fnt2iOBm8O0/Uhu4HJeiCNI/AAAAAAAAAgk/ALpOyLuUn88/s400/InnerSpeech-130826.jpg\"/></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUIMjiJQKhU/Uhu4HPc5q1I/AAAAAAAAAgY/--f-b9fz_5A/s1600/WordsOnPage-130826.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUIMjiJQKhU/Uhu4HPc5q1I/AAAAAAAAAgY/--f-b9fz_5A/s400/WordsOnPage-130826.jpg\"/></a></div>\n[Note: For words on the page, we asked: \"How often do you NOT experience the words on the page as you read?  Example: your mind is filled with the ideas of the story and not the actual black letters against the white background\".  We have reversed the scale for presentation here.]<p>\n\nNow, if you're anything like me, you'll be <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Naive.htm\">pretty skeptical</a> about the accuracy of these types of self-reports.  So Alan and I did several things to try to test for accuracy.<p>\n\nOur general design was to give each person a passage to read, during which they were interrupted with a beep and asked if they were experiencing imagery, inner speech, or the words on the page.  Afterwards, we asked comprehension questions, including questions about visual or auditory details of the story or about details of the visual presentation of the material (such as font).  Finally, we asked again for participants' general impressions about how regularly they experience imagery, inner speech, and the words on the page when they read.<p>\n\nThe comprehension questions were a mixed bag and difficult to interpret -- too much for this blog post (maybe we'll do a follow-up) -- but the other results are striking enough on their own.<p>\n<b>Among those who reported \"always\" experiencing inner speech while they read, only 78% reported inner speech in their one sampled experience.</b>  Think a bit about what that means.  Despite, presumably, some pressure on participants to conform to their earlier statements about their experience, <i>it took exactly one sampled experience</i> for 22% of those reporting constant inner speech to find an apparent counterexample to their initially expressed opinion.  Suppose we had sampled five times, or twenty?<p>\n\nFor comparison: 9% of those reporting \"always\" experiencing visual imagery denied experiencing visual imagery in their one sampled experience.  And 42% did the same about visually experiencing the words on the page.<p>\n\nParticipants' final reports about their reading experience, too, suggest substantial initial ignorance about their reading experience.  <b>The correlations between participants initial and final generalizations about reading experience were .47 for visual imagery, .58 for inner speech, and .37 for experience of words on the page.</b>  Such medium-sized correlations are quite modest considering that the questions being correlated are verbatim identical questions about participants' reading experience in general, with an interval of about 5-10 minutes between.  One might have thought that if people's general opinions about their experience are well-founded, the experience of reading a single passage should have only a minimal effect on such generalizations.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I'm an <i>introspective pessimist:</i> I think people's introspective judgments about their stream of conscious experience are often radically mistaken.  This is the topic of my 2011 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262014904/\">Perplexities of Consciousness</a>.  Over the past few years, I've found the most common objection to my work to be what I'll call the <i>Individual Differences Reply</i>.<p>\n\nMany of my arguments depend on what I call the <i>Argument from Variability</i>: Some people report experiences of Type X, others report experience of Type not-X, but it's not plausible that Group 1 and Group 2 differ enough in their underlying stream of experience to make both claims true.  Therefore, someone must be mistaken about their experience.  So for example: People used to say they dreamed in black and white; now people don't say that; so someone is wrong about their dream experiences.  Some people say that tilted coins in some sense look elliptical as though projected upon a 2D visual screen, while others say that visual experience is robustly 3D with no projective distortions at all.  Some people say that objects seen 20 degrees from the point of fixation look fairly clear and colorful, while others say objects 20 degrees from center look extremely sketchy and indeterminate of color.  Assuming a common underlying experience, disagreement reveals someone to be mistaken.  (Fortunately, we needn't settle which is the mistaken party.)<p>\n\nThe Individual Differences Reply challenges this assumption of underlying commonality.  If people differ in their experience as radically as is suggested by their introspective reports, then no one need be mistaken!  Maybe people did really used to dream in black and white and now they dream in color (<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/06/portrayals-of-dream-coloration-in-mid.html?showComment=1371857364091#c4560608641111518187\">see Ned Block's comment on a recent Splintered Mind post</a>).  Maybe some people really do see tilted coins as elliptical while others do not.<p>\n\nThere are two versions of the Individual Difference Reply, which I will call the <i>Stable Differences</i> and the <i>Temporary Differences</i> versions.  On the Stable Differences version, people <i>durably</i> differ in their experiences in such a way as to render their reports accurate as generalizations about their experiences.  On the Temporary Differences version, people might be similar in their experiences generally, but when faced with the introspective task itself their experience shifts in such a way as to match their reports.  For example, maybe everyone generally has similar experiences 20 degrees into the visual periphery, but when asked to introspect their visual experience, some people experience (and accurately report) clarity while others experience (and accurately report) haziness.<p>\n\nPeople who have pressed versions of the Individual Differences Reply on me include <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-013-9315-1\">Alsmith forthcoming</a>, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0017.2011.01418.x/abstract\">Hohwy 2011</a>, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00439.x/abstract\">Jacovides 2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DescExp.htm\">Hurlburt in Hurlburt &amp; Schwitzgebel 2007</a>.)<p>\n\nHere's how I think the dispute should be resolved: Look, on a case-by-case basis, for measurable brain or behavioral differences that tightly correlate with the differences in introspective report and which are plausibly diagnostic of the underlying variability.  If those correlations are found, accept that the reports reveal real differences.  If not, conclude that at least one party is wrong about their experience.<p>\n\nConsider black and white dreaming.  Theoretically, we could hook up brain imagining machinery to people who report black and white dreams and to people who report color dreams.  If the latter group shows substantially more neural activity in color-associated neural areas while dreaming, the reports are substantiated.  If not, the reports are undermined.  Alternatively, examine color term usage in dream narratives: How often do people use terms like \"red\", \"green\", etc., in dream diaries?  If the rates are different, that supports the existence of difference; if not, that supports the hypothesis of error.  In fact, I looked at exactly this in Chapter 1 of <i>Perplexities</i>, and found rates of color-term usage in dream reports to be the same during the peak period of black-and-white dream reporting (USA circa 1950) and recently (USA circa 2000).<p>\n\nGenerally, I think the evidence often shows a poor relationship between differences in introspective report and differences in plausibly corresponding behavior or physiology.<p>\n\nSometimes there is no systematic evidence, but antecedent plausibility considerations suggest against at least the Stable Differences version of the Individual Differences Reply: It seems highly unlikely that the people who report sharp visual experiences 20 degrees into the periphery differ vastly in general visual capacity or visual physiology from those who report highly indeterminate shape and color 20 degrees into the periphery.  But that's an empirical question, so test it if you like!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/spenermaja/home\">Maja Spener</a> has<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzcGVuZXJtYWphfGd4OjZlYmZlMDc2MmYxZmM4MzY\"> written an interesting critique</a> of my 2011 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262014904\">Perplexities of Consciousness</a>, for a forthcoming book symposium at <i>Philosophical Studies</i>.  My book is an extended argument that people have very poor knowledge of their own conscious experience, even of what one might have thought would be fairly obvious-seeming features of their currently ongoing experience (such as whether it is sparse or full of abundant detail, whether it is visually doubled, whether they have pervasive auditory experience of the silent surfaces around them).  Maja argues that we have good introspective knowledge in at least one class of cases: cases in which our skillful negotiation with the world depends on what she calls \"introspection-reliant abilities\".<p>\n\nMaja provides examples of two such introspection-reliant abilities: choosing the right amount of food to order at a restaurant (which relies on knowledge of how hungry you feel) and adjusting binoculars (which relies on knowing how blurry the target objects look).<p>\n\nLet's consider, then, Maja's binoculars.  What, exactly, are you noticing when you adjust your binoculars?<p>\n\nConsider other cases of optical reflection and refraction.  I see an oar half-submerged in water.  In some sense, maybe, it \"looks bent\".  Is this a judgment about my visual experience of the oar or instead a judgment about the optical structure of my environment? -- or a bit of both?  How about when I view myself in the bathroom mirror?  Normally during my morning routine, I seem to be reaching judgments primarily about my body and secondarily about the mirror, and hardly at all about my visual experience.  (At least, not unless we accept some kind of introspective foundationalism on which all judgments about the outside world are grounded on prior judgments about experience.)  Or suppose I'm just out of the shower and the mirror is foggy; in this case my primary judgment seems to concern neither my body nor my visual experience but rather the state of the mirror.  Similarly, perhaps, if the mirror is warped -- or if I am looking through a warped window, or a fisheye lens, or using a maladjusted review mirror at night, or looking in a carnival mirror.<p>\n\nIf I can reach such judgments directly without antecedent judgments about my visual experience, perhaps analogously in the binoculars case?  Or is there maybe instead some interaction among phenomenal judgments about experience and optical or objectual judgments, or some indeterminacy about what sort of judgment it really is?  We can create, I'm inclined to think, a garden path between the normal bathroom mirror case (seemingly not an introspective judgment about visual experience) and the blurry binoculars case (seemingly an introspective judgment about visual experience), going either direction, and thus into self-contradiction.  (For related cases feeding related worries see my essay in draft <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KnownIllusion.htm\">The Problem of Known Illusion and the Resemblance of Experience to Reality</a>.)<p>\n\nAnother avenue of resistance to the binoculars case might be this.  Suppose I'm looking at a picture on a rather dodgy computer monitor and it looks too blue, so I blame the monitor and change the settings.  Arguably, I could have done this without introspection: I reach a normal, non-introspective visual judgment that the picture of the baby seal is tinted blue.  But I know that baby seals are white.  So I blame the monitor and adjust.  Or maybe I have a real baby seal in a room with dubious, theatrical lighting.  I reach a normal visual assessment of the seal as tinted blue, so I know the lighting much be off and I ask the lighting techs to adjust.  Similarly perhaps, then, if I gaze at a real baby seal through blurry binoculars: I reach a normal, non-introspective judgment of the baby seal as blurry-edged.  But I know that baby seals have sharp edges.  So I blame the binoculars and adjust.  Need this be introspective at all, need it concern visual experience at all?<p>\n\nIn the same way, maybe, I see spears of light spiking out of streetlamps at night -- an illusion, some imperfection of my eyes or eyewear.  When I know I am being betrayed by optics, am I necessarily introspecting, or might I just be correcting my normal non-introspective visual assessments?<p>\n\nThis is a nest of issues I am struggling with, making less progress than I would like.  Maybe Maja is right, then.  But if so, it will take further work to show.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>You believe some proposition P.  You believe that Armadillo is the capital of Texas, say.[footnote 1]  Someone asks you what you think the capital of Texas is.  You say, \"In my opinion, the capital of Texas is Armadillo.\"  How do you know that that is what you believe?<p>\n\nHere's one account (e.g., in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mindreading-Integrated-Self-Awareness-Understanding-Cognitive/dp/0198236107\">Nichols and Stich 2003</a>): You have in your mind a dedicated \"Monitoring Mechanism\".  The job of this Monitoring Mechanism is to scan the contents of your Belief Box, finding tokens such as P (\"Armadillo is the capital of Texas\") or Q (\"There's an orangutan in the fridge\"), and producing, in consequence, new beliefs of the form \"I believe P\" or \"I believe Q\".  Similarly, it or a related mechanism can scan your Desire Box, producing new beliefs of the form \"I desire R\" or \"I desire S\".  Call this the <i>Dedicated Mechanism Account.</i><p>\n\nOne alternative account is <a href=\"http://faculty.philosophy.umd.edu/pcarruthers/\">Peter Carruthers</a>'s.  Carruthers <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Opacity-Mind-Integrative-Theory-Self-Knowledge/dp/0199596190/\">argues that there is no such dedicated mechanism</a>.  Instead, we theorize on the basis of sensory evidence and our own imagery.  For example, I hear myself saying -- either aloud or in inner speech (which is a form of imagery) -- \"The capital of Texas is Armadillo\", and I think something like, \"Well, I wouldn't say that unless I thought it was true!\", and so I conclude that I believe that Armadillo is the capital.  This theoretical, interpretative reasoning about myself is usually nonconscious, but in the bowels of my cognitive architecture, that's what I'm doing.  And there's no more direct route to self-knowledge, according to Carruthers.  We have to interpret ourselves given the evidence of our behavior, our environmental context, and our stream of imagery and inner speech.<p>\n\nHere's an argument against both accounts.<p>\n\nFirst, assume that to believe that P is to have a representation with the content P stored in a Belief Box (or memory store), i.e., ready to be accessed for theoretical inference and practical decision making.  (<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">I'm not keen on Belief Boxes myself</a>, but I'll get to that later.)  A typical deployment of P might be as follows: When Bluebeard says to me, \"I'm heading off to the capital of Texas!\", I call up P from my Belief Box and conclude that Bluebeard is heading off to Armadillo.  I might similarly ascribe a belief to Bluebeard on that basis.  Unless I have reason to think Bluebeard ignorant about the capital of Texas or (by my lights) mistaken about it, I can reasonably conclude that Bluebeard <i>believes </i>that he is heading to Armadillo.  All parties agree that I need not introspect to attribute this belief to Bluebeard, nor call upon any specially dedicated self-scanning mechanism (other than whatever allows ordinary memory retrieval), nor interpret my own behavior and imagery.  I can just pull up P to join it with other beliefs, and conclude that Q.  Nothing special here or self-interpretive.  Just ordinary cognition.<p>\n\nNow suppose the conclusion of interest -- the \"Q\" in this case -- is just \"I believe that P\".  What other beliefs does P need to be hooked up with to license this conclusion?  None, it seems!  I can go straightaway, in normal cases, from pulling up P to the conclusion \"I believe that P\".  If that's how it works, no dedicated self-scanning mechanism or self-interpretation is required, but only ordinary belief-retrieval for cognition, contra both Carruthers's view and Dedicated Mechanism Accounts.<p>\n\nThat will have seemed a bit fast, perhaps.  So let's consider some comparison cases.  Suppose Sally is the school registrar.  I assume she has true beliefs about the main events on the academic calendar.  I believe that final exams end on June 8.  If someone asks me when Sally believes final exams will end, I can call up P1 (\"exams end June 8\") and P2 (\"Sally has true beliefs about the main events on the academic calendar\") to conclude Q (\"Sally believes exams end June 8\").  Self-ascription would be like that, but without P2 required.  Or suppose I believe in divine omniscience.  From P1 plus divine omniscience, I can conclude that God believes P1.  Or suppose that I've heard that there's this guy, Eric Schwitzgebel, who believes all the same things I believe about politics.  If P1 concerns politics, I can conclude from P1 and this knowledge about Eric Schwitzgebel that this Eric Schwitzgebel guy believes P1.  Later I might find out that Eric Schwitzgebel is me.<p>\n\nDo I need to self-ascribe the belief that P1 before reaching that conclusion about the Eric Schwitzgebel guy?  I don't see why I must.  I know that moving from \"P1 is true and concerns politics\" to \"that Eric Schwitzgebel guy believes P1\" will get me true conclusions.  I can rely on it.  It might be cognitively efficient for me to develop a habit of thought by which I leap straight from one to the other.<p>\n\nAlternatively: Everyone thinks that I can at least sometimes ascribe myself beliefs as a result of inference.  I subscribe to a general theory, say, on which if P1 and P2 are true of Person S and if P3 and P4 are true in general about the world, then I can conclude that S believes Q.  Now suppose S is me.  And suppose Q is \"I believe P\" and suppose P3 is P.  And then jettison the rest of P1, P2, and P4.  Voila![footnote 2]<p>\n\nIf there is a Desire Box, it might work much the same way.  If I can call up the desire R to join with some other beliefs and desires to form a plan, in just the ordinary cognitive way that desires are called up, so also it seems I should be able to do for the purposes of self-ascription.  It would be odd if we could call up beliefs and desires for all the wide variety of cognitive purposes that we ordinarily call them up for but <i>not</i> for the purposes of self-ascriptive judgment.  What would explain that strange incapacity?<p>\n\nWhat if there isn't a Belief Box, a Desire Box, or a representational storage bin?  The idea remains basically the same: Whatever mechanisms allow me to reach conclusions and act <i>based on</i> my beliefs and desires should also allow me to reach conclusions <i>about</i> my beliefs and desires -- at least once I am cognitively sophisticated enough to have adult-strength concepts of belief and desire.<p>\n\nThis doesn't mean I never go wrong and don't self-interpret at all.  We are inconsistent and unstable in our belief- and desire-involving behavioral patterns; the opinions we tend to act on in some circumstances (e.g., when self-ascription or verbal avowal is our task) might very often differ from those we tend to act on in other circumstances; and it's a convenient shorthand -- too convenient, sometimes -- to assume that what we say, when we're not just singing to ourselves and not intending to lie, reflects our opinions.  Nor does it imply that there aren't also dedicated mechanisms of a certain sort.  My own view of self-knowledge is, in fact, <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KnowOwnBel.htm\">pluralist</a>.  But among the many paths, I think, is the path above.<p>\n\n(Fans of <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~philos/byrne.html\">Alex Byrne</a>'s approach to self-knowledge will notice substantial similarities between the above and <a href=\"http://mit.edu/abyrne/www/introspection.pdf\">his views</a>, to which I owe a considerable debt.)<p>\n<i>Update, February 27<p></p></i>\nPeter Carruthers replies as follows:<blockquote>Eric says: \u201cI can just pull up P to join it with other beliefs, and conclude that Q. Nothing special here or self-interpretive. Just ordinary cognition.\u201d This embodies a false assumption (albeit one that is widely shared among philosophers; and note that essentially the same response to that below can be made to Alex Byrne). This is that there is a central <i>propositional </i>workspace of the mind where beliefs and desires can be activated and interact with one another directly in unconstrained ways to issue in new beliefs or decisions. In fact there is no such amodal workspace. The only central workspace that the mind contains is the working memory system, which has been heavily studied by psychologists for the last half-century. The emerging consensus from this work (especially over the last 15 years or so) is that working memory is <i>sensory based</i>. It depends upon attention directed toward mid-level sensory areas of the brain, resulting in globally broadcast sensory representations in visual or motor imagery, inner speech, and so on. While these representations can have conceptual information bound into them, it is impossible for such information to enter the central workspace alone, not integrated into a sensory-based representation of some sort.<p>\n \nUnless P is an episodic memory, then (which is likely to have a significant sensory component), or unless it is a semantic memory stored, at least in part, in sensory format (e.g. a visual image of a map of Texas), then the only way for P to \u201cjoin with other beliefs, and conclude that Q\u201d is for it to be converted into (say) an episode of inner speech, which will then require interpretation.<p>\n \nThis is not to deny that <i>some </i>systems in the mind can access beliefs and draw inferences without those beliefs needing to be activated in the global workspace (that is, in working memory). In particular, goal states can initiate searches for information to enable the construction of plans in an \u201cautomatic\u201d, unconscious manner. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the mindreading system can do the same. Indeed, a second error made by Eric in his post is a failure to note that the mindreading system bifurcates into two (or more) distinct components: a domain-specific system that attributes mental states to others (and to oneself), and a set of domain-general planning systems that can be used to simulate the reasoning of another in order to generate predictions about that person\u2019s other beliefs or likely behavior. On this Nichols &amp; Stich and I agree, and it provides the former the wherewithal to reply to Eric\u2019s critique also. For the \u201cpulling up of beliefs\u201d to draw inferences about another\u2019s beliefs takes place (unconsciously) in the planning systems, and isn\u2019t directly available to the domain-specific system responsible for attributing beliefs to others or to oneself.</p></p></blockquote>\n\nPeter says: \"Unless P is an episodic memory... or unless it is a semantic memory stored, at least in part, in sensory format (e.g. a visual image of a map of Texas), then the only way for P to \u201cjoin with other beliefs, and conclude that Q\u201d is for it to be converted into (say) an episode of inner speech, which will then require interpretation.\"  I don't accept that theory of how the mind works, but even if I did accept that theory, it seems now like Peter is allowing that if P is a \"semantic memory\" stored in partly \"sensory format\" it <i>can</i> join with other beliefs to drive the conclusion Q without an intermediate self-interpretative episode.  Or am I misunderstanding the import of his sentence?  If I'm not misunderstanding, then hasn't just given me all I need for this step of my argument?  Let's imagine that \"Armadillo is the capital of Texas\" is stored in partly sensory format (as a visual map of Texas with the word \"Armadillo\" and a star).  Now Peter seems to be allowing that it can drive inferences without requiring an intermediate act of self-interpretation.  So then why not allow it to drive also the conclusion that I believe that Armadillo is the capital?  We're back to the main question of this post, right?<p>\n\nPeter continues: \"This is not to deny that <i>some </i>systems in the mind can access beliefs and draw inferences without those beliefs needing to be activated in the global workspace (that is, in working memory). In particular, goal states can initiate searches for information to enable the construction of plans in an \u201cautomatic\u201d, unconscious manner. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the mindreading system can do the same.\"  First, let me note that I agree that the fact that some systems can access stored representations without activating those representations in the global workspace doesn't stricly imply that the mindreading system (if there is a dedicated system, which is part of the issue in dispute) can also do so.  But I do think that if, for a broad range of purposes, we can access these stored beliefs, it would be <i>odd </i> if we couldn't do so for the purpose of reaching conclusions about our own minds.  We'd then need a pretty good theory of why we have this special disability with respect to mindreading.  I don't think Peter really offers us as much as we should want to explain this disability.<p>\n\n... which brings me to my second reaction to this quote.  What Peter seems to be presenting as a secondary feature of the mind -- \"the construction of plans in an 'automatic', unconscious manner\" -- is, in my view, the very heart of mentality.  For example, to create inner speech itself, we need to bring together a huge variety of knowledge and skills about language, about the social environment, and about the topic of discourse.  The motor plan or speech plan constructed in this way cannot mostly be driven by considerations that are pulled explicitly into the narrow theater of the \"global workspace\" (which is widely held to host only a small amount of material at a time, consciously experienced).  Our most sophisticated cognition tends to be what happens <i>before </i>things hit the global workspace, or even entirely independent of it.  If Peter allows, as I think he must, that that pre-workspace cognition can access beliefs like P, what then remains to be shown to complete my argument is just that these highly sophisticated P-accessing processes can drive the judgment or the representation or the conclusion that I believe that P, just as they can drive many other judgments, representations, or conclusions.  Again, I think the burden of proof should be squarely on Peter to show why this wouldn't be possible.<p>\n<i>Update, February 28</i><p>\nPeter responds:<blockquote>Eric writes: \u201cit seems now like Peter is allowing that if P is a \"semantic memory\" stored in partly \"sensory format\" it <i>can </i>join with other beliefs to drive the conclusion Q without an intermediate self-interpretative episode.\u201d<p>\n\nI allow that the <i>content </i>of sensory-based memory can enter working memory, and so can join with other beliefs to drive a conclusion. But that the content in question is the content of a <i>memory </i>rather than a fantasy or supposition requires interpretation. There is nothing about the content of an image as such that identifies it as a memory, and memory images don\u2019t come with tags attached signifying that they are memories. (There is a pretty large body of empirical work supporting this claim, I should say. It isn\u2019t just an implication of the ISA theory.)<p>\n\nEric writes: \u201cBut I do think that if, for a broad range of purposes, we can access these stored beliefs, it would be <i>odd </i>if we couldn't do so for the purpose of reaching conclusions about our own minds. We'd then need a pretty good theory of why we have this special disability with respect to mindreading.\u201d<p>\n\nWell, I and others (especially Nichols &amp; Stich in their mindreading book) had provided that theory. The separation between thought-attribution and behavioral prediction is now widely accepted in the literature, with the latter utilizing the subject\u2019s own planning systems, which can in turn access the subject\u2019s beliefs. There is also an increasing body of work suggesting that on-line, unreflective, forms of mental-state attribution are encapsulated from background beliefs. (I make this point at various places in <i>The Opacity of Mind</i>. But more recently, see Ian Apperly\u2019s book <i>Mindreaders</i>, and my own \u201cMindreading in Infancy\u201d, shortly to appear in <i>Mind &amp; Language</i>.) The claim also makes good theoretical sense seen in evolutionary and functional terms, if the mindreading system evolved to track the mental states of others and generate predictions therefrom. From this perspective one might predict that thought-attribution could access a domain-specific database of acquired information (e.g. \u201cperson files\u201d containing previously acquired information about the mental states of others), without being able to conduct free-wheeling searches of memory more generally.<p>\n\nEric writes: \u201cthese highly sophisticated P-accessing processes can drive the judgment or the representation or the conclusion that I believe that P, just as they can drive many other judgments, representations, or conclusions. Again, I think the burden of proof should be squarely on Peter to show why this wouldn't be possible.\u201d<p>\n\nFirst, I concede that it is possible. I merely claim that it isn\u2019t actual. As for the evidence that supports such a claim, there are multiple strands. The most important is evidence that people confabulate about their beliefs and other mental states in just the sorts of circumstances that the ISA theory predicts that they would. (Big chunks of <i>The Opacity of Mind</i> are devoted to substantiating this claim.) Now, Eric can <i>claim </i>that he, too, can allow for confabulation, since he holds a pluralist account of self-knowledge. But this theory is too underspecified to be capable of <i>explaining </i>the data. Saying \u201csometimes we have direct access to our beliefs and sometimes we self-interpret\u201d issues in no predictions about when we will self-interpret. In contrast, other mixed-method theorists such as Nichols &amp; Stich and Alvin Goldman have attempted to specify when one or another method will be employed. But none of these accounts is consistent with the totality of the evidence. The only theory currently on the market that does explain the data is the ISA theory. And this entails that the only access that we have to our own beliefs is sensory-based and interpretive.\n</p></p></p></p></p></blockquote>\nI agree that people can certainly make \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692093/\">source monitoring</a>\" and related errors in which genuine memories of external events are confused with merely imagined events.  But it sounds to me like Peter is saying that a stored belief, in order to fulfill its function as a memory rather than a fantasy or supposition must be \"interpreted\" -- and, given his earlier remarks, presumably interpreted in a way that requires activation of that content in the \"global workspace\".  (Otherwise, his main argument doesn't seem to go through.)  I feel like I must be missing something.  I don't see how spontaneous, skillful action that draws together many influences -- for example, in conversational wit -- could realistically be construed as working this way.  Lots of pieces of background knowledge flow together in guiding such responsiveness; they can't all be mediated in the \"global workspace\", which is normally thought to have a very limited capacity.  (See also <a href=\"http://thorgan.faculty.arizona.edu/\">Terry Horgan</a>'s recent work on jokes.)<p>\n\nWhether we are looking at visual judgments, memory judgments, social judgments about other people, or judgments about ourselves, the general rule seems to be that the sources are manifold and the mechanisms complex.  \"P, therefore I believe that P\" is far too simple to be the whole story; but so also I think is any single-mechanism story, including Peter's.<p>\n\nI guess Peter and I will have a chance to hammer this out a bit more in person during our <a href=\"http://southernsociety.org/\">SSPP</a> session tomorrow!\n\n\n_______________________________________________<p>\n[note 1]: Usually philosophers believe that it's raining.  Failing that, they believe that snow is white.  I just wanted a change, okay?<p>\n\n[note 2]: Is it really \"inference\" if the solidity of the conclusion doesn't require the solidity of the premises?  I don't see why that should be an essential feature of inferences.  But if you instead want to call it (following Byrne) just an \"epistemic rule\" that you follow, that's okay by me.</p>\n<div style=\"clear:

class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>As I've mentioned, MIT Press will be publishing a book of my selected blog posts and op-eds.  I've narrowed it down to a mere (!) 150 posts, in seven broad categories, and I'd love your input in helping me narrow it down more.\n\n<p>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LJ8HJ3C\">moral psychology</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NSY9M3D\">technology</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DPZJ638\">belief, desire, and self-knowledge</a> (live as of today)</li>\n<li>culture and humor</li>\n<li>cosmology, skepticism, and weird minds</li>\n<li>consciousness</li>\n<li>metaphilosophy and sociology of philosophy</li><p>\n\nEvery week I'll post a poll with about twenty posts or op-eds to rate, on one of those seven themes.  No need to rate all of the listed posts!  Just rate any posts or op-eds you remember.  Each poll will also contain links to the original posts and op-eds so you can refresh your memory if you want.<p>\n\nIt would be a great help if you could answer some of these polls -- if only just to click \"a favorite\" next to a few you remember fondly.  I will take this input seriously in selecting what to include in the book.<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DPZJ638\">Today's poll, 11 selected posts on belief, desire, and self-knowledge</a>.<p>\n\nAlthough I've written more on self-knowledge and belief than any other topic, this is my shortest list among the seven categories -- maybe because so much of my work on this is already in longer papers?  Or maybe because my positions on these issues were already well worked out before I started blogging, so I had less of an impulse to toss out new ideas about them?

It doesn't exist.<p>\n\nNow I think there are basically <b>two different things that one could mean in saying \"consciousness doesn't exist\"</b>.<p>\n\n(A.) <b>One is something that seems to be patently absurd and decisively refuted by every moment of lived experience</b>: that there <i>is </i>no such thing as lived experience. If it sounds preposterous to deny that anyone ever has conscious experience, then you're probably understanding the claim correctly.  It is a radically strange claim.  Of course philosophers do sometimes defend radically strange, preposterous-sounding positions.  Among them, this would be a doozy.<p>\n\n(B.) Alternatively, you might think that when a philosopher says that consciousness exists (or \"phenomenal consciousness\" or \"lived, subjective experience\" or whatever) she's usually not just saying the almost undeniably obvious thing.  You might think that she's probably <i>also </i>regarding certain disputable properties as definitionally essential to consciousness.  You might hear her as saying not only that there is lived experience in the almost undeniable sense but also that the target phenomenon is irreducible to the merely physical, or is infallibly knowable through introspection, or is constantly accompanied by a self-representational element, or something like that. <b>Someone who hears the claim that \"consciousness exists\" in this stronger, more commissive sense might then deny that consciousness does exist, if they think that nothing exists that has those disputable properties.</b>  This might be an unintuitive claim, if it's intuitively plausible that consciousness does have those properties.  But it's not a jaw dropper.<p>\n\nAdmittedly, there has been some unclarity in how philosophers define \"consciousness\".  It's not entirely clear on the face of it what Frankish means to deny the existence of in the article linked above.  Is he going for the totally absurd sounding claim, or only the more moderate claim?  (Or maybe something somehow in between or slightly to the side of either of these?)<p>\n\nIn my view, <b>the best and most helpful definitions of \"consciousness\" are the less commissive ones.</b>  The usual approach is to point to some examples of conscious experiences, while also mentioning some synonyms or evocative phrases.  Examples include sensory experiences, dreams, vivid surges of emotion, and sentences spoken silently to oneself.  Near synonyms or evocative phrases include \"subjective quality\", \"stream of experience\", \"that in virtue of which it's <i>like </i>something to be a person\".  While you might quibble about any particular example or phrase, it is in this sense of \"consciousness\" that it seems to be undeniable or absurd to deny that consciousness exists.  It is in this sense that the existence of consciousness is, as <a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/scicon.html\">David Chalmers</a> says, a \"datum\" that philosophers and psychologists need to accept.<p>\n<b>\nStill, we might be dissatisfied with evocative phrases and pointing to examples.</b>  For one thing, such a definition doesn't seem very rigorous, compared to an analytic definition.  For another thing, you can't do very much <i>a priori</i> with such a thin definition, if you want to build an argument from the existence of consciousness to some bold philosophical conclusion (like the incompleteness of physical science or the existence of an immaterial soul).  So philosophers are understandably tempted to add more to the definition -- whatever further claims about consciousness seem plausible to them.  But then, of course, <b>they risk adding too much and losing the undeniability of the claim</b> that consciousness exists.<p>\n\nWhen I read Frankish's article in preprint, I wasn't sure how radical a claim he meant to defend, in denying the existence of phenomenal consciousness.  Was he going for the seemingly absurd claim?  Or only for the possibly-unintuitive-but-much-less-radical claim?<p>\n\nSo I wrote a <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/imp/jcs/2016/00000023/F0020011/art00018\">commentary </a>in which I tried to define \"phenomenal consciousness\" as innocently as possible, simply by appealing to what I hoped would be uncontroversial examples of it, while explicitly disavowing any definitional commitment to immateriality, introspective infallibility, irreducibility, etc. (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DefiningConsciousness.htm\">final MS version</a>).  Did Frankish mean to deny the existence of phenomenal consciousness in <i>that </i>sense?<p>\n\nIn one important respect, I should say, definition by example is necessarily substantive or commissive: <b>Definition by example cannot succeed if the examples are a mere hodgepodge without any important commonalities.</b>  Even if there isn't a single unifying essence among the examples, there must at least be some sort of \"family resemblance\" that ordinary people can latch on to, more or less.<p>\n\nFor instance, the following would fail as an attempted definition: By \"blickets\" I mean things like: this cup on my desk, my right shoe, the Eiffel tower, Mickey Mouse, and other things like those; but not this stapler on my desk, my left shoe, the Taj Mahal, Donald Duck, or other things like those.  What property could the first group possibly possess, that the second group lacks, which ordinary people could latch onto by means of contemplating these examples?  None, presumably (even if a clever philosopher or AI could find some such property).  <b>Defining \"consciousness\" by example requires there to be some shared property or family resemblance among the examples</b>, which is not present in things we normally regard as \"nonconscious\" (early visual processing, memories stored but not presently considered, and growth hormone release).  The putative examples cannot be a mere hodge-podge.<p>\n\nDefinition by example can be silent about what descriptive features all these conscious experiences share, just as a definition by example of \"furniture\" or \"games\" might be silent about what ties those concepts together.  Maybe all conscious experiences are in principle introspectively reportable, or nonphysical, or instantiated by 40 hertz neuronal oscillations.  Grant first that consciousness exists.  Argue about these other things later.<p>\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/imp/jcs/2016/00000023/F0020011/art00020\">his reply</a> to my commentary, <b>Frankish accepts the existence of \"phenomenal consciousness\" as I have defined it</b> -- which is really (I think) more or less how it is already defined and ought to be defined in the recent Anglophone \"phenomenal realist\" tradition.  (The \"phenomenal\" in \"phenomenal consciousness\", I think, serves as a usually unnecessary disambiguator, to prevent interpreting \"consciousness\" as some other less obvious but related thing like explicit self-consciousness or functional accessibility to cognition.)  If so, then Frankish is saying something less radical than it might at first seem when he rejects the existence of \"phenomenal consciousness\".<p>\n<b>So is consciousness an illusion?  No, not if you define \"consciousness\" as you ought to.</b><p>\n\nMaybe my dispute with Frankish is mainly terminological.

One can be disposed <i>to have</i> a certain conscious experience (e.g., disposed to experience a feeling of surprise if one were to see no beer), but dispositions and their manifestations are not metaphysically identical.  Oscar can be disposed to experience surprise if he were to see an empty fridge, even if he never actually sees an empty fridge and so never actually experiences surprise.<p>\n\nFrom these three claims <b>it follows that we cannot introspect attitudes such as belief and desire</b>.<p>\n<b>But it seems we <i>can </i>introspect them! </b> Right now, I'm craving a sip of coffee.  It seems like I am currently experiencing that desire in a directly introspectible way.  Or suppose I'm thinking aloud, in inner speech, \"X would be such a horrible president!\"  It seems like I can introspectively detect that belief, in all its passionate intensity, as it is occurs in my mind right now.<p>\n\nI don't want to deny this, exactly.  Instead, let me define relatively <i>strict </i>versus <i>permissive </i>conceptions of the targets of introspection.<p>\n\nTo warm up, consider a visual analogy: seeing an orange.  There the orange is, on the table.  You see it.  But do you really see the whole orange?  Speaking strictly, it might be better to say that you see the orange rind, or the part of the orange rind that is facing you, rather than the whole orange.  Arguably, you infer or assume that it's not just an empty rind, that it has a backside, that it has a juicy interior -- and usually that's a safe enough assumption.  It's reasonable to just say that you see the orange.  <b>In a relatively permissive sense, you see the whole orange; in a relatively strict sense you see only the facing part of the orange rind.</b><p>\n\nAnother example: From my office window I see the fire burning downtown.  Of course, I only see the smoke.  Even if I were to see the flames, in the strictest sense perhaps the visible light emitted from flames is only a contingent manifestation of the combustion process that truly constitutes a fire.  (Consider <a href=\"http://blog.chembark.com/2010/11/05/methanol-fires-are-invisible/\">invisible methanol fires</a>.)  More permissively, I see the fire when I see the smoke.  More strictly, I need to see the flames or maybe even (impossibly?) the combustion process itself.<p>\n\nNow consider psychological cases: In a relatively permissive sense, you see Sandra's anger.  In a stricter sense, you see her scowling face. <b> In a relatively permissive sense, you hear the shyness and social awkwardness in Shivani's voice.</b>  In a stricter sense you hear only her words and prosody.<p>\n\nTo be clear: I do not mean to imply that a stricter understanding of the targets of perception is more accurate or better than a more permissive understanding.  (Indeed, excessive strictness can collapse into absurdity: \"No, officer, I didn't see the stop sign.  Really, all I saw were patterns of light streaming through my vitreous humour!\")<p>\n<b>As anger can manifest in a scowl and as fire can manifest in smoke and visible flames, so also can attitudes manifest in conscious experience.</b>  The desire for coffee can manifest in a conscious experience that I would describe as an urge to take a sip; my attitude about X's candidacy can manifest in a momentary experience of inner speech.  In such cases, we can say that the attitudes present a <b><i>conscious face</i></b>.  If the conscious experience is distinctive enough to serve as an excellent sign of the real presence of the relevant dispositional structure constituting that attitude, then we can say that the attitude is (occurrently) conscious.<p>\n\nIt is important to my view that the conscious face of an attitude is not tantamount to the attitude itself, even if they normally co-occur.  If you have the conscious experience but not the underlying suite of relevant dispositions, you do not actually have the attitude.  (Let's bracket the question of whether such cases are realistically psychologically possible.)  Similarly, a scowl is not anger, smoke is not a fire, a rind is not an orange.<p>\n<b>Speaking relatively permissively, then, one can introspect an attitude by introspecting its conscious face</b>, much as I can see a whole orange by seeing the facing part of its rind and I can see a fire by seeing its smoke.  I rely upon the fact that the conscious experience wouldn't be there unless the whole dispositional structure were there.  If that reliance is justified and the attitude is really there, distinctively manifesting in that conscious experience, then I have successfully introspected it.  The exact metaphysical relationship between the strictly conceived target and the permissively conceived target is different among the various cases -- part-whole for the orange, cause-effect for the fire, and disposition-manifestation for the attitude -- but the general strategy is the same.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://ourbraggingwrites.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/just-an-orange-rind/\">image source</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/11/introspecting-attitude-by-introspecting.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-11-02T10:45:00-07:00\">10:45 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2407424397990888785\" onclick=\"\">14\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/attitudes\" rel=\"tag\">attitudes</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/belief\" rel=\"tag\">belief</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, June 27, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3139237466837224032\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/susan-schneider-on-how-to-prevent_27.html\">Susan Schneider on How to Prevent a Zombie Dictatorship</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Last week I posted \"<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-to-accidentally-become-zombie-robot.html\">How to Accidentally Become a Zombie Robot</a>\", discussing Susan Schneider's <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Can-A-Robot-Feel-Susan-Schneide#.V2rDcojGso8\">recent TEDx-talk</a> proposal for checking whether silicon chips can be conscious.  Susan has written the following reply, which she invited me to share on the blog.<p>\n\n---------------------------------------------<p>\n\nEric,<p>\n\nGreetings from a caf\u00e9 in Lisbon! Your new, seriously cool <i>I,Brain</i> case raises an important point about my original test in my Ted talk and is right out of a cyberpunk novel.  A few initial points, for readers, before I respond, as Ted talks don\u2019t give much philosophical detail:<p>\n\n1. It may be that the microchips are made of something besides silicon, (right now, e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene are alternate substrates under development). I don\u2019t think this matters \u2013 the issues that arise are the same.<p>\n\n2. It will be important that any chip test involve the <b>very kind of chip substrate and design</b> as that used in the AI in question.<p>\n\n3. Even if a kind of chip works in humans, there is still the issue of whether the AI in question has the right functional organization for consciousness. Since AI could be very different than us, and it is even difficult to figure out these issues in the case of biological creatures like the octopus, this may turn out to be very difficult.<p>\n\n4. For relation of the chip test to intriguing ideas of Ned Block and Dave Chalmers on this issue, see a paper on <a href=\"http://schneiderwebsite.com/Susan_Schneiders_Website/Research.html\">my website</a> (a section in \u201c<a href=\"http://schneiderwebsite.com/Susan_Schneiders_Website/Research_files/How%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind%20can%20Shape%20the%20Future.pdf\">The Future of Philosophy of Mind</a>\u201d, based on an earlier op-ed of mine.)<p>\n\n5. As Eric knows, it is probably a mistake to assume that brain chips will be functional isomorphs. I\u2019m concerned with the development of real, emerging technologies, because I am concerned with finding a solution to the problem of AI consciousness based on an actual test. Brain chips, already under development at DARPA, may eventually be faster and more efficient information processors, enhance human consciousness, or, they may be low fidelity copies of what a given minicolumn does.  This depends upon how medicine progresses...<p>\n \nBack to my original \u201cChip Test\u201d (in the Ted talk). It\u2019s 2045. You are ready to upgrade your aging brain.  You go to <i>I,Brain</i>. They can gradually replace parts of your biological brain with microchips.  You are awake during the surgery, suppose, and they replace a part of your biological brain that is responsible for some aspect of consciousness, with a microchip.  Do you lose consciousness of something (e.g., do you lose part of your visual field)? If so, you will probably notice. This would be a sign that the microchip is the wrong stuff. Science could try and try to engineer a better chip, but if after years of trying, they never could get it right, perhaps we should conclude that that kind of substrate (e.g., silicon) does not give rise to consciousness.<p>\n\nOn the other hand, if the chips work, that kind of substrate is in principle the right stuff (it can, in the right mental environment, give rise to qualia) although there is a further issue of whether a particular AI that has such chips has the right organization to be conscious (e.g., maybe it has nothing like a global workspace, like a Rodney Brooks style robot, or maybe it is superintelligent, and has mastered everything already and eliminated consciousness because it is too slow and inefficient).<p>\n\nEric, your test is different, and I agree that someone should not trust that test. This would involve a systematic deception. What kind of society would do this?  A <b>zombie dictatorship</b>, of course, which seeks to secretly eliminate conscious life from the planet.  :-) <p> \n\nBut I think you want to apply your larger point to the original test. Is the idea: couldn\u2019t a chip be devised that would falsely indicate consciousness to the person? (Let\u2019s call this a \u201csham qualia chip.\u201d ) I think it is, so here\u2019s a reply: God yes, in a dystopian world. We had better watch out! That would be horrible medicine\u2026and luckily, it would involve a good deal of expense and effort, (systematically fooling someone about say, their visual experience, would be a major undertaking), so science would likely first seek a genuine chip substitute that preserved consciousness. (Would a sham qualia chip even clear the FDA :-) ? Maybe only if microchips were not the right stuff and it was the best science could do. After all, people would always be missing lost visual qualia, and it is best that they not suffer like this....). But crucially, since this would involve a deliberate effort on the part of medical researchers, we would know this, and so we would know that the chip is not a true substitute. Unless, that is, we are inhabitants of a <b>zombie dictatorship</b>.<p>\n\nThe upshot: It would involve a lot of extra engineering effort to produce a <b><i>sham qualia chip</i></b>, and we would hopefully know that the sham chip was really a device designed to fool us. If this was done because the genuine chip substitute could not be developed, this would probably indicate that chips aren\u2019t the right stuff, or that science needs to go back to the drawing board.<p>\n\nI propose a global ban on sham qualia chips in interest of preserving democracy.<p>\n\n---------------------------------------------<p>\n\nI (Eric) have some thoughts in response.  I'm not sure it would be harder to make a sham qualia chip than a genuine qualia chip.  Rather than going into detail on that now, I'll let it brew for a future post.  Meanwhile, others' reactions welcomed too!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/susan-schneider-on-how-to-prevent_27.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-06-27T12:38:00-07:00\">12:38 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3139237466837224032\" onclick=\"\">15\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, April 14, 2016</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4215100768191847961\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/paraphenomenal-experience-conscious.html\">Paraphenomenal Experience: Conscious Experience Uncorrelated with Cognition and Behavior </a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7GGnk3ukyM/Vw_tgEda6UI/AAAAAAAABVQ/UB4PUmkVhT4WFXGH3JeHXUSv1K-s31gggCLcB/s1600/reading.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7GGnk3ukyM/Vw_tgEda6UI/AAAAAAAABVQ/UB4PUmkVhT4WFXGH3JeHXUSv1K-s31gggCLcB/s200/reading.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\nMy student Alan T. Moore defends his dissertation today.  (Good thing we <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/XWorld.htm\">proved he exists</a>!)  One striking idea from his dissertation is that much of our consciousness might be, in his terminology, <i>paraphenomenal</i>.  <b>A conscious experience is paraphenomenal to the extent it is uncorrelated with cognitive and behavioral processes</b>.  (That's my own tweaking of his formulation, not quite how Alan phrases it himself.)<p>\n<b><i>Complete</i> paraphenomenality is a possibility so bizarre and skeptical that I'm unaware of any philosopher who has seriously contemplated it.</b>  (It seems likely, though, that <i>someone</i> has, so I welcome references!)  Complete paraphenomenality would mean having a stream of experience that was entirely uncorrelated with any functional, cognitive, or sensory input and entirely uncorrelated with any functional, cognitive, or behavioral output (including introspective self-report).  Imagine laying the stream of William James's conscious experience atop the behavior and cognitive life of Moctezuma II, or atop a stone -- simply no relationship between the non-phenomenal aspects of one's cognitive life and one's outward behavior (or lack of it) and the stream of lived experience.  Or imagine taking the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/\">philosophical zombie</a> scenario and instead of denying the zombies any experience, randomly scramble which body has which set of experiences, while holding all the physical and behavioral stuff constant in each body.<p>\n<i>Paraphenomenal</i> is not the same as <i>epiphenomenal</i>.  Epiphenomenalism about consciousness is the view that conscious experience has no causal influence, the view that consciousness is a causal dead-end.  But most epiphenomenalists believe, indeed emphasize, that conscious experience still <i>correlates</i> with causally efficacious brain processes.  On paraphenomenalism, in contrast, there aren't even correlations.<p>\n\nComplete paraphenomenalism is about as implausible a philosophical view as one is likely to find.  <b>However, <i>partial</i> paraphenomenalism has some plausibility as an interpretation of recent empirical evidence, from Moore and others.</b>  Partial paraphenomenalism is the view that the correlations between conscious experiences and cognitive processes are <b>weaker and more limited</b> than one might otherwise expect -- that, for example, presence or absence of the conscious experience of visual imagery is largely irrelevant to performance on the types of cognitive tasks that are ordinarily thought to be aided by imagery.  If so, this would be one way to explain empirical results suggesting that self-reported visual imagery abilities are largely uncorrelated with performance on \"imagery\" tasks like mental rotation and mental folding.  (See my discussion <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Imagery.htm\">here</a> and in Ch. 3 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262014904/\">my 2011 book</a>.)<p>\n\nEspecially strikingly to me are the vast differences in the experiences that people report in <a href=\"https://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/\">Russell T. Hurlburt</a>'s Descriptive Experience Sampling (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Inner-Experience-descriptive-Consciousness/dp/9027252009\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Describing-Inner-Experience-Philosophical-Psychology/dp/0262083663\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/heavey-hurlburt-2008.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Investigating-Pristine-Inner-Experience-Moments/dp/0521279127\">here</a>).  Hurlburt \"beeps\" people at random moments throughout their day.  When the beep sounds, their task is to recall their last moment of experience immediately before the beep.  Hurlburt then later interviews them about details of the targeted experience.  Some of Hurlburt's participants report conscious sensory experiences in almost all of their samples, while others almost never report sensory experiences.  Some of Hurlburt's participants report inner speech in almost all of their samples, while others almost never report inner speech.  Similarly for emotional feelings, imageless or \"unsymbolized\" thinking, and visual imagery -- some participants report these things in almost every sample, others never or almost never.  Huge, huge differences in the general reported arc of experience!  When functional cognitive capacities vary that much between people, it's immediately obvious (e.g., blind people vs. sighted people). But no such radical differences are evident among most of Hurlburt's participants.  Participants often even surprise themselves.  For example, it's not uncommon for people to initially say, before starting the sampling process, that they experience a stream of constant inner speech, but then report few or no instances of it when actually sampled.<p>\n\nIn his dissertation, <b>Moore finds very large differences in people's reported experiences while reading</b> (some of the preliminary data were reported <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-experience-of-reading-imagery-inner.html\">here</a>), <b>but those reported experiential differences don't seem to predict performance in plausibly related cognitive tasks</b> like recall of visual details from the story (for people reporting high visual imagery), rhyme disambiguation (for people reporting hearing the text in inner speech), or recall of details of the visual layout of the text (for people reporting visually experiencing the words on the page in front of them).<p>\n\nWhen faced with radical differences in experiential report that are largely uncorrelated with the expected outward behavior or cognitive skills, we seem to have three interpretative choices:<p>\n\n1. <b>We could decide that the assumed functional relationship shouldn't have been expected in the first place.</b>  For example, in the imagery literature, some researchers decided that it was a mistake to have expected mental rotation ability to correlate with conscious visual imagery.  Conscious visual imagery plays an important causal functional role in cognition, just not <i>that</i> role.<p>\n\n2. <b>We could challenge the accuracy of the subjective reports.</b>  This has tended to be my approach in the past.  Maybe people who deny having visual sensory experience of the scene before them in Hurlburt's and Moore's data really do have sensory experience but either forget that experience or fail to understand exactly what is being asked.<p>\n\n3. <b>We could adopt partial paraphenomenalism about the experience.</b>  Maybe people really are radically different in their streams of experience while reading, or while going about their daily life, but those differences have little systematic relationship to the remainder of their cognition or behavior (apart from their ability to generate reports).  I wouldn't initially have been much attracted to this idea, but I now think it's an important option to keep explicitly on the table.

Thursday 4-6 I'm commenting on Wayne Wu's \"Introspection as Attention and Action\".  This post is adapted from those comments.<p>\n\n(Also Wed 6 pm I'm presenting my paper \"A Pragmatic Approach to the Metaphysics of Belief\" and Sat 6-9 I'm critic in an author-meets-critics on Jay Garfield's <i>Engaging Buddhism</i>.  Feel free to stop by!)<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------<p>\n\nWhat does <b>introspective attention to one's perceptual experiences amount to?</b>  As I look at my desk, I can attend to or think about my ongoing sensory experiences, reaching judgments about their quality or character.  For example, I'm visually experiencing a brownish, slightly complicated oblong shape in my visual periphery (which I know to be my hat).  I'm having auditory experience of my coffee-maker spitting and bubbling as it brews the pot.  What exactly am I doing, in the process of reaching these judgments?<p>  \n\nOne thing that I'm <i>not </i>doing, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~waynewu/My_Academic_Site/Home.html\">Wayne Wu</a>, is launching a new process, distinct from the perceptual processes of seeing the hat and hearing the coffee-maker, which turns an \"attentional spotlight\" upon those perceptual processes.  <b>Introspective attention</b>, Wu argues -- and I agree -- <b>is a matter of applying phenomenal concepts in the course of ordinary perceiving</b>, with the goal of arriving at a judgment about your perceptual experience -- doing so in a way that isn't radically different from the way in which, according to your goals, you can aim to categorize the things you perceive along any of several different dimensions.<p>\n\nI hope the following is a Wu-friendly way of developing the idea.  Suppose you're looking at a coffee mug.  You can do so with any of a variety of perceptual goals in mind.  You can look at it with the aim of noticing details about its color -- its precise shade and how consistent or variable its color is across its face.  You can look at it with the aim of noticing details of its shape.  You can look at it with the aim of thinking about how it could effectively be used as a weapon.  You can look at it with a critical aesthetic eye.  Each of these aims is a way of attending differently to the mug, resulting in judgments that employ different conceptual categories.<p>\n\nYou can also look at the mug with an introspective aim, or rather with one of several introspective aims.  You can look at the mug with the aim of reaching conclusions about what your<i> visual experience</i> is as you look at the mug rather than with the aim of reaching conclusions about the physical mug itself.  You might be interested in noticing your experience of the mug's color, possibly distinct from mug's real color.  According to Wu, this is not a process radically different from ordinary acts of perception.  Introspection your visual experience of the color or shape of the mug is <b>not a two-stage process that consists of <i>first </i>perceiving the mug and then <i>second </i> of introspecting the experiences that arise in the course of that perceptual act.</b><p>\n\nThe approach Wu and I favor is especially attractive in thinking about what the early introspective psychologists <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_B._Titchener\">E.B. Titchener</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Boring\">E.G. Boring</a> called \"R-error\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1413768\">stimulus error</a>\".  Imagine that you're lying on your stomach and an experimenter is gently poking the bare skin of your back with either one or two toothpicks.  You might have one of two different tasks.  An <i>objective</i> task would be to guess whether you are being poked by only one toothpick or instead by both toothpicks at once.  You answer with either \"one\" or \"two\".  It's easy to tell that you're being poked by two if the toothpicks are several centimeters apart, but once they are brought close enough together, the task becomes difficult.  Two toothpicks placed within a centimeter of each other on your back are likely to feel like only a single toothpick.  The <i>objective</i> task would be to guess how many toothpicks you are being poked with in reality.<p>\n\nAn <i>introspective</i> task might be very similar but with a crucial difference: You are asked to report whether you have <i>tactile experience</i> of two separate regions of pressure or only one region.  Again you might answer \"one\" or \"two\".  This is of course not the same as the objective task.  You're reporting not on facts about the toothpicks but rather on facts about your experience of the toothpicks.  The objective task and the introspective task have different truth conditions.  For example if two toothpicks are pressed to your back only 6 millimeters apart and you say \"one\" you've given the wrong answer if your task is objective but quite possibly the right answer if your task is introspective.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_aa_x4C25wk/Vvq8f5yUg-I/AAAAAAAABT0/DsA8M8EIc-gZLta2my-42iXmo17gq-vOw/s1600/Edwin_G._Boring.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_aa_x4C25wk/Vvq8f5yUg-I/AAAAAAAABT0/DsA8M8EIc-gZLta2my-42iXmo17gq-vOw/s400/Edwin_G._Boring.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n[Edwin G. Boring in 1961]<p>\n\nHere's the thing that Titchener and Boring noticed, which they repeatedly warn against in their discussions of introspective methodology: People very easily slide back and forth between the introspective task and the objective task.  It's not entirely natural to keep them distinct in your mind over the course of a long series of stimuli.  You might be assigned the introspective task, for example, and start saying \"one\", \"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"two\", \"two\", \"two\" -- at first your intentions are clearly introspective, but then by the thirtieth trial you have slipped into the more familiar objective way of responding and you're just guessing how many toothpicks there actually are, rather than reporting introspectively.  If you've slipped from the introspective to the objective mode of reporting, you've committed what Titchener and Boring call <i>stimulus error</i>.<p>\n\nFor Wu's and my view, the crucial point is this: It's very easy to shift unintentionally between the two ways of deploying your perceptual faculties.  In fact I'm inclined to think -- I don't know if Wu would agree with me about this -- that <b>for substantial stretches of the experiment your intentions might be vague enough that there's no determinate fact about the content of your utterances.</b>  Is your \"one\" really a report about your experience or a report about the world outside?  It might be kind of muddy, kind of in-between.  You're just rolling along not very thoughtful of the distinction. <b> What distinguishes the introspective judgment from the perceptual judgment in this case is a kind of minor thing about your background intentions in making your report.</b><p>\n\nIntrospection of perceptual experience is perception with a twist, with an aim slightly different from the usual aim of reporting on the outside world.  That's the idea.  It's not a distinct cognitive process that begins after the perceptual act ends, ontologically distinct from the perceptual act and taking the perceptual act as its target.<p>\n\nWhen you know that your experience might be misleading, the difference can matter to your reporting.  For example, if you know that you're pretty bad at detecting two toothpicks when they're close together and you have reason to think that lots of the trials will have toothpicks close together, and if your focus is on objective reporting, you might say: \"Well, 50-50% -- might be one, might be two for all I know\".  For introspective reporting, in contrast, you might say something like \"Sure feels like one, though I know you might well actually be touching me with two\".<p>\n\nIn visual experience, noticing blurriness is similar.  Take off your glasses or cross your eyes.  You know enough about the world to know that your coffee mug hasn't become objectively vague-edged and blurry.  So you attribute the blurriness to your experience.  This is a matter of seeing the world and reaching judgments about your experience in the process.  You reach an experiential judgment rather than or in addition to an objective judgment just because of certain background facts about your cognition.  Imagine someone so naive and benighted as to think that maybe actual real-world coffee mugs do in fact become vague bordered and blurry edged when she takes off her glasses.  It seems conceivable that we could so bizarrely structure someone's environment that she actually came to adulthood thinking this.  That person might then not know whether to apply blurriness to the outward object or to her experience of the object.  <b>It's a similar perceptual act of looking at the mug, but given different background concepts and assumptions in one case she reaches an introspective attribution while in the other case she reaches an objective attribution.</b><p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Boring\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Related:<p></p></i>\n<li>\"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrospectionWhat.htm\">Introspection, What?</a>\" (2012), in D.

He focuses especially on arguments I developed in my 2011 book <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Perplexities.htm\">Perplexities of Consciousness</a>.<p>\n\nPeels considers arguments for the unreliability of introspection based on: the sometimes large effect of reporting method (e.g., button press vs. verbal report) on the content of introspective judgments; cultural variation in whether dreams are seen as colored; the poor correlation between self-reported visual imagery and performance on cognitive tasks often thought to be facilitated by visual imagery (such as mental rotation or folding tasks); people's ignorance of their capacity for echolocation; and people's ignorance of the lack of detail and precision in the visual field.  In each case, Peels presents the skeptic's argument in a couple of pages and then offers a couple of pages of objections.<p>\n\nFor example, Peels offers three responses to my observation that self-reports of mental imagery tend not to correlate with behavioral performance on seemingly related cognitive tasks.  First, he points out that since people don't have access to other people's imagery, terms like \"vivid\" might be interpreted quite differently between subjects -- and thus people might be accurate in their own idiolect even if not in an outwardly measurable way.  Second, he suggests that the aspects of mental imagery being reported (such as vividness) might not be relevant to the cognitive tasks at hand (like mental rotation), in which case lack of correlation is to be expected.  Third, he notes that some studies (a minority) do report positive correlations.  While in my discussion of this topic, I <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/Perplexities-Ch3-Imagery-091105.pdf\">have given reasons</a> to be leery of psychological findings that fail to replicate -- such as experimenter bias, \"file-drawer\" effects, the existence of confounding or intervening variables, and participants' tendency to confirm perceived research hypotheses -- Peels argues that I have presented insufficient positive evidence that such factors are at work in these cases.<p>\n\nThe imagery case is, I think, illustrative of the debate in two ways: First, <b>a lot hinges on examination of the empirical details</b>, such as the precise nature of the measures.  And second, a<b> lot hinges on judgments of plausibility about which reasonable people might differ</b>.  For example, looking at hundreds of studies of visual imagery self-report and cognitive performance, a literature with lots of null results and non-replications, does one think (as I do), \"That looks pretty bad for the reality of an underlying effect\" or does one think (as Peels seems to), \"There probably is an effect in there somewhere that the null studies aren't effectively getting at\".  This sort of thing is a matter of judgment.  (And no, I don't think the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2007/09/what-does-non-effect-look-like-meta.html\">typical statistical meta-analysis</a> will yield a straightforward answer that we should take at face value.)<p>\n\nOne's sense of plausibility, in such matters, comes close to being something like one's general academic worldview -- about philosophy, about psychology, and about their interaction.  Here, I find the introduction and conclusion of Peels' essay interesting.<p>\n\nIn the introduction, Peels lists four reasons the question of the reliability of introspection is important:\n\n<blockquote><p>(a.) Ordinary \"common sense\" tends to treat introspection as a reliable source of knowledge.  To reject its reliability is to <b>challenge common sense</b>.<p>\n\n(b.) There's a philosophical tradition from Descartes to Chalmers of taking introspection (appropriately restricted) as infallible.  To reject introspection's reliability means <b>abandoning the infallibilist tradition</b>.<p>\n\n(c.)There's a contrary \"scientistic\" tradition that emphasizes science as the only secure source of knowledge and regards introspection as non-scientific.  To reject introspection's reliability <b>plays into the hands of those who want to privilege the epistemic role of science</b>.<p>\n<p> (d.) There's a <b>debate <i>within </i>science about how to treat introspective self-reports</b>.</p></p></p></p></p></blockquote></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html><p>\n\nAs these observations make clear, issues about introspection are inextricable from one's general sense of what philosophers and psychologists should be doing.  I suspect that it is background differences between Peels and me on these sorts of questions that drive our different senses of plausibility in interpreting the empirical details.<p>\n\nI want to resist the infallibilist tradition in philosophy, and the philosophical tradition that emphasizes \"common sense\", and other philosophical and metaphilosophical positions that seek to insulate philosophical reasoning from science.  This is fundamental to my worldview and my vision of the nature of philosophy.  My views on introspection are of a piece with this general worldview -- supporting that worldview, I think, but also supported by it.  Other considerations that support such a worldview are (I argue) the incoherence and cultural variability of \"common sense\" and philosophical fashion, and evolutionary, cultural, and psychological reasons to think that people would likely be much worse reasoners about philosophical issues than they are about mundane, practical affairs.<p>\n\nI would add to Peels' four considerations also a fifth consideration of a somewhat different sort: <b>People usually want to be taken at their word when they say they're not angry, not racist, happy with their life choices.</b>  To express doubt is to deny people a certain sort of authority over the story of what is going on in their own minds.  An introspection-friendly approach tends to cede people that sort of self-authority; <b>an introspective-skeptical approach denies that self-authority</b>.  Again, there are big-picture worldview questions at stake, which both inform one's sense of how to interpret the psychological evidence and are in turn either supported or undercut by some of that same evidence.<p>\n\nAlthough Peels' essay focuses on the empirical details of a few cases, this larger context both informs and motivates all work on the epistemology of introspection.  Are we basically right about ourselves, and is philosophy of mind safe from radical scientific critique?  Or is self-knowledge fragile and the armchair a tempting cozy spot to doze away into ignorance?</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/01/rik-peels-defense-of-reliability-of.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2016-01-28T10:04:00-08:00\">10:04 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7485741126658569272\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/stream%20of%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">stream of experience</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, February 11, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1810883130834154658\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-intrinsic-value-of-self-knowledge.html\">The Intrinsic Value of Self-Knowledge</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>April 2, I'll be a critic at a <a href=\"http://www.apaonline.org/events/event_details.asp?id=322900\">Pacific APA</a> author-meets-critics session on Quassim Cassam's book <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199657575.do\">Self-Knowledge for Humans</a>.  (Come!)  In the last chapter of the book, Cassam argues that self-knowledge is not intrinsically valuable.  It's only, he says, <i>derivatively </i>or <i>instrumentally</i> valuable -- valuable to the extent it helps deliver something <i>else</i>, like happiness.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-FesaV1JMROE/VNu3VTdjHaI/AAAAAAAAAwY/YFKN6LS_oS0/s1600/CassamCover.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-FesaV1JMROE/VNu3VTdjHaI/AAAAAAAAAwY/YFKN6LS_oS0/s320/CassamCover.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nI disagree. <b>Self-knowledge is intrinsically valuable!</b>  It's valuable even if it doesn't advance some other project, valuable even if it doesn't increase our happiness.  Cassam defends his view by objecting to three possible arguments for the intrinsic value of self-knowledge.  I'll spot him those objections.  Here are three other ways to argue for the intrinsic value of self-knowledge.<p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n<i>1. The Argument from Addition and Subtraction.</i><p>\n\nHere's what I want you to do: <b>Imaginatively <i>subtract </i>our self-knowledge from the world</b> while keeping everything else as constant as possible, especially our happiness or subjective sense of well-being.  Now ask yourself: Is something valuable missing?<p>\n\nNow <b>imaginatively <i>add </i>lots of self-knowledge to the world</b> while keeping everything else as constant as possible.  Now ask: Has something valuable been gained?<p>\n\nOkay, I see two big problems with this method of philosophical discovery.  Both problems are real, but they can be <i>partly</i> addressed.<p>\n<i>Problem 1:</i> The subtraction and addition are too vague to imagine.  To do it right, you need to get into details, and the details are going to be tricky.<p>\n<i>Reply 1:</i> Fair enough!  But still: We can give it a try and take our best guess where it's leading.  Suppose I suddenly knew more about why I'm drawn to philosophy.  Wouldn't that be good, independent of further consequences?  Or subtract: I think of myself as a middling extravert.  Suppose I lose this knowledge. Stipulate again: To the extent possible, no practical consequences.  Wouldn't something valuable be lost?<p>\n\nAlternatively, <b>consider an alien culture on the far side of the galaxy</b>.  <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-coolest-of-all-possible-worlds.html\">What would I wish for it?</a>  Would I wish for a culture of happy beings with no self-knowledge?  Or, if I imaginatively added substantial self-knowledge to this culture, would I be imagining a better state of affairs in the universe?  I think the latter.<p>\n<b>Contrast with a case where addition and subtraction leave us cold:</b> seas of iron in the planet's core.  Unless there are effects on the planetary inhabitants, I don't care.  Add or subtract away, whatever.<p>\n<i>Problem 2:</i> What these exercises reveal is only that <i>I</i> regard self-knowledge as something that has intrinsic value.  <b>You might differ.</b>  You might think: happy aliens, no self-knowledge, great!  They're not missing anything important.  <b>You might think that unless some practical purpose is served by knowing your personality, you might as well not know.</b><p>\n<i>Reply 2:</i> This is just the methodological problem that's at the root of all value inquiries.  I can't rationally compel you to share my view, if you start far enough away in value space.  I can just invite you to consider how your own values fit together, suggest that <b>if you think about it, you'll find you already do share these values with me, more or less.</b><p>\n<i>2. The Argument from Nearby Cases.<p></p></i>\n\nSuppose you agree that <i>knowledge in general</i> is intrinsically valuable.  A world of unreflective bliss would lack something important that a world of bliss plus knowledge would possess.  I want my alien world to be a world with inhabitants who know things, not just a bunch of ecstatic oysters.<p>\n\nMight self-knowledge be an exception to the general rule?  Here's one reason to think not: Knowledge of the motivations and values and attitudes of your friends and family, specifically, is intrinsically good.  Set this up with an Argument from Subtraction: <b>Subtracting from the world people's psychological knowledge of people intimate to them would make the world a worse place.</b>  Now do the Nearby Cases step: You yourself are one of those people intimate to you!  <b>It would be weird if psychological knowledge of your friends were valuable but psychological knowledge of yourself were not.</b><p>\n\nUnless you're a <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/#EthHed\">hedonist</a> -- and few people, when they really think about it, are -- you probably thinks that there's some intrinsic value in the rich flourishing of human intellectual and artistic capacities.  It seems natural to suppose that self-knowledge would be an important part of that general flourishing.<p>\n<i>3. The Argument from Identity.<p></p></i>\n\nAnother way to argue that something has intrinsic value is to argue that it is in fact identical to something that we already agree has intrinsic value.<p>\n\nSo what is self-knowledge?  On my dispositional view (see <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KB.htm\">here</a>), to know some psychological fact about yourself is to possess a suite of dispositions or capacities with respect to your own psychology.  An example:<p>\n\nWhat is it to know you're an extravert?  It's in part the capacity to say, truly and sincerely, \"I'm an extravert\".  It's in part the capacity to respond appropriately to party invitations, by accepting them in anticipation of the good time you'll have.  It's in part to be unsurprised to find yourself smiling and laughing in the crowd.  It's in part to be disposed to conclude that someone in the room is an extravert.  Etc.<p>\n\nMy thought is: Those kinds of dispositions or capacities are intrinsically valuable, central to living a rich, meaningful life.  If we subtract them away, we impoverish ourselves.  <b>Human life wouldn't be the same without this kind of self-attunement or structured responsiveness to psychological facts about ourselves</b>, even if we might experience as much pleasure.  And self-knowledge is not just some further thing floating free of those dispositional patterns that could be subtracted without taking them away too.  <b>Self-knowledge isn't some independent representational entity <i>contingently connected</i> to those patterns; it <i>is</i> those patterns.</b><p>\n\nYou might notice that this third argument creates some problems for the straightforward application of the Argument from Addition and Subtraction.  Maybe in trying to imagine subtracting self-knowledge from the world while holding all else constant to the extent possible, you were imagining or trying to imagine holding constant all those dispositions I just mentioned, like the capacity to say yes appropriately to party invitations.  If my view of knowledge is correct, you can't do that.  What this shows is that the Argument from Addition and Subtraction isn't as straightforward as it might at first seem.  It needs careful handling.  But that doesn't mean it's a bad argument.<p>\n<i>Conclusion.</i><p>\n\nI'd go so far as to say this: Self-knowledge, when we have it (which, I agree with Cassam, is less commonly than we tend to think), is one of the most intrinsically valuable things in human life.  <b>The world is a richer place because pieces of it can gaze knowledgeably upon themselves and the others around them.</b></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-intrinsic-value-of-self-knowledge.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-02-11T13:11:00-08:00\">1:11 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1810883130834154658\" onclick=\"\">28\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, September 25, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6397246756227647104\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/09/three-kinds-of-transparency-in-self.html\">Three Kinds of Transparency in Self-Knowledge (Or Maybe 1 3/4 Kinds); and How the World Looks If You're Disagreeable</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Transparency is a fun concept, as applied in the recent philosophical literature on self-knowledge (e.g., <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-knowledge/#2.3\">here</a>; see also these <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/01/two-approaches-to-transparency-about.html\">past</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/10/transparency-of-warped-windows.html\">posts</a>).  I want to extend the transparency metaphor to self-knowledge of personality traits, where philosophers haven't yet taken it (to my knowledge).<p>\n\nFirst, the established versions:<p>\n<b>Transparency 1: Sensory experience.</b>  As <a href=\"http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica\">G.E. Moore</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2214186\">Gilbert Harman</a> have noticed, when you try to attend to your visual experience you (usually? inevitably?) end up attending to external objects instead (or at least <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/SIEIET\">in addition</a>).  Attend to your experience of the computer screen.  In <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4321404\">some sense</a> it seems like your attention slips right through the experience itself, lodging upon the screen.<p>\n<b>Transparency 2: Attitudes.</b>  As <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Varieties-Reference-Clarendon-Paperbacks/dp/0198246862\">Gareth Evans</a> notices, when someone asks you if you think there will be a third world war, you typically answer by thinking about the outside world -- about the likelihood of war -- rather than by turning your attention inward toward your own mental states.  <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/GORARF\">More contentiously</a>, thinking about whether you want ice cream also seems to involve, mostly, thinking about the world -- about the advantages and disadvantages of eating ice cream.<p>\n\nIn both types of case, <b>you learn about <i>yourself </i>by attending to the <i>outside world</i>.</b>  One feature of this metaphor <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/10/transparency-of-warped-windows.html\">that I especially like</a> is that you can <b>learn about distortions in yourself</b> by noticing features of the world that don't align with your general knowledge.  Gazing through a window, if the trees are a weird color, you know the window is tinted; if the trees wiggle around as you shift head position, you know the window is warped.  If the lamplights at night radiate spears, you've learned something about distortions in your vision.  If your paper is The Best Thing Ever Published, you've learned something about your egocentric bias.<p>\n\nThis brings me to:<p>\n<b>Transparency 3: Personality.</b>  Since I think <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">personality traits and attitudes are basically the same thing</a>, I regard Transparency 3 as a natural extension of Transparency 2.  (And since 2 and 1 are also related, maybe we have 1 3/4 kinds of transparency rather than three kinds.)  <b>To find out if you're the kind of person who loves children, think about children.</b>  To find out if you're an extravert, think about parties.  Since your personality colors your view of the world, one way to learn about your personality is to look at a relevant part of the world and notice its color.  (You can also consider your past behavior; or directly try a label on for size; or ask friends for their frank opinion of you.  Transparency-style reflection on the world isn't the only, or even always a very good, route to self-knowledge.)<p>\n\nThis approach might work especially well for the \"<a href=\"http://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/bigfive.html\">Big Five</a>\" personality trait <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness\">Agreeableness</a>.  \"Agreeable\" people are those who self-rate, or are rated by others, as being concerned for other people, interested in them, sympathetic, helpful.  <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1081&amp;context=managementfacpub\">Several</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20175628\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/37/9/1172.abstract\">studies</a> suggest that<b> people who self-rate as agreeable tend also to be more likely to rate others as agreeable (sympathetic, helpful, etc.)</b>, and also to rate other people positively in other ways too, especially if the other person is not very well known.  If you're a sweetheart, the world seems to be full mostly of sweethearts and interesting people; <a href=\"http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/if-youre-surrounded-by-idiots-guess-whos-the-jerk/\">if you're a jerk, the world seems to be full of jerks and fools</a>.  What I'm proposing to call the transparency approach to self-knowledge of personality simply involves running this observation the other direction: From the fact that the world seems full of uninteresting and disagreeable people, infer that you are a disagreeable person; from the fact that the world seems full of warm, loving, interesting people, infer that you are a relatively sympathetic, concerned person.<p>\n<b>Now it would be really interesting if it turned out that these sorts of <i>perceiver effects</i> were actually better predictors of underlying personality as constituted by patterns of real-world behavior than are the typical self-rating scales used in personality psychology</b> -- but it's probably too much to hope that the world would align so neatly with my own theoretical biases.  (Hm, what does that last judgment reveal about my personality?)</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/09/three-kinds-of-transparency-in-self.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2014-09-25T10:26:00-07:00\">10:26 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6397246756227647104\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, April 04, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1271714966741427164\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-negative-pluralist-account-of.html\">A Negative, Pluralist Account of Introspection</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>What is introspection?  Nothing!  Or rather, almost everything.<p>\n<b>A long philosophical tradition</b>, going back at least to Locke, <b>has held that there is a distinctive faculty</b> by means of which we know our own minds -- or at least our currently ongoing stream of conscious experience, our sensory experience, our imagery, our emotional experience and inner speech.  \"Reflection\" or \"inner sense\" or introspection is, in this common view, <b>a single type of process</b>, yielding highly reliable (maybe even infallibly certain) knowledge of our own minds.<p>\n\nCritics of this approach to introspection have tended to either:<p>\n\n(a.) radically deny the existence of the human capacity to discover a stream of inner experience (e.g., radical <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/\">behaviorism</a>);<p>\n\n(b.) attribute our supposedly excellent self-knowledge of experience to some distinctive process <i>other </i>than introspection (e.g., <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/introspection/#Exp\">expressivist</a> or <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/introspection/#Tra\">transparency approaches</a>, on which \"I think that...\" is just a dongle added to a judgment about the outside world, no inward attention or scanning required); or \n\n<p>(c.) be pluralistic in the sense that we have one introspective mechanism to scan our beliefs, another to scan our visual experiences, another to scan our emotional experiences....<p>\n\nBut here's another possibility: Introspective judgments arise from a range of processes that is <b>diverse both <i>within-case</i></b> (i.e., lots of different processes feeding any one judgment) <b>and <i>between-case</i></b> (i.e., very different sets of processes contributing to the judgment on different occasions) and yet also allows that <b>introspective judgments arise <i>partly </i>through a relatively direct sensitivity to the conscious experiences that they are judgments about</b>.<p>\n\nConsider an <b>analogy</b>:  You're at a science conference or a high school science fair, quickly trying to take in a poster.  <b>You have no dedicated faculty of poster-taking-in.</b>  Rather, you deploy a variety of cognitive resources: visually appreciating the charts, listening to the presenter's explanation, simultaneously reading pieces of the poster, charitably bringing general knowledge to bear, asking questions and listening to responses both for overt content and for emotional tone....  It needn't be the same set of resources every time (you needn't even use vision: sometimes you can just listen, if you're in the mood or visually impaired).  <b>Instead, you flexibly, opportunistically use a diverse range of resources</b>, dedicated to the question of <i>what are the main ideas of this poster</i>, in a way that aims to be relatively directly sensitive to the actual content of the poster.<p>\n\nIntrospection, in my view, is like that.  If I want to know what my visual experience is right now, or my emotional experience, or my auditory imagery, I engage not one cognitive process that was selected or developed primarily for the purpose of acquiring self-knowledge; rather I engage a diversity of processes that were primarily selected or developed for other purposes.  I look outward at the world and think about what, given that world, it would make sense for me to be experiencing right now; but also I am attuned to the possibility that I might not be experiencing that, ready to notice clues pointing a different direction.  I change and shape my experience in the very act of thinking about it, often (but not always) in a way that improves the match between my experience and my judgment about it.  I have memories (short- and long-term), associations, things that it seems more natural and less natural to say, views sometimes important to my self-image about what types of experience I tend to have, either in general or under certain conditions, emotional reactions that color or guide my response, spontaneous speech impulses that I can inhibit or disinhibit.  Etc.  <b>And any combination of these processes, and others besides, can swirl together to precipitate a judgment about my ongoing stream of experience.</b><p>\n\nNow the functional set-up of the mind is such that some processes' outputs are contingent upon the outputs of other processes.  <b>Pieces of the mind stay in sync with what is going on in other pieces</b>, keep a running bead on each other, with varying degrees of directness and accuracy.  And so also introspective judgments will be causally linked to a wide variety of other cognitive processes, including normally both relatively short and relatively circuitous links from the processes that give rise to the conscious experiences that the introspective judgments are judgments about.  But <b>these kinds of contingencies imply no distinctive introspective self-scanning faculty; it's just how the mind must work, if it is to be a single coherent mind,</b> and it happens preconsciously in systems no-one thinks of as introspective, e.g., in the early visual system, as well as farther downstream.<p>\n\n[For further exposition of this view, with detailed examples, see my essay <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrospectionWhat.htm\">Introspection, What?</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-negative-pluralist-account-of.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2014-04-04T11:17:00-07:00\">11:17 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1271714966741427164\" onclick=\"\">11\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, February 19, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"420958904542117836\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-case-for-pessimism-about-general.html\">A Case for Pessimism about General Theories of Consciousess</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Recently, I've been arguing (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh6.htm\">here</a>) that we should be skeptical about any general theory of consciousness, whether philosophical or scientific.  Here's one way of putting the case.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-QoGv31ixJH4/UwUSMzNYH3I/AAAAAAAAAj0/Zj6GtWRGAe0/s1600/confusedbrain.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-QoGv31ixJH4/UwUSMzNYH3I/AAAAAAAAAj0/Zj6GtWRGAe0/s1600/confusedbrain.jpg\" width=\"168\"/></a></div>\nWhen we advance a general theory of consciousness, we must do so on some combination of empirical grounds (especially the study of actual conscious systems here on Earth) and armchair reflection (especially thought experiments).<p>\n\nOur empirical grounds are very limited: <b>We have only seen conscious systems as they exist on Earth</b>. To draw, on these grounds, universal conclusions about how any conscious system <i>must </i>be structured would be a reckless leap, <i>if </i>our theories are really supposed to be driven by empirical tests on conscious animals, which could have come out either way. Who knows how those crucial theory-driving experiments would have come out on very differently constructed beings from Andromeda Galaxy?<br/>\n<br/>\nA truly universal theory of consciousness seems more likely to succeed if it draws broadly from a range of hypothetical cases, abstracting away from empirical details of implementation on Earth. So we must sit in our armchairs. However, armchair reflection about the consciousness of hypothetical beings has two huge shortcomings:\n<br/>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Experts in the field reach very different conclusions</b> when asked to reflect on what sorts of hypothetical beings would be conscious (all the way from <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/\">panpsychism</a> to views that require highly sophisticated cognitive abilities).</li>\n<li><b>Our judgments about such cases must be grounded in some sort of prior knowledge</b>, such as our experience of beings here on Earth and our developmentally and socially and evolutionarily favored beliefs.  And there seems little reason to trust such judgments outside the run of normal cases, for example, about the <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">consciousness or not of large group entities</a> under various conditions.</li>\n</ol><p>\nIf you are moved by these concerns, you might think that the appropriate response is to restrict our theory to consciousness as it appears on Earth. But even just thinking about consciousness on Earth drops us into a huge methodological dilemma. If we treat introspective reportability as something close to a necessary condition for consciousness, then we end up with a very sparse view of the distribution of consciousness on Earth. And maybe that's right! <b>But it also seems reasonable to think that consciousness might be possible without introspective reportability, e.g., in dogs and babies. And then it becomes extremely unclear how we determine whether it is present without begging big theoretical questions.</b> How could we possibly determine whether an ant is conscious without begging the question against people with very different views than our own?<p>\n<b>Could we forget about non-human animals and babies and restrict our (increasingly less general) theory of consciousness just to adult humans? Even here, I incline toward pessimism</b>, at least for the medium-term future.<p>\n\nOne reason is this: <b>I see no near-term way to resolve the question of <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh6.htm\">whether consciousness abundantly outruns attention</a></b>. I think I can imagine two very different possibilities here. One possibility is that I have constant tactile experience of my feet in my shoes, constant auditory experience of the hum of the refrigerator, etc., but when I'm not attending to such matters, that experience drops out of memory so quickly and is so lightly processed that it is unreportable. Another possibility is that I usually have no tactile experience whatsoever of my feet in my shoes or auditory experience of the hum of the fridge unless these things capture my attention for some reason. These possibilities seem substantively distinct, and it's easy to see how a proponent of one can create a methodological error theory to explain away the judgments of a proponent of the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow maybe there's a way around these problems. Scientists have often found ingenious ways to embarrass earlier naysayers! But still, there's such a huge spread between the best neuroscientific approaches (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.architalbiol.org/aib/article/view/15056\">Tononi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027700001232\">Dehaene</a>) and such a huge spread between the best philosophical approaches (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Conscious-Mind-Fundamental-Philosophy/dp/0195117891\">Chalmers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661/\">Dennett</a>), that it's hard for me to envision a well-justified consensus emerging in my philosophical lifetime.<p>\n [HT <a href=\"http://rsbakker.wordpress.com/\">Scott Bakker</a>, who has been pushing me on these issues.]</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n<span style=\"background-color: white; font-size: x-small;\">[<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/_x7CuhI1BVXw/TIf3J20M4tI/AAAAAAAAA_U/uUaPJBkoZU0/s400/ist2_3448262-confused-or-brain-tangle.jpg\">image source</a>]</span>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-case-for-pessimism-about-general.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2014-02-19T13:41:00-08:00\">1:41 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=420958904542117836\" onclick=\"\">18\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/skepticism\" rel=\"tag\">skepticism</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/stream%20of%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">stream of experience</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, November 22, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5173566644109605635\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/11/introspecting-my-visual-experience-as.html\">Introspecting My Visual Experience \"as of\" Seeing a Hat?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>In \"The Unreliability of Naive Introspection\" (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Naive.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh7.htm\">here</a>), I argue, contra a philosophical tradition going back at least to Descartes, <b> that we have much better knowledge of middle-sized objects in the world around us than we do of our stream of sensory experience while perceiving those objects</b>.<p>\n\nAs I write near the end of that paper:<blockquote>The tomato is stable.

If outward things were so evasive, they\u2019d also mystify and mislead.</blockquote>\n\nLast Saturday, I defended this view for three hours before commentator <a href=\"http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/carlottapavese.html\">Carlotta Pavese</a> and a number of other New York philosophers (including <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/\">Ned Block</a>, <a href=\"http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/paulboghossian\">Paul Boghossian</a>, <a href=\"http://consc.net/chalmers/\">David Chalmers</a>, <a href=\"http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/paulhorwich.html\">Paul Horwich</a>, <a href=\"http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/christopher-ab-peacocke\">Chris Peacocke</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jimpryor.net/\">Jim Pryor</a>).<p>\n\nOne question -- raised first, I think, by Paul B. then later by Jim -- was this: <b>Don't I know that I'm having a visual experience as of seeing a hat at least as well as I know that there is in fact a real hat in front of me?</b>  I could be wrong about the hat without being wrong about the visual experience as of seeing a hat, but to be wrong about having a visual experience as of seeing a hat, well, maybe it's not impossible but at least it's a weird, unusual case.<p>\n\nI was a bit rustier in answering this question than I would have been in 2009 -- partly, I suspect, because I never articulated in writing my standard response to that concern.  So let me do so now.<p>\n\nFirst, we need to know what kind of mental state this is about which I supposedly have excellent knowledge.  Here's one possibility: To have \"a visual experience as of seeing a hat\" is to have a visual experience of the type that is normally caused by seeing hats.  In other words, when I judge that I'm having this experience, I'm making a causal generalization about the normal origins of experiences of the present type.  But it seems doubtful that I know better what types of visual experiences normally arise in the course of seeing hats than I know that there is a hat in front of me.  In any case, such causal generalizations are not sort of thing defenders of introspection usually have in mind.<p>\n\nHere's another interpretative possibility: In judging that I am having a visual experience as of seeing a hat, I am reporting an inclination to reach a certain judgment.  I am reporting an inclination to judge that there is a hat in front of me, and I am reporting that that inclination is somehow caused by or grounded in my current visual experience.  On this reading of the claim, what I am accurate about is that I have a certain <i>attitude </i>-- an inclination to judge.  But attitudes are not conscious experiences.  Inclinations to judge are one thing; visual experiences another.  I might be very accurate in my judgment that I am inclined to reach a certain judgment about the world (and on such-and-such grounds), but that's not knowledge of my stream of sensory experience.<p>\n\n(In <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KnowOwnBel.htm\">a couple of</a> <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">other essays</a>, I discuss self-knowledge of attitudes.  I argue that our self-knowledge of our judgments is pretty good when the matter is of little importance to our self-conception and when the tendency to verbally espouse the content of the judgment is central to the dispositional syndrome constitutive of reaching that judgment.  Excellent knowledge of such partially self-fulfilling attitudes is quite a different matter from excellent knowledge of the stream of experience.)<p>\n\nSo how about this interpretative possibility?  To say I know that I am having a visual experience as of seeing a hat is to say that I am having a visual experience with such-and-such specific phenomenal features, e.g., this-shade-here, this-shape-here, this-piece-of-representational-content-there, and maybe this-holistic-character.  If we're careful to read such judgments purely as judgments about features of my current stream of visual experience, I see no reason to think we would be highly trustworthy in them.  Such structural features of the stream of experience are exactly the kinds of things about which I've argued we are apt to err: <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2006/05/do-tilted-coins-look-ellip_114850011009693840.html\">what it's like to see a tilted coin at an oblique angle</a>, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2008/01/peripheral-vision-mapping-color-onto.html\">how fast color and shape experience get hazy toward the periphery</a>, how stable or shifty the phenomenology of shape and color is, <a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ssiegel/papers/Precis%20of%20The%20Contents%20of%20Visual%20Experience.pdf\">how richly penetrated visual experience is with cognitive content</a>.  These are topics of confusion and dispute in philosophy and consciousness studies, not matters we introspect with near infallibility.<p>\n<b>Part of the issue here, I think, is that certain mental states have both a phenomenal face and a functional face.</b>  When I judge that I see something or that I'm hungry or that I want something, I am typically reaching a judgment that is in part about my stream of conscious experience and in part about my physiology, dispositions, and causal position in the world. <b> If we think carefully about even medium-sized features of the phenomenological face of such hybrid mental states </b>-- about what, exactly, <i>it's like</i> to experience hunger (how far does it spread in subjective bodily space, how much is it like a twisting or pressure or pain or...?) or about what, exactly, it's like to see a hat (how stable is that experience, how rich with detail, how do I experience the hat's non-canonical perspective...?), <b>we quickly reach the limits of introspective reliability</b>.  My judgments about even medium-sized features of my visual experience are dubious.  But I can easily answer a whole range of questions about comparably medium-sized features of the hat itself (its braiding, where the stitches are, its size and stability and solidity).<p>\n<i>Update, November 25 [revised 5:24 pm]:</i><p>\nPaul Boghossian writes:<blockquote>I haven't had a chance to think carefully about what you say, but I wanted to clarify the point I was making, which wasn't quite what you say on the blog, that it would be a weird, unusual case in which one misdescribes one's own perceptual states.<p>  \n\nI was imagining that one was given the task of carefully describing the surface of a table and giving a very attentive description full of detail of the whorls here and the color there.  One then discovers that all along one has just been a brain in a vat being fed experiences.  At that point, it would be very natural to conclude that one had been merely describing the visual images that one had enjoyed as opposed to any table.  Since one can so easily retreat from saying that one had been describing a table to saying that one had been describing one's mental image of a table, it's hard to see how one could be much better at the former than at the latter.<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~philos/white.html\">Roger White</a> then made the same point without using the brain in a vat scenario.  \n</p></p></blockquote>I do feel some sympathy for the thought that you get <i>something</i> right in such a case -- but <i>what </i>exactly you get right, and how dependably... well, that's the tricky issue!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/11/introspecting-my-visual-experience-as.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-11-22T16:03:00-08:00\">4:03 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5173566644109605635\" onclick=\"\">9\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sense%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">sense experience</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/stream%20of%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">stream of experience</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, August 28, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5426913463279394874\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-experience-of-reading-imagery-inner.html\">The Experience of Reading: Imagery, Inner Speech, and Seeing the Words on the Page</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>(by Alan T. Moore and Eric Schwitzgebel)<p>\n\nWhat do you usually experience when you read?<p>\n\nSome people say that they generally <b>hear the words of the text</b> in their heads, either in their own voice or in the voices of narrator or characters; others say they rarely do this.  Some people say they generally form <b>visual images of the scene or ideas</b> depicted; others say they rarely do this.  Some people say that when they are deeply enough absorbed in reading, <b>they no longer see the page</b>, instead playing the scene like a movie before their eyes; others say that even when fully absorbed they still always visually experience the words on the page.<p>\n\nSome quotes:\n\n<blockquote>Baars (2003): \u201cHuman beings talk to themselves every moment of the waking day.  Most readers of this sentence are doing it just now.\u201d<p>\n\nJaynes (1976): \u201cRight at this moment\u2026 as you read, you are not conscious of the letters or even of the words, or even of the syntax or the sentences, or the punctuation, but only of their meaning.\u201d<p>\n\nTitchener (1909): \u201cI instinctively arrange the facts or arguments in some visual pattern [such as] a suggestion of dull red\u2026 of angles rather than curves\u2026 pretty clearly, the picture of movement along lines, and of neatness or confusion where the moving lines come together.\u201d<p>\n\nWittgenstein (1946-1948): While reading \u201cI have impressions, see pictures in my mind\u2019s eye, etc.  I make the story pass before me like pictures, like a cartoon story.\u201d<p>\n\nBurke (1757): While reading \u201ca very diligent examination of my own mind, and getting others to consider theirs, I do not find that one in twenty times any such picture is formed.\u201d<p>\n\nHurlburt (2007): Some people \u201capparently simply read, comprehending the meaning without images or speech.  Melanie\u2019s general view\u2026 is that she starts a passage in inner speech and then \u201ctakes off\u201d into images.\u201d</p></p></p></p></p></blockquote>\n\nAlan and I can find no systematic studies of the issue.<p>\n\nWe recruited 414 U.S. <a href=\"https://www.mturk.com/mturk/\">mechanical Turk</a> workers to participate in a study on the experience of reading.  First we asked them for their general impressions about their own experiences while reading.  How often -- on a 1-7 scale from \"never\" to \"half of the time\" to \"always\" -- do they experience visual imagery?  Inner speech?  The words on the page?  (We briefly clarified these terms and gave examples.)<p>\n\nThe responses:<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-bKJ8mwJvnd8/Uhu4HIZ-4fI/AAAAAAAAAgc/RhVg7l1u8Y0/s1600/Imagery-130826.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-bKJ8mwJvnd8/Uhu4HIZ-4fI/AAAAAAAAAgc/RhVg7l1u8Y0/s400/Imagery-130826.jpg\"/></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fnt2iOBm8O0/Uhu4HJeiCNI/AAAAAAAAAgk/ALpOyLuUn88/s1600/InnerSpeech-130826.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fnt2iOBm8O0/Uhu4HJeiCNI/AAAAAAAAAgk/ALpOyLuUn88/s400/InnerSpeech-130826.jpg\"/></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUIMjiJQKhU/Uhu4HPc5q1I/AAAAAAAAAgY/--f-b9fz_5A/s1600/WordsOnPage-130826.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-zUIMjiJQKhU/Uhu4HPc5q1I/AAAAAAAAAgY/--f-b9fz_5A/s400/WordsOnPage-130826.jpg\"/></a></div>\n[Note: For words on the page, we asked: \"How often do you NOT experience the words on the page as you read?  Example: your mind is filled with the ideas of the story and not the actual black letters against the white background\".  We have reversed the scale for presentation here.]<p>\n\nNow, if you're anything like me, you'll be <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Naive.htm\">pretty skeptical</a> about the accuracy of these types of self-reports.  So Alan and I did several things to try to test for accuracy.<p>\n\nOur general design was to give each person a passage to read, during which they were interrupted with a beep and asked if they were experiencing imagery, inner speech, or the words on the page.  Afterwards, we asked comprehension questions, including questions about visual or auditory details of the story or about details of the visual presentation of the material (such as font).  Finally, we asked again for participants' general impressions about how regularly they experience imagery, inner speech, and the words on the page when they read.<p>\n\nThe comprehension questions were a mixed bag and difficult to interpret -- too much for this blog post (maybe we'll do a follow-up) -- but the other results are striking enough on their own.<p>\n<b>Among those who reported \"always\" experiencing inner speech while they read, only 78% reported inner speech in their one sampled experience.</b>  Think a bit about what that means.  Despite, presumably, some pressure on participants to conform to their earlier statements about their experience, <i>it took exactly one sampled experience</i> for 22% of those reporting constant inner speech to find an apparent counterexample to their initially expressed opinion.  Suppose we had sampled five times, or twenty?<p>\n\nFor comparison: 9% of those reporting \"always\" experiencing visual imagery denied experiencing visual imagery in their one sampled experience.  And 42% did the same about visually experiencing the words on the page.<p>\n\nParticipants' final reports about their reading experience, too, suggest substantial initial ignorance about their reading experience.  <b>The correlations between participants initial and final generalizations about reading experience were .47 for visual imagery, .58 for inner speech, and .37 for experience of words on the page.</b>  Such medium-sized correlations are quite modest considering that the questions being correlated are verbatim identical questions about participants' reading experience in general, with an interval of about 5-10 minutes between.  One might have thought that if people's general opinions about their experience are well-founded, the experience of reading a single passage should have only a minimal effect on such generalizations.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-experience-of-reading-imagery-inner.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-08-28T08:54:00-07:00\">8:54 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5426913463279394874\" onclick=\"\">11\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/imagery\" rel=\"tag\">imagery</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/inner%20speech\" rel=\"tag\">inner speech</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/stream%20of%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">stream of experience</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/visual%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">visual experience</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, July 09, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4925958831062504780\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-individual-differences-reply-to.html\">The Individual Differences Reply to Introspective Pessimism</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I'm an <i>introspective pessimist:</i> I think people's introspective judgments about their stream of conscious experience are often radically mistaken.  This is the topic of my 2011 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262014904/\">Perplexities of Consciousness</a>.  Over the past few years, I've found the most common objection to my work to be what I'll call the <i>Individual Differences Reply</i>.<p>\n\nMany of my arguments depend on what I call the <i>Argument from Variability</i>: Some people report experiences of Type X, others report experience of Type not-X, but it's not plausible that Group 1 and Group 2 differ enough in their underlying stream of experience to make both claims true.  Therefore, someone must be mistaken about their experience.  So for example: People used to say they dreamed in black and white; now people don't say that; so someone is wrong about their dream experiences.  Some people say that tilted coins in some sense look elliptical as though projected upon a 2D visual screen, while others say that visual experience is robustly 3D with no projective distortions at all.  Some people say that objects seen 20 degrees from the point of fixation look fairly clear and colorful, while others say objects 20 degrees from center look extremely sketchy and indeterminate of color.  Assuming a common underlying experience, disagreement reveals someone to be mistaken.  (Fortunately, we needn't settle which is the mistaken party.)<p>\n\nThe Individual Differences Reply challenges this assumption of underlying commonality.  If people differ in their experience as radically as is suggested by their introspective reports, then no one need be mistaken!  Maybe people did really used to dream in black and white and now they dream in color (<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/06/portrayals-of-dream-coloration-in-mid.html?showComment=1371857364091#c4560608641111518187\">see Ned Block's comment on a recent Splintered Mind post</a>).  Maybe some people really do see tilted coins as elliptical while others do not.<p>\n\nThere are two versions of the Individual Difference Reply, which I will call the <i>Stable Differences</i> and the <i>Temporary Differences</i> versions.  On the Stable Differences version, people <i>durably</i> differ in their experiences in such a way as to render their reports accurate as generalizations about their experiences.  On the Temporary Differences version, people might be similar in their experiences generally, but when faced with the introspective task itself their experience shifts in such a way as to match their reports.  For example, maybe everyone generally has similar experiences 20 degrees into the visual periphery, but when asked to introspect their visual experience, some people experience (and accurately report) clarity while others experience (and accurately report) haziness.<p>\n\nPeople who have pressed versions of the Individual Differences Reply on me include <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-013-9315-1\">Alsmith forthcoming</a>, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0017.2011.01418.x/abstract\">Hohwy 2011</a>, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00439.x/abstract\">Jacovides 2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DescExp.htm\">Hurlburt in Hurlburt &amp; Schwitzgebel 2007</a>.)<p>\n\nHere's how I think the dispute should be resolved: Look, on a case-by-case basis, for measurable brain or behavioral differences that tightly correlate with the differences in introspective report and which are plausibly diagnostic of the underlying variability.  If those correlations are found, accept that the reports reveal real differences.  If not, conclude that at least one party is wrong about their experience.<p>\n\nConsider black and white dreaming.  Theoretically, we could hook up brain imagining machinery to people who report black and white dreams and to people who report color dreams.  If the latter group shows substantially more neural activity in color-associated neural areas while dreaming, the reports are substantiated.  If not, the reports are undermined.  Alternatively, examine color term usage in dream narratives: How often do people use terms like \"red\", \"green\", etc., in dream diaries?  If the rates are different, that supports the existence of difference; if not, that supports the hypothesis of error.  In fact, I looked at exactly this in Chapter 1 of <i>Perplexities</i>, and found rates of color-term usage in dream reports to be the same during the peak period of black-and-white dream reporting (USA circa 1950) and recently (USA circa 2000).<p>\n\nGenerally, I think the evidence often shows a poor relationship between differences in introspective report and differences in plausibly corresponding behavior or physiology.<p>\n\nSometimes there is no systematic evidence, but antecedent plausibility considerations suggest against at least the Stable Differences version of the Individual Differences Reply: It seems highly unlikely that the people who report sharp visual experiences 20 degrees into the periphery differ vastly in general visual capacity or visual physiology from those who report highly indeterminate shape and color 20 degrees into the periphery.  But that's an empirical question, so test it if you like!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-individual-differences-reply-to.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-07-09T15:41:00-07:00\">3:41 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4925958831062504780\" onclick=\"\">13\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, May 15, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7641857450362394449\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-are-you-noticing-when-you-adjust.html\">What Are You Noticing When You Adjust Your Binoculars?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/spenermaja/home\">Maja Spener</a> has<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzcGVuZXJtYWphfGd4OjZlYmZlMDc2MmYxZmM4MzY\"> written an interesting critique</a> of my 2011 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262014904\">Perplexities of Consciousness</a>, for a forthcoming book symposium at <i>Philosophical Studies</i>.  My book is an extended argument that people have very poor knowledge of their own conscious experience, even of what one might have thought would be fairly obvious-seeming features of their currently ongoing experience (such as whether it is sparse or full of abundant detail, whether it is visually doubled, whether they have pervasive auditory experience of the silent surfaces around them).  Maja argues that we have good introspective knowledge in at least one class of cases: cases in which our skillful negotiation with the world depends on what she calls \"introspection-reliant abilities\".<p>\n\nMaja provides examples of two such introspection-reliant abilities: choosing the right amount of food to order at a restaurant (which relies on knowledge of how hungry you feel) and adjusting binoculars (which relies on knowing how blurry the target objects look).<p>\n\nLet's consider, then, Maja's binoculars.  What, exactly, are you noticing when you adjust your binoculars?<p>\n\nConsider other cases of optical reflection and refraction.  I see an oar half-submerged in water.  In some sense, maybe, it \"looks bent\".  Is this a judgment about my visual experience of the oar or instead a judgment about the optical structure of my environment? -- or a bit of both?  How about when I view myself in the bathroom mirror?  Normally during my morning routine, I seem to be reaching judgments primarily about my body and secondarily about the mirror, and hardly at all about my visual experience.  (At least, not unless we accept some kind of introspective foundationalism on which all judgments about the outside world are grounded on prior judgments about experience.)  Or suppose I'm just out of the shower and the mirror is foggy; in this case my primary judgment seems to concern neither my body nor my visual experience but rather the state of the mirror.  Similarly, perhaps, if the mirror is warped -- or if I am looking through a warped window, or a fisheye lens, or using a maladjusted review mirror at night, or looking in a carnival mirror.<p>\n\nIf I can reach such judgments directly without antecedent judgments about my visual experience, perhaps analogously in the binoculars case?  Or is there maybe instead some interaction among phenomenal judgments about experience and optical or objectual judgments, or some indeterminacy about what sort of judgment it really is?  We can create, I'm inclined to think, a garden path between the normal bathroom mirror case (seemingly not an introspective judgment about visual experience) and the blurry binoculars case (seemingly an introspective judgment about visual experience), going either direction, and thus into self-contradiction.  (For related cases feeding related worries see my essay in draft <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KnownIllusion.htm\">The Problem of Known Illusion and the Resemblance of Experience to Reality</a>.)<p>\n\nAnother avenue of resistance to the binoculars case might be this.  Suppose I'm looking at a picture on a rather dodgy computer monitor and it looks too blue, so I blame the monitor and change the settings.  Arguably, I could have done this without introspection: I reach a normal, non-introspective visual judgment that the picture of the baby seal is tinted blue.  But I know that baby seals are white.  So I blame the monitor and adjust.  Or maybe I have a real baby seal in a room with dubious, theatrical lighting.  I reach a normal visual assessment of the seal as tinted blue, so I know the lighting much be off and I ask the lighting techs to adjust.  Similarly perhaps, then, if I gaze at a real baby seal through blurry binoculars: I reach a normal, non-introspective judgment of the baby seal as blurry-edged.  But I know that baby seals have sharp edges.  So I blame the binoculars and adjust.  Need this be introspective at all, need it concern visual experience at all?<p>\n\nIn the same way, maybe, I see spears of light spiking out of streetlamps at night -- an illusion, some imperfection of my eyes or eyewear.  When I know I am being betrayed by optics, am I necessarily introspecting, or might I just be correcting my normal non-introspective visual assessments?<p>\n\nThis is a nest of issues I am struggling with, making less progress than I would like.  Maybe Maja is right, then.  But if so, it will take further work to show.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-are-you-noticing-when-you-adjust.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-05-15T14:17:00-07:00\">2:17 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7641857450362394449\" onclick=\"\">9\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/introspection\" rel=\"tag\">introspection</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/self-knowledge\" rel=\"tag\">self-knowledge</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/stream%20of%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">stream of experience</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/visual%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">visual experience</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, February 25, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6724988083094053511\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/02/an-objection-to-some-accounts-of-self.html\">An Objection to Some Accounts of Self-Knowledge of Attitudes</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>You believe some proposition P.  You believe that Armadillo is the capital of Texas, say.[footnote 1]  Someone asks you what you think the capital of Texas is.  You say, \"In my opinion, the capital of Texas is Armadillo.\"  How do you know that that is what you believe?<p>\n\nHere's one account (e.g., in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mindreading-Integrated-Self-Awareness-Understanding-Cognitive/dp/0198236107\">Nichols and Stich 2003</a>): You have in your mind a dedicated \"Monitoring Mechanism\".  The job of this Monitoring Mechanism is to scan the contents of your Belief Box, finding tokens such as P (\"Armadillo is the capital of Texas\") or Q (\"There's an orangutan in the fridge\"), and producing, in consequence, new beliefs of the form \"I believe P\" or \"I believe Q\".  Similarly, it or a related mechanism can scan your Desire Box, producing new beliefs of the form \"I desire R\" or \"I desire S\".  Call this the <i>Dedicated Mechanism Account.</i><p>\n\nOne alternative account is <a href=\"http://faculty.philosophy.umd.edu/pcarruthers/\">Peter Carruthers</a>'s.  Carruthers <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Opacity-Mind-Integrative-Theory-Self-Knowledge/dp/0199596190/\">argues that there is no such dedicated mechanism</a>.  Instead, we theorize on the basis of sensory evidence and our own imagery.  For example, I hear myself saying -- either aloud or in inner speech (which is a form of imagery) -- \"The capital of Texas is Armadillo\", and I think something like, \"Well, I wouldn't say that unless I thought it was true!\", and so I conclude that I believe that Armadillo is the capital.  This theoretical, interpretative reasoning about myself is usually nonconscious, but in the bowels of my cognitive architecture, that's what I'm doing.  And there's no more direct route to self-knowledge, according to Carruthers.  We have to interpret ourselves given the evidence of our behavior, our environmental context, and our stream of imagery and inner speech.<p>\n\nHere's an argument against both accounts.<p>\n\nFirst, assume that to believe that P is to have a representation with the content P stored in a Belief Box (or memory store), i.e., ready to be accessed for theoretical inference and practical decision making.  (<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">I'm not keen on Belief Boxes myself</a>, but I'll get to that later.)  A typical deployment of P might be as follows: When Bluebeard says to me, \"I'm heading off to the capital of Texas!\", I call up P from my Belief Box and conclude that Bluebeard is heading off to Armadillo.  I might similarly ascribe a belief to Bluebeard on that basis.  Unless I have reason to think Bluebeard ignorant about the capital of Texas or (by my lights) mistaken about it, I can reasonably conclude that Bluebeard <i>believes </i>that he is heading to Armadillo.  All parties agree that I need not introspect to attribute this belief to Bluebeard, nor call upon any specially dedicated self-scanning mechanism (other than whatever allows ordinary memory retrieval), nor interpret my own behavior and imagery.  I can just pull up P to join it with other beliefs, and conclude that Q.  Nothing special here or self-interpretive.  Just ordinary cognition.<p>\n\nNow suppose the conclusion of interest -- the \"Q\" in this case -- is just \"I believe that P\".  What other beliefs does P need to be hooked up with to license this conclusion?  None, it seems!  I can go straightaway, in normal cases, from pulling up P to the conclusion \"I believe that P\".  If that's how it works, no dedicated self-scanning mechanism or self-interpretation is required, but only ordinary belief-retrieval for cognition, contra both Carruthers's view and Dedicated Mechanism Accounts.<p>\n\nThat will have seemed a bit fast, perhaps.  So let's consider some comparison cases.  Suppose Sally is the school registrar.  I assume she has true beliefs about the main events on the academic calendar.  I believe that final exams end on June 8.  If someone asks me when Sally believes final exams will end, I can call up P1 (\"exams end June 8\") and P2 (\"Sally has true beliefs about the main events on the academic calendar\") to conclude Q (\"Sally believes exams end June 8\").  Self-ascription would be like that, but without P2 required.  Or suppose I believe in divine omniscience.  From P1 plus divine omniscience, I can conclude that God believes P1.  Or suppose that I've heard that there's this guy, Eric Schwitzgebel, who believes all the same things I believe about politics.  If P1 concerns politics, I can conclude from P1 and this knowledge about Eric Schwitzgebel that this Eric Schwitzgebel guy believes P1.  Later I might find out that Eric Schwitzgebel is me.<p>\n\nDo I need to self-ascribe the belief that P1 before reaching that conclusion about the Eric Schwitzgebel guy?  I don't see why I must.  I know that moving from \"P1 is true and concerns politics\" to \"that Eric Schwitzgebel guy believes P1\" will get me true conclusions.  I can rely on it.  It might be cognitively efficient for me to develop a habit of thought by which I leap straight from one to the other.<p>\n\nAlternatively: Everyone thinks that I can at least sometimes ascribe myself beliefs as a result of inference.  I subscribe to a general theory, say, on which if P1 and P2 are true of Person S and if P3 and P4 are true in general about the world, then I can conclude that S believes Q.  Now suppose S is me.  And suppose Q is \"I believe P\" and suppose P3 is P.  And then jettison the rest of P1, P2, and P4.  Voila![footnote 2]<p>\n\nIf there is a Desire Box, it might work much the same way.  If I can call up the desire R to join with some other beliefs and desires to form a plan, in just the ordinary cognitive way that desires are called up, so also it seems I should be able to do for the purposes of self-ascription.  It would be odd if we could call up beliefs and desires for all the wide variety of cognitive purposes that we ordinarily call them up for but <i>not</i> for the purposes of self-ascriptive judgment.  What would explain that strange incapacity?<p>\n\nWhat if there isn't a Belief Box, a Desire Box, or a representational storage bin?  The idea remains basically the same: Whatever mechanisms allow me to reach conclusions and act <i>based on</i> my beliefs and desires should also allow me to reach conclusions <i>about</i> my beliefs and desires -- at least once I am cognitively sophisticated enough to have adult-strength concepts of belief and desire.<p>\n\nThis doesn't mean I never go wrong and don't self-interpret at all.  We are inconsistent and unstable in our belief- and desire-involving behavioral patterns; the opinions we tend to act on in some circumstances (e.g., when self-ascription or verbal avowal is our task) might very often differ from those we tend to act on in other circumstances; and it's a convenient shorthand -- too convenient, sometimes -- to assume that what we say, when we're not just singing to ourselves and not intending to lie, reflects our opinions.  Nor does it imply that there aren't also dedicated mechanisms of a certain sort.  My own view of self-knowledge is, in fact, <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KnowOwnBel.htm\">pluralist</a>.  But among the many paths, I think, is the path above.<p>\n\n(Fans of <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~philos/byrne.html\">Alex Byrne</a>'s approach to self-knowledge will notice substantial similarities between the above and <a href=\"http://mit.edu/abyrne/www/introspection.pdf\">his views</a>, to which I owe a considerable debt.)<p>\n<i>Update, February 27<p></p></i>\nPeter Carruthers replies as follows:<blockquote>Eric says: \u201cI can just pull up P to join it with other beliefs, and conclude that Q. Nothing special here or self-interpretive. Just ordinary cognition.\u201d This embodies a false assumption (albeit one that is widely shared among philosophers; and note that essentially the same response to that below can be made to Alex Byrne). This is that there is a central <i>propositional </i>workspace of the mind where beliefs and desires can be activated and interact with one another directly in unconstrained ways to issue in new beliefs or decisions. In fact there is no such amodal workspace. The only central workspace that the mind contains is the working memory system, which has been heavily studied by psychologists for the last half-century. The emerging consensus from this work (especially over the last 15 years or so) is that working memory is <i>sensory based</i>. It depends upon attention directed toward mid-level sensory areas of the brain, resulting in globally broadcast sensory representations in visual or motor imagery, inner speech, and so on. While these representations can have conceptual information bound into them, it is impossible for such information to enter the central workspace alone, not integrated into a sensory-based representation of some sort.<p>\n \nUnless P is an episodic memory, then (which is likely to have a significant sensory component), or unless it is a semantic memory stored, at least in part, in sensory format (e.g. a visual image of a map of Texas), then the only way for P to \u201cjoin with other beliefs, and conclude that Q\u201d is for it to be converted into (say) an episode of inner speech, which will then require interpretation.<p>\n \nThis is not to deny that <i>some </i>systems in the mind can access beliefs and draw inferences without those beliefs needing to be activated in the global workspace (that is, in working memory). In particular, goal states can initiate searches for information to enable the construction of plans in an \u201cautomatic\u201d, unconscious manner. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the mindreading system can do the same. Indeed, a second error made by Eric in his post is a failure to note that the mindreading system bifurcates into two (or more) distinct components: a domain-specific system that attributes mental states to others (and to oneself), and a set of domain-general planning systems that can be used to simulate the reasoning of another in order to generate predictions about that person\u2019s other beliefs or likely behavior. On this Nichols &amp; Stich and I agree, and it provides the former the wherewithal to reply to Eric\u2019s critique also. For the \u201cpulling up of beliefs\u201d to draw inferences about another\u2019s beliefs takes place (unconsciously) in the planning systems, and isn\u2019t directly available to the domain-specific system responsible for attributing beliefs to others or to oneself.</p></p></blockquote>\n\nPeter says: \"Unless P is an episodic memory... or unless it is a semantic memory stored, at least in part, in sensory format (e.g. a visual image of a map of Texas), then the only way for P to \u201cjoin with other beliefs, and conclude that Q\u201d is for it to be converted into (say) an episode of inner speech, which will then require interpretation.\"  I don't accept that theory of how the mind works, but even if I did accept that theory, it seems now like Peter is allowing that if P is a \"semantic memory\" stored in partly \"sensory format\" it <i>can</i> join with other beliefs to drive the conclusion Q without an intermediate self-interpretative episode.  Or am I misunderstanding the import of his sentence?  If I'm not misunderstanding, then hasn't just given me all I need for this step of my argument?  Let's imagine that \"Armadillo is the capital of Texas\" is stored in partly sensory format (as a visual map of Texas with the word \"Armadillo\" and a star).  Now Peter seems to be allowing that it can drive inferences without requiring an intermediate act of self-interpretation.  So then why not allow it to drive also the conclusion that I believe that Armadillo is the capital?  We're back to the main question of this post, right?<p>\n\nPeter continues: \"This is not to deny that <i>some </i>systems in the mind can access beliefs and draw inferences without those beliefs needing to be activated in the global workspace (that is, in working memory). In particular, goal states can initiate searches for information to enable the construction of plans in an \u201cautomatic\u201d, unconscious manner. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the mindreading system can do the same.\"  First, let me note that I agree that the fact that some systems can access stored representations without activating those representations in the global workspace doesn't stricly imply that the mindreading system (if there is a dedicated system, which is part of the issue in dispute) can also do so.  But I do think that if, for a broad range of purposes, we can access these stored beliefs, it would be <i>odd </i> if we couldn't do so for the purpose of reaching conclusions about our own minds.  We'd then need a pretty good theory of why we have this special disability with respect to mindreading.  I don't think Peter really offers us as much as we should want to explain this disability.<p>\n\n... which brings me to my second reaction to this quote.  What Peter seems to be presenting as a secondary feature of the mind -- \"the construction of plans in an 'automatic', unconscious manner\" -- is, in my view, the very heart of mentality.  For example, to create inner speech itself, we need to bring together a huge variety of knowledge and skills about language, about the social environment, and about the topic of discourse.  The motor plan or speech plan constructed in this way cannot mostly be driven by considerations that are pulled explicitly into the narrow theater of the \"global workspace\" (which is widely held to host only a small amount of material at a time, consciously experienced).  Our most sophisticated cognition tends to be what happens <i>before </i>things hit the global workspace, or even entirely independent of it.  If Peter allows, as I think he must, that that pre-workspace cognition can access beliefs like P, what then remains to be shown to complete my argument is just that these highly sophisticated P-accessing processes can drive the judgment or the representation or the conclusion that I believe that P, just as they can drive many other judgments, representations, or conclusions.  Again, I think the burden of proof should be squarely on Peter to show why this wouldn't be possible.<p>\n<i>Update, February 28</i><p>\nPeter responds:<blockquote>Eric writes: \u201cit seems now like Peter is allowing that if P is a \"semantic memory\" stored in partly \"sensory format\" it <i>can </i>join with other beliefs to drive the conclusion Q without an intermediate self-interpretative episode.\u201d<p>\n\nI allow that the <i>content </i>of sensory-based memory can enter working memory, and so can join with other beliefs to drive a conclusion. But that the content in question is the content of a <i>memory </i>rather than a fantasy or supposition requires interpretation. There is nothing about the content of an image as such that identifies it as a memory, and memory images don\u2019t come with tags attached signifying that they are memories. (There is a pretty large body of empirical work supporting this claim, I should say. It isn\u2019t just an implication of the ISA theory.)<p>\n\nEric writes: \u201cBut I do think that if, for a broad range of purposes, we can access these stored beliefs, it would be <i>odd </i>if we couldn't do so for the purpose of reaching conclusions about our own minds. We'd then need a pretty good theory of why we have this special disability with respect to mindreading.\u201d<p>\n\nWell, I and others (especially Nichols &amp; Stich in their mindreading book) had provided that theory. The separation between thought-attribution and behavioral prediction is now widely accepted in the literature, with the latter utilizing the subject\u2019s own planning systems, which can in turn access the subject\u2019s beliefs. There is also an increasing body of work suggesting that on-line, unreflective, forms of mental-state attribution are encapsulated from background beliefs. (I make this point at various places in <i>The Opacity of Mind</i>. But more recently, see Ian Apperly\u2019s book <i>Mindreaders</i>, and my own \u201cMindreading in Infancy\u201d, shortly to appear in <i>Mind &amp; Language</i>.) The claim also makes good theoretical sense seen in evolutionary and functional terms, if the mindreading system evolved to track the mental states of others and generate predictions therefrom. From this perspective one might predict that thought-attribution could access a domain-specific database of acquired information (e.g. \u201cperson files\u201d containing previously acquired information about the mental states of others), without being able to conduct free-wheeling searches of memory more generally.<p>\n\nEric writes: \u201cthese highly sophisticated P-accessing processes can drive the judgment or the representation or the conclusion that I believe that P, just as they can drive many other judgments, representations, or conclusions. Again, I think the burden of proof should be squarely on Peter to show why this wouldn't be possible.\u201d<p>\n\nFirst, I concede that it is possible. I merely claim that it isn\u2019t actual. As for the evidence that supports such a claim, there are multiple strands. The most important is evidence that people confabulate about their beliefs and other mental states in just the sorts of circumstances that the ISA theory predicts that they would. (Big chunks of <i>The Opacity of Mind</i> are devoted to substantiating this claim.) Now, Eric can <i>claim </i>that he, too, can allow for confabulation, since he holds a pluralist account of self-knowledge. But this theory is too underspecified to be capable of <i>explaining </i>the data. Saying \u201csometimes we have direct access to our beliefs and sometimes we self-interpret\u201d issues in no predictions about when we will self-interpret. In contrast, other mixed-method theorists such as Nichols &amp; Stich and Alvin Goldman have attempted to specify when one or another method will be employed. But none of these accounts is consistent with the totality of the evidence. The only theory currently on the market that does explain the data is the ISA theory. And this entails that the only access that we have to our own beliefs is sensory-based and interpretive.\n</p></p></p></p></p></blockquote>\nI agree that people can certainly make \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692093/\">source monitoring</a>\" and related errors in which genuine memories of external events are confused with merely imagined events.  But it sounds to me like Peter is saying that a stored belief, in order to fulfill its function as a memory rather than a fantasy or supposition must be \"interpreted\" -- and, given his earlier remarks, presumably interpreted in a way that requires activation of that content in the \"global workspace\".  (Otherwise, his main argument doesn't seem to go through.)  I feel like I must be missing something.  I don't see how spontaneous, skillful action that draws together many influences -- for example, in conversational wit -- could realistically be construed as working this way.  Lots of pieces of background knowledge flow together in guiding such responsiveness; they can't all be mediated in the \"global workspace\", which is normally thought to have a very limited capacity.  (See also <a href=\"http://thorgan.faculty.arizona.edu/\">Terry Horgan</a>'s recent work on jokes.)<p>\n\nWhether we are looking at visual judgments, memory judgments, social judgments about other people, or judgments about ourselves, the general rule seems to be that the sources are manifold and the mechanisms complex.  \"P, therefore I believe that P\" is far too simple to be the whole story; but so also I think is any single-mechanism story, including Peter's.<p>\n\nI guess Peter and I will have a chance to hammer this out a bit more in person during our <a href=\"http://southernsociety.org/\">SSPP</a> session tomorrow!\n\n\n_______________________________________________<p>\n[note 1]: Usually philosophers believe that it's raining.  Failing that, they believe that snow is white.  I just wanted a change, okay?<p>\n\n[note 2]: Is it really \"inference\" if the solidity of the conclusion doesn't require the solidity of the premises?

No need to rate all of the listed posts!  Just rate any posts or op-eds you remember.

I will take this input seriously in selecting what to include in the book. \n Today's poll, 11 selected posts on belief, desire, and self-knowledge  . \n\nAlthough I've written more on self-knowledge and belief than any other topic, this is my shortest list among the seven categories -- maybe because so much of my work on this is already in longer papers?  Or maybe because my positions on these issues were already well worked out before I started blogging, so I had less of an impulse to toss out new ideas about them?  Hm..... \n   \n\n\n[ image source  ]\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n        \n What a pleasure and an honor to have been invited back to Julia Galef's awesome podcast,  Rationally Speaking  ! \n\nIf you don't know Rationally Speaking, check it out.  The podcast weaves together ideas and guests from psychology, philosophy, economics, and related fields; and Julia has a real knack for the friendly but probing question. \n\nIn this episode, Julia and I discuss the value of truth, daringness, and wonder as motives for studying philosophy; the hazards of interpreting other thinkers too charitably; and our lack of self-knowledge about the stream of conscious experience.  \n  \n    \n    \n\nIn the  current issue of the  Journal of Consciousness Studies   ,  Keith Frankish   argues that  consciousness is an illusion   -- or at least that \"phenomenal consciousness\" is an illusion.  It doesn't exist. \n\nNow I think there are basically  two different things that one could mean in saying \"consciousness doesn't exist\"  . \n\n(A.)  One is something that seems to be patently absurd and decisively refuted by every moment of lived experience  : that there  is   no such thing as lived experience. If it sounds preposterous to deny that anyone ever has conscious experience, then you're probably understanding the claim correctly.  It is a radically strange claim.  Of course philosophers do sometimes defend radically strange, preposterous-sounding positions.  Among them, this would be a doozy. \n\n(B.) Alternatively, you might think that when a philosopher says that consciousness exists (or \"phenomenal consciousness\" or \"lived, subjective experience\" or whatever) she's usually not just saying the almost undeniably obvious thing.  You might think that she's probably  also   regarding certain disputable properties as definitionally essential to consciousness.  You might hear her as saying not only that there is lived experience in the almost undeniable sense but also that the target phenomenon is irreducible to the merely physical, or is infallibly knowable through introspection, or is constantly accompanied by a self-representational element, or something like that.  Someone who hears the claim that \"consciousness exists\" in this stronger, more commissive sense might then deny that consciousness does exist, if they think that nothing exists that has those disputable properties.    This might be an unintuitive claim, if it's intuitively plausible that consciousness does have those properties.  But it's not a jaw dropper. \n\nAdmittedly, there has been some unclarity in how philosophers define \"consciousness\".  It's not entirely clear on the face of it what Frankish means to deny the existence of in the article linked above.  Is he going for the totally absurd sounding claim, or only the more moderate claim?  (Or maybe something somehow in between or slightly to the side of either of these?) \n\nIn my view,  the best and most helpful definitions of \"consciousness\" are the less commissive ones.    The usual approach is to point to some examples of conscious experiences, while also mentioning some synonyms or evocative phrases.  Examples include sensory experiences, dreams, vivid surges of emotion, and sentences spoken silently to oneself.  Near synonyms or evocative phrases include \"subjective quality\", \"stream of experience\", \"that in virtue of which it's  like   something to be a person\".  While you might quibble about any particular example or phrase, it is in this sense of \"consciousness\" that it seems to be undeniable or absurd to deny that consciousness exists.  It is in this sense that the existence of consciousness is, as  David Chalmers   says, a \"datum\" that philosophers and psychologists need to accept. \n \nStill, we might be dissatisfied with evocative phrases and pointing to examples.    For one thing, such a definition doesn't seem very rigorous, compared to an analytic definition.  For another thing, you can't do very much  a priori   with such a thin definition, if you want to build an argument from the existence of consciousness to some bold philosophical conclusion (like the incompleteness of physical science or the existence of an immaterial soul).  So philosophers are understandably tempted to add more to the definition -- whatever further claims about consciousness seem plausible to them.  But then, of course,  they risk adding too much and losing the undeniability of the claim   that consciousness exists. \n\nWhen I read Frankish's article in preprint, I wasn't sure how radical a claim he meant to defend, in denying the existence of phenomenal consciousness.  Was he going for the seemingly absurd claim?  Or only for the possibly-unintuitive-but-much-less-radical claim? \n\nSo I wrote a  commentary   in which I tried to define \"phenomenal consciousness\" as innocently as possible, simply by appealing to what I hoped would be uncontroversial examples of it, while explicitly disavowing any definitional commitment to immateriality, introspective infallibility, irreducibility, etc. ( final MS version  ).  Did Frankish mean to deny the existence of phenomenal consciousness in  that   sense? \n\nIn one important respect, I should say, definition by example is necessarily substantive or commissive:  Definition by example cannot succeed if the examples are a mere hodgepodge without any important commonalities.    Even if there isn't a single unifying essence among the examples, there must at least be some sort of \"family resemblance\" that ordinary people can latch on to, more or less. \n\nFor instance, the following would fail as an attempted definition: By \"blickets\" I mean things like: this cup on my desk, my right shoe, the Eiffel tower, Mickey Mouse, and other things like those; but not this stapler on my desk, my left shoe, the Taj Mahal, Donald Duck, or other things like those.  What property could the first group possibly possess, that the second group lacks, which ordinary people could latch onto by means of contemplating these examples?  None, presumably (even if a clever philosopher or AI could find some such property).   Defining \"consciousness\" by example requires there to be some shared property or family resemblance among the examples  , which is not present in things we normally regard as \"nonconscious\" (early visual processing, memories stored but not presently considered, and growth hormone release).  The putative examples cannot be a mere hodge-podge. \n\nDefinition by example can be silent about what descriptive features all these conscious experiences share, just as a definition by example of \"furniture\" or \"games\" might be silent about what ties those concepts together.  Maybe all conscious experiences are in principle introspectively reportable, or nonphysical, or instantiated by 40 hertz neuronal oscillations.  Grant first that consciousness exists.  Argue about these other things later. \n\nIn  his reply   to my commentary,  Frankish accepts the existence of \"phenomenal consciousness\" as I have defined it   -- which is really (I think) more or less how it is already defined and ought to be defined in the recent Anglophone \"phenomenal realist\" tradition.  (The \"phenomenal\" in \"phenomenal consciousness\", I think, serves as a usually unnecessary disambiguator, to prevent interpreting \"consciousness\" as some other less obvious but related thing like explicit self-consciousness or functional accessibility to cognition.)  If so, then Frankish is saying something less radical than it might at first seem when he rejects the existence of \"phenomenal consciousness\". \n So is consciousness an illusion?  No, not if you define \"consciousness\" as you ought to.  \n\nMaybe my dispute with Frankish is mainly terminological.  But it's a pretty important piece of terminology! \n\n[ image source  ,  Pinna et al 2002  ,  The Pinna Illusion  ]  \n  \n                  \n    \n\nIn some of my published work, I have argued that: \n\n(1.)  Attitudes, such as belief and desire, are best understood as clusters of dispositions.    For example, to believe that there is beer in the fridge is nothing more or less than to be disposed (all else being equal or normal) to go to the fridge if one wants a beer, to feel surprised if one were to open the fridge and find no beer, to conclude that the fridge isn't empty if that question becomes relevant, etc, etc.  (See my essays  here   and  here  .) \n\nAnd \n\n(2.)  Only conscious experiences are introspectible.    I characterize introspection as \"the dedication of central cognitive resources, or attention, to the task of arriving at a judgment about one's current, or very recently past, conscious experience, using or attempting to use some capacities that are unique to the first-person case... with the aim or intention that one's judgment reflect some relatively direct sensitivity to the target state\" ( 2012, p. 42-43  ). \n\nNow it also seems correct that (3.)  dispositions, or clusters of dispositions, are not the same as conscious experiences  .  One can be disposed  to have   a certain conscious experience (e.g., disposed to experience a feeling of surprise if one were to see no beer), but dispositions and their manifestations are not metaphysically identical.  Oscar can be disposed to experience surprise if he were to see an empty fridge, even if he never actually sees an empty fridge and so never actually experiences surprise. \n\nFrom these three claims  it follows that we cannot introspect attitudes such as belief and desire  . \n But it seems we  can   introspect them!    Right now, I'm craving a sip of coffee.  It seems like I am currently experiencing that desire in a directly introspectible way.  Or suppose I'm thinking aloud, in inner speech, \"X would be such a horrible president!\"  It seems like I can introspectively detect that belief, in all its passionate intensity, as it is occurs in my mind right now. \n\nI don't want to deny this, exactly.  Instead, let me define relatively  strict   versus  permissive   conceptions of the targets of introspection. \n\nTo warm up, consider a visual analogy: seeing an orange.  There the orange is, on the table.  You see it.  But do you really see the whole orange?  Speaking strictly, it might be better to say that you see the orange rind, or the part of the orange rind that is facing you, rather than the whole orange.  Arguably, you infer or assume that it's not just an empty rind, that it has a backside, that it has a juicy interior -- and usually that's a safe enough assumption.  It's reasonable to just say that you see the orange.   In a relatively permissive sense, you see the whole orange; in a relatively strict sense you see only the facing part of the orange rind.  \n\nAnother example: From my office window I see the fire burning downtown.  Of course, I only see the smoke.  Even if I were to see the flames, in the strictest sense perhaps the visible light emitted from flames is only a contingent manifestation of the combustion process that truly constitutes a fire.  (Consider  invisible methanol fires  .)  More permissively, I see the fire when I see the smoke.  More strictly, I need to see the flames or maybe even (impossibly?) the combustion process itself. \n\nNow consider psychological cases: In a relatively permissive sense, you see Sandra's anger.  In a stricter sense, you see her scowling face.   In a relatively permissive sense, you hear the shyness and social awkwardness in Shivani's voice.    In a stricter sense you hear only her words and prosody. \n\nTo be clear: I do not mean to imply that a stricter understanding of the targets of perception is more accurate or better than a more permissive understanding.  (Indeed, excessive strictness can collapse into absurdity: \"No, officer, I didn't see the stop sign.  Really, all I saw were patterns of light streaming through my vitreous humour!\") \n As anger can manifest in a scowl and as fire can manifest in smoke and visible flames, so also can attitudes manifest in conscious experience.    The desire for coffee can manifest in a conscious experience that I would describe as an urge to take a sip; my attitude about X's candidacy can manifest in a momentary experience of inner speech.  In such cases, we can say that the attitudes present a  conscious face   .  If the conscious experience is distinctive enough to serve as an excellent sign of the real presence of the relevant dispositional structure constituting that attitude, then we can say that the attitude is (occurrently) conscious. \n\nIt is important to my view that the conscious face of an attitude is not tantamount to the attitude itself, even if they normally co-occur.  If you have the conscious experience but not the underlying suite of relevant dispositions, you do not actually have the attitude.  (Let's bracket the question of whether such cases are realistically psychologically possible.)  Similarly, a scowl is not anger, smoke is not a fire, a rind is not an orange. \n Speaking relatively permissively, then, one can introspect an attitude by introspecting its conscious face  , much as I can see a whole orange by seeing the facing part of its rind and I can see a fire by seeing its smoke.  I rely upon the fact that the conscious experience wouldn't be there unless the whole dispositional structure were there.  If that reliance is justified and the attitude is really there, distinctively manifesting in that conscious experience, then I have successfully introspected it.  The exact metaphysical relationship between the strictly conceived target and the permissively conceived target is different among the various cases -- part-whole for the orange, cause-effect for the fire, and disposition-manifestation for the attitude -- but the general strategy is the same. \n\n[ image source  ]\n  \n  \n                  \n Last week I posted \" How to Accidentally Become a Zombie Robot  \", discussing Susan Schneider's  recent TEDx-talk   proposal for checking whether silicon chips can be conscious.  Susan has written the following reply, which she invited me to share on the blog. \n\n--------------------------------------------- \n\nEric, \n\nGreetings from a caf\u00e9 in Lisbon! Your new, seriously cool  I,Brain   case raises an important point about my original test in my Ted talk and is right out of a cyberpunk novel.  A few initial points, for readers, before I respond, as Ted talks don\u2019t give much philosophical detail: \n\n1. It may be that the microchips are made of something besides silicon, (right now, e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene are alternate substrates under development). I don\u2019t think this matters \u2013 the issues that arise are the same. \n\n2. It will be important that any chip test involve the  very kind of chip substrate and design   as that used in the AI in question. \n\n3. Even if a kind of chip works in humans, there is still the issue of whether the AI in question has the right functional organization for consciousness. Since AI could be very different than us, and it is even difficult to figure out these issues in the case of biological creatures like the octopus, this may turn out to be very difficult. \n\n4. For relation of the chip test to intriguing ideas of Ned Block and Dave Chalmers on this issue, see a paper on  my website   (a section in \u201c The Future of Philosophy of Mind  \u201d, based on an earlier op-ed of mine.) \n\n5. As Eric knows, it is probably a mistake to assume that brain chips will be functional isomorphs. I\u2019m concerned with the development of real, emerging technologies, because I am concerned with finding a solution to the problem of AI consciousness based on an actual test. Brain chips, already under development at DARPA, may eventually be faster and more efficient information processors, enhance human consciousness, or, they may be low fidelity copies of what a given minicolumn does.  This depends upon how medicine progresses... \n \nBack to my original \u201cChip Test\u201d (in the Ted talk). It\u2019s 2045. You are ready to upgrade your aging brain.  You go to  I,Brain  . They can gradually replace parts of your biological brain with microchips.  You are awake during the surgery, suppose, and they replace a part of your biological brain that is responsible for some aspect of consciousness, with a microchip.  Do you lose consciousness of something (e.g., do you lose part of your visual field)? If so, you will probably notice. This would be a sign that the microchip is the wrong stuff. Science could try and try to engineer a better chip, but if after years of trying, they never could get it right, perhaps we should conclude that that kind of substrate (e.g., silicon) does not give rise to consciousness. \n\nOn the other hand, if the chips work, that kind of substrate is in principle the right stuff (it can, in the right mental environment, give rise to qualia) although there is a further issue of whether a particular AI that has such chips has the right organization to be conscious (e.g., maybe it has nothing like a global workspace, like a Rodney Brooks style robot, or maybe it is superintelligent, and has mastered everything already and eliminated consciousness because it is too slow and inefficient). \n\nEric, your test is different, and I agree that someone should not trust that test. This would involve a systematic deception. What kind of society would do this?  A  zombie dictatorship  , of course, which seeks to secretly eliminate conscious life from the planet.  :-)   \n\nBut I think you want to apply your larger point to the original test. Is the idea: couldn\u2019t a chip be devised that would falsely indicate consciousness to the person? (Let\u2019s call this a \u201csham qualia chip.\u201d ) I think it is, so here\u2019s a reply: God yes, in a dystopian world. We had better watch out! That would be horrible medicine\u2026and luckily, it would involve a good deal of expense and effort, (systematically fooling someone about say, their visual experience, would be a major undertaking), so science would likely first seek a genuine chip substitute that preserved consciousness. (Would a sham qualia chip even clear the FDA :-) ? Maybe only if microchips were not the right stuff and it was the best science could do. After all, people would always be missing lost visual qualia, and it is best that they not suffer like this....). But crucially, since this would involve a deliberate effort on the part of medical researchers, we would know this, and so we would know that the chip is not a true substitute. Unless, that is, we are inhabitants of a  zombie dictatorship  . \n\nThe upshot: It would involve a lot of extra engineering effort to produce a  sham qualia chip   , and we would hopefully know that the sham chip was really a device designed to fool us. If this was done because the genuine chip substitute could not be developed, this would probably indicate that chips aren\u2019t the right stuff, or that science needs to go back to the drawing board. \n\nI propose a global ban on sham qualia chips in interest of preserving democracy. \n\n--------------------------------------------- \n\nI (Eric) have some thoughts in response.  I'm not sure it would be harder to make a sham qualia chip than a genuine qualia chip.  Rather than going into detail on that now, I'll let it brew for a future post.  Meanwhile, others' reactions welcomed too!  \n  \n                  \n    \nMy student Alan T. Moore defends his dissertation today.  (Good thing we  proved he exists  !)  One striking idea from his dissertation is that much of our consciousness might be, in his terminology,  paraphenomenal  .   A conscious experience is paraphenomenal to the extent it is uncorrelated with cognitive and behavioral processes  .  (That's my own tweaking of his formulation, not quite how Alan phrases it himself.) \n Complete   paraphenomenality is a possibility so bizarre and skeptical that I'm unaware of any philosopher who has seriously contemplated it.    (It seems likely, though, that  someone   has, so I welcome references!)  Complete paraphenomenality would mean having a stream of experience that was entirely uncorrelated with any functional, cognitive, or sensory input and entirely uncorrelated with any functional, cognitive, or behavioral output (including introspective self-report).  Imagine laying the stream of William James's conscious experience atop the behavior and cognitive life of Moctezuma II, or atop a stone -- simply no relationship between the non-phenomenal aspects of one's cognitive life and one's outward behavior (or lack of it) and the stream of lived experience.  Or imagine taking the  philosophical zombie   scenario and instead of denying the zombies any experience, randomly scramble which body has which set of experiences, while holding all the physical and behavioral stuff constant in each body. \n Paraphenomenal   is not the same as  epiphenomenal  .  Epiphenomenalism about consciousness is the view that conscious experience has no causal influence, the view that consciousness is a causal dead-end.  But most epiphenomenalists believe, indeed emphasize, that conscious experience still  correlates   with causally efficacious brain processes.  On paraphenomenalism, in contrast, there aren't even correlations. \n\nComplete paraphenomenalism is about as implausible a philosophical view as one is likely to find.   However,  partial   paraphenomenalism has some plausibility as an interpretation of recent empirical evidence, from Moore and others.    Partial paraphenomenalism is the view that the correlations between conscious experiences and cognitive processes are  weaker and more limited   than one might otherwise expect -- that, for example, presence or absence of the conscious experience of visual imagery is largely irrelevant to performance on the types of cognitive tasks that are ordinarily thought to be aided by imagery.  If so, this would be one way to explain empirical results suggesting that self-reported visual imagery abilities are largely uncorrelated with performance on \"imagery\" tasks like mental rotation and mental folding.  (See my discussion  here   and in Ch. 3 of  my 2011 book  .) \n\nEspecially strikingly to me are the vast differences in the experiences that people report in  Russell T. Hurlburt  's Descriptive Experience Sampling (e.g.,  here  ,  here  ,  here  ,  here  ).  Hurlburt \"beeps\" people at random moments throughout their day.  When the beep sounds, their task is to recall their last moment of experience immediately before the beep.  Hurlburt then later interviews them about details of the targeted experience.  Some of Hurlburt's participants report conscious sensory experiences in almost all of their samples, while others almost never report sensory experiences.  Some of Hurlburt's participants report inner speech in almost all of their samples, while others almost never report inner speech.  Similarly for emotional feelings, imageless or \"unsymbolized\" thinking, and visual imagery -- some participants report these things in almost every sample, others never or almost never.  Huge, huge differences in the general reported arc of experience!  When functional cognitive capacities vary that much between people, it's immediately obvious (e.g., blind people vs. sighted people). But no such radical differences are evident among most of Hurlburt's participants.  Participants often even surprise themselves.  For example, it's not uncommon for people to initially say, before starting the sampling process, that they experience a stream of constant inner speech, but then report few or no instances of it when actually sampled. \n\nIn his dissertation,  Moore finds very large differences in people's reported experiences while reading   (some of the preliminary data were reported  here  ),  but those reported experiential differences don't seem to predict performance in plausibly related cognitive tasks   like recall of visual details from the story (for people reporting high visual imagery), rhyme disambiguation (for people reporting hearing the text in inner speech), or recall of details of the visual layout of the text (for people reporting visually experiencing the words on the page in front of them). \n\nWhen faced with radical differences in experiential report that are largely uncorrelated with the expected outward behavior or cognitive skills, we seem to have three interpretative choices: \n\n1.  We could decide that the assumed functional relationship shouldn't have been expected in the first place.    For example, in the imagery literature, some researchers decided that it was a mistake to have expected mental rotation ability to correlate with conscious visual imagery.  Conscious visual imagery plays an important causal functional role in cognition, just not  that   role. \n\n2.  We could challenge the accuracy of the subjective reports.    This has tended to be my approach in the past.  Maybe people who deny having visual sensory experience of the scene before them in Hurlburt's and Moore's data really do have sensory experience but either forget that experience or fail to understand exactly what is being asked. \n\n3.  We could adopt partial paraphenomenalism about the experience.    Maybe people really are radically different in their streams of experience while reading, or while going about their daily life, but those differences have little systematic relationship to the remainder of their cognition or behavior (apart from their ability to generate reports).  I wouldn't initially have been much attracted to this idea, but I now think it's an important option to keep explicitly on the table.  Alan Moore's dissertation builds an interesting case! \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n             \n Tomorrow I'm off to the  Pacific APA   in San Francisco. Thursday 4-6 I'm commenting on Wayne Wu's \"Introspection as Attention and Action\".  This post is adapted from those comments. \n\n(Also Wed 6 pm I'm presenting my paper \"A Pragmatic Approach to the Metaphysics of Belief\" and Sat 6-9 I'm critic in an author-meets-critics on Jay Garfield's  Engaging Buddhism  .  Feel free to stop by!) \n\n------------------------------------------- \n\nWhat does  introspective attention to one's perceptual experiences amount to?    As I look at my desk, I can attend to or think about my ongoing sensory experiences, reaching judgments about their quality or character.  For example, I'm visually experiencing a brownish, slightly complicated oblong shape in my visual periphery (which I know to be my hat).  I'm having auditory experience of my coffee-maker spitting and bubbling as it brews the pot.  What exactly am I doing, in the process of reaching these judgments?   \n\nOne thing that I'm  not   doing, according to  Wayne Wu  , is launching a new process, distinct from the perceptual processes of seeing the hat and hearing the coffee-maker, which turns an \"attentional spotlight\" upon those perceptual processes.   Introspective attention  , Wu argues -- and I agree --  is a matter of applying phenomenal concepts in the course of ordinary perceiving  , with the goal of arriving at a judgment about your perceptual experience -- doing so in a way that isn't radically different from the way in which, according to your goals, you can aim to categorize the things you perceive along any of several different dimensions. \n\nI hope the following is a Wu-friendly way of developing the idea.  Suppose you're looking at a coffee mug.  You can do so with any of a variety of perceptual goals in mind.  You can look at it with the aim of noticing details about its color -- its precise shade and how consistent or variable its color is across its face.  You can look at it with the aim of noticing details of its shape.  You can look at it with the aim of thinking about how it could effectively be used as a weapon.  You can look at it with a critical aesthetic eye.  Each of these aims is a way of attending differently to the mug, resulting in judgments that employ different conceptual categories. \n\nYou can also look at the mug with an introspective aim, or rather with one of several introspective aims.  You can look at the mug with the aim of reaching conclusions about what your  visual experience   is as you look at the mug rather than with the aim of reaching conclusions about the physical mug itself.  You might be interested in noticing your experience of the mug's color, possibly distinct from mug's real color.  According to Wu, this is not a process radically different from ordinary acts of perception.  Introspection your visual experience of the color or shape of the mug is  not a two-stage process that consists of  first   perceiving the mug and then  second    of introspecting the experiences that arise in the course of that perceptual act.  \n\nThe approach Wu and I favor is especially attractive in thinking about what the early introspective psychologists  E.B. Titchener   and  E.G. Boring   called \"R-error\" or \" stimulus error  \".  Imagine that you're lying on your stomach and an experimenter is gently poking the bare skin of your back with either one or two toothpicks.  You might have one of two different tasks.  An  objective   task would be to guess whether you are being poked by only one toothpick or instead by both toothpicks at once.  You answer with either \"one\" or \"two\".  It's easy to tell that you're being poked by two if the toothpicks are several centimeters apart, but once they are brought close enough together, the task becomes difficult.  Two toothpicks placed within a centimeter of each other on your back are likely to feel like only a single toothpick.  The  objective   task would be to guess how many toothpicks you are being poked with in reality. \n\nAn  introspective   task might be very similar but with a crucial difference: You are asked to report whether you have  tactile experience   of two separate regions of pressure or only one region.  Again you might answer \"one\" or \"two\".  This is of course not the same as the objective task.  You're reporting not on facts about the toothpicks but rather on facts about your experience of the toothpicks.  The objective task and the introspective task have different truth conditions.  For example if two toothpicks are pressed to your back only 6 millimeters apart and you say \"one\" you've given the wrong answer if your task is objective but quite possibly the right answer if your task is introspective. \n    \n[Edwin G. Boring in 1961] \n\nHere's the thing that Titchener and Boring noticed, which they repeatedly warn against in their discussions of introspective methodology: People very easily slide back and forth between the introspective task and the objective task.  It's not entirely natural to keep them distinct in your mind over the course of a long series of stimuli.  You might be assigned the introspective task, for example, and start saying \"one\", \"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"two\", \"two\", \"two\" -- at first your intentions are clearly introspective, but then by the thirtieth trial you have slipped into the more familiar objective way of responding and you're just guessing how many toothpicks there actually are, rather than reporting introspectively.  If you've slipped from the introspective to the objective mode of reporting, you've committed what Titchener and Boring call  stimulus error  . \n\nFor Wu's and my view, the crucial point is this: It's very easy to shift unintentionally between the two ways of deploying your perceptual faculties.  In fact I'm inclined to think -- I don't know if Wu would agree with me about this -- that  for substantial stretches of the experiment your intentions might be vague enough that there's no determinate fact about the content of your utterances.    Is your \"one\" really a report about your experience or a report about the world outside?  It might be kind of muddy, kind of in-between.  You're just rolling along not very thoughtful of the distinction.   What distinguishes the introspective judgment from the perceptual judgment in this case is a kind of minor thing about your background intentions in making your report.  \n\nIntrospection of perceptual experience is perception with a twist, with an aim slightly different from the usual aim of reporting on the outside world.  That's the idea.  It's not a distinct cognitive process that begins after the perceptual act ends, ontologically distinct from the perceptual act and taking the perceptual act as its target. \n\nWhen you know that your experience might be misleading, the difference can matter to your reporting.  For example, if you know that you're pretty bad at detecting two toothpicks when they're close together and you have reason to think that lots of the trials will have toothpicks close together, and if your focus is on objective reporting, you might say: \"Well, 50-50% -- might be one, might be two for all I know\".  For introspective reporting, in contrast, you might say something like \"Sure feels like one, though I know you might well actually be touching me with two\". \n\nIn visual experience, noticing blurriness is similar.  Take off your glasses or cross your eyes.  You know enough about the world to know that your coffee mug hasn't become objectively vague-edged and blurry.  So you attribute the blurriness to your experience.  This is a matter of seeing the world and reaching judgments about your experience in the process.  You reach an experiential judgment rather than or in addition to an objective judgment just because of certain background facts about your cognition.  Imagine someone so naive and benighted as to think that maybe actual real-world coffee mugs do in fact become vague bordered and blurry edged when she takes off her glasses.  It seems conceivable that we could so bizarrely structure someone's environment that she actually came to adulthood thinking this.  That person might then not know whether to apply blurriness to the outward object or to her experience of the object.   It's a similar perceptual act of looking at the mug, but given different background concepts and assumptions in one case she reaches an introspective attribution while in the other case she reaches an objective attribution.  \n\n[ image source  ] \n\n------------------------------------------- \n Related:   \n \" Introspection, What?  \" (2012), in D. Smithies and D. Stoljar, eds.,  Introspection and Consciousness    (Oxford). My own positive account of the nature of introspection.  \n \" Introspection  \".  My  Stanford Encyclopedia   review article on theories of introspection.  \n \" The Problem of Known Illusion and the Resemblance of Experience to Reality  \" (2014),  Philosophy of Science 81,   954-960.  Puzzlement and possible metaphysical juice, arising from reflections on the weird relation between objective and introspective reporting.   \n  \n                    \n In  a paper forthcoming in  Philosophical Studies    (also  here  ),  Rik Peels   defends, against a variety of scientifically inspired objections, the traditional philosophical view that introspection is a reliable source of knowledge.  He focuses especially on arguments I developed in my 2011 book  Perplexities of Consciousness  . \n\nPeels considers arguments for the unreliability of introspection based on: the sometimes large effect of reporting method (e.g., button press vs. verbal report) on the content of introspective judgments; cultural variation in whether dreams are seen as colored; the poor correlation between self-reported visual imagery and performance on cognitive tasks often thought to be facilitated by visual imagery (such as mental rotation or folding tasks); people's ignorance of their capacity for echolocation; and people's ignorance of the lack of detail and precision in the visual field.  In each case, Peels presents the skeptic's argument in a couple of pages and then offers a couple of pages of objections. \n\nFor example, Peels offers three responses to my observation that self-reports of mental imagery tend not to correlate with behavioral performance on seemingly related cognitive tasks.  First, he points out that since people don't have access to other people's imagery, terms like \"vivid\" might be interpreted quite differently between subjects -- and thus people might be accurate in their own idiolect even if not in an outwardly measurable way.  Second, he suggests that the aspects of mental imagery being reported (such as vividness) might not be relevant to the cognitive tasks at hand (like mental rotation), in which case lack of correlation is to be expected.  Third, he notes that some studies (a minority) do report positive correlations.  While in my discussion of this topic, I  have given reasons   to be leery of psychological findings that fail to replicate -- such as experimenter bias, \"file-drawer\" effects, the existence of confounding or intervening variables, and participants' tendency to confirm perceived research hypotheses -- Peels argues that I have presented insufficient positive evidence that such factors are at work in these cases. \n\nThe imagery case is, I think, illustrative of the debate in two ways: First,  a lot hinges on examination of the empirical details  , such as the precise nature of the measures.  And second, a  lot hinges on judgments of plausibility about which reasonable people might differ  .  For example, looking at hundreds of studies of visual imagery self-report and cognitive performance, a literature with lots of null results and non-replications, does one think (as I do), \"That looks pretty bad for the reality of an underlying effect\" or does one think (as Peels seems to), \"There probably is an effect in there somewhere that the null studies aren't effectively getting at\".  This sort of thing is a matter of judgment.  (And no, I don't think the  typical statistical meta-analysis   will yield a straightforward answer that we should take at face value.) \n\nOne's sense of plausibility, in such matters, comes close to being something like one's general academic worldview -- about philosophy, about psychology, and about their interaction.  Here, I find the introduction and conclusion of Peels' essay interesting. \n\nIn the introduction, Peels lists four reasons the question of the reliability of introspection is important:\n\n (a.) Ordinary \"common sense\" tends to treat introspection as a reliable source of knowledge.  To reject its reliability is to  challenge common sense  . \n\n(b.) There's a philosophical tradition from Descartes to Chalmers of taking introspection (appropriately restricted) as infallible.  To reject introspection's reliability means  abandoning the infallibilist tradition  . \n\n(c.)There's a contrary \"scientistic\" tradition that emphasizes science as the only secure source of knowledge and regards introspection as non-scientific.  To reject introspection's reliability  plays into the hands of those who want to privilege the epistemic role of science  . \n  (d.) There's a  debate  within   science about how to treat introspective self-reports  .              \n April 2, I'll be a critic at a  Pacific APA   author-meets-critics session on Quassim Cassam's book  Self-Knowledge for Humans  .  (Come!)  In the last chapter of the book, Cassam argues that self-knowledge is not intrinsically valuable.  It's only, he says,  derivatively   or  instrumentally   valuable -- valuable to the extent it helps deliver something  else  , like happiness. \n    \n\nI disagree.  Self-knowledge is intrinsically valuable!    It's valuable even if it doesn't advance some other project, valuable even if it doesn't increase our happiness.  Cassam defends his view by objecting to three possible arguments for the intrinsic value of self-knowledge.  I'll spot him those objections.  Here are three other ways to argue for the intrinsic value of self-knowledge.     \n Transparency is a fun concept, as applied in the recent philosophical literature on self-knowledge (e.g.,  here  ; see also these  past    posts  ).  I want to extend the transparency metaphor to self-knowledge of personality traits, where philosophers haven't yet taken it (to my knowledge). \n\nFirst, the established versions: \n Transparency 1: Sensory experience.    As  G.E. Moore   and  Gilbert Harman   have noticed, when you try to attend to your visual experience you (usually? inevitably?) end up attending to external objects instead (or at least  in addition  ).  Attend to your experience of the computer screen.  In  some sense   it seems like your attention slips right through the experience itself, lodging upon the screen. \n Transparency 2: Attitudes.    As  Gareth Evans   notices, when someone asks you if you think there will be a third world war, you typically answer by thinking about the outside world -- about the likelihood of war -- rather than by turning your attention inward toward your own mental states.   More contentiously  , thinking about whether you want ice cream also seems to involve, mostly, thinking about the world -- about the advantages and disadvantages of eating ice cream. \n\nIn both types of case,  you learn about  yourself   by attending to the  outside world  .    One feature of this metaphor  that I especially like   is that you can  learn about distortions in yourself   by noticing features of the world that don't align with your general knowledge.  Gazing through a window, if the trees are a weird color, you know the window is tinted; if the trees wiggle around as you shift head position, you know the window is warped.  If the lamplights at night radiate spears, you've learned something about distortions in your vision.  If your paper is The Best Thing Ever Published, you've learned something about your egocentric bias. \n\nThis brings me to: \n Transparency 3: Personality.    Since I think  personality traits and attitudes are basically the same thing  , I regard Transparency 3 as a natural extension of Transparency 2.  (And since 2 and 1 are also related, maybe we have 1 3/4 kinds of transparency rather than three kinds.)   To find out if you're the kind of person who loves children, think about children.    To find out if you're an extravert, think about parties.  Since your personality colors your view of the world, one way to learn about your personality is to look at a relevant part of the world and notice its color.  (You can also consider your past behavior; or directly try a label on for size; or ask friends for their frank opinion of you.  Transparency-style reflection on the world isn't the only, or even always a very good, route to self-knowledge.) \n\nThis approach might work especially well for the \" Big Five  \" personality trait  Agreeableness  .  \"Agreeable\" people are those who self-rate, or are rated by others, as being concerned for other people, interested in them, sympathetic, helpful.   Several    recent    studies   suggest that  people who self-rate as agreeable tend also to be more likely to rate others as agreeable (sympathetic, helpful, etc.)  , and also to rate other people positively in other ways too, especially if the other person is not very well known.  If you're a sweetheart, the world seems to be full mostly of sweethearts and interesting people;  if you're a jerk, the world seems to be full of jerks and fools  .  What I'm proposing to call the transparency approach to self-knowledge of personality simply involves running this observation the other direction: From the fact that the world seems full of uninteresting and disagreeable people, infer that you are a disagreeable person; from the fact that the world seems full of warm, loving, interesting people, infer that you are a relatively sympathetic, concerned person. \n Now it would be really interesting if it turned out that these sorts of  perceiver effects   were actually better predictors of underlying personality as constituted by patterns of real-world behavior than are the typical self-rating scales used in personality psychology   -- but it's probably too much to hope that the world would align so neatly with my own theoretical biases.  (Hm, what does that last judgment reveal about my personality?)  \n  \n          \n What is introspection?  Nothing!  Or rather, almost everything. \n A long philosophical tradition  , going back at least to Locke,  has held that there is a distinctive faculty   by means of which we know our own minds -- or at least our currently ongoing stream of conscious experience, our sensory experience, our imagery, our emotional experience and inner speech.  \"Reflection\" or \"inner sense\" or introspection is, in this common view,  a single type of process  , yielding highly reliable (maybe even infallibly certain) knowledge of our own minds. \n\nCritics of this approach to introspection have tended to either: \n\n(a.) radically deny the existence of the human capacity to discover a stream of inner experience (e.g., radical  behaviorism  ); \n\n(b.) attribute our supposedly excellent self-knowledge of experience to some distinctive process  other   than introspection (e.g.,  expressivist   or  transparency approaches  , on which \"I think that...\" is just a dongle added to a judgment about the outside world, no inward attention or scanning required); or \n\n (c.) be pluralistic in the sense that we have one introspective mechanism to scan our beliefs, another to scan our visual experiences, another to scan our emotional experiences.... \n\nBut here's another possibility: Introspective judgments arise from a range of processes that is  diverse both  within-case    (i.e., lots of different processes feeding any one judgment)  and  between-case    (i.e., very different sets of processes contributing to the judgment on different occasions) and yet also allows that  introspective judgments arise  partly   through a relatively direct sensitivity to the conscious experiences that they are judgments about  . \n\nConsider an  analogy  :  You're at a science conference or a high school science fair, quickly trying to take in a poster.   You have no dedicated faculty of poster-taking-in.    Rather, you deploy a variety of cognitive resources: visually appreciating the charts, listening to the presenter's explanation, simultaneously reading pieces of the poster, charitably bringing general knowledge to bear, asking questions and listening to responses both for overt content and for emotional tone....  It needn't be the same set of resources every time (you needn't even use vision: sometimes you can just listen, if you're in the mood or visually impaired).   Instead, you flexibly, opportunistically use a diverse range of resources  , dedicated to the question of  what are the main ideas of this poster  , in a way that aims to be relatively directly sensitive to the actual content of the poster. \n\nIntrospection, in my view, is like that.  If I want to know what my visual experience is right now, or my emotional experience, or my auditory imagery, I engage not one cognitive process that was selected or developed primarily for the purpose of acquiring self-knowledge; rather I engage a diversity of processes that were primarily selected or developed for other purposes.  I look outward at the world and think about what, given that world, it would make sense for me to be experiencing right now; but also I am attuned to the possibility that I might not be experiencing that, ready to notice clues pointing a different direction.  I change and shape my experience in the very act of thinking about it, often (but not always) in a way that improves the match between my experience and my judgment about it.  I have memories (short- and long-term), associations, things that it seems more natural and less natural to say, views sometimes important to my self-image about what types of experience I tend to have, either in general or under certain conditions, emotional reactions that color or guide my response, spontaneous speech impulses that I can inhibit or disinhibit.  Etc.   And any combination of these processes, and others besides, can swirl together to precipitate a judgment about my ongoing stream of experience.  \n\nNow the functional set-up of the mind is such that some processes' outputs are contingent upon the outputs of other processes.   Pieces of the mind stay in sync with what is going on in other pieces  , keep a running bead on each other, with varying degrees of directness and accuracy.  And so also introspective judgments will be causally linked to a wide variety of other cognitive processes, including normally both relatively short and relatively circuitous links from the processes that give rise to the conscious experiences that the introspective judgments are judgments about.  But  these kinds of contingencies imply no distinctive introspective self-scanning faculty; it's just how the mind must work, if it is to be a single coherent mind,   and it happens preconsciously in systems no-one thinks of as introspective, e.g., in the early visual system, as well as farther downstream. \n\n[For further exposition of this view, with detailed examples, see my essay  Introspection, What?  ]  \n  \n            \n Recently, I've been arguing (e.g.,  here   and  here  ) that we should be skeptical about any general theory of consciousness, whether philosophical or scientific.  Here's one way of putting the case. \n \n    \nWhen we advance a general theory of consciousness, we must do so on some combination of empirical grounds (especially the study of actual conscious systems here on Earth) and armchair reflection (especially thought experiments). \n\nOur empirical grounds are very limited:  We have only seen conscious systems as they exist on Earth  . To draw, on these grounds, universal conclusions about how any conscious system  must   be structured would be a reckless leap,  if   our theories are really supposed to be driven by empirical tests on conscious animals, which could have come out either way. Who knows how those crucial theory-driving experiments would have come out on very differently constructed beings from Andromeda Galaxy?  \n  \nA truly universal theory of consciousness seems more likely to succeed if it draws broadly from a range of hypothetical cases, abstracting away from empirical details of implementation on Earth. So we must sit in our armchairs. However, armchair reflection about the consciousness of hypothetical beings has two huge shortcomings:\n  \n \n Experts in the field reach very different conclusions   when asked to reflect on what sorts of hypothetical beings would be conscious (all the way from  panpsychism   to views that require highly sophisticated cognitive abilities).  \n Our judgments about such cases must be grounded in some sort of prior knowledge  , such as our experience of beings here on Earth and our developmentally and socially and evolutionarily favored beliefs.  And there seems little reason to trust such judgments outside the run of normal cases, for example, about the  consciousness or not of large group entities   under various conditions.  \n  \nIf you are moved by these concerns, you might think that the appropriate response is to restrict our theory to consciousness as it appears on Earth. But even just thinking about consciousness on Earth drops us into a huge methodological dilemma. If we treat introspective reportability as something close to a necessary condition for consciousness, then we end up with a very sparse view of the distribution of consciousness on Earth. And maybe that's right!  But it also seems reasonable to think that consciousness might be possible without introspective reportability, e.g., in dogs and babies. And then it becomes extremely unclear how we determine whether it is present without begging big theoretical questions.   How could we possibly determine whether an ant is conscious without begging the question against people with very different views than our own? \n Could we forget about non-human animals and babies and restrict our (increasingly less general) theory of consciousness just to adult humans? Even here, I incline toward pessimism  , at least for the medium-term future. \n\nOne reason is this:  I see no near-term way to resolve the question of  whether consciousness abundantly outruns attention   . I think I can imagine two very different possibilities here. One possibility is that I have constant tactile experience of my feet in my shoes, constant auditory experience of the hum of the refrigerator, etc., but when I'm not attending to such matters, that experience drops out of memory so quickly and is so lightly processed that it is unreportable. Another possibility is that I usually have no tactile experience whatsoever of my feet in my shoes or auditory experience of the hum of the fridge unless these things capture my attention for some reason. These possibilities seem substantively distinct, and it's easy to see how a proponent of one can create a methodological error theory to explain away the judgments of a proponent of the other.  \n  \nNow maybe there's a way around these problems. Scientists have often found ingenious ways to embarrass earlier naysayers! But still, there's such a huge spread between the best neuroscientific approaches (e.g.,  Tononi   and  Dehaene  ) and such a huge spread between the best philosophical approaches (e.g.,  Chalmers   and  Dennett  ), that it's hard for me to envision a well-justified consensus emerging in my philosophical lifetime. \n [HT  Scott Bakker  , who has been pushing me on these issues.]         \n In \"The Unreliability of Naive Introspection\" ( here   and  here  ), I argue, contra a philosophical tradition going back at least to Descartes,   that we have much better knowledge of middle-sized objects in the world around us than we do of our stream of sensory experience while perceiving those objects  . \n\nAs I write near the end of that paper: The tomato is stable.  My visual experience as I look at the tomato shifts with each saccade, each blink, each observation of a blemish, each alteration of attention, with the adaptation of my eyes to lighting and color.  My thoughts, my images, my itches, my pains \u2013 all bound away as I think about them, or remain only as interrupted, theatrical versions of themselves.  Nor can I hold them still even as artificial specimens \u2013 as I reflect on one aspect of the experience, it alters and grows, or it crumbles.  The unattended aspects undergo their own changes too.  If outward things were so evasive, they\u2019d also mystify and mislead.  \n\nLast Saturday, I defended this view for three hours before commentator  Carlotta Pavese   and a number of other New York philosophers (including  Ned Block  ,  Paul Boghossian  ,  David Chalmers  ,  Paul Horwich  ,  Chris Peacocke  ,  Jim Pryor  ). \n\nOne question -- raised first, I think, by Paul B. then later by Jim -- was this:  Don't I know that I'm having a visual experience as of seeing a hat at least as well as I know that there is in fact a real hat in front of me?    I could be wrong about the hat without being wrong about the visual experience as of seeing a hat, but to be wrong about having a visual experience as of seeing a hat, well, maybe it's not impossible but at least it's a weird, unusual case. \n\nI was a bit rustier in answering this question than I would have been in 2009 -- partly, I suspect, because I never articulated in writing my standard response to that concern.  So let me do so now. \n\nFirst, we need to know what kind of mental state this is about which I supposedly have excellent knowledge.  Here's one possibility: To have \"a visual experience as of seeing a hat\" is to have a visual experience of the type that is normally caused by seeing hats.  In other words, when I judge that I'm having this experience, I'm making a causal generalization about the normal origins of experiences of the present type.  But it seems doubtful that I know better what types of visual experiences normally arise in the course of seeing hats than I know that there is a hat in front of me.  In any case, such causal generalizations are not sort of thing defenders of introspection usually have in mind. \n\nHere's another interpretative possibility: In judging that I am having a visual experience as of seeing a hat, I am reporting an inclination to reach a certain judgment.  I am reporting an inclination to judge that there is a hat in front of me, and I am reporting that that inclination is somehow caused by or grounded in my current visual experience.  On this reading of the claim, what I am accurate about is that I have a certain  attitude   -- an inclination to judge.  But attitudes are not conscious experiences.  Inclinations to judge are one thing; visual experiences another.  I might be very accurate in my judgment that I am inclined to reach a certain judgment about the world (and on such-and-such grounds), but that's not knowledge of my stream of sensory experience. \n\n(In  a couple of    other essays  , I discuss self-knowledge of attitudes.  I argue that our self-knowledge of our judgments is pretty good when the matter is of little importance to our self-conception and when the tendency to verbally espouse the content of the judgment is central to the dispositional syndrome constitutive of reaching that judgment.  Excellent knowledge of such partially self-fulfilling attitudes is quite a different matter from excellent knowledge of the stream of experience.) \n\nSo how about this interpretative possibility?  To say I know that I am having a visual experience as of seeing a hat is to say that I am having a visual experience with such-and-such specific phenomenal features, e.g., this-shade-here, this-shape-here, this-piece-of-representational-content-there, and maybe this-holistic-character.  If we're careful to read such judgments purely as judgments about features of my current stream of visual experience, I see no reason to think we would be highly trustworthy in them.  Such structural features of the stream of experience are exactly the kinds of things about which I've argued we are apt to err:  what it's like to see a tilted coin at an oblique angle  ,  how fast color and shape experience get hazy toward the periphery  , how stable or shifty the phenomenology of shape and color is,  how richly penetrated visual experience is with cognitive content  .  These are topics of confusion and dispute in philosophy and consciousness studies, not matters we introspect with near infallibility. \n Part of the issue here, I think, is that certain mental states have both a phenomenal face and a functional face.    When I judge that I see something or that I'm hungry or that I want something, I am typically reaching a judgment that is in part about my stream of conscious experience and in part about my physiology, dispositions, and causal position in the world.   If we think carefully about even medium-sized features of the phenomenological face of such hybrid mental states   -- about what, exactly,  it's like   to experience hunger (how far does it spread in subjective bodily space, how much is it like a twisting or pressure or pain or...?) or about what, exactly, it's like to see a hat (how stable is that experience, how rich with detail, how do I experience the hat's non-canonical perspective...?),  we quickly reach the limits of introspective reliability  .  My judgments about even medium-sized features of my visual experience are dubious.  But I can easily answer a whole range of questions about comparably medium-sized features of the hat itself (its braiding, where the stitches are, its size and stability and solidity). \n Update, November 25 [revised 5:24 pm]:  \nPaul Boghossian writes: I haven't had a chance to think carefully about what you say, but I wanted to clarify the point I was making, which wasn't quite what you say on the blog, that it would be a weird, unusual case in which one misdescribes one's own perceptual states.   \n\nI was imagining that one was given the task of carefully describing the surface of a table and giving a very attentive description full of detail of the whorls here and the color there.  One then discovers that all along one has just been a brain in a vat being fed experiences.  At that point, it would be very natural to conclude that one had been merely describing the visual images that one had enjoyed as opposed to any table.  Since one can so easily retreat from saying that one had been describing a table to saying that one had been describing one's mental image of a table, it's hard to see how one could be much better at the former than at the latter. \n Roger White   then made the same point without using the brain in a vat scenario.  \n    I do feel some sympathy for the thought that you get  something   right in such a case -- but  what   exactly you get right, and how dependably... well, that's the tricky issue!  \n  \n            \n (by Alan T. Moore and Eric Schwitzgebel) \n\nWhat do you usually experience when you read? \n\nSome people say that they generally  hear the words of the text   in their heads, either in their own voice or in the voices of narrator or characters; others say they rarely do this.  Some people say they generally form  visual images of the scene or ideas   depicted; others say they rarely do this.  Some people say that when they are deeply enough absorbed in reading,  they no longer see the page  , instead playing the scene like a movie before their eyes; others say that even when fully absorbed they still always visually experience the words on the page. \n\nSome quotes:\n\n Baars (2003): \u201cHuman beings talk to themselves every moment of the waking day.  Most readers of this sentence are doing it just now.\u201d \n\nJaynes (1976): \u201cRight at this moment\u2026 as you read, you are not conscious of the letters or even of the words, or even of the syntax or the sentences, or the punctuation, but only of their meaning.\u201d \n\nTitchener (1909): \u201cI instinctively arrange the facts or arguments in some visual pattern [such as] a suggestion of dull red\u2026 of angles rather than curves\u2026 pretty clearly, the picture of movement along lines, and of neatness or confusion where the moving lines come together.\u201d \n\nWittgenstein (1946-1948): While reading \u201cI have impressions, see pictures in my mind\u2019s eye, etc.  I make the story pass before me like pictures, like a cartoon story.\u201d \n\nBurke (1757): While reading \u201ca very diligent examination of my own mind, and getting others to consider theirs, I do not find that one in twenty times any such picture is formed.\u201d \n\nHurlburt (2007): Some people \u201capparently simply read, comprehending the meaning without images or speech.  Melanie\u2019s general view\u2026 is that she starts a passage in inner speech and then \u201ctakes off\u201d into images.\u201d       \n\nAlan and I can find no systematic studies of the issue. \n\nWe recruited 414 U.S.  mechanical Turk   workers to participate in a study on the experience of reading.  First we asked them for their general impressions about their own experiences while reading.  How often -- on a 1-7 scale from \"never\" to \"half of the time\" to \"always\" -- do they experience visual imagery?  Inner speech?  The words on the page?  (We briefly clarified these terms and gave examples.) \n\nThe responses: \n          \n[Note: For words on the page, we asked: \"How often do you NOT experience the words on the page as you read?  Example: your mind is filled with the ideas of the story and not the actual black letters against the white background\".  We have reversed the scale for presentation here.] \n\nNow, if you're anything like me, you'll be  pretty skeptical   about the accuracy of these types of self-reports.  So Alan and I did several things to try to test for accuracy. \n\nOur general design was to give each person a passage to read, during which they were interrupted with a beep and asked if they were experiencing imagery, inner speech, or the words on the page.  Afterwards, we asked comprehension questions, including questions about visual or auditory details of the story or about details of the visual presentation of the material (such as font).  Finally, we asked again for participants' general impressions about how regularly they experience imagery, inner speech, and the words on the page when they read. \n\nThe comprehension questions were a mixed bag and difficult to interpret -- too much for this blog post (maybe we'll do a follow-up) -- but the other results are striking enough on their own. \n Among those who reported \"always\" experiencing inner speech while they read, only 78% reported inner speech in their one sampled experience.    Think a bit about what that means.  Despite, presumably, some pressure on participants to conform to their earlier statements about their experience,  it took exactly one sampled experience   for 22% of those reporting constant inner speech to find an apparent counterexample to their initially expressed opinion.  Suppose we had sampled five times, or twenty? \n\nFor comparison: 9% of those reporting \"always\" experiencing visual imagery denied experiencing visual imagery in their one sampled experience.  And 42% did the same about visually experiencing the words on the page. \n\nParticipants' final reports about their reading experience, too, suggest substantial initial ignorance about their reading experience.   The correlations between participants initial and final generalizations about reading experience were .47 for visual imagery, .58 for inner speech, and .37 for experience of words on the page.    Such medium-sized correlations are quite modest considering that the questions being correlated are verbatim identical questions about participants' reading experience in general, with an interval of about 5-10 minutes between.  One might have thought that if people's general opinions about their experience are well-founded, the experience of reading a single passage should have only a minimal effect on such generalizations.  \n  \n              \n I'm an  introspective pessimist:   I think people's introspective judgments about their stream of conscious experience are often radically mistaken.  This is the topic of my 2011 book,  Perplexities of Consciousness  .  Over the past few years, I've found the most common objection to my work to be what I'll call the  Individual Differences Reply  . \n\nMany of my arguments depend on what I call the  Argument from Variability  : Some people report experiences of Type X, others report experience of Type not-X, but it's not plausible that Group 1 and Group 2 differ enough in their underlying stream of experience to make both claims true.  Therefore, someone must be mistaken about their experience.  So for example: People used to say they dreamed in black and white; now people don't say that; so someone is wrong about their dream experiences.  Some people say that tilted coins in some sense look elliptical as though projected upon a 2D visual screen, while others say that visual experience is robustly 3D with no projective distortions at all.  Some people say that objects seen 20 degrees from the point of fixation look fairly clear and colorful, while others say objects 20 degrees from center look extremely sketchy and indeterminate of color.  Assuming a common underlying experience, disagreement reveals someone to be mistaken.  (Fortunately, we needn't settle which is the mistaken party.) \n\nThe Individual Differences Reply challenges this assumption of underlying commonality.  If people differ in their experience as radically as is suggested by their introspective reports, then no one need be mistaken!  Maybe people did really used to dream in black and white and now they dream in color ( see Ned Block's comment on a recent Splintered Mind post  ).  Maybe some people really do see tilted coins as elliptical while others do not. \n\nThere are two versions of the Individual Difference Reply, which I will call the  Stable Differences   and the  Temporary Differences   versions.  On the Stable Differences version, people  durably   differ in their experiences in such a way as to render their reports accurate as generalizations about their experiences.  On the Temporary Differences version, people might be similar in their experiences generally, but when faced with the introspective task itself their experience shifts in such a way as to match their reports.  For example, maybe everyone generally has similar experiences 20 degrees into the visual periphery, but when asked to introspect their visual experience, some people experience (and accurately report) clarity while others experience (and accurately report) haziness. \n\nPeople who have pressed versions of the Individual Differences Reply on me include  Alsmith forthcoming  ,  Hohwy 2011  ,  Jacovides 2012   and  Hurlburt in Hurlburt & Schwitzgebel 2007  .) \n\nHere's how I think the dispute should be resolved: Look, on a case-by-case basis, for measurable brain or behavioral differences that tightly correlate with the differences in introspective report and which are plausibly diagnostic of the underlying variability.  If those correlations are found, accept that the reports reveal real differences.  If not, conclude that at least one party is wrong about their experience. \n\nConsider black and white dreaming.  Theoretically, we could hook up brain imagining machinery to people who report black and white dreams and to people who report color dreams.  If the latter group shows substantially more neural activity in color-associated neural areas while dreaming, the reports are substantiated.  If not, the reports are undermined.  Alternatively, examine color term usage in dream narratives: How often do people use terms like \"red\", \"green\", etc., in dream diaries?  If the rates are different, that supports the existence of difference; if not, that supports the hypothesis of error.  In fact, I looked at exactly this in Chapter 1 of  Perplexities  , and found rates of color-term usage in dream reports to be the same during the peak period of black-and-white dream reporting (USA circa 1950) and recently (USA circa 2000). \n\nGenerally, I think the evidence often shows a poor relationship between differences in introspective report and differences in plausibly corresponding behavior or physiology. \n\nSometimes there is no systematic evidence, but antecedent plausibility considerations suggest against at least the Stable Differences version of the Individual Differences Reply: It seems highly unlikely that the people who report sharp visual experiences 20 degrees into the periphery differ vastly in general visual capacity or visual physiology from those who report highly indeterminate shape and color 20 degrees into the periphery.  But that's an empirical question, so test it if you like!  \n  \n          \n Maja Spener   has  written an interesting critique   of my 2011 book,  Perplexities of Consciousness  , for a forthcoming book symposium at  Philosophical Studies  .  My book is an extended argument that people have very poor knowledge of their own conscious experience, even of what one might have thought would be fairly obvious-seeming features of their currently ongoing experience (such as whether it is sparse or full of abundant detail, whether it is visually doubled, whether they have pervasive auditory experience of the silent surfaces around them).  Maja argues that we have good introspective knowledge in at least one class of cases: cases in which our skillful negotiation with the world depends on what she calls \"introspection-reliant abilities\". \n\nMaja provides examples of two such introspection-reliant abilities: choosing the right amount of food to order at a restaurant (which relies on knowledge of how hungry you feel) and adjusting binoculars (which relies on knowing how blurry the target objects look). \n\nLet's consider, then, Maja's binoculars.  What, exactly, are you noticing when you adjust your binoculars? \n\nConsider other cases of optical reflection and refraction.  I see an oar half-submerged in water.  In some sense, maybe, it \"looks bent\".  Is this a judgment about my visual experience of the oar or instead a judgment about the optical structure of my environment? -- or a bit of both?  How about when I view myself in the bathroom mirror?  Normally during my morning routine, I seem to be reaching judgments primarily about my body and secondarily about the mirror, and hardly at all about my visual experience.  (At least, not unless we accept some kind of introspective foundationalism on which all judgments about the outside world are grounded on prior judgments about experience.)  Or suppose I'm just out of the shower and the mirror is foggy; in this case my primary judgment seems to concern neither my body nor my visual experience but rather the state of the mirror.  Similarly, perhaps, if the mirror is warped -- or if I am looking through a warped window, or a fisheye lens, or using a maladjusted review mirror at night, or looking in a carnival mirror. \n\nIf I can reach such judgments directly without antecedent judgments about my visual experience, perhaps analogously in the binoculars case?  Or is there maybe instead some interaction among phenomenal judgments about experience and optical or objectual judgments, or some indeterminacy about what sort of judgment it really is?  We can create, I'm inclined to think, a garden path between the normal bathroom mirror case (seemingly not an introspective judgment about visual experience) and the blurry binoculars case (seemingly an introspective judgment about visual experience), going either direction, and thus into self-contradiction.  (For related cases feeding related worries see my essay in draft  The Problem of Known Illusion and the Resemblance of Experience to Reality  .) \n\nAnother avenue of resistance to the binoculars case might be this.  Suppose I'm looking at a picture on a rather dodgy computer monitor and it looks too blue, so I blame the monitor and change the settings.  Arguably, I could have done this without introspection: I reach a normal, non-introspective visual judgment that the picture of the baby seal is tinted blue.  But I know that baby seals are white.  So I blame the monitor and adjust.  Or maybe I have a real baby seal in a room with dubious, theatrical lighting.  I reach a normal visual assessment of the seal as tinted blue, so I know the lighting much be off and I ask the lighting techs to adjust.  Similarly perhaps, then, if I gaze at a real baby seal through blurry binoculars: I reach a normal, non-introspective judgment of the baby seal as blurry-edged.  But I know that baby seals have sharp edges.  So I blame the binoculars and adjust.  Need this be introspective at all, need it concern visual experience at all? \n\nIn the same way, maybe, I see spears of light spiking out of streetlamps at night -- an illusion, some imperfection of my eyes or eyewear.  When I know I am being betrayed by optics, am I necessarily introspecting, or might I just be correcting my normal non-introspective visual assessments? \n\nThis is a nest of issues I am struggling with, making less progress than I would like.  Maybe Maja is right, then.  But if so, it will take further work to show.  \n  \n         \n You believe some proposition P.  You believe that Armadillo is the capital of Texas, say.[footnote 1]  Someone asks you what you think the capital of Texas is.  You say, \"In my opinion, the capital of Texas is Armadillo.\"  How do you know that that is what you believe? \n\nHere's one account (e.g., in  Nichols and Stich 2003  ): You have in your mind a dedicated \"Monitoring Mechanism\".  The job of this Monitoring Mechanism is to scan the contents of your Belief Box, finding tokens such as P (\"Armadillo is the capital of Texas\") or Q (\"There's an orangutan in the fridge\"), and producing, in consequence, new beliefs of the form \"I believe P\" or \"I believe Q\".  Similarly, it or a related mechanism can scan your Desire Box, producing new beliefs of the form \"I desire R\" or \"I desire S\".  Call this the  Dedicated Mechanism Account.  \n\nOne alternative account is  Peter Carruthers  's.  Carruthers  argues that there is no such dedicated mechanism  .  Instead, we theorize on the basis of sensory evidence and our own imagery.  For example, I hear myself saying -- either aloud or in inner speech (which is a form of imagery) -- \"The capital of Texas is Armadillo\", and I think something like, \"Well, I wouldn't say that unless I thought it was true!\", and so I conclude that I believe that Armadillo is the capital.  This theoretical, interpretative reasoning about myself is usually nonconscious, but in the bowels of my cognitive architecture, that's what I'm doing.  And there's no more direct route to self-knowledge, according to Carruthers.  We have to interpret ourselves given the evidence of our behavior, our environmental context, and our stream of imagery and inner speech. \n\nHere's an argument against both accounts. \n\nFirst, assume that to believe that P is to have a representation with the content P stored in a Belief Box (or memory store), i.e., ready to be accessed for theoretical inference and practical decision making.  ( I'm not keen on Belief Boxes myself  , but I'll get to that later.)  A typical deployment of P might be as follows: When Bluebeard says to me, \"I'm heading off to the capital of Texas!\", I call up P from my Belief Box and conclude that Bluebeard is heading off to Armadillo.  I might similarly ascribe a belief to Bluebeard on that basis.  Unless I have reason to think Bluebeard ignorant about the capital of Texas or (by my lights) mistaken about it, I can reasonably conclude that Bluebeard  believes   that he is heading to Armadillo.  All parties agree that I need not introspect to attribute this belief to Bluebeard, nor call upon any specially dedicated self-scanning mechanism (other than whatever allows ordinary memory retrieval), nor interpret my own behavior and imagery.  I can just pull up P to join it with other beliefs, and conclude that Q.  Nothing special here or self-interpretive.  Just ordinary cognition. \n\nNow suppose the conclusion of interest -- the \"Q\" in this case -- is just \"I believe that P\".  What other beliefs does P need to be hooked up with to license this conclusion?  None, it seems!  I can go straightaway, in normal cases, from pulling up P to the conclusion \"I believe that P\".  If that's how it works, no dedicated self-scanning mechanism or self-interpretation is required, but only ordinary belief-retrieval for cognition, contra both Carruthers's view and Dedicated Mechanism Accounts. \n\nThat will have seemed a bit fast, perhaps.  So let's consider some comparison cases.  Suppose Sally is the school registrar.  I assume she has true beliefs about the main events on the academic calendar.  I believe that final exams end on June 8.  If someone asks me when Sally believes final exams will end, I can call up P1 (\"exams end June 8\") and P2 (\"Sally has true beliefs about the main events on the academic calendar\") to conclude Q (\"Sally believes exams end June 8\").  Self-ascription would be like that, but without P2 required.  Or suppose I believe in divine omniscience.  From P1 plus divine omniscience, I can conclude that God believes P1.  Or suppose that I've heard that there's this guy, Eric Schwitzgebel, who believes all the same things I believe about politics.  If P1 concerns politics, I can conclude from P1 and this knowledge about Eric Schwitzgebel that this Eric Schwitzgebel guy believes P1.  Later I might find out that Eric Schwitzgebel is me. \n\nDo I need to self-ascribe the belief that P1 before reaching that conclusion about the Eric Schwitzgebel guy?  I don't see why I must.  I know that moving from \"P1 is true and concerns politics\" to \"that Eric Schwitzgebel guy believes P1\" will get me true conclusions.  I can rely on it.  It might be cognitively efficient for me to develop a habit of thought by which I leap straight from one to the other. \n\nAlternatively: Everyone thinks that I can at least sometimes ascribe myself beliefs as a result of inference.  I subscribe to a general theory, say, on which if P1 and P2 are true of Person S and if P3 and P4 are true in general about the world, then I can conclude that S believes Q.  Now suppose S is me.  And suppose Q is \"I believe P\" and suppose P3 is P.  And then jettison the rest of P1, P2, and P4.  Voila![footnote 2] \n\nIf there is a Desire Box, it might work much the same way.  If I can call up the desire R to join with some other beliefs and desires to form a plan, in just the ordinary cognitive way that desires are called up, so also it seems I should be able to do for the purposes of self-ascription.  It would be odd if we could call up beliefs and desires for all the wide variety of cognitive purposes that we ordinarily call them up for but  not   for the purposes of self-ascriptive judgment.  What would explain that strange incapacity? \n\nWhat if there isn't a Belief Box, a Desire Box, or a representational storage bin?  The idea remains basically the same: Whatever mechanisms allow me to reach conclusions and act  based on   my beliefs and desires should also allow me to reach conclusions  about   my beliefs and desires -- at least once I am cognitively sophisticated enough to have adult-strength concepts of belief and desire. \n\nThis doesn't mean I never go wrong and don't self-interpret at all.  We are inconsistent and unstable in our belief- and desire-involving behavioral patterns; the opinions we tend to act on in some circumstances (e.g., when self-ascription or verbal avowal is our task) might very often differ from those we tend to act on in other circumstances; and it's a convenient shorthand -- too convenient, sometimes -- to assume that what we say, when we're not just singing to ourselves and not intending to lie, reflects our opinions.  Nor does it imply that there aren't also dedicated mechanisms of a certain sort.  My own view of self-knowledge is, in fact,  pluralist  .  But among the many paths, I think, is the path above. \n\n(Fans of  Alex Byrne  's approach to self-knowledge will notice substantial similarities between the above and  his views  , to which I owe a considerable debt.) \n Update, February 27   \nPeter Carruthers replies as follows: Eric says: \u201cI can just pull up P to join it with other beliefs, and conclude that Q. Nothing special here or self-interpretive. Just ordinary cognition.\u201d This embodies a false assumption (albeit one that is widely shared among philosophers; and note that essentially the same response to that below can be made to Alex Byrne). This is that there is a central  propositional   workspace of the mind where beliefs and desires can be activated and interact with one another directly in unconstrained ways to issue in new beliefs or decisions. In fact there is no such amodal workspace. The only central workspace that the mind contains is the working memory system, which has been heavily studied by psychologists for the last half-century. The emerging consensus from this work (especially over the last 15 years or so) is that working memory is  sensory based  . It depends upon attention directed toward mid-level sensory areas of the brain, resulting in globally broadcast sensory representations in visual or motor imagery, inner speech, and so on. While these representations can have conceptual information bound into them, it is impossible for such information to enter the central workspace alone, not integrated into a sensory-based representation of some sort. \n \nUnless P is an episodic memory, then (which is likely to have a significant sensory component), or unless it is a semantic memory stored, at least in part, in sensory format (e.g. a visual image of a map of Texas), then the only way for P to \u201cjoin with other beliefs, and conclude that Q\u201d is for it to be converted into (say) an episode of inner speech, which will then require interpretation. \n \nThis is not to deny that  some   systems in the mind can access beliefs and draw inferences without those beliefs needing to be activated in the global workspace (that is, in working memory). In particular, goal states can initiate searches for information to enable the construction of plans in an \u201cautomatic\u201d, unconscious manner. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the mindreading system can do the same. Indeed, a second error made by Eric in his post is a failure to note that the mindreading system bifurcates into two (or more) distinct components: a domain-specific system that attributes mental states to others (and to oneself), and a set of domain-general planning systems that can be used to simulate the reasoning of another in order to generate predictions about that person\u2019s other beliefs or likely behavior. On this Nichols & Stich and I agree, and it provides the former the wherewithal to reply to Eric\u2019s critique also. For the \u201cpulling up of beliefs\u201d to draw inferences about another\u2019s beliefs takes place (unconsciously) in the planning systems, and isn\u2019t directly available to the domain-specific system responsible for attributing beliefs to others or to oneself.    \n\nPeter says: \"Unless P is an episodic memory... or unless it is a semantic memory stored, at least in part, in sensory format (e.g. a visual image of a map of Texas), then the only way for P to \u201cjoin with other beliefs, and conclude that Q\u201d is for it to be converted into (say) an episode of inner speech, which will then require interpretation.\"  I don't accept that theory of how the mind works, but even if I did accept that theory, it seems now like Peter is allowing that if P is a \"semantic memory\" stored in partly \"sensory format\" it  can   join with other beliefs to drive the conclusion Q without an intermediate self-interpretative episode.  Or am I misunderstanding the import of his sentence?  If I'm not misunderstanding, then hasn't just given me all I need for this step of my argument?  Let's imagine that \"Armadillo is the capital of Texas\" is stored in partly sensory format (as a visual map of Texas with the word \"Armadillo\" and a star).  Now Peter seems to be allowing that it can drive inferences without requiring an intermediate act of self-interpretation.  So then why not allow it to drive also the conclusion that I believe that Armadillo is the capital?  We're back to the main question of this post, right? \n\nPeter continues: \"This is not to deny that  some   systems in the mind can access beliefs and draw inferences without those beliefs needing to be activated in the global workspace (that is, in working memory). In particular, goal states can initiate searches for information to enable the construction of plans in an \u201cautomatic\u201d, unconscious manner. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the mindreading system can do the same.\"  First, let me note that I agree that the fact that some systems can access stored representations without activating those representations in the global workspace doesn't stricly imply that the mindreading system (if there is a dedicated system, which is part of the issue in dispute) can also do so.  But I do think that if, for a broad range of purposes, we can access these stored beliefs, it would be  odd    if we couldn't do so for the purpose of reaching conclusions about our own minds.  We'd then need a pretty good theory of why we have this special disability with respect to mindreading.  I don't think Peter really offers us as much as we should want to explain this disability. \n\n... which brings me to my second reaction to this quote.  What Peter seems to be presenting as a secondary feature of the mind -- \"the construction of plans in an 'automatic', unconscious manner\" -- is, in my view, the very heart of mentality.  For example, to create inner speech itself, we need to bring together a huge variety of knowledge and skills about language, about the social environment, and about the topic of discourse.  The motor plan or speech plan constructed in this way cannot mostly be driven by considerations that are pulled explicitly into the narrow theater of the \"global workspace\" (which is widely held to host only a small amount of material at a time, consciously experienced).  Our most sophisticated cognition tends to be what happens  before   things hit the global workspace, or even entirely independent of it.  If Peter allows, as I think he must, that that pre-workspace cognition can access beliefs like P, what then remains to be shown to complete my argument is just that these highly sophisticated P-accessing processes can drive the judgment or the representation or the conclusion that I believe that P, just as they can drive many other judgments, representations, or conclusions.  Again, I think the burden of proof should be squarely on Peter to show why this wouldn't be possible. \n Update, February 28  \nPeter responds: Eric writes: \u201cit seems now like Peter is allowing that if P is a \"semantic memory\" stored in partly \"sensory format\" it  can   join with other beliefs to drive the conclusion Q without an intermediate self-interpretative episode.\u201d \n\nI allow that the  content   of sensory-based memory can enter working memory, and so can join with other beliefs to drive a conclusion. But that the content in question is the content of a  memory   rather than a fantasy or supposition requires interpretation. There is nothing about the content of an image as such that identifies it as a memory, and memory images don\u2019t come with tags attached signifying that they are memories. (There is a pretty large body of empirical work supporting this claim, I should say. It isn\u2019t just an implication of the ISA theory.) \n\nEric writes: \u201cBut I do think that if, for a broad range of purposes, we can access these stored beliefs, it would be  odd   if we couldn't do so for the purpose of reaching conclusions about our own minds. We'd then need a pretty good theory of why we have this special disability with respect to mindreading.\u201d \n\nWell, I and others (especially Nichols & Stich in their mindreading book) had provided that theory. The separation between thought-attribution and behavioral prediction is now widely accepted in the literature, with the latter utilizing the subject\u2019s own planning systems, which can in turn access the subject\u2019s beliefs. There is also an increasing body of work suggesting that on-line, unreflective, forms of mental-state attribution are encapsulated from background beliefs. (I make this point at various places in  The Opacity of Mind  . But more recently, see Ian Apperly\u2019s book  Mindreaders  , and my own \u201cMindreading in Infancy\u201d, shortly to appear in  Mind & Language  .) The claim also makes good theoretical sense seen in evolutionary and functional terms, if the mindreading system evolved to track the mental states of others and generate predictions therefrom. From this perspective one might predict that thought-attribution could access a domain-specific database of acquired information (e.g. \u201cperson files\u201d containing previously acquired information about the mental states of others), without being able to conduct free-wheeling searches of memory more generally. \n\nEric writes: \u201cthese highly sophisticated P-accessing processes can drive the judgment or the representation or the conclusion that I believe that P, just as they can drive many other judgments, representations, or conclusions. Again, I think the burden of proof should be squarely on Peter to show why this wouldn't be possible.\u201d \n\nFirst, I concede that it is possible. I merely claim that it isn\u2019t actual. As for the evidence that supports such a claim, there are multiple strands. The most important is evidence that people confabulate about their beliefs and other mental states in just the sorts of circumstances that the ISA theory predicts that they would. (Big chunks of  The Opacity of Mind   are devoted to substantiating this claim.) Now, Eric can  claim   that he, too, can allow for confabulation, since he holds a pluralist account of self-knowledge. But this theory is too underspecified to be capable of  explaining   the data. Saying \u201csometimes we have direct access to our beliefs and sometimes we self-interpret\u201d issues in no predictions about when we will self-interpret. In contrast, other mixed-method theorists such as Nichols & Stich and Alvin Goldman have attempted to specify when one or another method will be employed. But none of these accounts is consistent with the totality of the evidence. The only theory currently on the market that does explain the data is the ISA theory. And this entails that the only access that we have to our own beliefs is sensory-based and interpretive.\n       \nI agree that people can certainly make \" source monitoring  \" and related errors in which genuine memories of external events are confused with merely imagined events.  But it sounds to me like Peter is saying that a stored belief, in order to fulfill its function as a memory rather than a fantasy or supposition must be \"interpreted\" -- and, given his earlier remarks, presumably interpreted in a way that requires activation of that content in the \"global workspace\".  (Otherwise, his main argument doesn't seem to go through.)  I feel like I must be missing something.  I don't see how spontaneous, skillful action that draws together many influences -- for example, in conversational wit -- could realistically be construed as working this way.  Lots of pieces of background knowledge flow together in guiding such responsiveness; they can't all be mediated in the \"global workspace\", which is normally thought to have a very limited capacity.  (See also  Terry Horgan  's recent work on jokes.) \n\nWhether we are looking at visual judgments, memory judgments, social judgments about other people, or judgments about ourselves, the general rule seems to be that the sources are manifold and the mechanisms complex.  \"P, therefore I believe that P\" is far too simple to be the whole story; but so also I think is any single-mechanism story, including Peter's. \n\nI guess Peter and I will have a chance to hammer this out a bit more in person during our  SSPP   session tomorrow!\n\n\n_______________________________________________ \n[note 1]: Usually philosophers believe that it's raining.  Failing that, they believe that snow is white.  I just wanted a change, okay? \n\n[note 2]: Is it really \"inference\" if the solidity of the conclusion doesn't require the solidity of the premises?  I don't see why that should be an essential feature of inferences.  But if you instead want to call it (following Byrne) just an \"epistemic rule\" that you follow, that's okay by me.  \n  \n                       ", "title_html": "<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/03/new-podcast-interview-how-little-thou.html\">New Podcast Interview: How Little Thou Can Know Thyself</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/help-me-choose-posts-for-my-next-book_29.html\">Help Me Choose Posts for My Next Book: Belief, Desire, and Self-Knowledge</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/rationally-speaking-weird-ideas-and.html\">Rationally Speaking: Weird Ideas and Opaque Minds</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/12/is-consciousness-illusion.html\">Is Consciousness an Illusion?</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/11/introspecting-attitude-by-introspecting.html\">Introspecting an Attitude by Introspecting Its Conscious Face</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/susan-schneider-on-how-to-prevent_27.html\">Susan Schneider on How to Prevent a Zombie Dictatorship</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/04/paraphenomenal-experience-conscious.html\">Paraphenomenal Experience: Conscious Experience Uncorrelated with Cognition and Behavior </a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/03/introspective-attention-as-perception.html\">Introspective Attention as Perception with a Twist</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/01/rik-peels-defense-of-reliability-of.html\">Rik Peels' Defense of the Reliability of Introspection</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-intrinsic-value-of-self-knowledge.html\">The Intrinsic Value of Self-Knowledge</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/09/three-kinds-of-transparency-in-self.html\">Three Kinds of Transparency in Self-Knowledge (Or Maybe 1 3/4 Kinds); and How the World Looks If You're Disagreeable</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-negative-pluralist-account-of.html\">A Negative, Pluralist Account of Introspection</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-case-for-pessimism-about-general.html\">A Case for Pessimism about General Theories of Consciousess</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/11/introspecting-my-visual-experience-as.html\">Introspecting My Visual Experience \"as of\" Seeing a Hat?</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-experience-of-reading-imagery-inner.html\">The Experience of Reading: Imagery, Inner Speech, and Seeing the Words on the Page</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-individual-differences-reply-to.html\">The Individual Differences Reply to Introspective Pessimism</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-are-you-noticing-when-you-adjust.html\">What Are You Noticing When You Adjust Your Binoculars?</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/02/an-objection-to-some-accounts-of-self.html\">An Objection to Some Accounts of Self-Knowledge of Attitudes</a>\n</h3> "}

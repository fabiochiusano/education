I wanted to tell a tale in which none of the protagonists are conscious but we care about them anyway -- an interplanetary probe (with some chat algorithms and cute subroutines) and its stuffed monkey doll.<p>\n\nAnother theme is what counts as the extinction or continuation of a sapient species.<p>\n\n------------------------------------------<p>\n<b>Gaze of Robot, Gaze of Bird<p></p></b>\n\nby Eric Schwitzgebel<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Here's something you might think you know about consciousness: It's unified and discrete.<p>\n\nWhen we think about the stream of conscious experience -- the series of conscious thoughts, perceptual experiences, felt emotions, images, etc., that runs through us -- we normally imagine that each person has exactly one such stream.  I have my stream, you have yours.  Even if we entertain very similar ideas (\"the bus is late again!\") each of those ideas belongs determinately to each of our streams of experience.  We share ideas like we might share a personality trait (each having a full version of each idea or trait), not like we share a brownie (each taking half) or a load (each contributing to the mutual support of a single whole).  Our streams of experience may be similar, and we may influence each other, but each stream runs separately without commingling.<p>\n\nLikewise, when we count streams of experience or conscious entities, we stick to whole numbers.  It sounds like a joke to say that there are two and a half or 3.72 streams of conscious experience, or conscious entities, here in this room.  If you and I are in the room with a snail and an anesthesized patient, there are either two conscious entities in the room with two streams of conscious experience (if neither snails nor people in that type of anesthesized state have conscious experiences), or there are three, or there are four.  Even if the anethesized patient is \"half-awake\", being half-awake (or alternatively, dreaming) is to be fully possessed of a stream of experience -- though maybe a hazy stream with confused ideas.  Even if the snail isn't capable of explicit self-representation of itself as a thinker, if there's anything it's like to be a snail, then it has a stream of experience of its own snailish sort, unlike a fern, which (we normally think) has no conscious experiences whatsoever.<p>\n\nI find it hard to imagine how this could be wrong.  And yet I think it might be wrong.<p>\n\nTo start, let's build a slippery slope.  We'll need some science fiction, but nothing too implausible I hope.<p>\n\nAt the top of the slope, we have five conscious human beings, or even better (if you'll allow it) five conscious robots.  At the bottom of the slope we have a fully merged and unified entity with a single stream of conscious experience.  At each step along the way from top to bottom, we integrate the original five entities just a little bit more.  If they are humans, we might imagine growing neural connections, one at a time, between their brains, slowly building cross-connections until the final merged brain is as unified as one could wish.  If necessary, we could slowly remove and reconfigure neurons during the process so that the final merged brain is exactly like a normal human brain.<p>\n\nSince the human brain is a delicate and bloody thing, it will be much more convenient to do this with robots or AI systems, made of silicon chips or some other digital technology, if we are willing to grant that under some conditions a well-designed robot or AI system could have a genuine stream of consciousness.  (As intuitive examples, consider C3P0 from <i>Star Wars</i> or Data from <i>Star Trek</i>.)  Such systems could be slowly linked up, with no messy neurosurgery required, and their bodies (if necessary) slowly joined together.  On the top of the slope will be five conscious robots, on the bottom one conscious robot.<p>\n\nThe tricky bit is in the middle, of course.  Either there must be a sudden shift at exactly one point from five streams of experience to one (or four sudden shifts from exactly 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1), as a result of ever so small a change (a single neural connection), or, alternatively, streams of experience must in some cases not be discretely countable.<p>\n\nTo help consider which of these two possibilities is the more plausible, let's try some toy examples.<p>\n\nYou and me and our friends are discretely different animals with discretely different brains in discretely different skulls, with only one mouth each.  So we are used to thinking of the stream of conscious experience like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nIsdfeMhycU/XEjrZoWlphI/AAAAAAAABWw/1CZCRipDXlYcfakoKdaTUHVWB2c9UGmSgCLcBGAs/s1600/StreamsDiscrete2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1152\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nIsdfeMhycU/XEjrZoWlphI/AAAAAAAABWw/1CZCRipDXlYcfakoKdaTUHVWB2c9UGmSgCLcBGAs/s400/StreamsDiscrete2.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><p>\n\nThe red circles contain what is in our streams of conscious experience -- sometimes similar (A and A', which you and I share), sometimes different (C belongs only to you), all reportable out of our discrete mouths, and all available for the guidance of consciously chosen actions.<p>\n\nHowever, it seems to be only a contingent fact about the biology of Earthly animals that we are designed like this.  An AI system, or an alien, might be designed more like this:<p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QSvk0b3zxW0/XEjvlqbDp7I/AAAAAAAABXI/fos_2ZAM9OwzxJcqimHGFPXFgusBvKGaQCLcBGAs/s1600/StreamsOverlapping.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"562\" data-original-width=\"895\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QSvk0b3zxW0/XEjvlqbDp7I/AAAAAAAABXI/fos_2ZAM9OwzxJcqimHGFPXFgusBvKGaQCLcBGAs/s400/StreamsOverlapping.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><p>\n\nImagine here a complex system with a large pool of representations.  There are five distinct verbal output centers (mouths), or five distinct loci of conscious action (independent arms), each of which draws on some but not all of the pool of representations.  I have included one redundant representation (F) and a pair of contradictory representations (B and -B) to illustrate some of the possible complexity.<p>\n\nIn such a case, we might imagine that there are exactly five streams, though they overlap in some important way.<p>\n\nBut this is still much simpler than it might be.  Now imagine these further complications:<p>\n1. There is no fixed number of mouths or arms over time.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Someday we might meet spacefaring aliens who engage us in (what seems to be) conversation.  Some philosophers -- for example <a href=\"http://cosmos.nautil.us/feature/72/it-may-not-feel-like-anything-to-be-an-alien\">Susan Schneider</a> and (if I may generalize his claims about superficially isomorphic robots to superficially isomorphic aliens) <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/HarderProblem.pdf\">Ned Block</a> -- have argued that such aliens might not really have conscious experiences.  In contrast, I hold what I believe to be the majority view that aliens who outwardly behaved similarly to us would very likely have conscious experiences.  In the phrase that Thomas Nagel <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183914?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\">made famous</a>, there would be \"something it is like\" to be an alien.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E8_rwL6O4Tw/XBK3cdUuz9I/AAAAAAAABRg/1nVW2FS4i3k58Ztmn3YCBVZ0XPWDGoZYACLcBGAs/s1600/alien.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"843\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E8_rwL6O4Tw/XBK3cdUuz9I/AAAAAAAABRg/1nVW2FS4i3k58Ztmn3YCBVZ0XPWDGoZYACLcBGAs/s320/alien.png\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n\nI offer three arguments in defense of this general conclusion.  I stipulate that the aliens I'm considering have arisen through a long evolutionary process, that they are capable of sophisticated cooperative technological behavior, and that they interact with us in ways that it is natural for non-philosophers to interpret as having comprehensible linguistic content.<p>\n\n(I set aside some <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/12/is-most-of-intelligence-in-universe-non.html\">more specific criticisms</a> of Schneider's argument.)<p>\n<i>The Linguistic Argument.</i><p>\n\nAn alien descends from its spaceship.  Upon meeting the local population, it raises an appendage and begins touching things.  It touches its leg and says \"bzzbl\".  It touches its elbow and says \"tikpt\".  It touches a tree and says \"illillin\".  And so forth.  Furthermore, it does so in reliable and repeatable ways, so that this behavior is naturally interpreted as linguistic labeling.  When a human touches a tree and says \"illillin\" the alien says \"hi\".  When a human touches a tree and says \"bzzbl\", the alien says \"pu\".  The pattern of hi/pu responses is naturally interpreted as affirmation and negation.  From this starting point, humans seem to learn the alien language and the alien seems to learn the local human language.  Learning proceeds smoothly, except for a few understandable hiccups, so that after several months, the aliens and the local humans are cooperating in complex activities with apparently complex linguistic understanding.  For example, the alien emits sounds like this: \"After I enjoy eating the oak tree down the road by David's house, I plan to take a half-hour nap at the bottom of Blackberry Pond.  Could we meet to talk about Martian volcanology after I've finished my nap?\"  All proceeds as expected.  The alien eats the tree, takes the nap, and afterwards engages in what appears to be a dicussion of Martian volcanology.  If this was not approximately how things went, the alien would not be the right kind of outwardly similar entity that I have in mind.<p>\n\nTo be outwardly similar -- and also just for good architectural reasons in a risky world -- the alien will also presumably be able to discuss its interior states and perceptual states.  When it is running low on nutrition and needs to eat, it will say something like \"I'm getting hungry\".  When it can't visually detect a distant object that a human interlocutor is pointing out, it will say something like, \"Sorry, I can't see that.  Oh, wait, now I can!\"  When it fears for the safety of its mate who has just wandered onto the highway, it will say something like, \"I'm worried that she might be struck by a car\" or \"I hope she gets across the road okay!\"  Now suppose a human interlocutor says something like, \"Do you really have conscious experiences?  I mean, is there something it's like for you to experience red and to feel pain?  Do you have imagination and understanding and emotional feelings?\"  If the alien is generally similar to us in its linguistic behavior, and if the question is phrased clearly enough, it will say yes.  I think this is plausible given the rest of the set up, but we can also stipulate if necessary that if such an alien said no it wouldn't be a superficial isomorph outwardly similar to us in the intended respect.<p>\n\nAlthough I'm not sure how Schneider and Block would react to this particular case, my interlocutor is someone who thinks it still remains a live possibility that the alien really has no conscious experiences underneath it all, because it has the wrong type of internal structure.  (Maybe it's made of silicon inside, or hydraulics, or maybe it engages in fast serial cognitive processing rather than parallel processing.)  The thought behind the linguistic argument (which I leave undeveloped for now) is that <b>it would be unnatural, awkward, inelegant, and scientifically dubious to interpret the alien's speech as failing to refer both to trees and to genuine conscious mental states that it possesses</b>.<p>\n<i>The Grounds of Consciousness Argument.<p></p></i>\n\nWhat theoretical reasons do we have for thinking that creatures other than us have conscious experiences?  I'm inclined to think we rely on two main grounds: (a.) sophisticated outward behavior similar to outward behavior that we associate with consciousness in our own case, and (b.) structural similarity between the target creature and us, with respect to the types of structures we associate with consciousness in our own case.  By stipulation, (a) favors the alien.  So the question is whether divergence in (b) alone would be good enough grounds to seriously doubt the existence of conscious experience despite seemingly-introspective reports about consciousness.<p>\n\nIf the structural situation is bad enough, that can ground plausible denial.  A remote-controlled puppet with a speaker in its mouth might exhibit sophisticated outward behavior, but we would not want to attribute consciousness to the puppet.  (We might want to attribute consciousness to the puppet-manipulator system or at least to the manipulator.)  Similarly, we might reasonably doubt the consciousness of an entity programmed specifically to act as though it is conscious, even if that entity passes the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/\">Turing test</a> or similar, because there is possibly something suspicious about having such a programming history: Maybe the best explanation of the entity's seeming-consciousness is not that it is conscious but only that it has been programmed to act as though it is.  (I'm not saying I agree with that position, only that it is a reasonable position.)<p>\n\nTo avoid these doubts about the structural story, I have stipulated that the aliens have a long evolutionary history.  The question then becomes whether a naturally-evolved cognitive structure underlying such sophisticated and apparently linguistic behavior might not be sufficient for consciousness, if it is different enough from our own -- such as maybe a fast serial cognitive process rather than the massively parallel (but slowish) structure of neurons, or relying on a material substrate different than carbon.  My intended sense of \"might\" here is not the thin metaphysical sense of \"might\" in which we might allow for <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/\">philosophical zombies</a>, but rather scientific plausibility.<p>\n\nA good approach to this question, I think, is to consider <i>what it is </i>about neurons aligned in massively parallel structures that explains why such neurons give rise to consciousness in our case.  There must be something functionally awesome about neurons; it's not likely to be mysterious carbon-magic, independent of what neurons can do for us cognitively.  So what could be that functionally awesome thing?  The most plausible answers are the kinds of answers we see in broadly functionalist approaches to consciousness -- things like the ability to integrate information so as to respond in various sophisticated ways to the environment, including retaining information over time, monitoring one's own cognitive condition, complex long-term strategic planning, being capable of creative solutions to novel predicaments, etc.  <b>If serial processing or silicon processing can do all of the right kind of cognitive work, it's hard for me to see good theoretical reason to think that something necessary may be missing due merely to, say, the different number of protons in silicon or the implementational details of transfer relations between different cognitive subprocesses.</b>  It's a possible skepticism, but it's a skepticism without warranted grounds for doubt.<p>\n<i>The Copernican Cosmological Argument.<p></p></i>\n\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle\">Copernican Principle</a> in scientific cosmology, we are unlikely to be in a privileged position in the universe, such as its exact center.  It's more reasonable, according to the principle, to think that we are in mediocre, mid-rent location among all of the locations that possibly support observers capable of reflection about cosmological principles.  (However, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle\">Anthropic Principle</a> allows that we shouldn't be surprised to be in a location that supports cosmological observers, even if such locations are uncommon.  For purposes of this post I am assuming that being an \"observer\" requires cognitive sophistication but does not require phenomenal consciousness if the two are separable.  We can argue about that in the comments, if you like!)<p>\n\nThe Copernican Principle can, I think, plausibly be applied to consciousness as follows.  Stipulate, as seems plausible, that complex coordinated functional responsiveness to one's environment, comparable to the sophistication of human responsiveness, can evolve in myriad different ways that diverge in their internal structural basis (e.g., carbon vs non-carbon, or if carbon is essential because of its lovely capacity to form long organic molecules, highly divergent carbon-based systems).  If only one or a few of these myriad ways gave rise to actual conscious experience, then we would be especially lucky to be among the minority of complex evolved seemingly-linguistic entities who are privileged with genuine conscious experience.  There would be systems all across the universe who equally build cities, travel into space, write novels about their interactions with each other, and monitor and report their internal states in ways approximately as sophisticated as ours -- and among them, only a fraction would happen to possess conscious experience, while the other unfortunates are merely blank inside.<p>\n<b>It is much more plausible, on Copernican grounds, to think that we are not in this way especially privileged entities, lucky to be among the minority of evolved intelligences who happen also to have conscious experiences.</b><p> \n\n[<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/naTVuGXzfOJ3ovrES08i3qGsqt1j0jROsINT75tq9cSASpEi-bt1C0MsFjAZ680N04vvVrQR-gLpslf4VMYgWkicQg=s0\">image source</a>]\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/2018/09/11/guest-post-eric-schwitzgebel-gives-one-point-five-cheers-for-a-hugo-award-for-a-tv-show-about-ethicists-moral-expertise/\">cross-posted</a> at <a href=\"http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/\">Kittywumpus</a>]<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5nZsAbBSKk/W5lddWu-TcI/AAAAAAAABEQ/Q8yWEODkRsMDE9FM8HuevArrfQN3wrEYQCLcBGAs/s1600/GoodTrolleyProblem.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5nZsAbBSKk/W5lddWu-TcI/AAAAAAAABEQ/Q8yWEODkRsMDE9FM8HuevArrfQN3wrEYQCLcBGAs/s320/GoodTrolleyProblem.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n\nWhen <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6951978/\"><i>The Good Place</i> episode \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</a> won one of science fiction\u2019s most prestigious awards, the Hugo, in the category of best dramatic presentation, short form, I celebrated. I celebrated not because I loved the episode (in fact, I had so far only seen a couple of The Good Place\u2019s earlier episodes) but because, as a philosophy professor aiming to build bridges between academic philosophy and popular science fiction, the awarding of a Hugo to a show starring a professor of philosophy discussing a famous philosophical problem seemed to confirm that science fiction fans see some of the same synergies I see between science fiction and philosophy.<p>\n\nI do think the synergies are there and that the fans see and value them \u2013 as also revealed by the enduring popularity of The Matrix, and by West World, and Her, and Black Mirror, among others \u2013 but \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d, considered as a free-standing episode, fumbles the job. (Below, I will suggest a twist by which The Good Place could redeem itself in later episodes.)<p>\n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to be fussy when maybe I should just cheer and praise. And I\u2019m going to take the episode more philosophically seriously than maybe I should, treating it as not just light humor. But taking good science fiction philosophically seriously is important to me \u2013 and that means engaging critically. So here we go.<p>\n<i>The Philosophical Trolley Problem</i><p>\n\nThe trolley problem \u2013 the classic academic philosophy version of the trolley problem \u2013 concerns a pair of scenarios.<p>\n\nIn one scenario, the Switch case, you are standing beside a railroad track watching a runaway railcar (or \u201ctrolley\u201d) headed toward five people it will surely kill if you do nothing. You are standing by a switch, however, and you can flip the switch to divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. Unfortunately, there is one person on the side track who will be killed if you divert the trolley. Question: Should you flip the switch?<p>\n\nIn another scenario, the Push case, you are standing on a footbridge when you see the runaway railcar headed toward the five people. In this case, there is no switch. You do, however, happen to be standing beside a hiker with a heavy backpack, who you could push off the bridge into the path of the trolley, which will then grind to a halt on his body, killing him and saving the five. (You are too light to stop the trolley with your own body.) He is leaning over the railing, heedless of you, so you could just push him over. Question: Should you push the hiker?<p>\n\nThe interesting thing about these problems is that most people say it\u2019s okay to flip the switch in Switch but not okay to push the hiker in Push, despite the fact that in both cases you appear to be killing one person to save five. Is there really a meaningful difference between the cases? If so, what is it? Or are our ordinary intuitions about one or the other case wrong?<p>\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely puzzle, much, much debated in academic philosophy, often with intricate variations on the cases. (Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">one of my papers about it</a>.)<p>\n<i>The Problem with \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\n\u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d episode nicely sets up some basic trolley scenarios, adding also a medical case of killing one to save five (an involuntary organ donor). The philosophy professor character, Chidi, is teaching the material to the other characters.<p>\n\nSpoilers coming.<p>\n\nThe episode stumbles by trying to do two conflicting things.<p>\n\nFirst, it seizes the trope of the philosophy professor who can\u2019t put his theories into practice. The demon Michael sets up a simulated trolley, headed toward five victims, with Chidi at the helm. Chidi is called on to make a fast decision. He hesitates, agonizing, and crashes into the five. Micheal reruns the scenario with several variations, and it\u2019s clear that Chidi, faced with a practical decision requiring swift action, can\u2019t actually figure out what\u2019s best. (However, Chidi is clear that he wouldn\u2019t cut up a healthy patient in an involuntary organ donor case.)<p>\n\nSecond, incompatibly, the episode wants to affirm Chidi\u2019s moral expertise. Michael, the demon who enjoys torturing humans, can\u2019t seem to take Chidi\u2019s philosophy lessons seriously, despite Chidi\u2019s great knowledge of ethics. Michael tries to win Chidi\u2019s favor by giving him a previously unseen notebook of Kant\u2019s, but Chidi, with integrity that I suppose the viewer is expected to find admirable, casts the notebook aside, seeing it as a bribe. What Chidi really wants is for Michael to recognize his moral expertise. At the climax of the episode, Michael seems to do just this, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.</blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from within the episode whether we are supposed to regard Michael as sincere. Maybe not. Regardless, the viewer is invited to think that it\u2019s what Michael should say, what his attitude should be \u2013 and Chidi accepts the apology.<p>\n\nBut this resolution hardly fits with Chidi\u2019s failure in actual ethical decision making in the moment (a vice he also reveals in other episodes). Chidi has abstract, theoretical knowledge about ethical quandaries such as the trolley problem, and he is in some ways the most morally admirable of the lead characters, but his failure in vividly simulated trolley cases casts his practical ethical expertise into doubt. Nothing in the episode satisfactorily resolves that practical challenge to Chidi\u2019s expertise, pro or con.<p>\n<i>Ethical Expertise?</i><p>\n\nNow, as it happens, I am the world\u2019s leading expert on the ethical behavior of professional ethicists. (Yes, really. Admittedly, the <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">competition is limited</a>.)<p>\n\nThe one thing that shows most clearly from my and others\u2019 work on this topic, and which is anyway pretty evident if you spend much time around professional ethicists, is that ethicists, on average, behave more or less similarly to other people of similar social background \u2013 not especially better, not especially worse. From the fact that Chidi is a professor of ethics, nothing in particular follows about his moral behavior. Often, indeed, expertise in philosophical ethics appears to become expertise in constructing <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">post-hoc intellectual rationales for what you were inclined to do anyway</a>.<p>\n\nI hope you will agree with me about the following, concerning the philosophy of philosophy: Real ethical understanding is not a matter of what words you speak in classroom moments. It\u2019s a matter of what you choose and what you do habitually, regardless of whether you can tell your friends a handsome story about it, grounded in your knowledge of Kant. It\u2019s not clear that Chidi does have especially good ethical understanding in this practical sense. Moreover, to the extent Chidi does have some such practical ethical understanding, as a somewhat morally admirable person, it is not in virtue of his knowledge of Kant.<p>\n\nMichael should not be so deferential to Chidi\u2019s expertise, and especially he should not be deferential on the basis of Chidi\u2019s training as a philosopher. If, over the seasons, the characters improve morally, it is, or should be, because they learn from the practical situations they find themselves in, not because of Chidi\u2019s theoretical lessons.<p>\n<i>How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\nThus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics).<p>\n\nWhen the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.overthinkingit.com/2017/10/23/the-good-place-unlocked-season-2-episode-6-the-trolley-problem/\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Update, October 21, 2018:</i><p>\n\nWisecrack has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds\">terrific treatment of the philosophy of <i>The Good Place</i></a>, revealing that the show has a more nuanced view of the role of ethics lessons than one might infer from treating \"The Trolley Problem\" as a stand-alone work.

Did you say SUNGLASSES?!\"<p>\n\nSpeaking of hyperminds....<p>\n\nI want to distinguish two ways of being a group mind, since <strike>I know you care immensely about the cognitive architecture of group minds</strike> I'm a dork.  My thought is that the philosophical issues of group consciousness and personal identity play out differently in the two types of case.<p>\n<i>\nSynchronic:</i><p>\n\nExamples: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Star Trek's Borg</a> (mostly), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Justice\">Ann Leckie's ancillaries</a>, highly interconnected nations (<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">according to me</a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep\">Vernor Vinge's tines</a>.<p>\n\nSynchronic group minds are probably the default conception.  A bunch of independent, or semi-independent, or independent-enough entities remain in constant or constant-enough communication with each other.  Their communication is sufficiently rich or sufficiently well structured that it gives rise to group-level mental states in the whole.  In the most interesting case, the individual entities are distinct enough to have rich mental lives but also the group is well enough coordinated that it also, simultaneously, has a distinctive, rich mental life above and beyond that of its members.<p>\n<i>Diachronic:</i><p>\n\nExamples: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln_People\">David Brin's Kiln People</a>, <a href=\"https://socialecologies.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/linda-negata-the-bohr-maker/\">Linda Nagata's ghosts</a>, <a href=\"http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/meltwater/\">Benjamin Kinney's forks</a>.<p>\n\nIn a diachronic group mind, communication is relatively rare but high bandwidth and transformative.  Post-communication, the individuals inherit mental states from the others.  In the most interesting case, the inheritance process is very different from just listening credulously to someone's testimony; rather it's more like a direct transfer of memories, plans, and opinions, maybe even values or personality.  Imagine \"forking\" into three versions of yourself, going your separate ways for the day, and then at the end of the day merging back into a single individual, integrating the memories and plans of each, and averaging any general changes in value, opinion, or personality.  Tomorrow and every day thereafter, you will fork and merge in the same way.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mC2tLnP5OB0/W0addm2naSI/AAAAAAAAA70/oyiSxK9d9wI3tfnRi_HUWsUi21BMZ_i3QCLcBGAs/s1600/Cerberus-Blake.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"725\" data-original-width=\"1024\" height=\"227\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mC2tLnP5OB0/W0addm2naSI/AAAAAAAAA70/oyiSxK9d9wI3tfnRi_HUWsUi21BMZ_i3QCLcBGAs/s320/Cerberus-Blake.jpeg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[Cerberus might not be integrated enough to be a good example of a group mind, but I didn't want to attach another darn picture of the Borg.]<p>\n<i>Tradeoffs Between Group-Level and Individual-Level Personhood and Autonomy:</i><p>\n\nAs I have described it here, delay between information transfer episodes is the fundamental difference between these types of group minds: whether the minds are in constant or constant-enough communication, or whether instead they communicate only at long intervals.  Obviously, temporal distance admits of degree, but this difference in degree creates structural pressures.  If communication is infrequent, its effects have to be radical if it is to give rise to an entity sufficiently integrated to be worth calling a \"group mind\".  If every day group of friends meets to exchange information and plan the next day's activities, in the ordinary way people sometimes do this, I suppose that in some weak sense they have formed a group mind.  But they haven't done so in the radical science-fictional sense I'm imagining.  For example, if there were five friends who did this, there would still be exactly five <i>persons </i>-- entities with serious rights whose destruction would we worth calling murder.  For the emergence of something more metaphysically and morally interesting, the exchange has to be radical enough to challenge the boundaries of personal identity.<p>\n\nConversely, if communication is constant <i>and </i>its effects are radical, it's not clear that we have a group of individuals in any interesting sense: We might just have a single non-group entity that happens to be spatially scattered (as in my <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/05/martian-rabbit-superorganisms-yeah.html\">Martian Smartspiders</a>).<p>\n\nIn other words, to be a philosophically-interesting group entity there must be some sort of interestingly autonomous mentality both at the individual level and at the group level.  Massive transformative communication (as in diachronic merging of memories and values) radically reduces autonomy: If communication is both massively transformative and very frequent, there's no chance for interesting person-like autonomy at the individual level.  If communication is neither massively transformative nor very frequent, there's no chance for interesting person-like autonomy at the group level.<p>\n<i>Consciousness:</i><p>\n\nOur intuitive judgments about group-level consciousness are probably pretty crappy (as I've argued <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">here</a>).  But our general theories about consciousness as they apply to the group level are probably even crappier (as I've argued <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/07/tononis-exclusion-postulate-would-make.html\">here</a>).  At the same time, whether the group as a whole has a stream of conscious experience over and above the consciousness of its individual members seems like a very important question if we're interested in its mentality and whether it deserves moral status as a person.  So we're kind of stuck.  We'll have to guess.<p>\n\nPlausibly, in the diachronic case there is no stream of consciousness beyond that of the merging individuals.  When there's one body at night, there's one stream of consciousness (at most, if it's dreaming).  When there are three bodies off doing their thing, there are three streams of consciousness.  We might be able to create some problematic boundary cases during the merge, but maybe that's marginal enough to dismiss with a bit of hand waving.<p>\n\nThe synchronic case is, I think, more conceptually challenging with respect to consciousness.  If we allow that minimally interactive groups do not give rise to group level consciousness and we also allow that a fully informationally integrated but spatially distributed entity does give rise to consciousness, it seems that we can create a <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/slippery-slope-arguments-and-discretely.html\">slippery slope</a> from one case to the other by adding more integration and communication (for example <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/group-minds-on-ringworld.html\">here</a>).  At some point, if there is enough coherent behavior, self-representation, and information exchange at the group level, most standard functionalist views of consciousness (unless they accept an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nesting_principle\">anti-nesting principle</a>) should allow that each individual member of the group would have a stream of experience and also that there would be a further, different stream of experience at the group level. \n But it's a tricky question how much integration and information exchange, and with what kind of structural properties, is necessary for group-level consciousness to arise.<p>\n<i>Personhood:</i><p>\n\nOne interesting issue that arises is the extent to which an individual's <i>beliefs </i>about what counts as \"self-interest\" and \"death\" define the boundaries of their personhood.  Consider a diachronic case: You are walking back home after your day out and about town, with a wallet full of money and interesting new information about a job opportunity tomorrow, and you are about to merge back together with the two other entities you forked off from this morning.  Is this death?  Are \"you\" going to be gone after the merge, your memories absorbed into some entity who is not you (but who you might care about even more than you care about yourself)?  In walking back, are you magnanimously sacrificing your life to give your money and information to the entity who will exist tomorrow?  Would it be more in your self-interest to run away and blow your wad on something fun for this current body?  Or, instead, will it still be \"you\" tomorrow, post-merge, with that information and that money?  To some extent, in unclear cases of this sort, I think it might depend on how you think and feel about it: It's to some extent <i>up to you</i> whether to conceptualize the merging together as death or not.<p>\n\nA parallel issue might arise with synchronic groups, though my hunch is that it would play out differently.  Synchronic groups, as I'm imagining them, don't have identity-threatening splits and merges.  The individual members of synchronic groups would seem to have the same types of rights that otherwise similar individuals who aren't members of synchronic group minds would have -- rights depending on (for example, but it's not this simple) their capacity to suffer and think and choose as individuals.  They might choose, <i>as individuals</i>, to view the group welfare as much more important than their own welfare (as a soldier might choose to die for sake of country); but unless there's some real loss of autonomy or consciousness, this doesn't threaten their status as persons or redefine the boundaries of what counts as death.<p>\n<i>\nRelated:</i><p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/05/possible-architectures-of-group-minds.html\">Possible Architectures of Group Minds: Perception (May 4, 2016)</a><p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/possible-architectures-of-group-minds.html\">Possible Architectures of Group Minds: Memory</a> (Jun 14, 2016)<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/group-minds-on-ringworld.html\">Group Minds on Ringworld</a> (Oct 24, 2012)<p>\n<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious</a> (academic essay in <i>Philosophical Studies,</i> 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/03/our-moral-duties-to-monsters.html\">Our Moral Duties to Monsters</a> (Mar 8, 2014)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/08/choosing-to-be-that-fellow-back-then.html\">Choosing to Be That Fellow Back Then: Voluntarism about Personal Identity</a> (Aug 20, 2016).<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights2.htm\">New paper</a> in draft!<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KrtXW9r1OO0/WnSre4e2gFI/AAAAAAAAAp8/qMcUWqg2ESU4Ab2LkJxxVGxgbDrB_oKsgCLcBGAs/s1600/artificial-intelligence-2167835_960_720.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"642\" data-original-width=\"960\" height=\"134\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KrtXW9r1OO0/WnSre4e2gFI/AAAAAAAAAp8/qMcUWqg2ESU4Ab2LkJxxVGxgbDrB_oKsgCLcBGAs/s200/artificial-intelligence-2167835_960_720.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\nAbstract:<p>\n\nWe propose four policies of ethical design of human-grade Artificial Intelligence.  Two of our policies are precautionary.  Given substantial uncertainty both about ethical theory and about the conditions under which AI would have conscious experiences, we should be cautious in our handling of cases where different moral theories or different theories of consciousness would produce very different ethical recommendations.  Two of our policies concern respect and freedom.  If we design AI that deserves moral consideration equivalent to that of human beings, that AI should be designed with self-respect and with the freedom to explore values other than those we might selfishly impose.  We are especially concerned about the temptation to create human-grade AI pre-installed with the desire to cheerfully sacrifice itself for its creators\u2019 benefit.<p>\n\nFull version <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights2.htm\">here</a>.\n\nAs always, comments and critical discussion welcome, either by email to me or as comments on this post.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/photos/artificial%20intelligence/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Today marks the third year since the death of my father, Kirkland Gable.

I now better understand than I once did why the ancient Confucian tradition recommends three years' mourning for one's parents.

Among his many maladies, he suffered from severe <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Complex-Regional-Pain-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet\">Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome</a> in one foot, which meant that he was in constant pain which would be seriously aggravated, sometimes for weeks, from even mild exertion, such as ten minutes' walking, or jostling the foot too much during sleep or while in a wheelchair.  It was, I believe, ultimately the CRiPS that killed him, through the side effects of long-term narcotics and the bodily harm from spending years almost immobile in bed.<p>\n\nI have often wished, during his final years, that we could have freed him from his horrible bed.  I've tried this in imagination many times, attempting to write it up as a science fiction story.  But the story never seems to come out right.  Today, instead of the story I can't yet write, let me discuss a technological innovation that I think would be interesting for people who are bedridden.<p>\n\nThe core idea is simple and would be easy to implement.  Probably, it is already being implemented somewhere.  (Links and info welcome!)  <b>Equip an able-bodied volunteer, the \"Host\", with a camera above each eye and a microphone by each ear.  Equip the bedridden person, the \"Rider\", with VR gear that immersively presents these audiovisual stimuli to Rider's eyes and ears.  Also equip Rider with a microphone to speak with Host</b>, directly into Host's ear.  Now send Host on a trip.  <b>During this trip, let Host be guided mainly by Rider's expressed desires</b>, going where Rider wants, looking where Rider wants to look, stopping and listening where Rider wants to stop and listen.  Unlike VR tours as they currently exist, Host can interact with and alter the environment in real time.  Rider could have Host lift a flower and turn it in their hands, then cast the flower into a stream and watch it drift away.  Host could purchase goods or services on Rider's behalf.  Host could conduct a conversation through Rider, interacting with locals by having Rider speak Host's words verbatim.<p>\n\n(In the psychology literature, speaking the words of another immediately upon hearing them quietly projected into your ear is called \"<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/136216880100500203\">conversational shadowing</a>\".  In his career as a psychologist, my father was involved in some early shadowing studies.  Shadowing can be surprisingly fast and smooth once one gets the hang of it, with utterances almost simultaneous as the host half-anticipates the rider's next word.)<p>\n\nA more ambitious Host-Rider setup would employ VR gloves.  As I imagine it, <b>Rider and Host wear matching gloves.  These gloves are synchronized to move in exactly the same way</b> -- of course with quick escape overrides and perhaps with Rider's motions damped down to prevent overextension or bumping into unseen obstacles near the bed.  This would take some excellent technological chicanery with good motion tracking (Nintendo Wii, improved) and some way of restricting or guiding the movements of the gloves on each end, perhaps using magnetic fields, so that when Rider wants to move a hand on vector W and Host wants to move it on vector V, the result is some compromise vector (barring safety override).  An intuitive collaboration would be necessary between Rider and Host, and gentle, predictable movements.  With practice, I think it would not be unfeasible, at least in safe and simple environments, for Rider to feel as though it is almost <i>their</i> hands that are moving in the virtual environment.  This could be further enhanced with tactile feedback -- that is, if pressure sensors in Host's gloves communicated with actuators in Rider's gloves that exerted corresponding pressures in corresponding locations.<p>\n\n(Here, compare the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_transfer_illusion\">Rubber Hand or Body Transfer Illusion</a>.  I have been a participant in some body transfer experiments and have informally conducted others at home with friends and family.  It is amazing how flexible one's sense of one's bodily shape, position, and boundaries can be, given suggestive feedback!)<p>\n\nA final, expensive, risky, and much more conjectural step here -- probably a step too far -- would involve equipping Host and Rider with helmets with brain-imaging technology and the capacity for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation\">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a> (or some other ability to directly stimulate or suppress brain activity).  For example, for <b>a fuller tactile experience, activity in Host's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex\">primary somatosensory cortex</a> could be tracked, and a vague, faint echo of it could be stimulated in matching areas in Rider's cortex</b>.  One wouldn't want too much synchrony, and anyhow brains differ somewhat in their organizational structure, even in fairly similarly structured regions like somatosensory cortex.   Also, of course, you wouldn't want much motor signal going down through efferent nerves into the Rider's body, making Rider move around in the bed.  Also, current brain imaging technologies, even if we imagine portable versions of them, wouldn't be spatiotemporally sharp enough to do a proper job of it.  But still, a dim, vague signal <i>might</i> be very suggestive for an otherwise well-harmonized, collaborative Host and Rider, in a rich environmental context with very clear cues and expectations.<p>\n\nI won't conjecture about, say, attempting to match activity in emotional regions or associative cortex.  Conjecturing about a high degree of match between different people's brains is both neurophysiologically unrealistic and possibly too threatening to the autonomy of Host and Rider -- though of course there are dark, interesting, far-future science-fictional possibilities there.<p>\n\nLet's bracket, then, this last conjectural step with brain imaging and brain stimulation, and focus just on the VR experience with audiovisual input, shadowing, and matching-motion gloves -- all in a positive, harmonious, and non-exploitative relationship with a host.  I think that would be pretty cool, and near- to medium-term technologically achievable.  If it plays out right, it might give some bedridden people a chance to explore the world beyond their bed in a much more vivid, engaging, and interactive manner.<p>\n\nMy father was both a psychologist and an inventor.  In 1995, when he was first diagnosed with cancer, he had been wanting to go to Hong Kong, and he had to cancel the trip to attempt a bone marrow transplant.  He never did make it to Hong Kong.  I wish I could bring him back, build some of this technology with him, then take him there.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[Edit Oct. 28: After discussion with friends and commenters in social media, I now think that the thesis should be moderated in two ways.  First, before direct mood control becomes common in the workplace, it probably first needs to become voluntarily common at home; and thus it will probably take more than 25 years.  Second, it seems likely that in many (most?) cases the direct control will remain in the employee's hands, though there will likely be coercive pressure from the employer to use it as the employer expects.  (Thanks to everyone for their comments!)]<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBKmfmeEQt8/WfIxkOjIeRI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RWPwdvEKCXstFOa-7oxpEkf6ngGb6GHLQCLcBGAs/s1600/braincontrol.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"629\" data-original-width=\"564\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBKmfmeEQt8/WfIxkOjIeRI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RWPwdvEKCXstFOa-7oxpEkf6ngGb6GHLQCLcBGAs/s320/braincontrol.jpg\" width=\"287\"/></a></div><p>\n\nHere's the argument:<p>\n\n(1.) In 25 years, employers will have the technological capacity to directly control their employees' moods.<p>\n\n(2.) Employers will not refrain from exercising that capacity.<p>\n\n(3.) Most working-age adults will be employees.<p>\n\n(4.) Therefore, in 25 years, most working-age adults will have employers who directly control their moods.<p>\n\nThe argument is valid in the sense that the conclusion (4) follows if all of the premises are true.<p>\n<b>Premise 1 seems plausible</b>, given current technological trajectories.  Control could be either pharmacological or via direct brain stimulation.  Pharmacological control could, for example, be through pills that directly influence your mood, energy levels, ability to concentrate, feeling of submissiveness, or passion for the type of task at hand.  Direct brain stimulation could be through a removable <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/home/ovc-20163795\">TMS helmet</a> that magnetically stimulates and suppresses neural activity in different brain regions, or with some more invasive technology.  McDonald's might ask its cashiers to tweak their dials toward perky friendliness.  Data entry centers might ask their temp workers to tweak their dials toward undistractable focus.  Brothels might ask their strippers to tweak their dials toward sexual arousal.<p>\n\nContra Premise 1, society might collapse, of course, or technological growth could stall or proceed much more slowly.  If it's just slower, then we can replace \"25 years\" with 50 or 100 and retain the rest of the argument.  It seems unlikely that moods are too complex or finicky to be subject to fairly precise technological control, given how readily they can be influenced by low-tech means.<p>\n\nI don't know to what extent people in Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and elite universities already use high-tech drugs to enhance alertness, energy, and concentration at work.  That might already be a step down this road.  Indeed, coffee might partly be seen this way too, especially if you use it to give your all to work, and then collapse in exhaustion when the caffeine wears off and you arrive home.  My thought is that in a few decades the interventions might be much more direct, effective, and precisely targeted.<p>\n<b>Premise 2 also seems plausible</b>, given the relative social power of employers vs. employees.  As long as there's surplus labor and a scarcity of desirable jobs, then employers will have some choice about whom to hire.  If Starbucks has a choice between Applicant A who is willing to turn up the perky-friendly dial and otherwise similar Applicant B who is not so willing, then they will presumably tend to prefer Applicant A.  If the Silicon Valley startup wants an employee who will crank out intense 16-hour days one after the next, and the technology is available for people to do so by directly regulating their moods, energy levels, focus, and passion, then the people who take that direct control, for their employers' benefit, will tend to win the competition for positions.  If Stanford wants to hire the medical researcher who is publishing article after article, they'll find the researcher who dialed up her appetite for work and dialed down everything else.<p>\n\nEmployees might yield control directly to the employer: The TMS dials might be in the boss's office, or the cafeteria lunch might include the pharmacological cocktail of the day.  Alternatively, employees might keep the hand on the dial themselves, but experience substantial pressure to manipulate it in the directions expected by the employer.  If that pressure is high enough and effective enough, then it comes to much the same thing.  (My guess is that lower-prestige occupations (the majority) would yield control directly to the employer, while higher-prestige occupations would retain the sheen of self-control alongside very effective pressure to use that \"self-control\" in certain ways.)<p>\n\nContra Premise 2, (a.) collective bargaining might prevent employers from successfully demanding direct mood control; or (b.) governmental regulations might do so; or (c.) there might be a lack of surplus labor.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (a): The historical trend recently, at least in the U.S., has been against unionization and collective bargaining, though I guess that could change.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (b): Although government regulations could forbid certain drugs or brain technologies, if there's enough demand for those drugs or technologies, employees will find ways to use them (unless enforcement gets a lot of resources, as in professional sports).  Government regulations could specifically forbid employers from requiring that their employees use certain technologies, while permitting such technologies for private use.  (No TMS helmets on the job.)  But enforcement might again be difficult; and private use vs. use as an employee is a permeable line for the increasing number of jobs that involve working outside of a set time and location.  Also, it's easier to regulate a contractual demand than an informal de facto demand.  Presumably many companies could say that of course they don't <i>require </i>their employees to use such technologies.  It's up to the employee!  But if the technology delivers as promised, the employees who \"voluntarily choose\" to have their moods directly regulated will be more productive and otherwise behave as the company desires, and thus be more attractive to retain and promote.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (c): At present there's no general long-term trend toward a shortage of labor; and at least for jobs seen as highly desirable, there will always be more applicants than available positions.<p>\n<b>Premise 3 also seems plausible</b>, especially on a liberal definition of \"employee\".  Most working-age adults (in Europe and North America) are currently employees of one form or another.  That could change substantially with the \"gig economy\" and more independent contracting, but not necessarily in a way that takes the sting out of the main argument.  Even if an Uber driver is technically not an employee, the pressures toward direct mood control for productivity ought to be similar.  Likewise for computer programmers and others who do piecework as independent contractors.  If anything, the pressures may be higher, with less security of income and fewer formal workplace regulations.<p>\n\nThinking about Premises 1-3, I find myself drawn to the conclusion that my children's and grandchildren's employers are likely to have a huge amount of coercive control over their moods and passions.<p>\n\n-------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/what-would-or-should-you-do-with.html\">What Would (or Should) You Do with Administrator Access to Your Mind?</a>\" (guest post by Henry Shevlin, Aug 16, 2017).<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/misp.12034/abstract\">Crash Space</a>\" (a short story by R.

Reynolds has written up a fun, vivid summary of my talk at Oxford Brookes last spring, on fiction writing for philosophers!<p>\n\n-----------------------------------<p>\n\nEric Schwitzgebel has a pleasingly liberal view of what constitutes philosophy. A philosopher is anyone wrestling with the \u201cbiggest picture framing issues\u201d of... well, anything.<p>\n\nIn a keynote session at the Fiction Writing for Philosophers Workshop that was held at Oxford Brookes University in June 2017, Schwitzgebel, Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside, shared his advice\u2013which he stated would be both practical and impractical.<p>\n\nSchwitzgebel tells us of a leading coiffeur who styles himself as a \u201cPhilosopher of Hair\u201d. We laugh \u2013 but there\u2019s something in this \u2013 the vagary, the contingency in favoured forms of philosophical output. And it\u2019s not just hairdressers that threaten to encroach upon the Philosophy Department\u2019s turf. Given that the foundational issues in any branch of science or art are philosophical in nature, it follows that most people \u201cdoing\u201d philosophy today aren\u2019t professional philosophers.<p>\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXG_Ju8hljI/WekqVa31D0I/AAAAAAAAAcI/_i-NSRx-K7Aj5vl63Z9FQ_z2H564JOoUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Hair.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"155\" data-original-width=\"307\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXG_Ju8hljI/WekqVa31D0I/AAAAAAAAAcI/_i-NSRx-K7Aj5vl63Z9FQ_z2H564JOoUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Hair.jpg\"/></a><p>\n\nThere are a host of ways one could go about doing philosophy, but of late a consensus has emerged amongst those that write articles for academic journals: the only proper way to \u201cdo\u201d philosophy is by writing articles for academic journals. Is it time to re-stock the tool shed? Philosophical nuts come in all shapes and sizes; yet contemporary attempts to crack them are somewhat monotone.<p>\n\nAs Schwitzgebel wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0719-schwitzgebel-philosophy-articles-20150717-story.html\">Los Angeles Times op-ed piece</a>:\n\n<blockquote>Too exclusive a focus on technical journal articles excludes non-academics from the dialogue \u2014 or maybe, better said, excludes us philosophers from non-academics\u2019 more important dialogue.</blockquote><p>\n\n[Hugh's account of my talk <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2017/10/18/practical-and-impractical-advice-for-philosophers-writing-fiction/\">continues here</a>.]<p>\n\n\n-----------------------------------<p>\n\nThanks also to Helen De Cruz for setting up the talk and to Skye Cleary for finding a home for Hugh's account on the APA blog.<p>\n\n[image detail from APA Blog]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Abstract:<p>\n\nI defend a how-possibly argument for Kantian (or Kant*-ian) transcendental idealism, drawing on concepts from David Chalmers, Nick Bostrom, and the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. If we are artificial intelligences living in a virtual reality instantiated on a giant computer, then the fundamental structure of reality might be very different than we suppose. Indeed, since computation does not require spatial properties, spatiality might not be a feature of things as they are in themselves but instead only the way that things necessarily appear to us. It might seem unlikely that we are living in a virtual reality instantiated on a non-spatial computer. However, understanding this possibility can help us appreciate the merits of transcendental idealism in general, as well as transcendental idealism's underappreciated skeptical consequences.<p>\n\nFull essay <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KantMeetsCyberpunk.htm\">here</a>.<p>\n\nAs always, I welcome comments, objections, and discussion either as comments on this post or by email to my UCR email address.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[The following is adapted from my advice to aspiring writers of philosophical fiction at the <a href=\"https://www.brookes.ac.uk/hpc/research/philosophy-through-fiction/\">Philosophy Through Fiction workshop</a> at Oxford Brookes last June.]<p>\n\nI have a <a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/schwitzgebel_09_17/\">new science fiction story</a> out this month in <i>Clarkesworld</i>.  I'm delighted!  Clarkesworld is one of my favorite magazines and a terrific location for thoughtful speculative fiction.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xJNWnII1B7o/WbgL2fxNhnI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/RxuLoudnk34hM1Iub1nl67EdUU6erBKdACLcBGAs/s1600/Galaxy-cassiopeia.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"974\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xJNWnII1B7o/WbgL2fxNhnI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/RxuLoudnk34hM1Iub1nl67EdUU6erBKdACLcBGAs/s320/Galaxy-cassiopeia.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<p>\n\nHowever, I doubt that you'll like my story.  I don't say this out of modesty or because I think this story is especially unlikable.  I say it partly to help defuse expectations: Please feel free not to like my story!  I won't be offended.  But I say it too, in this context, because I think it's important for writers to remind themselves regularly of one possibly somewhat disappointing fact: <i>Most people don't like most fiction.</i>  So most people are probably not going to like <i>your</i> fiction -- no matter how wonderful it is.<p>\n\nIn fiction, so much depends on taste.  Even the very best, most famous fiction in the world is disliked by most people.  I can't stand Ernest Hemingway or George Eliot.  I don't dispute that they were great writers -- just not my taste, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Similarly, most people don't like most poetry, no matter how famous or awesome it is.  And most people don't like most music, when it's not in a style that suits them.<p>\n\nA few stories do appear to be enjoyed by almost everyone who reads them (\"<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/2015/04/20/ep490-flowers-for-algernon/\">Flowers for Algernon</a>\"? \"<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/2012/05/17/ep345-the-paper-menagerie/\">The Paper Menagerie</a>\"?), but those are <i>peak stories of great writers' careers</i>.  To expect even a very good story by an excellent writer to achieve almost universal likability is like hearing that a philosopher has just put out a new book and then expecting it to be as beloved and influential as <i>Naming and Necessity</i>.<p>\n\nEven if someone likes your expository philosophy, they probably won't like your fiction.  The two types of writing are so different!  Even someone who enjoys philosophically-inspired fiction probably won't like your fiction in particular.  Too many other parameters of taste also need to align.  They'll find your prose style too flowery or too dry, your characters too flat or too cartoonishly clever, your plot too predictable or too confusing, your philosophical elements too heavy-handed or too understated....<p>\n\nI draw two lessons.<p>\n\nFirst lesson: Although you probably want your friends, family, and colleagues to enjoy your work, and some secret inner part of you might <i>expect </i>them to enjoy it (because it's so wonderful!), it's best to suppress that desire and expectation.  You need to learn to expect indifference without feeling disappointed.  It's like expecting your friends and family and colleagues to like your favorite band.  Almost none of them will -- even if some part of you screams out \"of course everyone should love this song it's so great!\"  Aesthetic taste doesn't work like that.  <i>It's perfectly fine if almost no one you know you likes your writing.</i>  They shouldn't feel bad about that, and you shouldn't feel bad about that.<p>\n\nSecond lesson: Write for the people who will like it.  Sometimes one hears the advice that you should \"just write for yourself\" and forget the potential audience.  I can see how this might be good advice if the alternative is to try to please everyone, which will never succeed and might along the way destroy what is most distinctive about your voice and style.  However, I don't think that advice is quite right, for most writers.  If you really are just writing for yourself -- well, isn't that what diaries are for?  If you're only writing for yourself you needn't think about comprehensibility, since of course <i>you </i>understand everything.  If you're only writing for yourself, you needn't think about suspense, since of course <i>you</i> know what's going to happen.  And so forth.  The better advice here is <i>write for the 10%</i>.  Maybe 10% of the people around you have tastes similar enough to your own that there's a chance that your story will please them.  They are your target audience.  Your story needn't be comprehensible to everyone, but it should be comprehensible to them.  Your story needn't work intellectually and emotionally for everyone, but you should try to make it work intellectually and emotionally for them.<p>\n\nWhen sending your story out for feedback, ignore the feedback of the 90%, and treasure the feedback of the 10%.  Don't try to implement every change that everyone recommends, or even the majority of changes.  Most people will never like the story that you would write.  You wouldn't want your favorite punk band taking aesthetic advice from your country-music loving uncle.  But listen intently to the 10%, to the readers who are almost there, the ones who have the <i>potential </i>to love your story but don't quite love it yet.  They are the ones to listen to.  Make it great for them, and forget everyone else.<p>\n\n[Cross-posted at <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2017/09/12/writing-for-the-ten-percent/\">The Blog of the APA</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>guest post by</p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mxmQExzW1I/WX-wfj-1xPI/AAAAAAAAAR8/afPDls3aHVodmoDyXwn-uZzq9yBw0CY5ACLcBGAs/s1600/asimovscoverr.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1178\" data-original-width=\"776\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mxmQExzW1I/WX-wfj-1xPI/AAAAAAAAAR8/afPDls3aHVodmoDyXwn-uZzq9yBw0CY5ACLcBGAs/s320/asimovscoverr.jpg\" width=\"211\"/></a></div><p>\n\nIn 2014, as a beginning writer of science fiction or speculative fiction, with no idea what magazines were well regarded in the industry, I decided to compile <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-top-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html\">a ranked list of magazines</a> based on awards and \"best of\" placements in the previous ten years.  Since people seemed to find it useful or interesting, I've been <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/SFranking.htm\">updating it annually</a>. Below is my list for 2017.<p>\n<i>Method and Caveats:</i><p>\n\n(1.) Only magazines are included (online or in print), not anthologies or standalones.<p>\n\n(2.) I gave each magazine one point for each story nominated for a <a href=\"http://www.thehugoawards.org/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sfwa.org/nebula-awards/\">Nebula</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eugiefoster.com/eugieaward\">Eugie</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.worldfantasy.org/\">World Fantasy Award</a> in the past ten years; one point for each story appearance in any of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250119243/\">Dozois</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blackgate.com/2016/11/23/prime-books-reveals-the-contents-of-the-years-best-science-fiction-and-fantasy-2017-edited-by-rich-horton/\">Horton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781085625/\">Strahan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597808962\">Clarke</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544555201\">Adams</a> \"Year's Best\" anthologies; and half a point for each story appearing in the short story or novelette category of the annual <a href=\"http://www.locusmag.com/News/2017/01/2016-locus-recommended-reading-list/\">Locus Recommended list</a>.<p>\n\n(3.) I am <b>not attempting to include the horror / dark fantasy genre</b>, except as it appears incidentally on the list.<p>\n\n(4.) <b>Prose only</b>, not poetry.<p>\n\n(5.) I'm <b>not attempting to correct for frequency of publication</b> or length of table of contents.<p>\n\n(6.) I'm also <b>not correcting for a magazine's only having published during part of the ten-year period</b>.  Reputations of defunct magazines slowly fade, and sometimes they are restarted.  Reputations of new magazines take time to build.<p>\n\n(7.) Lists of this sort do tend to <b>reinforce the prestige hierarchy</b>.  I have mixed feelings about that.  But since the prestige hierarchy is socially real, I think it's in people's best interest -- especially the best interest of outsiders and newcomers -- if it is common knowledge.<p>\n\n(8.) I take the list down to 1.5 points.<p>\n\n(9.) I welcome <b>corrections</b>.<p>\n\n(10.)

The camera rose, swiveling on its joint, compiling initial scans of the planetary surface. Second, six wheels on struts, pop-pop, pop-pop, pop-pop, and a platform unfolding between the main body and the eye. Third, an atmospheric taster and wind gauge. Fourth, a robotic arm. The arm emerged holding a fluffy, resilient, nanocarbon monkey doll, which it carefully set on the platform.<p>\n\nThe monkey doll had no actuators, no servos, no sensors, no cognitive processors. Monkey was, however, quite huggable. Monkey lay on his back on the warm platform, his black bead eyes pointed up toward the stars. He had traveled wadded near J11-L\u2019s core for ninety-five thousand years. His arms, legs, and tail lay open and relaxed for the first time since his hurried manufacture.<p>\n\nJ11-L sprouted more eyes, more arms, more gauges\u2014also stabilizers, ears, a scoop, solar panels, soil sensors, magnetic whirligigs. Always, J11-L observed Monkey more closely than anything else, leaning its eyes and gauges in.<p>\n\nJ11-L arranged Monkey\u2019s limbs on the platform, gently flexing and massaging the doll. J11-L scooped up a smooth stone from near its left front wheel, brushed it clean, then wedged it under Monkey\u2019s head to serve as a pillow. J11-L stroked and smoothed Monkey\u2019s fur, which was rumpled from the long journey.<p>\n\n\u201cI love you, Monkey,\u201d emitted J11-L, in a sound resembling language. \u201cWill you stay with me while I build a Home?\u201d<p>\n\nMonkey did not reply.<p>\n\n\n[story continues <a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/schwitzgebel_04_19/\">here</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/04/gaze-of-robot-gaze-of-bird.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2019-04-02T09:02:00-07:00\">9:02 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6503294038186157035\" onclick=\"\">2\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/announcements\" rel=\"tag\">announcements</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, January 24, 2019</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4749952461109758766\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/01/how-to-turn-five-discrete-streams-of.html\">How to Turn Five Discrete Streams of Consciousness into a Murky Commingling Bog</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Here's something you might think you know about consciousness: It's unified and discrete.<p>\n\nWhen we think about the stream of conscious experience -- the series of conscious thoughts, perceptual experiences, felt emotions, images, etc., that runs through us -- we normally imagine that each person has exactly one such stream.  I have my stream, you have yours.  Even if we entertain very similar ideas (\"the bus is late again!\") each of those ideas belongs determinately to each of our streams of experience.  We share ideas like we might share a personality trait (each having a full version of each idea or trait), not like we share a brownie (each taking half) or a load (each contributing to the mutual support of a single whole).  Our streams of experience may be similar, and we may influence each other, but each stream runs separately without commingling.<p>\n\nLikewise, when we count streams of experience or conscious entities, we stick to whole numbers.  It sounds like a joke to say that there are two and a half or 3.72 streams of conscious experience, or conscious entities, here in this room.  If you and I are in the room with a snail and an anesthesized patient, there are either two conscious entities in the room with two streams of conscious experience (if neither snails nor people in that type of anesthesized state have conscious experiences), or there are three, or there are four.  Even if the anethesized patient is \"half-awake\", being half-awake (or alternatively, dreaming) is to be fully possessed of a stream of experience -- though maybe a hazy stream with confused ideas.  Even if the snail isn't capable of explicit self-representation of itself as a thinker, if there's anything it's like to be a snail, then it has a stream of experience of its own snailish sort, unlike a fern, which (we normally think) has no conscious experiences whatsoever.<p>\n\nI find it hard to imagine how this could be wrong.  And yet I think it might be wrong.<p>\n\nTo start, let's build a slippery slope.  We'll need some science fiction, but nothing too implausible I hope.<p>\n\nAt the top of the slope, we have five conscious human beings, or even better (if you'll allow it) five conscious robots.  At the bottom of the slope we have a fully merged and unified entity with a single stream of conscious experience.  At each step along the way from top to bottom, we integrate the original five entities just a little bit more.  If they are humans, we might imagine growing neural connections, one at a time, between their brains, slowly building cross-connections until the final merged brain is as unified as one could wish.  If necessary, we could slowly remove and reconfigure neurons during the process so that the final merged brain is exactly like a normal human brain.<p>\n\nSince the human brain is a delicate and bloody thing, it will be much more convenient to do this with robots or AI systems, made of silicon chips or some other digital technology, if we are willing to grant that under some conditions a well-designed robot or AI system could have a genuine stream of consciousness.  (As intuitive examples, consider C3P0 from <i>Star Wars</i> or Data from <i>Star Trek</i>.)  Such systems could be slowly linked up, with no messy neurosurgery required, and their bodies (if necessary) slowly joined together.  On the top of the slope will be five conscious robots, on the bottom one conscious robot.<p>\n\nThe tricky bit is in the middle, of course.  Either there must be a sudden shift at exactly one point from five streams of experience to one (or four sudden shifts from exactly 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1), as a result of ever so small a change (a single neural connection), or, alternatively, streams of experience must in some cases not be discretely countable.<p>\n\nTo help consider which of these two possibilities is the more plausible, let's try some toy examples.<p>\n\nYou and me and our friends are discretely different animals with discretely different brains in discretely different skulls, with only one mouth each.  So we are used to thinking of the stream of conscious experience like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nIsdfeMhycU/XEjrZoWlphI/AAAAAAAABWw/1CZCRipDXlYcfakoKdaTUHVWB2c9UGmSgCLcBGAs/s1600/StreamsDiscrete2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1152\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nIsdfeMhycU/XEjrZoWlphI/AAAAAAAABWw/1CZCRipDXlYcfakoKdaTUHVWB2c9UGmSgCLcBGAs/s400/StreamsDiscrete2.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><p>\n\nThe red circles contain what is in our streams of conscious experience -- sometimes similar (A and A', which you and I share), sometimes different (C belongs only to you), all reportable out of our discrete mouths, and all available for the guidance of consciously chosen actions.<p>\n\nHowever, it seems to be only a contingent fact about the biology of Earthly animals that we are designed like this.  An AI system, or an alien, might be designed more like this:<p>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QSvk0b3zxW0/XEjvlqbDp7I/AAAAAAAABXI/fos_2ZAM9OwzxJcqimHGFPXFgusBvKGaQCLcBGAs/s1600/StreamsOverlapping.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"562\" data-original-width=\"895\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QSvk0b3zxW0/XEjvlqbDp7I/AAAAAAAABXI/fos_2ZAM9OwzxJcqimHGFPXFgusBvKGaQCLcBGAs/s400/StreamsOverlapping.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><p>\n\nImagine here a complex system with a large pool of representations.  There are five distinct verbal output centers (mouths), or five distinct loci of conscious action (independent arms), each of which draws on some but not all of the pool of representations.  I have included one redundant representation (F) and a pair of contradictory representations (B and -B) to illustrate some of the possible complexity.<p>\n\nIn such a case, we might imagine that there are exactly five streams, though they overlap in some important way.<p>\n\nBut this is still much simpler than it might be.  Now imagine these further complications:<p>\n1. There is no fixed number of mouths or arms over time.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n2. The region of the representational pool that a mouth or arm can access isn't fixed over time.\n3. The region of the representational pool that a mouth or arm can access isn't sharp-boundaried but is instead a probability function, where representations functionally nearer to the mouth or arm are very likely to be accessible for reporting or action, and representations far from the mouth or arm are unlikely to be accessible, with a smooth gradation between.<p>\n\nThis picture aims to capture some of the features described:<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PsTst_jrl60/XEj403bXBGI/AAAAAAAABXg/rqtqILvSPc45g8AJ7QvoZyk13GZrl7qUgCLcBGAs/s1600/StreamsIndistinct03.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"500\" data-original-width=\"769\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PsTst_jrl60/XEj403bXBGI/AAAAAAAABXg/rqtqILvSPc45g8AJ7QvoZyk13GZrl7qUgCLcBGAs/s400/StreamsIndistinct03.png\" width=\"400\"/></a><p>\nThink of each color as a functional subsystem.  Each color's density outside the oval is that system's likelihood, at any particular time, of being available for speech or action in that direction.  Each color's density inside the oval is the likelihood of representations in that region being available to that subsystem for speech or action guidance.  With a rainbow of colors, we needn't limit ourselves to a discretely countable number of subsystems.  The figure also might fluctuate over time, if the probabilities aren't static.<p>\n\nIn at least the fluctuating rainbow case, I submit, countability and discreteness fail.  Yet it is a conceivable architecture -- a possible instantiation of an intermediate case along our slippery slope.  If such an entity could host consciousness, and if consciousness is closely related to its fluctuating rainbow a structural/functional features, then the entity's stream(s) of conscious experience cannot be effectively represented with whole numbers.  (Maybe we could try with multidimensional vectors.)<p>\n\nIs this too wild?  Well, it's not inconceivable that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Other-Minds-Octopus-Origins-Consciousness/dp/0374227764\">octopus consciousness</a> has some features in this direction (if octopi are conscious), given the distribution of their cognition across their arms; or that some overlap occurs in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/magazine/could-conjoined-twins-share-a-mind.html\">unseparated craniopagus twins</a> joined at the head and brain; or even -- reading<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661\"> Daniel Dennett</a> in a certain way -- that we ourselves are structured not as differently from this as we normally suppose.<p>\n\n----------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-two-seater-homunculus.html\">A Two-Seater Homunculus</a> (Apr 1, 2013);<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/how-to-be-part-of-gods-mind.html\">How to Be a Part of God's Mind</a> (Apr 23, 2014);<p>\n<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious</a> (<i>Philosophical Studies,</i> 2015);<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/09/are-garden-snails-conscious-yes-no-or.html\">Are Garden Snails Conscious?

Some philosophers -- for example <a href=\"http://cosmos.nautil.us/feature/72/it-may-not-feel-like-anything-to-be-an-alien\">Susan Schneider</a> and (if I may generalize his claims about superficially isomorphic robots to superficially isomorphic aliens) <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/HarderProblem.pdf\">Ned Block</a> -- have argued that such aliens might not really have conscious experiences.  In contrast, I hold what I believe to be the majority view that aliens who outwardly behaved similarly to us would very likely have conscious experiences.  In the phrase that Thomas Nagel <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183914?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\">made famous</a>, there would be \"something it is like\" to be an alien.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E8_rwL6O4Tw/XBK3cdUuz9I/AAAAAAAABRg/1nVW2FS4i3k58Ztmn3YCBVZ0XPWDGoZYACLcBGAs/s1600/alien.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"843\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E8_rwL6O4Tw/XBK3cdUuz9I/AAAAAAAABRg/1nVW2FS4i3k58Ztmn3YCBVZ0XPWDGoZYACLcBGAs/s320/alien.png\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n\nI offer three arguments in defense of this general conclusion.  I stipulate that the aliens I'm considering have arisen through a long evolutionary process, that they are capable of sophisticated cooperative technological behavior, and that they interact with us in ways that it is natural for non-philosophers to interpret as having comprehensible linguistic content.<p>\n\n(I set aside some <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/12/is-most-of-intelligence-in-universe-non.html\">more specific criticisms</a> of Schneider's argument.)<p>\n<i>The Linguistic Argument.</i><p>\n\nAn alien descends from its spaceship.  Upon meeting the local population, it raises an appendage and begins touching things.  It touches its leg and says \"bzzbl\".  It touches its elbow and says \"tikpt\".  It touches a tree and says \"illillin\".  And so forth.  Furthermore, it does so in reliable and repeatable ways, so that this behavior is naturally interpreted as linguistic labeling.  When a human touches a tree and says \"illillin\" the alien says \"hi\".  When a human touches a tree and says \"bzzbl\", the alien says \"pu\".  The pattern of hi/pu responses is naturally interpreted as affirmation and negation.  From this starting point, humans seem to learn the alien language and the alien seems to learn the local human language.  Learning proceeds smoothly, except for a few understandable hiccups, so that after several months, the aliens and the local humans are cooperating in complex activities with apparently complex linguistic understanding.  For example, the alien emits sounds like this: \"After I enjoy eating the oak tree down the road by David's house, I plan to take a half-hour nap at the bottom of Blackberry Pond.  Could we meet to talk about Martian volcanology after I've finished my nap?\"  All proceeds as expected.  The alien eats the tree, takes the nap, and afterwards engages in what appears to be a dicussion of Martian volcanology.  If this was not approximately how things went, the alien would not be the right kind of outwardly similar entity that I have in mind.<p>\n\nTo be outwardly similar -- and also just for good architectural reasons in a risky world -- the alien will also presumably be able to discuss its interior states and perceptual states.  When it is running low on nutrition and needs to eat, it will say something like \"I'm getting hungry\".  When it can't visually detect a distant object that a human interlocutor is pointing out, it will say something like, \"Sorry, I can't see that.  Oh, wait, now I can!\"  When it fears for the safety of its mate who has just wandered onto the highway, it will say something like, \"I'm worried that she might be struck by a car\" or \"I hope she gets across the road okay!\"  Now suppose a human interlocutor says something like, \"Do you really have conscious experiences?  I mean, is there something it's like for you to experience red and to feel pain?  Do you have imagination and understanding and emotional feelings?\"  If the alien is generally similar to us in its linguistic behavior, and if the question is phrased clearly enough, it will say yes.  I think this is plausible given the rest of the set up, but we can also stipulate if necessary that if such an alien said no it wouldn't be a superficial isomorph outwardly similar to us in the intended respect.<p>\n\nAlthough I'm not sure how Schneider and Block would react to this particular case, my interlocutor is someone who thinks it still remains a live possibility that the alien really has no conscious experiences underneath it all, because it has the wrong type of internal structure.  (Maybe it's made of silicon inside, or hydraulics, or maybe it engages in fast serial cognitive processing rather than parallel processing.)  The thought behind the linguistic argument (which I leave undeveloped for now) is that <b>it would be unnatural, awkward, inelegant, and scientifically dubious to interpret the alien's speech as failing to refer both to trees and to genuine conscious mental states that it possesses</b>.<p>\n<i>The Grounds of Consciousness Argument.<p></p></i>\n\nWhat theoretical reasons do we have for thinking that creatures other than us have conscious experiences?  I'm inclined to think we rely on two main grounds: (a.) sophisticated outward behavior similar to outward behavior that we associate with consciousness in our own case, and (b.) structural similarity between the target creature and us, with respect to the types of structures we associate with consciousness in our own case.  By stipulation, (a) favors the alien.  So the question is whether divergence in (b) alone would be good enough grounds to seriously doubt the existence of conscious experience despite seemingly-introspective reports about consciousness.<p>\n\nIf the structural situation is bad enough, that can ground plausible denial.  A remote-controlled puppet with a speaker in its mouth might exhibit sophisticated outward behavior, but we would not want to attribute consciousness to the puppet.  (We might want to attribute consciousness to the puppet-manipulator system or at least to the manipulator.)  Similarly, we might reasonably doubt the consciousness of an entity programmed specifically to act as though it is conscious, even if that entity passes the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/\">Turing test</a> or similar, because there is possibly something suspicious about having such a programming history: Maybe the best explanation of the entity's seeming-consciousness is not that it is conscious but only that it has been programmed to act as though it is.  (I'm not saying I agree with that position, only that it is a reasonable position.)<p>\n\nTo avoid these doubts about the structural story, I have stipulated that the aliens have a long evolutionary history.  The question then becomes whether a naturally-evolved cognitive structure underlying such sophisticated and apparently linguistic behavior might not be sufficient for consciousness, if it is different enough from our own -- such as maybe a fast serial cognitive process rather than the massively parallel (but slowish) structure of neurons, or relying on a material substrate different than carbon.  My intended sense of \"might\" here is not the thin metaphysical sense of \"might\" in which we might allow for <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/\">philosophical zombies</a>, but rather scientific plausibility.<p>\n\nA good approach to this question, I think, is to consider <i>what it is </i>about neurons aligned in massively parallel structures that explains why such neurons give rise to consciousness in our case.  There must be something functionally awesome about neurons; it's not likely to be mysterious carbon-magic, independent of what neurons can do for us cognitively.  So what could be that functionally awesome thing?  The most plausible answers are the kinds of answers we see in broadly functionalist approaches to consciousness -- things like the ability to integrate information so as to respond in various sophisticated ways to the environment, including retaining information over time, monitoring one's own cognitive condition, complex long-term strategic planning, being capable of creative solutions to novel predicaments, etc.  <b>If serial processing or silicon processing can do all of the right kind of cognitive work, it's hard for me to see good theoretical reason to think that something necessary may be missing due merely to, say, the different number of protons in silicon or the implementational details of transfer relations between different cognitive subprocesses.</b>  It's a possible skepticism, but it's a skepticism without warranted grounds for doubt.<p>\n<i>The Copernican Cosmological Argument.<p></p></i>\n\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle\">Copernican Principle</a> in scientific cosmology, we are unlikely to be in a privileged position in the universe, such as its exact center.  It's more reasonable, according to the principle, to think that we are in mediocre, mid-rent location among all of the locations that possibly support observers capable of reflection about cosmological principles.  (However, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle\">Anthropic Principle</a> allows that we shouldn't be surprised to be in a location that supports cosmological observers, even if such locations are uncommon.  For purposes of this post I am assuming that being an \"observer\" requires cognitive sophistication but does not require phenomenal consciousness if the two are separable.  We can argue about that in the comments, if you like!)<p>\n\nThe Copernican Principle can, I think, plausibly be applied to consciousness as follows.  Stipulate, as seems plausible, that complex coordinated functional responsiveness to one's environment, comparable to the sophistication of human responsiveness, can evolve in myriad different ways that diverge in their internal structural basis (e.g., carbon vs non-carbon, or if carbon is essential because of its lovely capacity to form long organic molecules, highly divergent carbon-based systems).  If only one or a few of these myriad ways gave rise to actual conscious experience, then we would be especially lucky to be among the minority of complex evolved seemingly-linguistic entities who are privileged with genuine conscious experience.  There would be systems all across the universe who equally build cities, travel into space, write novels about their interactions with each other, and monitor and report their internal states in ways approximately as sophisticated as ours -- and among them, only a fraction would happen to possess conscious experience, while the other unfortunates are merely blank inside.<p>\n<b>It is much more plausible, on Copernican grounds, to think that we are not in this way especially privileged entities, lucky to be among the minority of evolved intelligences who happen also to have conscious experiences.</b><p> \n\n[<a href=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/naTVuGXzfOJ3ovrES08i3qGsqt1j0jROsINT75tq9cSASpEi-bt1C0MsFjAZ680N04vvVrQR-gLpslf4VMYgWkicQg=s0\">image source</a>]\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/12/three-arguments-for-alien-consciousness.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-12-14T08:50:00-08:00\">8:50 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=9172025981533174922\" onclick=\"\">19\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, September 12, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7022839094017605819\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/09/one-point-five-cheers-for-hugo-award.html\">One-Point-Five Cheers for a Hugo Award for a TV Show about Ethicists\u2019 Moral Expertise</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/2018/09/11/guest-post-eric-schwitzgebel-gives-one-point-five-cheers-for-a-hugo-award-for-a-tv-show-about-ethicists-moral-expertise/\">cross-posted</a> at <a href=\"http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/\">Kittywumpus</a>]<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5nZsAbBSKk/W5lddWu-TcI/AAAAAAAABEQ/Q8yWEODkRsMDE9FM8HuevArrfQN3wrEYQCLcBGAs/s1600/GoodTrolleyProblem.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5nZsAbBSKk/W5lddWu-TcI/AAAAAAAABEQ/Q8yWEODkRsMDE9FM8HuevArrfQN3wrEYQCLcBGAs/s320/GoodTrolleyProblem.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n\nWhen <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6951978/\"><i>The Good Place</i> episode \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</a> won one of science fiction\u2019s most prestigious awards, the Hugo, in the category of best dramatic presentation, short form, I celebrated. I celebrated not because I loved the episode (in fact, I had so far only seen a couple of The Good Place\u2019s earlier episodes) but because, as a philosophy professor aiming to build bridges between academic philosophy and popular science fiction, the awarding of a Hugo to a show starring a professor of philosophy discussing a famous philosophical problem seemed to confirm that science fiction fans see some of the same synergies I see between science fiction and philosophy.<p>\n\nI do think the synergies are there and that the fans see and value them \u2013 as also revealed by the enduring popularity of The Matrix, and by West World, and Her, and Black Mirror, among others \u2013 but \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d, considered as a free-standing episode, fumbles the job. (Below, I will suggest a twist by which The Good Place could redeem itself in later episodes.)<p>\n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to be fussy when maybe I should just cheer and praise. And I\u2019m going to take the episode more philosophically seriously than maybe I should, treating it as not just light humor. But taking good science fiction philosophically seriously is important to me \u2013 and that means engaging critically. So here we go.<p>\n<i>The Philosophical Trolley Problem</i><p>\n\nThe trolley problem \u2013 the classic academic philosophy version of the trolley problem \u2013 concerns a pair of scenarios.<p>\n\nIn one scenario, the Switch case, you are standing beside a railroad track watching a runaway railcar (or \u201ctrolley\u201d) headed toward five people it will surely kill if you do nothing. You are standing by a switch, however, and you can flip the switch to divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. Unfortunately, there is one person on the side track who will be killed if you divert the trolley. Question: Should you flip the switch?<p>\n\nIn another scenario, the Push case, you are standing on a footbridge when you see the runaway railcar headed toward the five people. In this case, there is no switch. You do, however, happen to be standing beside a hiker with a heavy backpack, who you could push off the bridge into the path of the trolley, which will then grind to a halt on his body, killing him and saving the five. (You are too light to stop the trolley with your own body.) He is leaning over the railing, heedless of you, so you could just push him over. Question: Should you push the hiker?<p>\n\nThe interesting thing about these problems is that most people say it\u2019s okay to flip the switch in Switch but not okay to push the hiker in Push, despite the fact that in both cases you appear to be killing one person to save five. Is there really a meaningful difference between the cases? If so, what is it? Or are our ordinary intuitions about one or the other case wrong?<p>\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely puzzle, much, much debated in academic philosophy, often with intricate variations on the cases. (Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">one of my papers about it</a>.)<p>\n<i>The Problem with \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\n\u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d episode nicely sets up some basic trolley scenarios, adding also a medical case of killing one to save five (an involuntary organ donor). The philosophy professor character, Chidi, is teaching the material to the other characters.<p>\n\nSpoilers coming.<p>\n\nThe episode stumbles by trying to do two conflicting things.<p>\n\nFirst, it seizes the trope of the philosophy professor who can\u2019t put his theories into practice. The demon Michael sets up a simulated trolley, headed toward five victims, with Chidi at the helm. Chidi is called on to make a fast decision. He hesitates, agonizing, and crashes into the five. Micheal reruns the scenario with several variations, and it\u2019s clear that Chidi, faced with a practical decision requiring swift action, can\u2019t actually figure out what\u2019s best. (However, Chidi is clear that he wouldn\u2019t cut up a healthy patient in an involuntary organ donor case.)<p>\n\nSecond, incompatibly, the episode wants to affirm Chidi\u2019s moral expertise. Michael, the demon who enjoys torturing humans, can\u2019t seem to take Chidi\u2019s philosophy lessons seriously, despite Chidi\u2019s great knowledge of ethics. Michael tries to win Chidi\u2019s favor by giving him a previously unseen notebook of Kant\u2019s, but Chidi, with integrity that I suppose the viewer is expected to find admirable, casts the notebook aside, seeing it as a bribe. What Chidi really wants is for Michael to recognize his moral expertise. At the climax of the episode, Michael seems to do just this, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.</blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from within the episode whether we are supposed to regard Michael as sincere. Maybe not. Regardless, the viewer is invited to think that it\u2019s what Michael should say, what his attitude should be \u2013 and Chidi accepts the apology.<p>\n\nBut this resolution hardly fits with Chidi\u2019s failure in actual ethical decision making in the moment (a vice he also reveals in other episodes). Chidi has abstract, theoretical knowledge about ethical quandaries such as the trolley problem, and he is in some ways the most morally admirable of the lead characters, but his failure in vividly simulated trolley cases casts his practical ethical expertise into doubt. Nothing in the episode satisfactorily resolves that practical challenge to Chidi\u2019s expertise, pro or con.<p>\n<i>Ethical Expertise?</i><p>\n\nNow, as it happens, I am the world\u2019s leading expert on the ethical behavior of professional ethicists. (Yes, really. Admittedly, the <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">competition is limited</a>.)<p>\n\nThe one thing that shows most clearly from my and others\u2019 work on this topic, and which is anyway pretty evident if you spend much time around professional ethicists, is that ethicists, on average, behave more or less similarly to other people of similar social background \u2013 not especially better, not especially worse. From the fact that Chidi is a professor of ethics, nothing in particular follows about his moral behavior. Often, indeed, expertise in philosophical ethics appears to become expertise in constructing <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">post-hoc intellectual rationales for what you were inclined to do anyway</a>.<p>\n\nI hope you will agree with me about the following, concerning the philosophy of philosophy: Real ethical understanding is not a matter of what words you speak in classroom moments. It\u2019s a matter of what you choose and what you do habitually, regardless of whether you can tell your friends a handsome story about it, grounded in your knowledge of Kant. It\u2019s not clear that Chidi does have especially good ethical understanding in this practical sense. Moreover, to the extent Chidi does have some such practical ethical understanding, as a somewhat morally admirable person, it is not in virtue of his knowledge of Kant.<p>\n\nMichael should not be so deferential to Chidi\u2019s expertise, and especially he should not be deferential on the basis of Chidi\u2019s training as a philosopher. If, over the seasons, the characters improve morally, it is, or should be, because they learn from the practical situations they find themselves in, not because of Chidi\u2019s theoretical lessons.<p>\n<i>How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\nThus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics).<p>\n\nWhen the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.overthinkingit.com/2017/10/23/the-good-place-unlocked-season-2-episode-6-the-trolley-problem/\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Update, October 21, 2018:</i><p>\n\nWisecrack has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds\">terrific treatment of the philosophy of <i>The Good Place</i></a>, revealing that the show has a more nuanced view of the role of ethics lessons than one might infer from treating \"The Trolley Problem\" as a stand-alone work.

Did you say SUNGLASSES?!\"<p>\n\nSpeaking of hyperminds....<p>\n\nI want to distinguish two ways of being a group mind, since <strike>I know you care immensely about the cognitive architecture of group minds</strike> I'm a dork.  My thought is that the philosophical issues of group consciousness and personal identity play out differently in the two types of case.<p>\n<i>\nSynchronic:</i><p>\n\nExamples: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Star Trek's Borg</a> (mostly), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Justice\">Ann Leckie's ancillaries</a>, highly interconnected nations (<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">according to me</a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep\">Vernor Vinge's tines</a>.<p>\n\nSynchronic group minds are probably the default conception.  A bunch of independent, or semi-independent, or independent-enough entities remain in constant or constant-enough communication with each other.  Their communication is sufficiently rich or sufficiently well structured that it gives rise to group-level mental states in the whole.  In the most interesting case, the individual entities are distinct enough to have rich mental lives but also the group is well enough coordinated that it also, simultaneously, has a distinctive, rich mental life above and beyond that of its members.<p>\n<i>Diachronic:</i><p>\n\nExamples: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln_People\">David Brin's Kiln People</a>, <a href=\"https://socialecologies.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/linda-negata-the-bohr-maker/\">Linda Nagata's ghosts</a>, <a href=\"http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/meltwater/\">Benjamin Kinney's forks</a>.<p>\n\nIn a diachronic group mind, communication is relatively rare but high bandwidth and transformative.  Post-communication, the individuals inherit mental states from the others.  In the most interesting case, the inheritance process is very different from just listening credulously to someone's testimony; rather it's more like a direct transfer of memories, plans, and opinions, maybe even values or personality.  Imagine \"forking\" into three versions of yourself, going your separate ways for the day, and then at the end of the day merging back into a single individual, integrating the memories and plans of each, and averaging any general changes in value, opinion, or personality.  Tomorrow and every day thereafter, you will fork and merge in the same way.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mC2tLnP5OB0/W0addm2naSI/AAAAAAAAA70/oyiSxK9d9wI3tfnRi_HUWsUi21BMZ_i3QCLcBGAs/s1600/Cerberus-Blake.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"725\" data-original-width=\"1024\" height=\"227\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mC2tLnP5OB0/W0addm2naSI/AAAAAAAAA70/oyiSxK9d9wI3tfnRi_HUWsUi21BMZ_i3QCLcBGAs/s320/Cerberus-Blake.jpeg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[Cerberus might not be integrated enough to be a good example of a group mind, but I didn't want to attach another darn picture of the Borg.]<p>\n<i>Tradeoffs Between Group-Level and Individual-Level Personhood and Autonomy:</i><p>\n\nAs I have described it here, delay between information transfer episodes is the fundamental difference between these types of group minds: whether the minds are in constant or constant-enough communication, or whether instead they communicate only at long intervals.  Obviously, temporal distance admits of degree, but this difference in degree creates structural pressures.  If communication is infrequent, its effects have to be radical if it is to give rise to an entity sufficiently integrated to be worth calling a \"group mind\".  If every day group of friends meets to exchange information and plan the next day's activities, in the ordinary way people sometimes do this, I suppose that in some weak sense they have formed a group mind.  But they haven't done so in the radical science-fictional sense I'm imagining.  For example, if there were five friends who did this, there would still be exactly five <i>persons </i>-- entities with serious rights whose destruction would we worth calling murder.  For the emergence of something more metaphysically and morally interesting, the exchange has to be radical enough to challenge the boundaries of personal identity.<p>\n\nConversely, if communication is constant <i>and </i>its effects are radical, it's not clear that we have a group of individuals in any interesting sense: We might just have a single non-group entity that happens to be spatially scattered (as in my <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/05/martian-rabbit-superorganisms-yeah.html\">Martian Smartspiders</a>).<p>\n\nIn other words, to be a philosophically-interesting group entity there must be some sort of interestingly autonomous mentality both at the individual level and at the group level.  Massive transformative communication (as in diachronic merging of memories and values) radically reduces autonomy: If communication is both massively transformative and very frequent, there's no chance for interesting person-like autonomy at the individual level.  If communication is neither massively transformative nor very frequent, there's no chance for interesting person-like autonomy at the group level.<p>\n<i>Consciousness:</i><p>\n\nOur intuitive judgments about group-level consciousness are probably pretty crappy (as I've argued <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">here</a>).  But our general theories about consciousness as they apply to the group level are probably even crappier (as I've argued <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/07/tononis-exclusion-postulate-would-make.html\">here</a>).  At the same time, whether the group as a whole has a stream of conscious experience over and above the consciousness of its individual members seems like a very important question if we're interested in its mentality and whether it deserves moral status as a person.  So we're kind of stuck.  We'll have to guess.<p>\n\nPlausibly, in the diachronic case there is no stream of consciousness beyond that of the merging individuals.  When there's one body at night, there's one stream of consciousness (at most, if it's dreaming).  When there are three bodies off doing their thing, there are three streams of consciousness.  We might be able to create some problematic boundary cases during the merge, but maybe that's marginal enough to dismiss with a bit of hand waving.<p>\n\nThe synchronic case is, I think, more conceptually challenging with respect to consciousness.  If we allow that minimally interactive groups do not give rise to group level consciousness and we also allow that a fully informationally integrated but spatially distributed entity does give rise to consciousness, it seems that we can create a <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/slippery-slope-arguments-and-discretely.html\">slippery slope</a> from one case to the other by adding more integration and communication (for example <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/group-minds-on-ringworld.html\">here</a>).  At some point, if there is enough coherent behavior, self-representation, and information exchange at the group level, most standard functionalist views of consciousness (unless they accept an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nesting_principle\">anti-nesting principle</a>) should allow that each individual member of the group would have a stream of experience and also that there would be a further, different stream of experience at the group level. \n But it's a tricky question how much integration and information exchange, and with what kind of structural properties, is necessary for group-level consciousness to arise.<p>\n<i>Personhood:</i><p>\n\nOne interesting issue that arises is the extent to which an individual's <i>beliefs </i>about what counts as \"self-interest\" and \"death\" define the boundaries of their personhood.  Consider a diachronic case: You are walking back home after your day out and about town, with a wallet full of money and interesting new information about a job opportunity tomorrow, and you are about to merge back together with the two other entities you forked off from this morning.  Is this death?  Are \"you\" going to be gone after the merge, your memories absorbed into some entity who is not you (but who you might care about even more than you care about yourself)?  In walking back, are you magnanimously sacrificing your life to give your money and information to the entity who will exist tomorrow?  Would it be more in your self-interest to run away and blow your wad on something fun for this current body?  Or, instead, will it still be \"you\" tomorrow, post-merge, with that information and that money?  To some extent, in unclear cases of this sort, I think it might depend on how you think and feel about it: It's to some extent <i>up to you</i> whether to conceptualize the merging together as death or not.<p>\n\nA parallel issue might arise with synchronic groups, though my hunch is that it would play out differently.  Synchronic groups, as I'm imagining them, don't have identity-threatening splits and merges.  The individual members of synchronic groups would seem to have the same types of rights that otherwise similar individuals who aren't members of synchronic group minds would have -- rights depending on (for example, but it's not this simple) their capacity to suffer and think and choose as individuals.  They might choose, <i>as individuals</i>, to view the group welfare as much more important than their own welfare (as a soldier might choose to die for sake of country); but unless there's some real loss of autonomy or consciousness, this doesn't threaten their status as persons or redefine the boundaries of what counts as death.<p>\n<i>\nRelated:</i><p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/05/possible-architectures-of-group-minds.html\">Possible Architectures of Group Minds: Perception (May 4, 2016)</a><p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2016/06/possible-architectures-of-group-minds.html\">Possible Architectures of Group Minds: Memory</a> (Jun 14, 2016)<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/10/group-minds-on-ringworld.html\">Group Minds on Ringworld</a> (Oct 24, 2012)<p>\n<a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious</a> (academic essay in <i>Philosophical Studies,</i> 2015)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/03/our-moral-duties-to-monsters.html\">Our Moral Duties to Monsters</a> (Mar 8, 2014)<p>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/08/choosing-to-be-that-fellow-back-then.html\">Choosing to Be That Fellow Back Then: Voluntarism about Personal Identity</a> (Aug 20, 2016).<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/two-ways-of-being-group-mind-synchronic.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-07-12T09:55:00-07:00\">9:55 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5922877562377500567\" onclick=\"\">9\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">consciousness</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/USA%20consciousness\" rel=\"tag\">USA consciousness</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, February 02, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1991177134013119798\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/designing-ai-with-rights-consciousness.html\">Designing AI with Rights, Consciousness, Self-Respect, and Freedom (with Mara Garza)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights2.htm\">New paper</a> in draft!<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KrtXW9r1OO0/WnSre4e2gFI/AAAAAAAAAp8/qMcUWqg2ESU4Ab2LkJxxVGxgbDrB_oKsgCLcBGAs/s1600/artificial-intelligence-2167835_960_720.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"642\" data-original-width=\"960\" height=\"134\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KrtXW9r1OO0/WnSre4e2gFI/AAAAAAAAAp8/qMcUWqg2ESU4Ab2LkJxxVGxgbDrB_oKsgCLcBGAs/s200/artificial-intelligence-2167835_960_720.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\nAbstract:<p>\n\nWe propose four policies of ethical design of human-grade Artificial Intelligence.  Two of our policies are precautionary.  Given substantial uncertainty both about ethical theory and about the conditions under which AI would have conscious experiences, we should be cautious in our handling of cases where different moral theories or different theories of consciousness would produce very different ethical recommendations.  Two of our policies concern respect and freedom.  If we design AI that deserves moral consideration equivalent to that of human beings, that AI should be designed with self-respect and with the freedom to explore values other than those we might selfishly impose.  We are especially concerned about the temptation to create human-grade AI pre-installed with the desire to cheerfully sacrifice itself for its creators\u2019 benefit.<p>\n\nFull version <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIRights2.htm\">here</a>.\n\nAs always, comments and critical discussion welcome, either by email to me or as comments on this post.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/photos/artificial%20intelligence/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/designing-ai-with-rights-consciousness.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-02-02T10:20:00-08:00\">10:20 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1991177134013119798\" onclick=\"\">19\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/artificial%20intelligence\" rel=\"tag\">artificial intelligence</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, January 18, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2285382327477492462\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/flying-free-of-deathbed-with.html\">Flying Free of the Deathbed, with Technological Help</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Today marks the third year since the death of my father, Kirkland Gable.  (Some memories of him <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/memories-of-my-father.html\">here</a>.)  I now better understand than I once did why the ancient Confucian tradition recommends three years' mourning for one's parents.  To my surprise -- since we had only been in contact about once a month before his death -- I find myself almost every day still thinking about his absence.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WkJaa2_oy0k/Wl-4-ASi_TI/AAAAAAAAAoU/8-QQpHqtyuYTq_DrsijJXokd0g18XkI7wCLcBGAs/s1600/William_Blake_-_Sconfitta_-_Frontispiece_to_The_Song_of_Los.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1229\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WkJaa2_oy0k/Wl-4-ASi_TI/AAAAAAAAAoU/8-QQpHqtyuYTq_DrsijJXokd0g18XkI7wCLcBGAs/s320/William_Blake_-_Sconfitta_-_Frontispiece_to_The_Song_of_Los.jpg\" width=\"246\"/></a></div><p>\n\nMy father spent the final twenty years of his life severely disabled and often bedridden.  Among his many maladies, he suffered from severe <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Complex-Regional-Pain-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet\">Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome</a> in one foot, which meant that he was in constant pain which would be seriously aggravated, sometimes for weeks, from even mild exertion, such as ten minutes' walking, or jostling the foot too much during sleep or while in a wheelchair.  It was, I believe, ultimately the CRiPS that killed him, through the side effects of long-term narcotics and the bodily harm from spending years almost immobile in bed.<p>\n\nI have often wished, during his final years, that we could have freed him from his horrible bed.  I've tried this in imagination many times, attempting to write it up as a science fiction story.  But the story never seems to come out right.  Today, instead of the story I can't yet write, let me discuss a technological innovation that I think would be interesting for people who are bedridden.<p>\n\nThe core idea is simple and would be easy to implement.  Probably, it is already being implemented somewhere.  (Links and info welcome!)  <b>Equip an able-bodied volunteer, the \"Host\", with a camera above each eye and a microphone by each ear.  Equip the bedridden person, the \"Rider\", with VR gear that immersively presents these audiovisual stimuli to Rider's eyes and ears.  Also equip Rider with a microphone to speak with Host</b>, directly into Host's ear.  Now send Host on a trip.  <b>During this trip, let Host be guided mainly by Rider's expressed desires</b>, going where Rider wants, looking where Rider wants to look, stopping and listening where Rider wants to stop and listen.  Unlike VR tours as they currently exist, Host can interact with and alter the environment in real time.  Rider could have Host lift a flower and turn it in their hands, then cast the flower into a stream and watch it drift away.  Host could purchase goods or services on Rider's behalf.  Host could conduct a conversation through Rider, interacting with locals by having Rider speak Host's words verbatim.<p>\n\n(In the psychology literature, speaking the words of another immediately upon hearing them quietly projected into your ear is called \"<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/136216880100500203\">conversational shadowing</a>\".  In his career as a psychologist, my father was involved in some early shadowing studies.  Shadowing can be surprisingly fast and smooth once one gets the hang of it, with utterances almost simultaneous as the host half-anticipates the rider's next word.)<p>\n\nA more ambitious Host-Rider setup would employ VR gloves.  As I imagine it, <b>Rider and Host wear matching gloves.  These gloves are synchronized to move in exactly the same way</b> -- of course with quick escape overrides and perhaps with Rider's motions damped down to prevent overextension or bumping into unseen obstacles near the bed.  This would take some excellent technological chicanery with good motion tracking (Nintendo Wii, improved) and some way of restricting or guiding the movements of the gloves on each end, perhaps using magnetic fields, so that when Rider wants to move a hand on vector W and Host wants to move it on vector V, the result is some compromise vector (barring safety override).  An intuitive collaboration would be necessary between Rider and Host, and gentle, predictable movements.  With practice, I think it would not be unfeasible, at least in safe and simple environments, for Rider to feel as though it is almost <i>their</i> hands that are moving in the virtual environment.  This could be further enhanced with tactile feedback -- that is, if pressure sensors in Host's gloves communicated with actuators in Rider's gloves that exerted corresponding pressures in corresponding locations.<p>\n\n(Here, compare the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_transfer_illusion\">Rubber Hand or Body Transfer Illusion</a>.  I have been a participant in some body transfer experiments and have informally conducted others at home with friends and family.  It is amazing how flexible one's sense of one's bodily shape, position, and boundaries can be, given suggestive feedback!)<p>\n\nA final, expensive, risky, and much more conjectural step here -- probably a step too far -- would involve equipping Host and Rider with helmets with brain-imaging technology and the capacity for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation\">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a> (or some other ability to directly stimulate or suppress brain activity).  For example, for <b>a fuller tactile experience, activity in Host's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex\">primary somatosensory cortex</a> could be tracked, and a vague, faint echo of it could be stimulated in matching areas in Rider's cortex</b>.  One wouldn't want too much synchrony, and anyhow brains differ somewhat in their organizational structure, even in fairly similarly structured regions like somatosensory cortex.   Also, of course, you wouldn't want much motor signal going down through efferent nerves into the Rider's body, making Rider move around in the bed.  Also, current brain imaging technologies, even if we imagine portable versions of them, wouldn't be spatiotemporally sharp enough to do a proper job of it.  But still, a dim, vague signal <i>might</i> be very suggestive for an otherwise well-harmonized, collaborative Host and Rider, in a rich environmental context with very clear cues and expectations.<p>\n\nI won't conjecture about, say, attempting to match activity in emotional regions or associative cortex.  Conjecturing about a high degree of match between different people's brains is both neurophysiologically unrealistic and possibly too threatening to the autonomy of Host and Rider -- though of course there are dark, interesting, far-future science-fictional possibilities there.<p>\n\nLet's bracket, then, this last conjectural step with brain imaging and brain stimulation, and focus just on the VR experience with audiovisual input, shadowing, and matching-motion gloves -- all in a positive, harmonious, and non-exploitative relationship with a host.  I think that would be pretty cool, and near- to medium-term technologically achievable.  If it plays out right, it might give some bedridden people a chance to explore the world beyond their bed in a much more vivid, engaging, and interactive manner.<p>\n\nMy father was both a psychologist and an inventor.  In 1995, when he was first diagnosed with cancer, he had been wanting to go to Hong Kong, and he had to cancel the trip to attempt a bone marrow transplant.  He never did make it to Hong Kong.  I wish I could bring him back, build some of this technology with him, then take him there.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/flying-free-of-deathbed-with.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-01-18T08:12:00-08:00\">8:12 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2285382327477492462\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sense%20experience\" rel=\"tag\">sense experience</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, October 26, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"123876686394688099\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/in-25-years-your-employer-will-directly.html\">In 25 Years, Your Employer Will Directly Control Your Moods</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[Edit Oct. 28: After discussion with friends and commenters in social media, I now think that the thesis should be moderated in two ways.  First, before direct mood control becomes common in the workplace, it probably first needs to become voluntarily common at home; and thus it will probably take more than 25 years.  Second, it seems likely that in many (most?) cases the direct control will remain in the employee's hands, though there will likely be coercive pressure from the employer to use it as the employer expects.  (Thanks to everyone for their comments!)]<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBKmfmeEQt8/WfIxkOjIeRI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RWPwdvEKCXstFOa-7oxpEkf6ngGb6GHLQCLcBGAs/s1600/braincontrol.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"629\" data-original-width=\"564\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBKmfmeEQt8/WfIxkOjIeRI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RWPwdvEKCXstFOa-7oxpEkf6ngGb6GHLQCLcBGAs/s320/braincontrol.jpg\" width=\"287\"/></a></div><p>\n\nHere's the argument:<p>\n\n(1.) In 25 years, employers will have the technological capacity to directly control their employees' moods.<p>\n\n(2.) Employers will not refrain from exercising that capacity.<p>\n\n(3.) Most working-age adults will be employees.<p>\n\n(4.) Therefore, in 25 years, most working-age adults will have employers who directly control their moods.<p>\n\nThe argument is valid in the sense that the conclusion (4) follows if all of the premises are true.<p>\n<b>Premise 1 seems plausible</b>, given current technological trajectories.  Control could be either pharmacological or via direct brain stimulation.  Pharmacological control could, for example, be through pills that directly influence your mood, energy levels, ability to concentrate, feeling of submissiveness, or passion for the type of task at hand.  Direct brain stimulation could be through a removable <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/home/ovc-20163795\">TMS helmet</a> that magnetically stimulates and suppresses neural activity in different brain regions, or with some more invasive technology.  McDonald's might ask its cashiers to tweak their dials toward perky friendliness.  Data entry centers might ask their temp workers to tweak their dials toward undistractable focus.  Brothels might ask their strippers to tweak their dials toward sexual arousal.<p>\n\nContra Premise 1, society might collapse, of course, or technological growth could stall or proceed much more slowly.  If it's just slower, then we can replace \"25 years\" with 50 or 100 and retain the rest of the argument.  It seems unlikely that moods are too complex or finicky to be subject to fairly precise technological control, given how readily they can be influenced by low-tech means.<p>\n\nI don't know to what extent people in Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and elite universities already use high-tech drugs to enhance alertness, energy, and concentration at work.  That might already be a step down this road.  Indeed, coffee might partly be seen this way too, especially if you use it to give your all to work, and then collapse in exhaustion when the caffeine wears off and you arrive home.  My thought is that in a few decades the interventions might be much more direct, effective, and precisely targeted.<p>\n<b>Premise 2 also seems plausible</b>, given the relative social power of employers vs. employees.  As long as there's surplus labor and a scarcity of desirable jobs, then employers will have some choice about whom to hire.  If Starbucks has a choice between Applicant A who is willing to turn up the perky-friendly dial and otherwise similar Applicant B who is not so willing, then they will presumably tend to prefer Applicant A.  If the Silicon Valley startup wants an employee who will crank out intense 16-hour days one after the next, and the technology is available for people to do so by directly regulating their moods, energy levels, focus, and passion, then the people who take that direct control, for their employers' benefit, will tend to win the competition for positions.  If Stanford wants to hire the medical researcher who is publishing article after article, they'll find the researcher who dialed up her appetite for work and dialed down everything else.<p>\n\nEmployees might yield control directly to the employer: The TMS dials might be in the boss's office, or the cafeteria lunch might include the pharmacological cocktail of the day.  Alternatively, employees might keep the hand on the dial themselves, but experience substantial pressure to manipulate it in the directions expected by the employer.  If that pressure is high enough and effective enough, then it comes to much the same thing.  (My guess is that lower-prestige occupations (the majority) would yield control directly to the employer, while higher-prestige occupations would retain the sheen of self-control alongside very effective pressure to use that \"self-control\" in certain ways.)<p>\n\nContra Premise 2, (a.) collective bargaining might prevent employers from successfully demanding direct mood control; or (b.) governmental regulations might do so; or (c.) there might be a lack of surplus labor.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (a): The historical trend recently, at least in the U.S., has been against unionization and collective bargaining, though I guess that could change.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (b): Although government regulations could forbid certain drugs or brain technologies, if there's enough demand for those drugs or technologies, employees will find ways to use them (unless enforcement gets a lot of resources, as in professional sports).  Government regulations could specifically forbid employers from requiring that their employees use certain technologies, while permitting such technologies for private use.  (No TMS helmets on the job.)  But enforcement might again be difficult; and private use vs. use as an employee is a permeable line for the increasing number of jobs that involve working outside of a set time and location.  Also, it's easier to regulate a contractual demand than an informal de facto demand.  Presumably many companies could say that of course they don't <i>require </i>their employees to use such technologies.  It's up to the employee!  But if the technology delivers as promised, the employees who \"voluntarily choose\" to have their moods directly regulated will be more productive and otherwise behave as the company desires, and thus be more attractive to retain and promote.<p>\n\nRebuttal to (c): At present there's no general long-term trend toward a shortage of labor; and at least for jobs seen as highly desirable, there will always be more applicants than available positions.<p>\n<b>Premise 3 also seems plausible</b>, especially on a liberal definition of \"employee\".  Most working-age adults (in Europe and North America) are currently employees of one form or another.  That could change substantially with the \"gig economy\" and more independent contracting, but not necessarily in a way that takes the sting out of the main argument.  Even if an Uber driver is technically not an employee, the pressures toward direct mood control for productivity ought to be similar.  Likewise for computer programmers and others who do piecework as independent contractors.  If anything, the pressures may be higher, with less security of income and fewer formal workplace regulations.<p>\n\nThinking about Premises 1-3, I find myself drawn to the conclusion that my children's and grandchildren's employers are likely to have a huge amount of coercive control over their moods and passions.<p>\n\n-------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/what-would-or-should-you-do-with.html\">What Would (or Should) You Do with Administrator Access to Your Mind?</a>\" (guest post by Henry Shevlin, Aug 16, 2017).<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/misp.12034/abstract\">Crash Space</a>\" (a short story by R.

Reynolds has written up a fun, vivid summary of my talk at Oxford Brookes last spring, on fiction writing for philosophers!<p>\n\n-----------------------------------<p>\n\nEric Schwitzgebel has a pleasingly liberal view of what constitutes philosophy. A philosopher is anyone wrestling with the \u201cbiggest picture framing issues\u201d of... well, anything.<p>\n\nIn a keynote session at the Fiction Writing for Philosophers Workshop that was held at Oxford Brookes University in June 2017, Schwitzgebel, Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside, shared his advice\u2013which he stated would be both practical and impractical.<p>\n\nSchwitzgebel tells us of a leading coiffeur who styles himself as a \u201cPhilosopher of Hair\u201d. We laugh \u2013 but there\u2019s something in this \u2013 the vagary, the contingency in favoured forms of philosophical output. And it\u2019s not just hairdressers that threaten to encroach upon the Philosophy Department\u2019s turf. Given that the foundational issues in any branch of science or art are philosophical in nature, it follows that most people \u201cdoing\u201d philosophy today aren\u2019t professional philosophers.<p>\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXG_Ju8hljI/WekqVa31D0I/AAAAAAAAAcI/_i-NSRx-K7Aj5vl63Z9FQ_z2H564JOoUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Hair.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"155\" data-original-width=\"307\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXG_Ju8hljI/WekqVa31D0I/AAAAAAAAAcI/_i-NSRx-K7Aj5vl63Z9FQ_z2H564JOoUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Hair.jpg\"/></a><p>\n\nThere are a host of ways one could go about doing philosophy, but of late a consensus has emerged amongst those that write articles for academic journals: the only proper way to \u201cdo\u201d philosophy is by writing articles for academic journals. Is it time to re-stock the tool shed? Philosophical nuts come in all shapes and sizes; yet contemporary attempts to crack them are somewhat monotone.<p>\n\nAs Schwitzgebel wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0719-schwitzgebel-philosophy-articles-20150717-story.html\">Los Angeles Times op-ed piece</a>:\n\n<blockquote>Too exclusive a focus on technical journal articles excludes non-academics from the dialogue \u2014 or maybe, better said, excludes us philosophers from non-academics\u2019 more important dialogue.</blockquote><p>\n\n[Hugh's account of my talk <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2017/10/18/practical-and-impractical-advice-for-philosophers-writing-fiction/\">continues here</a>.]<p>\n\n\n-----------------------------------<p>\n\nThanks also to Helen De Cruz for setting up the talk and to Skye Cleary for finding a home for Hugh's account on the APA blog.<p>\n\n[image detail from APA Blog]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/practical-and-impractical-advice-for.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-10-19T15:43:00-07:00\">3:43 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2066098109992975784\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, October 16, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7009462481282715687\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/new-essay-in-draft-kant-meets-cyberpunk.html\">New Essay in Draft: Kant Meets Cyberpunk</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Abstract:<p>\n\nI defend a how-possibly argument for Kantian (or Kant*-ian) transcendental idealism, drawing on concepts from David Chalmers, Nick Bostrom, and the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. If we are artificial intelligences living in a virtual reality instantiated on a giant computer, then the fundamental structure of reality might be very different than we suppose. Indeed, since computation does not require spatial properties, spatiality might not be a feature of things as they are in themselves but instead only the way that things necessarily appear to us. It might seem unlikely that we are living in a virtual reality instantiated on a non-spatial computer. However, understanding this possibility can help us appreciate the merits of transcendental idealism in general, as well as transcendental idealism's underappreciated skeptical consequences.<p>\n\nFull essay <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KantMeetsCyberpunk.htm\">here</a>.<p>\n\nAs always, I welcome comments, objections, and discussion either as comments on this post or by email to my UCR email address.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/new-essay-in-draft-kant-meets-cyberpunk.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-10-16T13:46:00-07:00\">1:46 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7009462481282715687\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, September 12, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1101019932700355190\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/writing-for-10.html\">Writing for the 10%</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[The following is adapted from my advice to aspiring writers of philosophical fiction at the <a href=\"https://www.brookes.ac.uk/hpc/research/philosophy-through-fiction/\">Philosophy Through Fiction workshop</a> at Oxford Brookes last June.]<p>\n\nI have a <a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/schwitzgebel_09_17/\">new science fiction story</a> out this month in <i>Clarkesworld</i>.  I'm delighted!  Clarkesworld is one of my favorite magazines and a terrific location for thoughtful speculative fiction.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xJNWnII1B7o/WbgL2fxNhnI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/RxuLoudnk34hM1Iub1nl67EdUU6erBKdACLcBGAs/s1600/Galaxy-cassiopeia.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"974\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xJNWnII1B7o/WbgL2fxNhnI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/RxuLoudnk34hM1Iub1nl67EdUU6erBKdACLcBGAs/s320/Galaxy-cassiopeia.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<p>\n\nHowever, I doubt that you'll like my story.  I don't say this out of modesty or because I think this story is especially unlikable.  I say it partly to help defuse expectations: Please feel free not to like my story!  I won't be offended.  But I say it too, in this context, because I think it's important for writers to remind themselves regularly of one possibly somewhat disappointing fact: <i>Most people don't like most fiction.</i>  So most people are probably not going to like <i>your</i> fiction -- no matter how wonderful it is.<p>\n\nIn fiction, so much depends on taste.  Even the very best, most famous fiction in the world is disliked by most people.  I can't stand Ernest Hemingway or George Eliot.  I don't dispute that they were great writers -- just not my taste, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Similarly, most people don't like most poetry, no matter how famous or awesome it is.  And most people don't like most music, when it's not in a style that suits them.<p>\n\nA few stories do appear to be enjoyed by almost everyone who reads them (\"<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/2015/04/20/ep490-flowers-for-algernon/\">Flowers for Algernon</a>\"? \"<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/2012/05/17/ep345-the-paper-menagerie/\">The Paper Menagerie</a>\"?), but those are <i>peak stories of great writers' careers</i>.  To expect even a very good story by an excellent writer to achieve almost universal likability is like hearing that a philosopher has just put out a new book and then expecting it to be as beloved and influential as <i>Naming and Necessity</i>.<p>\n\nEven if someone likes your expository philosophy, they probably won't like your fiction.  The two types of writing are so different!  Even someone who enjoys philosophically-inspired fiction probably won't like your fiction in particular.  Too many other parameters of taste also need to align.  They'll find your prose style too flowery or too dry, your characters too flat or too cartoonishly clever, your plot too predictable or too confusing, your philosophical elements too heavy-handed or too understated....<p>\n\nI draw two lessons.<p>\n\nFirst lesson: Although you probably want your friends, family, and colleagues to enjoy your work, and some secret inner part of you might <i>expect </i>them to enjoy it (because it's so wonderful!), it's best to suppress that desire and expectation.  You need to learn to expect indifference without feeling disappointed.  It's like expecting your friends and family and colleagues to like your favorite band.  Almost none of them will -- even if some part of you screams out \"of course everyone should love this song it's so great!\"  Aesthetic taste doesn't work like that.  <i>It's perfectly fine if almost no one you know you likes your writing.</i>  They shouldn't feel bad about that, and you shouldn't feel bad about that.<p>\n\nSecond lesson: Write for the people who will like it.  Sometimes one hears the advice that you should \"just write for yourself\" and forget the potential audience.  I can see how this might be good advice if the alternative is to try to please everyone, which will never succeed and might along the way destroy what is most distinctive about your voice and style.  However, I don't think that advice is quite right, for most writers.  If you really are just writing for yourself -- well, isn't that what diaries are for?  If you're only writing for yourself you needn't think about comprehensibility, since of course <i>you </i>understand everything.  If you're only writing for yourself, you needn't think about suspense, since of course <i>you</i> know what's going to happen.  And so forth.  The better advice here is <i>write for the 10%</i>.  Maybe 10% of the people around you have tastes similar enough to your own that there's a chance that your story will please them.  They are your target audience.  Your story needn't be comprehensible to everyone, but it should be comprehensible to them.  Your story needn't work intellectually and emotionally for everyone, but you should try to make it work intellectually and emotionally for them.<p>\n\nWhen sending your story out for feedback, ignore the feedback of the 90%, and treasure the feedback of the 10%.  Don't try to implement every change that everyone recommends, or even the majority of changes.  Most people will never like the story that you would write.  You wouldn't want your favorite punk band taking aesthetic advice from your country-music loving uncle.  But listen intently to the 10%, to the readers who are almost there, the ones who have the <i>potential </i>to love your story but don't quite love it yet.  They are the ones to listen to.  Make it great for them, and forget everyone else.<p>\n\n[Cross-posted at <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2017/09/12/writing-for-the-ten-percent/\">The Blog of the APA</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/writing-for-10.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-09-12T09:23:00-07:00\">9:23 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1101019932700355190\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, August 16, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"415928561761855095\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/what-would-or-should-you-do-with.html\">What Would (or Should) You Do With Administrator Access to Your Mind (guest post by Henry Shevlin)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>guest post by</p></div></div></div></div></div>\n<a href=\"http://henryshevlin.com/\">Henry Shevlin</a><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DTf7_C_tEwg/WZMamhqnX6I/AAAAAAAAATk/86TQt7I2ASQLyedV8hGJxAsrrv_ASetGQCLcBGAs/s1600/login-570317_1280-1080x675.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"675\" data-original-width=\"1080\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DTf7_C_tEwg/WZMamhqnX6I/AAAAAAAAATk/86TQt7I2ASQLyedV8hGJxAsrrv_ASetGQCLcBGAs/s320/login-570317_1280-1080x675.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n<i>\n'Dial 888,' Rick said as the set warmed. 'The desire to watch TV, no matter what's on it. <p>\n 'I don't feel like dialling anything at all now,' Iran said.<p>\n'Then dial 3,' he said. <p>\n'I can't dial a setting that stimulates my cerebral cortex into wanting to dial!

DICK, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep)<p></p></p></p></p></p></i>\n\n--------------------------<p>\n\nWe don\u2019t have direct control over most our beliefs and attitudes, let alone most of our drives and desires. No matter how much money was offered as an incentive, for example, I couldn\u2019t will myself to believe in fairies by this evening. Similarly, figuring out how to rid ourselves of our involuntary prejudices and biases is tricky (see <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603687/\">here</a> for an attempt), and changing our basic drives (such as our sexual orientation) is almost certainly impossible. <p>\nThat\u2019s not to say that we have <i>zero</i> control over any of these things. If I wanted to increase the likelihood of having religious beliefs, for example, I might decide to start hanging out with religious people, or attending services. But it\u2019s a messy and indirect path to acquiring new beliefs and values. <p>\nImagine, then, how useful it would be if we had some kind of more direct ability to control our minds. In thinking about this possibility, a useful analogy comes from the idea of Administrator access on a computer. What if \u2013 perhaps for just a few hours a month \u2013 you could delve into your beliefs, your values, and your drives, and reconfigure them to your heart\u2019s content, before \u2018logging back in\u2019 as your (now modified) self? <p>\nSome immediately tempting applications of this possibility are fairly clear. For one, we\u2019d perhaps want to eliminate or tone down our most egregious cognitive biases: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias\">post-purchase rationalization</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy\">sunk cost fallacy</a>, and so on. Similarly, we might want to rid ourselves of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype\">implicit prejudices</a> that we may have against groups or individuals. Prejudiced against elderly people? Just go into Settings Menu and adjust your slider to correct it. Irrationally resentful of a colleague who accidentally slighted you? A quick fix to remove the relevant emotion and you\u2019re sorted. <p>\nAnother attractive application might be to bring our immediate desires into line with our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_volition\">higher-order desires</a>. Crave cigarettes and wish you didn\u2019t? Tamp down the relevant first-order desire and you\u2019re sorted. Wish you had the motivation to run in the mornings? Then ramp up the slider for \u201cdesire to go jogging\u201d. We might even want to give ourselves some helpful false beliefs or \u2018constructive myths\u2019. Disheartened by the fact that you as an individual can do little to prevent climate change? Maybe a false belief that you can be a powerful agent for change will help you do good. <p>\nFinally, we come to the most controversial stuff, like values, drives, and memories. Take values first.  Imagine that you find yourself trapped in a small town where you\u2019re ostracised for your deviant political beliefs. One easy option might be to simply tweak your values to come into line with your community. Or imagine if you could adjust things like your sexual drives and orientation. Certainly, some people might feel relief at ridding themselves of certain kinks or fetishes that they found oppressive, while others might enjoy experimenting with recalibrating their sexuality. But we could also find that people were pressured or tempted to adjust their sexuality to bring it into line with the bigoted social expectations of their community, and it\u2019s hard not to find that a morally troubling idea. Finally, imagine if we could wipe away unpleasant memories at will \u2013 the bad relationships, social gaffes, and painful insults could be gone in a moment. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind\">What could possibly go wrong with that?</a> <p>\nAs much as I like the idea of tweaking my mind, I feel uncomfortable about lot of these possibilities.  First, at the risk of sounding cliched, it seems like the gains of personal growth are often as much in the journey as the destination. So, take someone who learns to become more patient with others\u2019 failings. Along the way, she\u2019s probably going to pick up a bunch of other important realizations \u2013 of her own fallibility, perhaps, or of the distress she\u2019s caused in the past by dismissing people. Skipping straight to the outcome threatens to cheat her, and us, of something valuable. Similarly, sometimes along the road of personal change, we realize that we\u2019ve been aiming for the wrong thing. Someone who desperately wants to fit in with their peer group, for example, might slowly and painfully realize that they don\u2019t like their peers as much as they thought. Skipping out the journey, then, not only robs us of potential goods we might find along the way, but also of the capacity to change our mind about where we\u2019re going. <p>\nThere might also be some kinds of extrinsic goods that would be lost if we could all tweak our minds so effortlessly. Take the example of someone who wishes he could fit in with his more conservative community. Even though he might relish not having values that are different from those around him, by holding onto them, he could be providing encouragement and cover for other political deviants in his town. In much the same way, diversity of opinion, outlook, and motivation may be valuable for the community at large, despite not always being pleasant for those in the minority. This can be true even if the majority perspective in the community is in the right: dissenters can helpfully force the dominant voices to articulate and justify their views. <p>\nFinally, we could run into serious unexpected consequences \u2013 maybe getting rid of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\">availability heuristic</a> would turn out to drastically slow down my reasoning, for example, or perhaps making myself more prosocial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(film)\">could backfire on me if I live in an antisocial community</a>. Still more catastrophic consequences might involve deviant paths to fulfilment of desires. If (in Administrator mode) I give myself an overriding desire to be \u201cfitter than the average person in my town\u201d, for example, I might (as a normal user) go on to decide that the fastest way to achieve that goal is to kill all the healthy people in my community! More prosaically, it\u2019s also easy to imagine people being tempted to reconfigure their difficult-to-achieve desires (like becoming rich and famous) and instead replacing them with stuff that\u2019s easy to achieve (collecting paperclips, say, or counting blades of grass). Perhaps they would be well advised to do so, but this is <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#DesThe\">philosophically controversial</a> to say the least! <p>\nWhile Administrator Access to our own minds is of course just science fiction for now, I think it\u2019s a useful tool for probing our intuitions about well-being, rationality, and personal change. It could also potentially guide us in situations where do have more powerful ways of influencing the development of minds. This may be a big deal in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem\">development of future forms of artificial intelligence</a>, for example, but something similar arguably applies even when we\u2019re deciding how to raise our children (should we encourage them to <a href=\"http://www.philosophymatters.org/2012/12/the-ethics-of-santa-claus/\">believe in Santa Claus?</a>). <p>\nFor my part, I doubt I could resist making a few tweaks to myself (maybe I\u2019d finally get to make good use of that gym membership). But I\u2019d do so carefully... and likely with a sense of trepidation and unease.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://sweetadelines.org.uk/reminder-on-member-password/\">image source</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/what-would-or-should-you-do-with.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-08-16T08:00:00-07:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=415928561761855095\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Henry%20Shevlin\" rel=\"tag\">Henry Shevlin</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/transhumanism\" rel=\"tag\">transhumanism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, August 03, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3887325787907329296\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/top-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html\">Top Science Fiction and Fantasy Magazines 2017</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mxmQExzW1I/WX-wfj-1xPI/AAAAAAAAAR8/afPDls3aHVodmoDyXwn-uZzq9yBw0CY5ACLcBGAs/s1600/asimovscoverr.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1178\" data-original-width=\"776\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8mxmQExzW1I/WX-wfj-1xPI/AAAAAAAAAR8/afPDls3aHVodmoDyXwn-uZzq9yBw0CY5ACLcBGAs/s320/asimovscoverr.jpg\" width=\"211\"/></a></div><p>\n\nIn 2014, as a beginning writer of science fiction or speculative fiction, with no idea what magazines were well regarded in the industry, I decided to compile <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-top-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html\">a ranked list of magazines</a> based on awards and \"best of\" placements in the previous ten years.  Since people seemed to find it useful or interesting, I've been <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/SFranking.htm\">updating it annually</a>. Below is my list for 2017.<p>\n<i>Method and Caveats:</i><p>\n\n(1.) Only magazines are included (online or in print), not anthologies or standalones.<p>\n\n(2.) I gave each magazine one point for each story nominated for a <a href=\"http://www.thehugoawards.org/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sfwa.org/nebula-awards/\">Nebula</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eugiefoster.com/eugieaward\">Eugie</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.worldfantasy.org/\">World Fantasy Award</a> in the past ten years; one point for each story appearance in any of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250119243/\">Dozois</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blackgate.com/2016/11/23/prime-books-reveals-the-contents-of-the-years-best-science-fiction-and-fantasy-2017-edited-by-rich-horton/\">Horton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781085625/\">Strahan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597808962\">Clarke</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544555201\">Adams</a> \"Year's Best\" anthologies; and half a point for each story appearing in the short story or novelette category of the annual <a href=\"http://www.locusmag.com/News/2017/01/2016-locus-recommended-reading-list/\">Locus Recommended list</a>.<p>\n\n(3.)

I'm <b>not attempting to correct for frequency of publication</b> or length of table of contents.<p>\n\n(6.) I'm also <b>not correcting for a magazine's only having published during part of the ten-year period</b>.  Reputations of defunct magazines slowly fade, and sometimes they are restarted.  Reputations of new magazines take time to build.<p>\n\n(7.) Lists of this sort do tend to <b>reinforce the prestige hierarchy</b>.  I have mixed feelings about that.  But since the prestige hierarchy is socially real, I think it's in people's best interest -- especially the best interest of outsiders and newcomers -- if it is common knowledge.<p>\n\n(8.) I take the list down to 1.5 points.<p>\n\n(9.) I welcome <b>corrections</b>.<p>\n\n(10.)

The remaining magazines focus on the F/SF genre.<p>\n\n(2.) It's also interesting to consider a three-year window.  Here are those results, down to six points:\n<blockquote>\n1. Clarkesworld (66.5)</blockquote></p></p></p>\n2. Tor.com (61)\n3. Asimov's (59)\n4. Lightspeed (49.5)\n5. F&amp;SF (37.5)\n6. Analog (21)\n7. Beneath Ceaseless Skies (20)\n8. Uncanny (19)\n9. Subterranean (16)\n10. Interzone (11.5)\n11. Strange Horizons (11)\n12. Nightmare (9)\n<p>\n\n(3.) One important thing left out of these numbers is the rise of good podcast venues such as the Escape Artists' podcasts (<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/\">Escape Pod</a>, <a href=\"http://podcastle.org/\">Podcastle</a>, <a href=\"http://pseudopod.org/\">Pseudopod</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.castofwonders.org/\">Cast of Wonders</a>), <a href=\"http://www.drabblecast.org/\">Drabblecast</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.starshipsofa.com/\">StarShipSofa</a>.  None of these qualify for my list by existing criteria, but podcasts are an increasingly important venue.  Some text-based magazines, like <i>Clarkesworld</i>, <i>Lightspeed</i>, and <i>Strange Horizons</i> also regularly podcast their stories.<p>\n\n(5.) Philosophers interested in science fiction might also want to look at <a href=\"http://www.sciphijournal.com/\">Sci Phi Journal</a>, which publishes both science fiction with philosophical discussion notes and philosophical essays about science fiction.<p>\n\n(6.) Other lists: The SFWA <a href=\"https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/\">qualifying markets list</a> is a list of \"pro\" science fiction and fantasy venues based on pay rates and track records of strong circulation.  <a href=\"http://ralan.com/\">Ralan.com</a> is a regularly updated list of markets, divided into categories based on pay rate.<p>\n\n(7.) The \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Puppies\">Sad Puppy</a>\" kerfuffle threatens to damage the once-sterling reputation of the Hugos, but the Hugos are a small part of my calculation and the results are pretty much the same either way.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.americanmagazinecollection.com/isaac-asimovs-science-fiction-magazine/\">image source</a>; admittedly, it's not the latest issue!]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/top-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-08-03T09:21:00-07:00\">9:21 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3887325787907329296\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, August 01, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6341506688198046478\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/why-was-sci-fi-so-slow-to-discover-time.html\">Why Was Sci-Fi So Slow to Discover Time Travel?

Almost every long running SF show \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday%27s_Enterprise\">Star Trek</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Late_Philip_J._Fry\">Futurama</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrony_(The_X-Files)\">The X-Files</a> \u2013 will have a time travel episode sooner or later, and some, like Doctor Who, use time travel as the main narrative device. The same applies to novels and, of course, to Hollywood \u2013 blockbuster SF franchises like the Terminator and Back to the Future employ it, as do quirkier pictures like Midnight in Paris. And of course, there\u2019s no shortage of time travel novels, including old favorites like A Christmas Carol, and perhaps most influentially, HG Wells\u2019s wonderful social sci-fi novella <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine\">The Time Machine</a>.<p>\nI don\u2019t find it particularly surprising that we\u2019re so interested in time travel. We all engage in so called \u2018mental time travel\u2019 (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronesthesia\">Chronaesthesia</a>) all the time, reviewing past experiences and imagining possible futures, and the psychological capacities required in our doing so are the subject of intense scientific and philosophical interest.<p>\nAdmittedly, the label \u201cmental time travel\u201d may be a bit misleading here; most of what gets labelled mental time travel is quite different from the SF variant, consisting in episodic recall of the past or projection into the future rather than imagining our present selves thrown back in time. But I think we also do this latter thing quite a lot. To give a commonplace example, we\u2019re all prone to engage in \u201ccoulda woulda shoulda\u201d thinking: if only I hadn\u2019t parked the car under that tree branch in a storm, if I only I hadn\u2019t forgotten my wedding anniversary, if only I hadn\u2019t fumbled that one interview question. Frequently when we do this, we even elaborate how the present might have been different if we\u2019d just done something a bit differently in the past. This looks a lot like the plots of some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sound_of_Thunder\">famous science fiction stories</a>! Similarly, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all pondered what it would be like to experience different historical periods like the American Revolution, the Roman Empire, or the age of dinosaurs (<a href=\"https://topatoco.com/products/qw-cheatsheet\">you can even buy a handy t-shirt</a>). More prosaically, I imagine many of us have also reflected on how satisfying it would be to relive some of our earlier life experiences and do things differently the second time round \u2013 standing up to high school bullies, or studying harder in high school (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Tub_Time_Machine\">again, a staple of light entertainment</a>).<p>\nGiven the above, I had always assumed that time travel was part of fiction because it was simply part of us. Time travel narratives, in other words, were borrowed from the kind of imaginings we all do all the time. It was with huge surprise, then, that I discovered (while teaching a course on philosophy and science fiction) that time travel doesn\u2019t appear in fiction until the 18th century, in the short novel \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_the_Twentieth_Century\">Memoirs of the Twentieth Century</a>\u201d. Specifically, this story imagines letters from the future being brought back to 1728. The first story of any kind (as far as I\u2019ve been able to find) that features humans being physically transported back into the past doesn\u2019t come until 1881, in Edward Page Mitchell\u2019s short story \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_that_Went_Backward\">The Clock That Went Backwards</a>\u201d.<p>\nMaybe this doesn\u2019t seem so surprising \u2013 isn\u2019t science fiction in the business of coming up with bizarre, never before seen plot devices? But in fact, it\u2019s pretty rare for genuinely new ideas to show up in science fiction. Long before we had stories about artificial intelligence, we had the tales of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio\">Pinocchio</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague\">Golem of Prague</a>. Creatures on other planets? Lucian's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_History\">True History</a> had beings living on the moon and sun back in the 2nd century AD. For huge spaceships, witness the mind-controlled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimana\">Vimanas</a> of the Sanskrit epics. And so on. And yet, for all the inventiveness of folklore and mythology, there\u2019s very little in the way of time travel to be found. The best I\u2019ve come up with so far is some time dilation in the stories of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakudmi\">Kakudmi</a> in the Ramayanas, and visions of the past in the Book of Enoch. But as far as I can tell, there\u2019s nothing that fits the conventional time travel narratives we\u2019re used to, namely physically travelling to ages past or future, let alone any idea that we might alter history.<p>\nWhat\u2019s going on here? One possibility is that something changed in science or society in the 18th century that paved the way for stories about time travel. But what would that be, and how would it lead to time travel seeming more plausible? For example, if the first time travel literature had accompanied the emergence of general relativity (with all its assorted time related weirdness), then that would offer a satisfying answer. However, Newtonian physics was already in place by the late 17th century, and it\u2019s not clear which of Newton\u2019s principles might pave the way for time travel narratives.<p>\nI\u2019m very open to suggestions, but let me throw out one final idea: time travel narratives don\u2019t show up in earlier fiction because they\u2019re <b>weird, unnatural, and counterintuitive</b>. Even weirder than the staples of folklore and mythology, like people being turned into animals. Time travel is just not the kind of thing that naturally occurs to humans to think about at all, and it\u2019s only via a few fateful books in the 18th century and its subsequent canonisation in The Time Machine that it\u2019s become established as a central plot device in science fiction.<p>\nBut doesn\u2019t that contradict what I said earlier about how we all often naturally think about time travel related scenarios, like changing the past, or witnessing historical events firsthand? Not necessarily. Maybe <b>these kinds of thought patterns are actually inspired by time-travel science fiction</b>. In other words, prior to the emergence of time travel as a trope, maybe people really didn\u2019t daydream about meeting Julius Caesar or going back and changing history. Perhaps the past was seen simply as a closed book, rather than (in the memorable words of L. P. Hartley) just \u201ca foreign country\u201d. That\u2019s not to suggest, of course, that people didn\u2019t experience memories and regrets, but maybe they experienced them a little differently, with the past seeming simply an immutable background to the present.<p>\nI\u2019m excited the idea that a science fiction trope might have birthed a new and widespread form of thinking. Partly that\u2019s because it suggests that science fiction may be more influential than we realize, and partly it\u2019s because, as a philosopher, I\u2019m interested in where patterns of thought come from. However, I\u2019m very happy to proven wrong in this conjecture \u2013 perhaps there are letters from the Middle Ages in which writers engage in precisely this kind of speculation. Or perhaps the emergence of science fiction in the 18th century can be explained in terms of some historical event I\u2019ve missed. Or who knows: maybe there\u2019s an untranslated gnostic manuscript out there where Jesus has a time machine....<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/p-1974990/\">image source</a>]\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/08/why-was-sci-fi-so-slow-to-discover-time.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-08-01T08:00:00-07:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6341506688198046478\" onclick=\"\">11\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Henry%20Shevlin\" rel=\"tag\">Henry Shevlin</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction?updated-max=2017-08-01T08:00:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=14&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

(Guest Post by Henry Shevlin)  \n  ", "content": "\n    \n\nI have a new SF story in Clarkesworld, \" Gaze of Robot, Gaze of Bird  \" -- my first new fiction publication since 2017. I wanted to tell a tale in which none of the protagonists are conscious but we care about them anyway -- an interplanetary probe (with some chat algorithms and cute subroutines) and its stuffed monkey doll. \n\nAnother theme is what counts as the extinction or continuation of a sapient species. \n\n------------------------------------------ \n Gaze of Robot, Gaze of Bird   \n\nby Eric Schwitzgebel        \n Here's something you might think you know about consciousness: It's unified and discrete. \n\nWhen we think about the stream of conscious experience -- the series of conscious thoughts, perceptual experiences, felt emotions, images, etc., that runs through us -- we normally imagine that each person has exactly one such stream.  I have my stream, you have yours.  Even if we entertain very similar ideas (\"the bus is late again!\") each of those ideas belongs determinately to each of our streams of experience.  We share ideas like we might share a personality trait (each having a full version of each idea or trait), not like we share a brownie (each taking half) or a load (each contributing to the mutual support of a single whole).  Our streams of experience may be similar, and we may influence each other, but each stream runs separately without commingling. \n\nLikewise, when we count streams of experience or conscious entities, we stick to whole numbers.  It sounds like a joke to say that there are two and a half or 3.72 streams of conscious experience, or conscious entities, here in this room.  If you and I are in the room with a snail and an anesthesized patient, there are either two conscious entities in the room with two streams of conscious experience (if neither snails nor people in that type of anesthesized state have conscious experiences), or there are three, or there are four.  Even if the anethesized patient is \"half-awake\", being half-awake (or alternatively, dreaming) is to be fully possessed of a stream of experience -- though maybe a hazy stream with confused ideas.  Even if the snail isn't capable of explicit self-representation of itself as a thinker, if there's anything it's like to be a snail, then it has a stream of experience of its own snailish sort, unlike a fern, which (we normally think) has no conscious experiences whatsoever. \n\nI find it hard to imagine how this could be wrong.  And yet I think it might be wrong. \n\nTo start, let's build a slippery slope.  We'll need some science fiction, but nothing too implausible I hope. \n\nAt the top of the slope, we have five conscious human beings, or even better (if you'll allow it) five conscious robots.  At the bottom of the slope we have a fully merged and unified entity with a single stream of conscious experience.  At each step along the way from top to bottom, we integrate the original five entities just a little bit more.  If they are humans, we might imagine growing neural connections, one at a time, between their brains, slowly building cross-connections until the final merged brain is as unified as one could wish.  If necessary, we could slowly remove and reconfigure neurons during the process so that the final merged brain is exactly like a normal human brain. \n\nSince the human brain is a delicate and bloody thing, it will be much more convenient to do this with robots or AI systems, made of silicon chips or some other digital technology, if we are willing to grant that under some conditions a well-designed robot or AI system could have a genuine stream of consciousness.  (As intuitive examples, consider C3P0 from  Star Wars   or Data from  Star Trek  .)  Such systems could be slowly linked up, with no messy neurosurgery required, and their bodies (if necessary) slowly joined together.  On the top of the slope will be five conscious robots, on the bottom one conscious robot. \n\nThe tricky bit is in the middle, of course.  Either there must be a sudden shift at exactly one point from five streams of experience to one (or four sudden shifts from exactly 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1), as a result of ever so small a change (a single neural connection), or, alternatively, streams of experience must in some cases not be discretely countable. \n\nTo help consider which of these two possibilities is the more plausible, let's try some toy examples. \n\nYou and me and our friends are discretely different animals with discretely different brains in discretely different skulls, with only one mouth each.  So we are used to thinking of the stream of conscious experience like this:\n\n   \n\nThe red circles contain what is in our streams of conscious experience -- sometimes similar (A and A', which you and I share), sometimes different (C belongs only to you), all reportable out of our discrete mouths, and all available for the guidance of consciously chosen actions. \n\nHowever, it seems to be only a contingent fact about the biology of Earthly animals that we are designed like this.  An AI system, or an alien, might be designed more like this: \n   \n\nImagine here a complex system with a large pool of representations.  There are five distinct verbal output centers (mouths), or five distinct loci of conscious action (independent arms), each of which draws on some but not all of the pool of representations.  I have included one redundant representation (F) and a pair of contradictory representations (B and -B) to illustrate some of the possible complexity. \n\nIn such a case, we might imagine that there are exactly five streams, though they overlap in some important way. \n\nBut this is still much simpler than it might be.  Now imagine these further complications: \n1. There is no fixed number of mouths or arms over time.                   \n Someday we might meet spacefaring aliens who engage us in (what seems to be) conversation.  Some philosophers -- for example  Susan Schneider   and (if I may generalize his claims about superficially isomorphic robots to superficially isomorphic aliens)  Ned Block   -- have argued that such aliens might not really have conscious experiences.  In contrast, I hold what I believe to be the majority view that aliens who outwardly behaved similarly to us would very likely have conscious experiences.  In the phrase that Thomas Nagel  made famous  , there would be \"something it is like\" to be an alien. \n    \n\nI offer three arguments in defense of this general conclusion.  I stipulate that the aliens I'm considering have arisen through a long evolutionary process, that they are capable of sophisticated cooperative technological behavior, and that they interact with us in ways that it is natural for non-philosophers to interpret as having comprehensible linguistic content. \n\n(I set aside some  more specific criticisms   of Schneider's argument.) \n The Linguistic Argument.  \n\nAn alien descends from its spaceship.  Upon meeting the local population, it raises an appendage and begins touching things.  It touches its leg and says \"bzzbl\".  It touches its elbow and says \"tikpt\".  It touches a tree and says \"illillin\".  And so forth.  Furthermore, it does so in reliable and repeatable ways, so that this behavior is naturally interpreted as linguistic labeling.  When a human touches a tree and says \"illillin\" the alien says \"hi\".  When a human touches a tree and says \"bzzbl\", the alien says \"pu\".  The pattern of hi/pu responses is naturally interpreted as affirmation and negation.  From this starting point, humans seem to learn the alien language and the alien seems to learn the local human language.  Learning proceeds smoothly, except for a few understandable hiccups, so that after several months, the aliens and the local humans are cooperating in complex activities with apparently complex linguistic understanding.  For example, the alien emits sounds like this: \"After I enjoy eating the oak tree down the road by David's house, I plan to take a half-hour nap at the bottom of Blackberry Pond.  Could we meet to talk about Martian volcanology after I've finished my nap?\"  All proceeds as expected.  The alien eats the tree, takes the nap, and afterwards engages in what appears to be a dicussion of Martian volcanology.  If this was not approximately how things went, the alien would not be the right kind of outwardly similar entity that I have in mind. \n\nTo be outwardly similar -- and also just for good architectural reasons in a risky world -- the alien will also presumably be able to discuss its interior states and perceptual states.  When it is running low on nutrition and needs to eat, it will say something like \"I'm getting hungry\".  When it can't visually detect a distant object that a human interlocutor is pointing out, it will say something like, \"Sorry, I can't see that.  Oh, wait, now I can!\"  When it fears for the safety of its mate who has just wandered onto the highway, it will say something like, \"I'm worried that she might be struck by a car\" or \"I hope she gets across the road okay!\"  Now suppose a human interlocutor says something like, \"Do you really have conscious experiences?  I mean, is there something it's like for you to experience red and to feel pain?  Do you have imagination and understanding and emotional feelings?\"  If the alien is generally similar to us in its linguistic behavior, and if the question is phrased clearly enough, it will say yes.  I think this is plausible given the rest of the set up, but we can also stipulate if necessary that if such an alien said no it wouldn't be a superficial isomorph outwardly similar to us in the intended respect. \n\nAlthough I'm not sure how Schneider and Block would react to this particular case, my interlocutor is someone who thinks it still remains a live possibility that the alien really has no conscious experiences underneath it all, because it has the wrong type of internal structure.  (Maybe it's made of silicon inside, or hydraulics, or maybe it engages in fast serial cognitive processing rather than parallel processing.)  The thought behind the linguistic argument (which I leave undeveloped for now) is that  it would be unnatural, awkward, inelegant, and scientifically dubious to interpret the alien's speech as failing to refer both to trees and to genuine conscious mental states that it possesses  . \n The Grounds of Consciousness Argument.   \n\nWhat theoretical reasons do we have for thinking that creatures other than us have conscious experiences?  I'm inclined to think we rely on two main grounds: (a.) sophisticated outward behavior similar to outward behavior that we associate with consciousness in our own case, and (b.) structural similarity between the target creature and us, with respect to the types of structures we associate with consciousness in our own case.  By stipulation, (a) favors the alien.  So the question is whether divergence in (b) alone would be good enough grounds to seriously doubt the existence of conscious experience despite seemingly-introspective reports about consciousness. \n\nIf the structural situation is bad enough, that can ground plausible denial.  A remote-controlled puppet with a speaker in its mouth might exhibit sophisticated outward behavior, but we would not want to attribute consciousness to the puppet.  (We might want to attribute consciousness to the puppet-manipulator system or at least to the manipulator.)  Similarly, we might reasonably doubt the consciousness of an entity programmed specifically to act as though it is conscious, even if that entity passes the  Turing test   or similar, because there is possibly something suspicious about having such a programming history: Maybe the best explanation of the entity's seeming-consciousness is not that it is conscious but only that it has been programmed to act as though it is.  (I'm not saying I agree with that position, only that it is a reasonable position.) \n\nTo avoid these doubts about the structural story, I have stipulated that the aliens have a long evolutionary history.  The question then becomes whether a naturally-evolved cognitive structure underlying such sophisticated and apparently linguistic behavior might not be sufficient for consciousness, if it is different enough from our own -- such as maybe a fast serial cognitive process rather than the massively parallel (but slowish) structure of neurons, or relying on a material substrate different than carbon.  My intended sense of \"might\" here is not the thin metaphysical sense of \"might\" in which we might allow for  philosophical zombies  , but rather scientific plausibility. \n\nA good approach to this question, I think, is to consider  what it is   about neurons aligned in massively parallel structures that explains why such neurons give rise to consciousness in our case.  There must be something functionally awesome about neurons; it's not likely to be mysterious carbon-magic, independent of what neurons can do for us cognitively.  So what could be that functionally awesome thing?  The most plausible answers are the kinds of answers we see in broadly functionalist approaches to consciousness -- things like the ability to integrate information so as to respond in various sophisticated ways to the environment, including retaining information over time, monitoring one's own cognitive condition, complex long-term strategic planning, being capable of creative solutions to novel predicaments, etc.   If serial processing or silicon processing can do all of the right kind of cognitive work, it's hard for me to see good theoretical reason to think that something necessary may be missing due merely to, say, the different number of protons in silicon or the implementational details of transfer relations between different cognitive subprocesses.    It's a possible skepticism, but it's a skepticism without warranted grounds for doubt. \n The Copernican Cosmological Argument.   \n\nAccording to the  Copernican Principle   in scientific cosmology, we are unlikely to be in a privileged position in the universe, such as its exact center.  It's more reasonable, according to the principle, to think that we are in mediocre, mid-rent location among all of the locations that possibly support observers capable of reflection about cosmological principles.  (However, the  Anthropic Principle   allows that we shouldn't be surprised to be in a location that supports cosmological observers, even if such locations are uncommon.  For purposes of this post I am assuming that being an \"observer\" requires cognitive sophistication but does not require phenomenal consciousness if the two are separable.  We can argue about that in the comments, if you like!) \n\nThe Copernican Principle can, I think, plausibly be applied to consciousness as follows.  Stipulate, as seems plausible, that complex coordinated functional responsiveness to one's environment, comparable to the sophistication of human responsiveness, can evolve in myriad different ways that diverge in their internal structural basis (e.g., carbon vs non-carbon, or if carbon is essential because of its lovely capacity to form long organic molecules, highly divergent carbon-based systems).  If only one or a few of these myriad ways gave rise to actual conscious experience, then we would be especially lucky to be among the minority of complex evolved seemingly-linguistic entities who are privileged with genuine conscious experience.  There would be systems all across the universe who equally build cities, travel into space, write novels about their interactions with each other, and monitor and report their internal states in ways approximately as sophisticated as ours -- and among them, only a fraction would happen to possess conscious experience, while the other unfortunates are merely blank inside. \n It is much more plausible, on Copernican grounds, to think that we are not in this way especially privileged entities, lucky to be among the minority of evolved intelligences who happen also to have conscious experiences.   \n\n[ image source  ]\n\n  \n  \n                 \n [ cross-posted   at  Kittywumpus  ] \n    \n\nWhen  The Good Place   episode \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d   won one of science fiction\u2019s most prestigious awards, the Hugo, in the category of best dramatic presentation, short form, I celebrated. I celebrated not because I loved the episode (in fact, I had so far only seen a couple of The Good Place\u2019s earlier episodes) but because, as a philosophy professor aiming to build bridges between academic philosophy and popular science fiction, the awarding of a Hugo to a show starring a professor of philosophy discussing a famous philosophical problem seemed to confirm that science fiction fans see some of the same synergies I see between science fiction and philosophy. \n\nI do think the synergies are there and that the fans see and value them \u2013 as also revealed by the enduring popularity of The Matrix, and by West World, and Her, and Black Mirror, among others \u2013 but \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d, considered as a free-standing episode, fumbles the job. (Below, I will suggest a twist by which The Good Place could redeem itself in later episodes.) \n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to be fussy when maybe I should just cheer and praise. And I\u2019m going to take the episode more philosophically seriously than maybe I should, treating it as not just light humor. But taking good science fiction philosophically seriously is important to me \u2013 and that means engaging critically. So here we go. \n The Philosophical Trolley Problem  \n\nThe trolley problem \u2013 the classic academic philosophy version of the trolley problem \u2013 concerns a pair of scenarios. \n\nIn one scenario, the Switch case, you are standing beside a railroad track watching a runaway railcar (or \u201ctrolley\u201d) headed toward five people it will surely kill if you do nothing. You are standing by a switch, however, and you can flip the switch to divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. Unfortunately, there is one person on the side track who will be killed if you divert the trolley. Question: Should you flip the switch? \n\nIn another scenario, the Push case, you are standing on a footbridge when you see the runaway railcar headed toward the five people. In this case, there is no switch. You do, however, happen to be standing beside a hiker with a heavy backpack, who you could push off the bridge into the path of the trolley, which will then grind to a halt on his body, killing him and saving the five. (You are too light to stop the trolley with your own body.) He is leaning over the railing, heedless of you, so you could just push him over. Question: Should you push the hiker? \n\nThe interesting thing about these problems is that most people say it\u2019s okay to flip the switch in Switch but not okay to push the hiker in Push, despite the fact that in both cases you appear to be killing one person to save five. Is there really a meaningful difference between the cases? If so, what is it? Or are our ordinary intuitions about one or the other case wrong? \n\nIt\u2019s a lovely puzzle, much, much debated in academic philosophy, often with intricate variations on the cases. (Here\u2019s  one of my papers about it  .) \n The Problem with \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d  \n\n\u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d episode nicely sets up some basic trolley scenarios, adding also a medical case of killing one to save five (an involuntary organ donor). The philosophy professor character, Chidi, is teaching the material to the other characters. \n\nSpoilers coming. \n\nThe episode stumbles by trying to do two conflicting things. \n\nFirst, it seizes the trope of the philosophy professor who can\u2019t put his theories into practice. The demon Michael sets up a simulated trolley, headed toward five victims, with Chidi at the helm. Chidi is called on to make a fast decision. He hesitates, agonizing, and crashes into the five. Micheal reruns the scenario with several variations, and it\u2019s clear that Chidi, faced with a practical decision requiring swift action, can\u2019t actually figure out what\u2019s best. (However, Chidi is clear that he wouldn\u2019t cut up a healthy patient in an involuntary organ donor case.) \n\nSecond, incompatibly, the episode wants to affirm Chidi\u2019s moral expertise. Michael, the demon who enjoys torturing humans, can\u2019t seem to take Chidi\u2019s philosophy lessons seriously, despite Chidi\u2019s great knowledge of ethics. Michael tries to win Chidi\u2019s favor by giving him a previously unseen notebook of Kant\u2019s, but Chidi, with integrity that I suppose the viewer is expected to find admirable, casts the notebook aside, seeing it as a bribe. What Chidi really wants is for Michael to recognize his moral expertise. At the climax of the episode, Michael seems to do just this, saying:\n\n Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.  \n\nIt\u2019s unclear from within the episode whether we are supposed to regard Michael as sincere. Maybe not. Regardless, the viewer is invited to think that it\u2019s what Michael should say, what his attitude should be \u2013 and Chidi accepts the apology. \n\nBut this resolution hardly fits with Chidi\u2019s failure in actual ethical decision making in the moment (a vice he also reveals in other episodes). Chidi has abstract, theoretical knowledge about ethical quandaries such as the trolley problem, and he is in some ways the most morally admirable of the lead characters, but his failure in vividly simulated trolley cases casts his practical ethical expertise into doubt. Nothing in the episode satisfactorily resolves that practical challenge to Chidi\u2019s expertise, pro or con. \n Ethical Expertise?  \n\nNow, as it happens, I am the world\u2019s leading expert on the ethical behavior of professional ethicists. (Yes, really. Admittedly, the  competition is limited  .) \n\nThe one thing that shows most clearly from my and others\u2019 work on this topic, and which is anyway pretty evident if you spend much time around professional ethicists, is that ethicists, on average, behave more or less similarly to other people of similar social background \u2013 not especially better, not especially worse. From the fact that Chidi is a professor of ethics, nothing in particular follows about his moral behavior. Often, indeed, expertise in philosophical ethics appears to become expertise in constructing  post-hoc intellectual rationales for what you were inclined to do anyway  . \n\nI hope you will agree with me about the following, concerning the philosophy of philosophy: Real ethical understanding is not a matter of what words you speak in classroom moments. It\u2019s a matter of what you choose and what you do habitually, regardless of whether you can tell your friends a handsome story about it, grounded in your knowledge of Kant. It\u2019s not clear that Chidi does have especially good ethical understanding in this practical sense. Moreover, to the extent Chidi does have some such practical ethical understanding, as a somewhat morally admirable person, it is not in virtue of his knowledge of Kant. \n\nMichael should not be so deferential to Chidi\u2019s expertise, and especially he should not be deferential on the basis of Chidi\u2019s training as a philosopher. If, over the seasons, the characters improve morally, it is, or should be, because they learn from the practical situations they find themselves in, not because of Chidi\u2019s theoretical lessons. \n How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d  \n\nThus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics). \n\nWhen the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around. \n\n[ image source  ] \n\n----------------------------------------------- \n Update, October 21, 2018:  \n\nWisecrack has a  terrific treatment of the philosophy of  The Good Place   , revealing that the show has a more nuanced view of the role of ethics lessons than one might infer from treating \"The Trolley Problem\" as a stand-alone work.  Bonus feature: I am depicted wearing a \"Captain Obvious\" hat.  \n  \n                                \n Based on  last week's post  , I am now seeing ads for sunglasses everywhere, as if to say \"Welcome, Eric, to the internet hypermind!  Did you say SUNGLASSES?!\" \n\nSpeaking of hyperminds.... \n\nI want to distinguish two ways of being a group mind, since  I know you care immensely about the cognitive architecture of group minds   I'm a dork.  My thought is that the philosophical issues of group consciousness and personal identity play out differently in the two types of case. \n \nSynchronic:  \n\nExamples:  Star Trek's Borg   (mostly),  Ann Leckie's ancillaries  , highly interconnected nations ( according to me  ),  Vernor Vinge's tines  . \n\nSynchronic group minds are probably the default conception.  A bunch of independent, or semi-independent, or independent-enough entities remain in constant or constant-enough communication with each other.  Their communication is sufficiently rich or sufficiently well structured that it gives rise to group-level mental states in the whole.  In the most interesting case, the individual entities are distinct enough to have rich mental lives but also the group is well enough coordinated that it also, simultaneously, has a distinctive, rich mental life above and beyond that of its members. \n Diachronic:  \n\nExamples:  David Brin's Kiln People  ,  Linda Nagata's ghosts  ,  Benjamin Kinney's forks  . \n\nIn a diachronic group mind, communication is relatively rare but high bandwidth and transformative.  Post-communication, the individuals inherit mental states from the others.  In the most interesting case, the inheritance process is very different from just listening credulously to someone's testimony; rather it's more like a direct transfer of memories, plans, and opinions, maybe even values or personality.  Imagine \"forking\" into three versions of yourself, going your separate ways for the day, and then at the end of the day merging back into a single individual, integrating the memories and plans of each, and averaging any general changes in value, opinion, or personality.  Tomorrow and every day thereafter, you will fork and merge in the same way. \n   \n[Cerberus might not be integrated enough to be a good example of a group mind, but I didn't want to attach another darn picture of the Borg.] \n Tradeoffs Between Group-Level and Individual-Level Personhood and Autonomy:  \n\nAs I have described it here, delay between information transfer episodes is the fundamental difference between these types of group minds: whether the minds are in constant or constant-enough communication, or whether instead they communicate only at long intervals.  Obviously, temporal distance admits of degree, but this difference in degree creates structural pressures.  If communication is infrequent, its effects have to be radical if it is to give rise to an entity sufficiently integrated to be worth calling a \"group mind\".  If every day group of friends meets to exchange information and plan the next day's activities, in the ordinary way people sometimes do this, I suppose that in some weak sense they have formed a group mind.  But they haven't done so in the radical science-fictional sense I'm imagining.  For example, if there were five friends who did this, there would still be exactly five  persons   -- entities with serious rights whose destruction would we worth calling murder.  For the emergence of something more metaphysically and morally interesting, the exchange has to be radical enough to challenge the boundaries of personal identity. \n\nConversely, if communication is constant  and   its effects are radical, it's not clear that we have a group of individuals in any interesting sense: We might just have a single non-group entity that happens to be spatially scattered (as in my  Martian Smartspiders  ). \n\nIn other words, to be a philosophically-interesting group entity there must be some sort of interestingly autonomous mentality both at the individual level and at the group level.  Massive transformative communication (as in diachronic merging of memories and values) radically reduces autonomy: If communication is both massively transformative and very frequent, there's no chance for interesting person-like autonomy at the individual level.  If communication is neither massively transformative nor very frequent, there's no chance for interesting person-like autonomy at the group level. \n Consciousness:  \n\nOur intuitive judgments about group-level consciousness are probably pretty crappy (as I've argued  here   and  here  ).  But our general theories about consciousness as they apply to the group level are probably even crappier (as I've argued  here   and  here  ).  At the same time, whether the group as a whole has a stream of conscious experience over and above the consciousness of its individual members seems like a very important question if we're interested in its mentality and whether it deserves moral status as a person.  So we're kind of stuck.  We'll have to guess. \n\nPlausibly, in the diachronic case there is no stream of consciousness beyond that of the merging individuals.  When there's one body at night, there's one stream of consciousness (at most, if it's dreaming).  When there are three bodies off doing their thing, there are three streams of consciousness.  We might be able to create some problematic boundary cases during the merge, but maybe that's marginal enough to dismiss with a bit of hand waving. \n\nThe synchronic case is, I think, more conceptually challenging with respect to consciousness.  If we allow that minimally interactive groups do not give rise to group level consciousness and we also allow that a fully informationally integrated but spatially distributed entity does give rise to consciousness, it seems that we can create a  slippery slope   from one case to the other by adding more integration and communication (for example  here  ).  At some point, if there is enough coherent behavior, self-representation, and information exchange at the group level, most standard functionalist views of consciousness (unless they accept an  anti-nesting principle  ) should allow that each individual member of the group would have a stream of experience and also that there would be a further, different stream of experience at the group level. \n But it's a tricky question how much integration and information exchange, and with what kind of structural properties, is necessary for group-level consciousness to arise. \n Personhood:  \n\nOne interesting issue that arises is the extent to which an individual's  beliefs   about what counts as \"self-interest\" and \"death\" define the boundaries of their personhood.  Consider a diachronic case: You are walking back home after your day out and about town, with a wallet full of money and interesting new information about a job opportunity tomorrow, and you are about to merge back together with the two other entities you forked off from this morning.  Is this death?  Are \"you\" going to be gone after the merge, your memories absorbed into some entity who is not you (but who you might care about even more than you care about yourself)?  In walking back, are you magnanimously sacrificing your life to give your money and information to the entity who will exist tomorrow?  Would it be more in your self-interest to run away and blow your wad on something fun for this current body?  Or, instead, will it still be \"you\" tomorrow, post-merge, with that information and that money?  To some extent, in unclear cases of this sort, I think it might depend on how you think and feel about it: It's to some extent  up to you   whether to conceptualize the merging together as death or not. \n\nA parallel issue might arise with synchronic groups, though my hunch is that it would play out differently.  Synchronic groups, as I'm imagining them, don't have identity-threatening splits and merges.  The individual members of synchronic groups would seem to have the same types of rights that otherwise similar individuals who aren't members of synchronic group minds would have -- rights depending on (for example, but it's not this simple) their capacity to suffer and think and choose as individuals.  They might choose,  as individuals  , to view the group welfare as much more important than their own welfare (as a soldier might choose to die for sake of country); but unless there's some real loss of autonomy or consciousness, this doesn't threaten their status as persons or redefine the boundaries of what counts as death. \n \nRelated:  \n Possible Architectures of Group Minds: Perception (May 4, 2016)  \n Possible Architectures of Group Minds: Memory   (Jun 14, 2016) \n Group Minds on Ringworld   (Oct 24, 2012) \n If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious   (academic essay in  Philosophical Studies,   2015) \n Our Moral Duties to Monsters   (Mar 8, 2014) \n Choosing to Be That Fellow Back Then: Voluntarism about Personal Identity   (Aug 20, 2016). \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n                              \n New paper   in draft! \n    \n\nAbstract: \n\nWe propose four policies of ethical design of human-grade Artificial Intelligence.  Two of our policies are precautionary.  Given substantial uncertainty both about ethical theory and about the conditions under which AI would have conscious experiences, we should be cautious in our handling of cases where different moral theories or different theories of consciousness would produce very different ethical recommendations.  Two of our policies concern respect and freedom.  If we design AI that deserves moral consideration equivalent to that of human beings, that AI should be designed with self-respect and with the freedom to explore values other than those we might selfishly impose.  We are especially concerned about the temptation to create human-grade AI pre-installed with the desire to cheerfully sacrifice itself for its creators\u2019 benefit. \n\nFull version  here  .\n\nAs always, comments and critical discussion welcome, either by email to me or as comments on this post. \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n       \n Today marks the third year since the death of my father, Kirkland Gable.  (Some memories of him  here  .)  I now better understand than I once did why the ancient Confucian tradition recommends three years' mourning for one's parents.  To my surprise -- since we had only been in contact about once a month before his death -- I find myself almost every day still thinking about his absence. \n    \n\nMy father spent the final twenty years of his life severely disabled and often bedridden.  Among his many maladies, he suffered from severe  Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome   in one foot, which meant that he was in constant pain which would be seriously aggravated, sometimes for weeks, from even mild exertion, such as ten minutes' walking, or jostling the foot too much during sleep or while in a wheelchair.  It was, I believe, ultimately the CRiPS that killed him, through the side effects of long-term narcotics and the bodily harm from spending years almost immobile in bed. \n\nI have often wished, during his final years, that we could have freed him from his horrible bed.  I've tried this in imagination many times, attempting to write it up as a science fiction story.  But the story never seems to come out right.  Today, instead of the story I can't yet write, let me discuss a technological innovation that I think would be interesting for people who are bedridden. \n\nThe core idea is simple and would be easy to implement.  Probably, it is already being implemented somewhere.  (Links and info welcome!)   Equip an able-bodied volunteer, the \"Host\", with a camera above each eye and a microphone by each ear.  Equip the bedridden person, the \"Rider\", with VR gear that immersively presents these audiovisual stimuli to Rider's eyes and ears.  Also equip Rider with a microphone to speak with Host  , directly into Host's ear.  Now send Host on a trip.   During this trip, let Host be guided mainly by Rider's expressed desires  , going where Rider wants, looking where Rider wants to look, stopping and listening where Rider wants to stop and listen.  Unlike VR tours as they currently exist, Host can interact with and alter the environment in real time.  Rider could have Host lift a flower and turn it in their hands, then cast the flower into a stream and watch it drift away.  Host could purchase goods or services on Rider's behalf.  Host could conduct a conversation through Rider, interacting with locals by having Rider speak Host's words verbatim. \n\n(In the psychology literature, speaking the words of another immediately upon hearing them quietly projected into your ear is called \" conversational shadowing  \".  In his career as a psychologist, my father was involved in some early shadowing studies.  Shadowing can be surprisingly fast and smooth once one gets the hang of it, with utterances almost simultaneous as the host half-anticipates the rider's next word.) \n\nA more ambitious Host-Rider setup would employ VR gloves.  As I imagine it,  Rider and Host wear matching gloves.  These gloves are synchronized to move in exactly the same way   -- of course with quick escape overrides and perhaps with Rider's motions damped down to prevent overextension or bumping into unseen obstacles near the bed.  This would take some excellent technological chicanery with good motion tracking (Nintendo Wii, improved) and some way of restricting or guiding the movements of the gloves on each end, perhaps using magnetic fields, so that when Rider wants to move a hand on vector W and Host wants to move it on vector V, the result is some compromise vector (barring safety override).  An intuitive collaboration would be necessary between Rider and Host, and gentle, predictable movements.  With practice, I think it would not be unfeasible, at least in safe and simple environments, for Rider to feel as though it is almost  their   hands that are moving in the virtual environment.  This could be further enhanced with tactile feedback -- that is, if pressure sensors in Host's gloves communicated with actuators in Rider's gloves that exerted corresponding pressures in corresponding locations. \n\n(Here, compare the  Rubber Hand or Body Transfer Illusion  .  I have been a participant in some body transfer experiments and have informally conducted others at home with friends and family.  It is amazing how flexible one's sense of one's bodily shape, position, and boundaries can be, given suggestive feedback!) \n\nA final, expensive, risky, and much more conjectural step here -- probably a step too far -- would involve equipping Host and Rider with helmets with brain-imaging technology and the capacity for  Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation   (or some other ability to directly stimulate or suppress brain activity).  For example, for  a fuller tactile experience, activity in Host's  primary somatosensory cortex   could be tracked, and a vague, faint echo of it could be stimulated in matching areas in Rider's cortex  .  One wouldn't want too much synchrony, and anyhow brains differ somewhat in their organizational structure, even in fairly similarly structured regions like somatosensory cortex.   Also, of course, you wouldn't want much motor signal going down through efferent nerves into the Rider's body, making Rider move around in the bed.  Also, current brain imaging technologies, even if we imagine portable versions of them, wouldn't be spatiotemporally sharp enough to do a proper job of it.  But still, a dim, vague signal  might   be very suggestive for an otherwise well-harmonized, collaborative Host and Rider, in a rich environmental context with very clear cues and expectations. \n\nI won't conjecture about, say, attempting to match activity in emotional regions or associative cortex.  Conjecturing about a high degree of match between different people's brains is both neurophysiologically unrealistic and possibly too threatening to the autonomy of Host and Rider -- though of course there are dark, interesting, far-future science-fictional possibilities there. \n\nLet's bracket, then, this last conjectural step with brain imaging and brain stimulation, and focus just on the VR experience with audiovisual input, shadowing, and matching-motion gloves -- all in a positive, harmonious, and non-exploitative relationship with a host.  I think that would be pretty cool, and near- to medium-term technologically achievable.  If it plays out right, it might give some bedridden people a chance to explore the world beyond their bed in a much more vivid, engaging, and interactive manner. \n\nMy father was both a psychologist and an inventor.  In 1995, when he was first diagnosed with cancer, he had been wanting to go to Hong Kong, and he had to cancel the trip to attempt a bone marrow transplant.  He never did make it to Hong Kong.  I wish I could bring him back, build some of this technology with him, then take him there. \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n              \n [Edit Oct. 28: After discussion with friends and commenters in social media, I now think that the thesis should be moderated in two ways.  First, before direct mood control becomes common in the workplace, it probably first needs to become voluntarily common at home; and thus it will probably take more than 25 years.  Second, it seems likely that in many (most?) cases the direct control will remain in the employee's hands, though there will likely be coercive pressure from the employer to use it as the employer expects.  (Thanks to everyone for their comments!)] \n    \n\nHere's the argument: \n\n(1.) In 25 years, employers will have the technological capacity to directly control their employees' moods. \n\n(2.) Employers will not refrain from exercising that capacity. \n\n(3.) Most working-age adults will be employees. \n\n(4.) Therefore, in 25 years, most working-age adults will have employers who directly control their moods. \n\nThe argument is valid in the sense that the conclusion (4) follows if all of the premises are true. \n Premise 1 seems plausible  , given current technological trajectories.  Control could be either pharmacological or via direct brain stimulation.  Pharmacological control could, for example, be through pills that directly influence your mood, energy levels, ability to concentrate, feeling of submissiveness, or passion for the type of task at hand.  Direct brain stimulation could be through a removable  TMS helmet   that magnetically stimulates and suppresses neural activity in different brain regions, or with some more invasive technology.  McDonald's might ask its cashiers to tweak their dials toward perky friendliness.  Data entry centers might ask their temp workers to tweak their dials toward undistractable focus.  Brothels might ask their strippers to tweak their dials toward sexual arousal. \n\nContra Premise 1, society might collapse, of course, or technological growth could stall or proceed much more slowly.  If it's just slower, then we can replace \"25 years\" with 50 or 100 and retain the rest of the argument.  It seems unlikely that moods are too complex or finicky to be subject to fairly precise technological control, given how readily they can be influenced by low-tech means. \n\nI don't know to what extent people in Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and elite universities already use high-tech drugs to enhance alertness, energy, and concentration at work.  That might already be a step down this road.  Indeed, coffee might partly be seen this way too, especially if you use it to give your all to work, and then collapse in exhaustion when the caffeine wears off and you arrive home.  My thought is that in a few decades the interventions might be much more direct, effective, and precisely targeted. \n Premise 2 also seems plausible  , given the relative social power of employers vs. employees.  As long as there's surplus labor and a scarcity of desirable jobs, then employers will have some choice about whom to hire.  If Starbucks has a choice between Applicant A who is willing to turn up the perky-friendly dial and otherwise similar Applicant B who is not so willing, then they will presumably tend to prefer Applicant A.  If the Silicon Valley startup wants an employee who will crank out intense 16-hour days one after the next, and the technology is available for people to do so by directly regulating their moods, energy levels, focus, and passion, then the people who take that direct control, for their employers' benefit, will tend to win the competition for positions.  If Stanford wants to hire the medical researcher who is publishing article after article, they'll find the researcher who dialed up her appetite for work and dialed down everything else. \n\nEmployees might yield control directly to the employer: The TMS dials might be in the boss's office, or the cafeteria lunch might include the pharmacological cocktail of the day.  Alternatively, employees might keep the hand on the dial themselves, but experience substantial pressure to manipulate it in the directions expected by the employer.  If that pressure is high enough and effective enough, then it comes to much the same thing.  (My guess is that lower-prestige occupations (the majority) would yield control directly to the employer, while higher-prestige occupations would retain the sheen of self-control alongside very effective pressure to use that \"self-control\" in certain ways.) \n\nContra Premise 2, (a.) collective bargaining might prevent employers from successfully demanding direct mood control; or (b.) governmental regulations might do so; or (c.) there might be a lack of surplus labor. \n\nRebuttal to (a): The historical trend recently, at least in the U.S., has been against unionization and collective bargaining, though I guess that could change. \n\nRebuttal to (b): Although government regulations could forbid certain drugs or brain technologies, if there's enough demand for those drugs or technologies, employees will find ways to use them (unless enforcement gets a lot of resources, as in professional sports).  Government regulations could specifically forbid employers from requiring that their employees use certain technologies, while permitting such technologies for private use.  (No TMS helmets on the job.)  But enforcement might again be difficult; and private use vs. use as an employee is a permeable line for the increasing number of jobs that involve working outside of a set time and location.  Also, it's easier to regulate a contractual demand than an informal de facto demand.  Presumably many companies could say that of course they don't  require   their employees to use such technologies.  It's up to the employee!  But if the technology delivers as promised, the employees who \"voluntarily choose\" to have their moods directly regulated will be more productive and otherwise behave as the company desires, and thus be more attractive to retain and promote. \n\nRebuttal to (c): At present there's no general long-term trend toward a shortage of labor; and at least for jobs seen as highly desirable, there will always be more applicants than available positions. \n Premise 3 also seems plausible  , especially on a liberal definition of \"employee\".  Most working-age adults (in Europe and North America) are currently employees of one form or another.  That could change substantially with the \"gig economy\" and more independent contracting, but not necessarily in a way that takes the sting out of the main argument.  Even if an Uber driver is technically not an employee, the pressures toward direct mood control for productivity ought to be similar.  Likewise for computer programmers and others who do piecework as independent contractors.  If anything, the pressures may be higher, with less security of income and fewer formal workplace regulations. \n\nThinking about Premises 1-3, I find myself drawn to the conclusion that my children's and grandchildren's employers are likely to have a huge amount of coercive control over their moods and passions. \n\n------------------------------------- \n\nRelated: \n\n\" What Would (or Should) You Do with Administrator Access to Your Mind?  \" (guest post by Henry Shevlin, Aug 16, 2017). \n\n\" Crash Space  \" (a short story by R.

A philosopher is anyone wrestling with the \u201cbiggest picture framing issues\u201d of... well, anything. \n\nIn a keynote session at the Fiction Writing for Philosophers Workshop that was held at Oxford Brookes University in June 2017, Schwitzgebel, Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside, shared his advice\u2013which he stated would be both practical and impractical. \n\nSchwitzgebel tells us of a leading coiffeur who styles himself as a \u201cPhilosopher of Hair\u201d.

Given that the foundational issues in any branch of science or art are philosophical in nature, it follows that most people \u201cdoing\u201d philosophy today aren\u2019t professional philosophers. \n   \n\nThere are a host of ways one could go about doing philosophy, but of late a consensus has emerged amongst those that write articles for academic journals: the only proper way to \u201cdo\u201d philosophy is by writing articles for academic journals. Is it time to re-stock the tool shed? Philosophical nuts come in all shapes and sizes; yet contemporary attempts to crack them are somewhat monotone. \n\nAs Schwitzgebel wrote in a  Los Angeles Times op-ed piece  :\n\n Too exclusive a focus on technical journal articles excludes non-academics from the dialogue \u2014 or maybe, better said, excludes us philosophers from non-academics\u2019 more important dialogue.  \n\n[Hugh's account of my talk  continues here  .] \n\n\n----------------------------------- \n\nThanks also to Helen De Cruz for setting up the talk and to Skye Cleary for finding a home for Hugh's account on the APA blog. \n\n[image detail from APA Blog]\n  \n  \n             \n Abstract: \n\nI defend a how-possibly argument for Kantian (or Kant*-ian) transcendental idealism, drawing on concepts from David Chalmers, Nick Bostrom, and the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. If we are artificial intelligences living in a virtual reality instantiated on a giant computer, then the fundamental structure of reality might be very different than we suppose. Indeed, since computation does not require spatial properties, spatiality might not be a feature of things as they are in themselves but instead only the way that things necessarily appear to us. It might seem unlikely that we are living in a virtual reality instantiated on a non-spatial computer. However, understanding this possibility can help us appreciate the merits of transcendental idealism in general, as well as transcendental idealism's underappreciated skeptical consequences. \n\nFull essay  here  . \n\nAs always, I welcome comments, objections, and discussion either as comments on this post or by email to my UCR email address.  \n  \n     \n [The following is adapted from my advice to aspiring writers of philosophical fiction at the  Philosophy Through Fiction workshop   at Oxford Brookes last June.] \n\nI have a  new science fiction story   out this month in  Clarkesworld  .  I'm delighted!  Clarkesworld is one of my favorite magazines and a terrific location for thoughtful speculative fiction. \n    \n \n\nHowever, I doubt that you'll like my story.  I don't say this out of modesty or because I think this story is especially unlikable.  I say it partly to help defuse expectations: Please feel free not to like my story!  I won't be offended.  But I say it too, in this context, because I think it's important for writers to remind themselves regularly of one possibly somewhat disappointing fact:  Most people don't like most fiction.    So most people are probably not going to like  your   fiction -- no matter how wonderful it is. \n\nIn fiction, so much depends on taste.  Even the very best, most famous fiction in the world is disliked by most people.  I can't stand Ernest Hemingway or George Eliot.  I don't dispute that they were great writers -- just not my taste, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Similarly, most people don't like most poetry, no matter how famous or awesome it is.  And most people don't like most music, when it's not in a style that suits them. \n\nA few stories do appear to be enjoyed by almost everyone who reads them (\" Flowers for Algernon  \"? \" The Paper Menagerie  \"?), but those are  peak stories of great writers' careers  .  To expect even a very good story by an excellent writer to achieve almost universal likability is like hearing that a philosopher has just put out a new book and then expecting it to be as beloved and influential as  Naming and Necessity  . \n\nEven if someone likes your expository philosophy, they probably won't like your fiction.  The two types of writing are so different!  Even someone who enjoys philosophically-inspired fiction probably won't like your fiction in particular.  Too many other parameters of taste also need to align.  They'll find your prose style too flowery or too dry, your characters too flat or too cartoonishly clever, your plot too predictable or too confusing, your philosophical elements too heavy-handed or too understated.... \n\nI draw two lessons. \n\nFirst lesson: Although you probably want your friends, family, and colleagues to enjoy your work, and some secret inner part of you might  expect   them to enjoy it (because it's so wonderful!), it's best to suppress that desire and expectation.  You need to learn to expect indifference without feeling disappointed.  It's like expecting your friends and family and colleagues to like your favorite band.  Almost none of them will -- even if some part of you screams out \"of course everyone should love this song it's so great!\"  Aesthetic taste doesn't work like that.   It's perfectly fine if almost no one you know you likes your writing.    They shouldn't feel bad about that, and you shouldn't feel bad about that. \n\nSecond lesson: Write for the people who will like it.  Sometimes one hears the advice that you should \"just write for yourself\" and forget the potential audience.  I can see how this might be good advice if the alternative is to try to please everyone, which will never succeed and might along the way destroy what is most distinctive about your voice and style.  However, I don't think that advice is quite right, for most writers.  If you really are just writing for yourself -- well, isn't that what diaries are for?  If you're only writing for yourself you needn't think about comprehensibility, since of course  you   understand everything.  If you're only writing for yourself, you needn't think about suspense, since of course  you   know what's going to happen.  And so forth.  The better advice here is  write for the 10%  .  Maybe 10% of the people around you have tastes similar enough to your own that there's a chance that your story will please them.  They are your target audience.  Your story needn't be comprehensible to everyone, but it should be comprehensible to them.  Your story needn't work intellectually and emotionally for everyone, but you should try to make it work intellectually and emotionally for them. \n\nWhen sending your story out for feedback, ignore the feedback of the 90%, and treasure the feedback of the 10%.  Don't try to implement every change that everyone recommends, or even the majority of changes.  Most people will never like the story that you would write.  You wouldn't want your favorite punk band taking aesthetic advice from your country-music loving uncle.  But listen intently to the 10%, to the readers who are almost there, the ones who have the  potential   to love your story but don't quite love it yet.  They are the ones to listen to.  Make it great for them, and forget everyone else. \n\n[Cross-posted at  The Blog of the APA  ]  \n  \n             \n guest post by   \n    \n\nIn 2014, as a beginning writer of science fiction or speculative fiction, with no idea what magazines were well regarded in the industry, I decided to compile  a ranked list of magazines   based on awards and \"best of\" placements in the previous ten years.  Since people seemed to find it useful or interesting, I've been  updating it annually  . Below is my list for 2017. \n Method and Caveats:  \n\n(1.) Only magazines are included (online or in print), not anthologies or standalones. \n\n(2.) I gave each magazine one point for each story nominated for a  Hugo  ,  Nebula  ,  Eugie  , or  World Fantasy Award   in the past ten years; one point for each story appearance in any of the  Dozois  ,  Horton  ,  Strahan  ,  Clarke  , or  Adams   \"Year's Best\" anthologies; and half a point for each story appearing in the short story or novelette category of the annual  Locus Recommended list  . \n\n(3.) I am  not attempting to include the horror / dark fantasy genre  , except as it appears incidentally on the list. \n\n(4.)  Prose only  , not poetry. \n\n(5.) I'm  not attempting to correct for frequency of publication   or length of table of contents. \n\n(6.) I'm also  not correcting for a magazine's only having published during part of the ten-year period  .  Reputations of defunct magazines slowly fade, and sometimes they are restarted.  Reputations of new magazines take time to build. \n\n(7.) Lists of this sort do tend to  reinforce the prestige hierarchy  .  I have mixed feelings about that.  But since the prestige hierarchy is socially real, I think it's in people's best interest -- especially the best interest of outsiders and newcomers -- if it is common knowledge. \n\n(8.) I take the list down to 1.5 points. \n\n(9.) I welcome  corrections  . \n\n(10.) ETA: Check out  Nelson Kingfisher's analysis of acceptance rates and response times   for these magazines below. \n Results:  \n\n1.

Don't take more than a month to return comments on written drafts.</b>  We advisors have a lot to do -- the book contract, the grant deadline, the trip to Germany.  But it's our responsibility to give our students comments in a timely fashion.  Next month will be busy too, and putting it off won't actually reduce the overall load unless you are slow enough to discourage students from showing their work very often (and I don't think that's what we should normally want).  Taking three months to return comments risks slowing down your student's progress by a whole semester.  The student might not prod you.  They might say it's fine, no hurry -- but take that with a grain of salt, given the power relations.  Find the time.<p>\n<b>(2.) Don't assume that your student wants to be a superstar researcher.</b>  If you're supervising PhD students, you probably see the academic world through the lens of research, and you probably esteem other professors in your field mostly in proportion to the strength of their research.  It's great if one of your students lands a job at a research university!  It's good, but nothing special, if they land a job at a non-research-focused teaching-intensive university.  If they end up teaching at a two-year community college, well, that's maybe a disappointment?  Of course some students do really want top research jobs and really would be disappointed to teach at a community college.  It's kind of in the air, in grad programs, that a research career is the ideal.  But not all students want that.  Most of world's professors work in teaching-intensive schools rather than powerhouse research universities -- and that's great.  I love to hear it when students tell me that they'd rather teach community college than land a job at Harvard.  If you assume that all of your students want to be superstar researchers, you contribute to a competitive and high-pressure environment in which teaching careers are devalued, students who don't appear to be on a research-career trajectory are perceived as disappointing, and students may not feel comfortable honestly sharing their non-research career goals with their professors.  All of this unfair and disheartening.  (Of course, it's terrific when a student aims for a stellar research career and achieves it.  I'm just saying don't assume that's what your students want, and don't push those expectations on them.)<p>\n<b>(3.) Don't pressure your students to work more quickly.</b>  Sure, the <i>university </i>might want to see them finish in five years.  But you should be the advocate of your students' interests against the university, rather than vice versa.  Life happens.  Depression.  Writer's block.  Parenthood.  Second thoughts and half-pursued career changes.  Financial trouble.  Illness.  A rare and exciting opportunity to see Brazil with their sister.  The situation is stressful enough for them without their advisor's giving them time pressure too.  You might think it's in their interest to work more quickly; and maybe it is.  But rather than take a harsh or paternalistic approach, pressuring them to work faster \"for their own good\", let <i>them </i>decide what pace works for them.  With perfect neutrality, help them finish quickly if that's what they want; and let them take their time if that's what they want.<p>\n<b>(4.) Remember that your student is already excellent.</b>  It is so hard to gain admissions into a good PhD program these days that only excellent students are able to do so.  They might not know how to write a dissertation yet, and they won't have as deep an understanding as you do of the research methods and the existing literature in your subfield.  But I've yet to meet a PhD student who didn't have the potential to be a terrific scholar and teacher.  There's no need for weeding them out or trying to figure out who are the strong vs. the weak ones.  Instead, help each of your amazing students more fully realize the excellence they already have.<p>\n<b>(5.) Evaluate the work, not the student.</b>  Evaluation is the constant duty of a professor.  But focus your evaluation on the student's work rather than on the student's ability or overall quality.  Excellent scholars sometimes produce mediocre work, especially when they're under pressure or trying something new.  No biggie!  (Reminder: Your student is under pressure and trying something new.)  If a student feels that everything they produce will be evaluated as a sign of their genius or (more likely) lack of genius, the atmosphere will be one of anxiety, pressure, perfectionism, defensiveness, and competitiveness.  Eventually, of course, the core parts of the student's dissertation will have to be excellent, but that's at the <i>end</i> of the PhD program.  Assuming that your student is a human being, their work along the way will have its ups and downs, and some of it will have to be discarded or will need at lot of revision, especially if they're creative, adventuresome, and open to risk.  How are they going to get helpful feedback if they feel that you are so constantly judging them that they dare not show you material unless they feel it's already near perfect?<p>\n<b>(6.) A hoop is just a hoop.  A class is just a class.  A draft is just a draft.</b>  Help them move efficiently through requirements (without pressuring them to do so (#3)).  The standard should be adequacy rather than exceptional brilliance.  If your student feels a need to prove their genius at every step, it should be no surprise if they're stressed out, taking incompletes, prepping far too long for their quals, etc.  Since they're already excellent (#4), if you've been a good advisor and if too many uncontrollable life changes haven't happened, their dissertation will be excellent at the end, when it's <i>finished</i> (#5).<p>\n<b>(7.) Be ever mindful of the asymmetry of power.</b>  The extreme asymmetry can be easy for advisors to forget, especially for those of us who regard ourselves as egalitarians and who like to be on a friendly, first-name basis with our students.  What you \"lightly\" request might be experienced as compulsion.  You might casually criticize, or tease, or razz them as you would a peer, but the effects of such casual remarks can be much more devastating, disruptive, or disorienting than you realize.  If a full professor says to another full professor working in the same field \"that's obviously wrong\" or \"that's stupid\", that might just be an occasion for friendly disagreement; not with a student whose whole career depends on your opinion.<p>\n\n---------------------------------<p>\n\nAll of these principles are defeasible, of course.  They represent my perspective on being a humane PhD advisor.  I might be wrong, and I might be much less humane than I think I am or than I hope to be.  (My grad students say they find me to be a good advisor, but given the power dynamics they might feel compelled to say that.  Few of us really know, I think, how good we are as advisors.)<p>\n\nOne disadvantage of my adherence to (7) above, I suspect, is that I'm less chummy with my students than some other advisors are.  Socializing, inviting students to my house, sharing details of our personal lives, etc., feels slightly strange to me given the power dynamic -- is the \"friendliness\" free or compelled?  I feel like I can't know, and that uncertainty keeps me always slightly guarded and formal.  I can only hope I'm not too standoffish as a result.<p>\n\nOne disadvantage of my adherence to (2) and (5) above, I suspect, is that the stronger students receive from me less of an encouraging vibe of \"you're the best, you're going to be a superstar researcher\" than they might hope or expect.  All my students are excellent and I prefer not to rank them in my mind.  Before anointing one as the next research superstar, let's see how the dissertation turns out in the end.  Nor do I especially value research excellence over teaching excellence.<p>\n\nWhen I think back on how warm and friendly and encouraging my father was with his strongest students (not PhD students in his case, but Master's), I somewhat regret my restraint in both of these respects.  There is, I suppose, no perfect solution but instead a range of tradeoffs that can reasonably be weighed differently.<p>\n\n---------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/06/against-those-year-end-faculty-meetings.html\">Against Those Year-End Faculty Meetings to Discuss the Graduate Students</a> (June 17, 2014)<p>\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/think-of-your-dissertation-as-your.html\">Think of Your Dissertation as Your <i>Longest </i>Work, Not Your <i>Best </i>Work</a> (July 19, 2018).</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/02/seven-principles-of-humane-phd-advising.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2019-02-21T10:07:00-08:00\">10:07 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1401654848956854342\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, December 27, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6888586366352015921\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/12/some-structural-disadvantages-of.html\">Some Structural Disadvantages of Interdisciplinary Research, and What to Do About Them</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>My own academic department has treated me well over the years, accepting my interdiscipinary forays into psychology and science fiction.  But most academic researchers who do interdisciplinary work face structural disadvantages.  I speak from my experience in philosophy, but the problems are deeply rooted in the academic system.<p>\n\nI will focus on two disadvantages: The \"But It Isn't X\" Complaint (from colleagues from your home discipline) and Prejudice / Turf Defense (from colleagues from disciplines other than your home discipline).<p>\n\n*****************************************************<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HQBHBgeWsOc/XCTjPS3HiUI/AAAAAAAABTI/xbzCjGAkluk2uCgzInC5E082YedyWvKVwCLcBGAs/s1600/fractal-1063445_1920.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1090\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"218\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HQBHBgeWsOc/XCTjPS3HiUI/AAAAAAAABTI/xbzCjGAkluk2uCgzInC5E082YedyWvKVwCLcBGAs/s320/fractal-1063445_1920.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n<b>The \"But It Isn't X\" Complaint</b><p>\n\nIf you apply for a job in a department in discipline X, the hiring department will care almost exclusively about your work in X.  When you stand for promotion or most other sorts of disciplinary recognition, you will be evaluated almost exclusively for your work within the discipline.  If you ask for your work outside the discipline to be counted equally, you will be told that it isn't really X and therefore doesn't count for much toward hiring, promotion, or recognition in discipline X.<p>\n\nThe \"But It Isn't X\" Complaint is entirely understandable.  Shouldn't hiring and promotion into a philosophy department, for example, and recognition in philosophy, depend on the candidate's contributions to <i>philosophy?</i>  And even if in principle the evaluators want work outside of their discipline to count equally, they will feel unable to properly evaluate it.  In the disciplinary evaluations on which most of academia is built, within-discipline contributions count most.<p>\n\nThe almost inevitable consequence is that researchers who devote substantial time to interdisciplinary work will be severely disadvantaged in hiring, promotion, and disciplinary recognition.<p>\n<i>What to Do on Behalf of Your Interdisciplinary Colleagues</i><p>\n\nIf a department wants to recognize interdisciplinary colleagues appropriately in hiring, promotion, and other types of evaluation, they need to <b>ask not \"how much has this person contributed to our discipline?\" but rather (1.) \"how much has this person contributed to academia as a whole?\" and (2.) \"has this person contributed enough to our discipline to still count as member of this discipline?\"</b>  Suppose someone straddles two disciplines 50/50, and over some period of time they publish three excellent papers in their home discipline and three excellent papers in another discipline.  Evaluate them not according to the three home-discipline papers, with the three others as \"frosting\", but treat all six papers on a par.  Of course, if the majority of papers are in another discipline, at some point it would be reasonable to consider a change of department.  But until that time, all contributions should be valued and evaluated by the home department.<p>\n\nIf there is to be room in academia, as I think there should be, for people who bridge two disciplines, those people need to be valued for their contributions to <i>both </i>disciplines.  If people in their home discipline cannot expertly evaluate that person's interdisciplinary work -- quite understandable! -- they should consult with others from the appropriate discipline, or even better with others who are interdisciplinary between the same two disciplines.<p>\n<i>\nWhat to Do If You Are the Interdisciplinary Researcher<p></p></i>\n\nAssuming your colleagues and evaluators are not implementing the strategy above, as most will not, I advise three strategies:<p>\n\n(1.) <b>Do as much in your home discipline as your colleagues do.</b>  Publish the six papers in your home discipline <i>and</i> three outside your discipline.  This isn't easy to implement, of course!  But one of the advantages of interdisciplinary research is that your expertise outside of your home discipline can be a font of fresh ideas.  If your c.v. contains as much good work in X as your colleagues', it doesn't matter so much if they think of your other work as of secondary importance.<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Take advantage of higher-level administrators' appreciation of interdisciplinarity.</b>  In my experience, the majority of higher-level administrators (deans, etc.) value interdisciplinarity.  Their evaluations rarely matter enough to compensate for the structural disadvantages I mentioned above, but often their evaluations matter somewhat.  There are sometimes grant opportunities, teaching release opportunities, or other recognition for interdisciplinary work; keep your eyes open for these.  Also, if your disciplinary colleagues are supportive, you can remind them that there are aspects of your research profile that will be attractive to administrators because of your interdisciplinarity.  This can lead your colleagues' to be more assertive in making your case than they would otherwise be, anticipating approval from the higher-ups.<p>\n\n(3.) <b>Relabel your work as a contribution to your discipline.</b>  This is the boldest move, and it will have mixed success at best.  For example, when I first started doing work in psychology I thought of it just as work in psychology that had <i>consequences </i>for philosophy.  After all, if you <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DreamReportRepl.htm\">run</a> an <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ExpWOAttn.htm\">empirical experiment</a> that <a href=\"http://\">looks like a psychology experiment</a>, or<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ExpWOAttn.htm\"> contribute an article</a> to a <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/ReplWarehouse.htm\">psychology journal</a>, isn't that doing psychology?<p> \n\nHowever, starting around 2003, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Steve Stich, Jonathan Weinberg, and others started calling their empirical research on non-philosophers' philosophical opinions \"experimental philosophy\" rather than psychology, and they successfully campaigned to publish some of it in straight-up philosophy journals.  They partly succeeded in <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/experimental-philosophy/\">changing the borders of the discipline</a> of philosophy to include work that would previously have been called psychology.  They haven't convinced everyone, of course.  Not all philosophers think of \"experimental philosophy\" as <i>really </i>philosophy.  But the situation is better than it was.  Arguably, \"behavioral economics\" is a similar story, even more successful.<p>\n\nSimilarly, I have been starting to <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/PhilosophersRecommend-150507-short.pdf\">make the case</a> that <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0719-schwitzgebel-philosophy-articles-20150717-story.html\">writing fiction</a> can also be <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/09/fiction-and-skepticism.html\">a way of doing philosophy</a> -- witness Rousseau, Sartre, Nietzsche, Plato, Murdoch, Voltaire, etc.!<p>\n\n*****************************************************<p>\n<b>Prejudice / Turf Defense<p></p></b>\n\nInterdisciplinary prejudice and turf defense are slightly different but related phenomena.<p>\n<i>Interdisciplinary prejudice </i>is the understandable default assumption that someone outside of your discipline isn't going to be nearly as good at work in your discipline as someone whose formal affiliation and training is in your discipline.  <i>Turf defense</i> is an emotional reaction to the threatening idea that someone outside of your discipline might be as good as you and your colleagues, or better, at work in your own discipline [ETA:] or that others might falsely perceive them that way.<p>\n\nUsually, interdisciplinary prejudice is justified, and perhaps not deserving of a pejorative label.  If a non-philosopher submits something to a philosophy journal, odds are good that it won't be an excellent work of philosophy.  If a philosopher tries to run a psychology experiment, odds are good that their methods and analyses won't be as solid as a psychologist's.  For similar reasons, turf defense isn't wholly unjustified: You don't want others to mistakenly think that the non-X researcher's probably-inferior work is as good as a disciplinary expert's work, so it makes sense in a way to guard against incursions.  The turf defense reaction is also, I think, partly driven by feelings that the outsider is being disrespectful: If an outsider thinks they can come in and beat us at our own game, that seems to suggest that they lack respect for our years of hard work and disciplinary training.<p>\n\nHowever, sometimes people really can do excellent work in more than one discipline.  It takes years of effort to acquire the knowledge and skills; but people do sometimes put in the requisite time and effort.  An Associate Professor of X with a strong interdisciplinary focus might have as much knowledge of and experience in Y as an Assistant Professor in Y.  (It would be almost superhuman, though, for an Associate Professor in X to have as much knowledge and experience in Y as an Associate Professor in Y, unless the situation is very unusual.)  However, even when the outsider does have the requisite knowledge and skills, it is, I fear, a sociological fact that substantial prejudice and turf defense remain.<p>\n<i>What to Do on Behalf of Interdisciplinary Colleagues</i><p>\n\n(1.) <b>Be aware of your possible interdisciplinary prejudice and turf defense and the fact that they are not always justified.</b>  Try to evaluate work in your home discipline by someone outside of your home discipline in approximately the same way you would evaluate other contributions to your discipline.<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Implement anonymous review when possible.</b>  If the work passes muster, it shouldn't matter if it's from a Stanford professor in your discipline or someone from a less prestigious university with a different disciplinary affiliation or from a construction worker in Tallahassee.<p>\n\n(3.) <b>Where anonymous review isn't possible, downplay departmental affiliations on the first page of articles and applications</b> -- for the same reasons.<p>\n<i>What to Do If You Are the Interdisciplinary Researcher<p></p></i>\n\n(1.) <b>Collaborate with someone from the other discipline.</b>  There appears to be much less prejudice and turf defense when at least one member of the research team is from the target discipline.  Furthermore, the collaborator will bring an inside-the-discipline perspective that it is very difficult to achieve from outside a discipline, even if one has substantial expertise.<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Watch for shibboleths.</b>  By shibboleths I mean superficial signs of being an insider rather than an outsider.  It helps reduce prejudice and turf defense the more you can write and speak indistinguishably from members of the target discipline.  (Collaborators can help with this.)  If you sound like an outsider, even if your content is good, that will tend to amplify negative reactions to your work.<p>\n\n(3.) <b>Cite thoroughly and carefully early in your project.</b>  Show, from the very beginning, thorough and serious engagement with the existing work in the target discipline.  This shows respect for that work, reducing the turf defense reaction, and it shows that you have substantial expertise, reducing the prejudice reaction.<p>\n\n*****************************************************<p>\n\nBarring radical changes, structural disadvantages will continue to impair people who do interdisciplinary work.  However, I do also believe that there is one major compensatory advantage, over the long run of a research career.  <b>Often, the freshest and most fruitful academic ideas come from researchers with expertise in more than one area</b>, who can use their expertise in Y to shine new interesting light on X.  Your colleagues won't always appreciate this right away.  But in the long run, you will have different things to say than those whose expertise is exclusively within a single discipline.  You will have a distinctive perspective and contribution.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/fractal-abstract-line-wave-design-1063445/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/12/some-structural-disadvantages-of.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-12-27T07:22:00-08:00\">7:22 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6888586366352015921\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, November 16, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7378135089447239332\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/possible-backfire-effects-of-excellent.html\">Possible Backfire Effects of an Excellent Diversity Statement?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VFI2qFzCxjw/W-3JY5NLwwI/AAAAAAAABN4/XTUmbDejpK4odVGTYhoJUNtuezcZ3gEuwCLcBGAs/s1600/diverse-kids.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1502\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VFI2qFzCxjw/W-3JY5NLwwI/AAAAAAAABN4/XTUmbDejpK4odVGTYhoJUNtuezcZ3gEuwCLcBGAs/s200/diverse-kids.jpg\" width=\"188\"/></a></div><p>\n\nApplicants for faculty positions in the University of California must now include \"Diversity Statements\" alongside more traditional elements of their applications.  Other universities have instituted similar requirements.  Applicants might wonder how much detail and energy to put into a diversity statement.  The question is trickier than it might seem, and there is, I think, some risk that an excellent diversity statement will backfire.<p>\n\nOne of the most acrimonious and politicized issues in faculty hiring in the U.S. right now is the extent to which universities ought to prioritize increasing the demographic diversity of their faculty.  On one side are faculty and administrators who think that applicants' race, gender, or other demographic features ought not to be considered at all in hiring; on the other side are faculty and administrators who regard demographic diversification as a very high priority in faculty hiring; and of course there is a range of nuances and intermediate positions.  You can see the politics of this issue, as it manifests in philosophy blogs, for example <a href=\"http://dailynous.com/2018/10/26/demographic-diversity-good-philosophy/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2018/10/nominations-are-currently-open-for-apa-leadership-positions-until-october-31-1.html\">here</a>.<p>\n\nBecause of these background politics, diversity statements that are too passionate or detailed might risk alienating some people on a hiring committee.  In the current environment, such statements are not politically neutral.<p>\n\n------------------------------------------<p>\n\nAt U.C. Riverside, where I work, it's clear that pursuit of demographic diversity is a high priority in the administration.  Many faculty have the impression that if a proposed hire will contribute substantially to the \"diversity mission\" of the university, that hire is much likelier to be approved.  Every search committee must have an \"Affirmative Action Compliance Officer\" responsible for monitoring affirmative action efforts and tracking justifications for the rejection of all rejected applicants.  Also, all faculty on hiring committees must complete a thirty-minute online diversity training and attend a ninety-minute in-person workshop on \"Promoting Faculty Diversity\".<p>\n\nI attended my first diversity workshop a couple of months ago.  It struck me that most of the attendees -- even those who thought that promoting diversity was a good idea -- felt resentful that they were required to engage in two hours of diversity training before being permitted to serve on a hiring committee.  We're busy with all of our teaching and research, of course!  The training is experienced as a needless, time-consuming interruption.  We all already know, or at least think we know, pretty much what we need to know about these issues.<p>\n\nDiversity statements were a central topic of the workshop I attended.  Examples of good and bad diversity statements were offered for our consideration.  We were advised to treat the diversity statement as among the most important parts of the application.  Indeed, it was suggested that we might do a preliminary screening of applications based on the diversity statement alone, removing from consideration any candidates whose diversity statements weren't excellent, before even looking at research or teaching.  This particular suggestion was met with considerable hostility and incredulity among the faculty sitting near me in the back corner of the room, most of whom seemed to be bristling with rebellious anger, like the \"bad\" kids forced to attend some supposedly-educational high school detention hour.<p>\n\nWhat makes for a good diversity statement?  I'm inclined to think that an excellent diversity statement would show concrete, detailed, and extensive evidence of one's commitment to and ability to contribute to the university's mission of promoting student and faculty diversity.  Ideally, this would show in your research, and in your teaching, and in your committee service and other administrative roles, and in your broader life experience.   (UC Davis offers some guidelines <a href=\"https://academicaffairs.ucdavis.edu/guidelines-writing-diversity-statement\">here</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2016/06/10/how-write-effective-diversity-statement-essay\">here's some advice</a> from <i>Inside Higher Ed</i>.)<p>\n\nI returned to my office and pulled up my own Diversity Statement (which I keep handy to trot out for various purposes when necessary).  Having attended the workshop, my statement now struck me as too brief and lacking detail.  It could be much better!  I revised it, adding several different kinds of specific evidence of my commitment to enhancing the diversity of the university through my teaching and adding another ten or so specific pieces of evidence of my commitment to enhancing the diversity of both UCR and the profession as a whole through my research, committee service, and public philosophy.  (If you follow my blog, you'll know that I have done considerable work on diversity issues.)  What a wonderful Diversity Statement I had by the end, if I may say so myself, full of good, concrete evidence that I'm deeply committed to diversifying the profession!<p>\n\nAnd then I thought: How would <a href=\"http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/dan-kaufman/\">Daniel Kaufman</a> or <a href=\"https://leiterreports.typepad.com/\">Brian Leiter</a> react a diversity statement like this?  A lot of philosophers (maybe not Kaufman and Leiter in particular) might react negatively.  For tenure-track job applicants especially, philosophers like Kaufman and Leiter, who believe that demographic diversity has recently been overemphasized, might understandably be hesitant to welcome colleagues who are passionately committed to the importance of demographic diversity.  They might, on good grounds, fear that such a colleague would prioritize philosophy of race or Asian philosophy over some of the areas they might prefer to hire in, or that the colleague might be especially drawn to job candidates who are disabled, or women, or from other historically underrepresented groups, etc.  The applicant's academic politics might be, in their view, all wrong.  Such philosophers might prefer to see a bland, pro forma diversity statement that implicitly conveys the message that increasing demographic diversity is not high among the applicant's priorities.<p>\n\nNow I wouldn't suggest playing down your enthusiasm about diversity issues if you genuinely feel that enthusiasm.  But I do think it probably makes sense to be aware that there might unfortunately be hiring contexts in which it's possible to do this part of the application <i>too</i> well.<p>\n\n------------------------------------------<p>\n\nAddendum:<p>\n\nTanya Golash-Boza, <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2016/06/10/how-write-effective-diversity-statement-essay\">in her advice at Inside Higher Ed</a>, suggests that hiring committee members who feel that the \"diversity agenda\" has gone too far will tend to skip diversity statements, and so applicants needn't worry about their reactions.  Hmmm... maybe?<p>\n\n------------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated:<p>\n\nSee also Helen De Cruz's <a href=\"https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2018/11/what-kind-of-colleague-do-you-want-.html\">recent thoughts</a> on the possible backfire effects of being portrayed as compassionate or as a dedicated teacher, in applications to research-oriented academic jobs.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=112338&amp;picture=diverse-kids\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/possible-backfire-effects-of-excellent.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-11-16T09:23:00-08:00\">9:23 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7378135089447239332\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, October 22, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6403260623576474171\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/10/in-defense-of-weekends-evenings.html\">In Defense of Weekends, Evenings, Holidays, and Sleep</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Csy7so-b4jU/W830CdJPEaI/AAAAAAAABJ4/QltpIs649zsY4-JWclUnt46-yzrizKS7wCLcBGAs/s1600/40hr-workweek.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"384\" data-original-width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Csy7so-b4jU/W830CdJPEaI/AAAAAAAABJ4/QltpIs649zsY4-JWclUnt46-yzrizKS7wCLcBGAs/s200/40hr-workweek.jpg\" width=\"156\"/></a></div><p>\n\nI haven't checked my email since Friday afternoon, and there are now 165 unread messages in my inbox.  (Only a few are likely to be spam.  I have excellent filters and use a separate email address for all commercial transactions.)  I am inspired to confess this after having read a <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Does-Graduate-School-Kill/244796\">recent article on academic overwork</a> and its propensity to kill marriages.<p>\n\nAccording to the article,\n\n<blockquote>Marital hardships are easily traced to academe\u2019s toxic work culture -- one in which your research must be everything, you are praised for working 17 hours a day in a lab, and you are reprimanded and told you\u2019re not dedicated enough for visiting your long-distance partner or (gasp!) taking a vacation.</blockquote><p>\n\nEtc.<p>\n\nSome students experience their professors as demanding these kinds of sacrifices from them.  I hope my students do not experience me as demanding this!  Nor do I demand it of myself.  I prioritize and protect my weekends, evenings, holidays, and sleep.  And yet I maintain a productive academic career.  This is possible!  Indeed, I believe that it is <i>good</i>, for two reasons:<p>\n\n(1.) <b>Other parts of life are important.</b>  Maybe if you're David Hume or a cancer researcher on the edge of a breakthrough, the world really needs every drop of labor possible from you.  But for the rest of us: Your kids, your spouse, your friends, and your neighbors need your more.  Your rebuttal to Schnerdfoot's objection to Imakara et al. (2009) can wait.  And <i>you</i> need you more.  Live a good, rich life!  Don't burn yourself out for this.<p>\n\n(2.) <b>Productivity gains under conditions of exhaustion are minimal.</b>  Some evidence suggests that there is <a href=\"https://lengstorf.com/overtime-hurts-productivity/\">little productivity gain above about forty hours a week</a>; and working sixty hours a week might even decrease total output compared to working forty.  I suspect this varies considerably by profession and type of labor, but speaking from personal experience, when I am exhausted, my philosophical work suffers.  I can't read or write as quickly, creatively, and actively.  My teaching energy declines and I'm more of a dud with my students.  And I find myself spacing out or spending too much time on distractions like Facebook or my phone.  I do my best work, focused and energetic, when I'm sleeping well and when I've been recharging and relaxing sufficiently on weekends and evenings.<p>\n\nNow there are some unfortunate situations in academic labor, where one simply cannot trim down to a reasonably-sized workweek -- for example, if you're adjuncting at multiple campuses or being tyrannized by a demanding supervisor.  But setting such regrettable cases aside, I don't think that most graduate students or tenure-track professors, in philosophy at least, need to regularly work more than 40-50 hours per week, except perhaps in exceptional crunch times, <i>if</i> they can work those 40-50 hours energetically and productively.<p>\n\n(I am open to being corrected about the generalization above, across some ranges of situations.  And in calling some situations \"regrettable\" I don't mean that they are <i>merely</i> regrettable in the sense that we should tolerate them with a sigh rather than activity fighting against the institutional practices that create those situations.)<p>\n\nFor example, I try to abide by the following policies:<p>\n\n(1.) No academic work in the evening.  (I do let myself check Facebook and read popular articles related to academia, and also to do other light reading related to my work, e.g., popular books by authors like Oliver Sacks or Steven Pinker.)<p>\n\n(2.) No academic work on weekends.  (Similar exceptions to those in the evening.  Also, sometimes I travel on weekends.)<p>\n\n(3.) One hour of exercise every morning.  (Sometimes, if I have academic thoughts while exercising, e.g., about blog posts or papers, I will note them down in my phone to pursue later.)<p>\n\n(4.) At least an eight-hour sleep opportunity.  (I have some insomnia issues I'm working on, so I don't typically succeed in sleeping a full eight hours, but even relaxing eyes-closed in bed has some value.)<p>\n\n(5.) A two-week holiday in the summer, and assorted vacation days throughout the year.  (I don't take every federal holiday, but I more than make up for that with days off that aren't federal holidays.)<p>\n\n(6.) Only four work-related out-of-town trips per year.  (I've been pushing a bit higher sometimes with exceptional cases, though, and my trips are often multi-stop.)<p>\n\n(7.) Regular Monday-Friday work hours.  (Right now, it's about 9:00-6:15, which is a 46.25-hour week.)<p>\n\nIn grad school, I was miserable until I figured out better policies for myself.  I felt like I needed to work as many hours as humanly possible, with the result that any time I wasn't working I was feeling guilty.  My days were a blurred mix of working and half-working/half-not-working-and-feeling-guilty-about-it, with lots of hazy wasted time and unproductive eyes-glazed reading.  Much better, for me, are bright lines between work and home, plus clear policies.<p>\n\nThese policies haven't interfered too much with my productivity.  I have a light teaching load (1-2-1 on the quarter system, with teaching buy-outs sometimes), enabling more research publications than most philosophers have.  With that caveat, in the last two years, I've published eight research articles (some co-authored), a co-edited anthology, two science fiction stories, and 17 minor or popular pieces.  I am currently teaching a 400-student class on Evil (with 5 TAs), plus an honors section, plus a graduate seminar; and I am chairing five PhD dissertation students and an undergraduate honors thesis, and I'm hosting a visiting post-doc.  Plus, I have my blog and a variety of (minor to moderate-sized) administrative duties.  I have a book manuscript due in November and of course several other writing projects in progress.<p>\n\nMaybe my work would be better if I spent more time on it?  I'm not sure.  But even if so, I suspect that the world will manage just fine.<p>\n\nSo if I don't quite get through my inbox today, please forgive me!  Also, there might be some typos.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/today-in-labor-history-the-40-hour-workweek/\">image source</a>]<p>\n<i>ETA Oct. 26:<p></p></i>\n\nWhile this post has generally had good reception, a number of people have expressed the view that in their academic jobs, they are forced to work over fifty hours per week either (a.) to keep their jobs, or (b.) to keep their jobs while also having time to do research work that they value, or (c.) to keep their jobs while also managing complex and demanding lives outside of work.  (The background assumption here is that there is at least <i>some</i> productivity gain for working over fifty hours, which I'm sure is true for some people in some situations.)  I don't deny this, and it is certainly not my intention to scold people in this position.\n\n\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/10/in-defense-of-weekends-evenings.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-10-22T09:20:00-07:00\">9:20 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6403260623576474171\" onclick=\"\">21\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, July 19, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5708606512854456210\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/think-of-your-dissertation-as-your.html\">Think of Your Dissertation as Your <i>Longest</i> Work, Not Your <i>Best</i> Work</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JIJ6nitz9C8/W1C3vQjm3DI/AAAAAAAAA8w/waEJsKh75IsXoDLn66XLkmWf0xtgXAlswCLcBGAs/s1600/DissertationGout.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"928\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JIJ6nitz9C8/W1C3vQjm3DI/AAAAAAAAA8w/waEJsKh75IsXoDLn66XLkmWf0xtgXAlswCLcBGAs/s200/DissertationGout.jpg\" width=\"116\"/></a></div><p>\n\nYou* know how to write a decent seminar paper.  You've done it at least a dozen times.  So why is it so hard to get going on that dissertation?<p>\n\n[* for values of \"you\" of approximately 3rd-5th year in a philosophy PhD program]<p>\n\nYour advisor might stink.  That's rough.  It can definitely slow you down.  But that's probably not the main reason.<p>\n\nYou've got to teach or TA.  Yes, that consumes oodles of time if you're conscientious about it.  But I doubt that's the main reason either.<p>\n\nI suspect that the main reason, for most students, is <i>excessive expectations</i>. You want your dissertation to be the best thing you've ever written.  You want to finally address a big, ambitious topic.  You want work that will wow your advisor and everyone else.<p>\n\nSure, of course you do!  Those are good things to want.  The problem is that the wanting interferes with the getting.<p>\n\nIt interferes in two ways: by leading you to take responsibility for a larger literature than you can digest in the time allotted, and by encouraging perfectionism.<p>\n<i>Against taking on too big a literature:</i><p>\n\nHow do you write a seminar paper?  You read the ten or thirty things assigned for the seminar, plus maybe a few other things.  You especially master one or two of them, and then you develop your critique or alternative position.  Now you've got a fine little criticism, say, of <a href=\"http://www.pgrim.org/philosophersannual/pa28articles/gendleraliefbelief.pdf\">Gendler's view of \"alief\"</a> in light of a couple of recent review papers on implicit bias.  Seminar grade: A.  Lovely!<p>\n\nBut now you're on your dissertation.  Time for a big, ambitious topic.  Time to throw yourself deep into something important.  You want to defend the existence of moral facts.  Or you want to show how it's possible to have infallible introspective knowledge of your own experience.  Great!  To do this responsibly, what do you need to read?  Um...<p>\n\n... the whole entire literature on moral facts or introspection?<p>\n<i>That</i> might take a while.  Could you possibly do it in a semester or a year (while teaching, with life happening, etc.)?  How do you even get started?  Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.  You feel like you've got to start writing.  You can't not write for two and a half years while you read every book and article that has been written about these topics.  But neither can you really write in an informed way without having read all of that stuff.  So are you supposed to write in an uninformed way?  If you're like most of us and you think in part <i>by</i> writing, how are you going to even organize it all in your mind and remember it if you aren't writing?<p>\n\nThat's a nasty little pickle.<p>\n\nHere's the way to duck the pickle: Choose a <i>much smaller topic</i> that you really can master in a dedicated couple of months.  Not just any topic, of course.  One relevant to the big picture you have in mind.<p>\n\nSuppose your big topic is the (in-)fallibility of introspection of conscious experience.  You might read everything pro and con in the recent literature on \"containment\" models of introspection, according to which the judgment <i>I am in conscious state S</i> literally contains conscious state S within it as a part (and is arguably thus infallibly correct).  This topic is small enough to master and write about in a semester, if you are already a well-trained graduate student in philosophy of mind who has given it some preliminary thought.  Though it's a small literature, really getting it right is an ample task for a big, long chapter.  And the topic is centrally related to the big-picture issue of introspective infallibility in the recent literature.<p>\n\nThen, for the next chapter, find something nearby that is similarly small and tractable, to which you can bring some of the insights and tools from your previous chapter.  Continuing the example, maybe neo-expressivist views of the nature of introspection.<p>\n\nRepeat a few times, and you'll find you've actually covered a fairly large territory in sum.  In the process, you'll have mastered much of the literature that seemed so impossibly large at the start.<p>\n\nFind the tiniest thing you can find that is relevant to your topic while also being of significant interest to specialists in the area, and become the absolute bleeding world expert on it.  Then bore your advisor with sixty-plus pages of a tediously thorough treatment.  This is how to duck the pickle.<p>\n<i>Against perfectionism:</i><p>\n\nIf I said, \"Michelangelo, next month create the best art you've ever made\" could he do it?  Not likely!<p>\n\nDon't think of your dissertation as your best work ever.  Don't hold your writing to that difficult a standard.  Maybe at some point down the road, after a bunch of revision, some favorite piece of it will turn out to be your best work ever.  (More on this below.)  But having that kind of expectation is not the way to <i>start</i> writing.  Reconcile yourself to the likely fact that you're not going to produce the best work of your life in the next few months.<p>\n\nHere's a better way to think of it: Your dissertation will be the <i>longest and most thorough</i> thing you've ever written.  That's all.  Instead of aiming for brilliant prose, aim for length.  Choose that little thing and cover it so exhaustively that no one who reads your chapter on the topic could doubt that you know that tiny corner of academia as well as anyone else in the world.<p>\n\nSend your advisor something long and hairy.  It's okay.  You're not being graded on prose style.  Get it out to your advisor for feedback, and to others you trust, even though it's not the most beautiful of things.  You can revise it later!  That's the point of getting feedback, right?<p>\n\nSettle.  Your target should be: <i>rough, covers the bases</i> (except for that one thing you forgot which you'll put in later), <i>good enough to move on to the next chapter</i>.<p>\n\nAfter the feedback, you'll see some things that definitely need changing.  But unless some radical rethinking is required, <i>don't make those changes yet!</i>  Instead, move on.  Write the next chapter.  Set the feedback aside to return to later, <i>after</i> you've rough drafted your other chapters.  In the course of writing those other chapters, you'll probably have insights that influence your thinking about the earlier chapters, so they'll need significant revising for that reason anyway.<p>\n\nDo this several times and you'll find that you have a few hundred pages of long, ugly chapters that take you from the beginning to the end.  <i>Then</i> revise.  Rewrite the whole thing top to bottom.  Now, at the end -- not in the early drafting stage -- is the time to make it... well I won't say perfect, but better.  Polished.  This is the last thing you do, simultaneously with hitting the job market.<p>\n\nLikely you will find, at the end, once you're done polishing, that your dissertation, or at least your favorite piece of it, <i>is</i> the best thing you've ever written.  That's not because any chapter was fantastic in its initial draft, but rather because you've never before in your life spent a few years thinking about a single topic, and as a result you now have that topic down so well that you really see to the core of it.  You know everyone else's views, and you can lay out the strengths and weaknesses of those views, and your great command of the material will show in the final, polished version of your work.<p>\n<i>Start today:</i><p>\n\nSo if you're sitting there stalled out on your dissertation, take Doctor Eric's three-step remedy:<p>\n\n(1.) Let go of the thought that you are about to produce the best work you've ever written.  Lower your ambitions.<p>\n\n(2.) Choose a topic so narrow that you can read everything relevant in short order, and then read that stuff.<p>\n\n(3.) Write out that narrow thing, long and boring and ugly, blow by blow.<p>\n\nAt the end, you'll have several dozen long, ugly, boring, thorough pages -- exactly the kind of material from which excellent dissertations are eventually built.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Title_page;_A_dissertation_on_the_gout_Wellcome_L0000077.jpg\">image source</a>]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/07/think-of-your-dissertation-as-your.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-07-19T10:00:00-07:00\">10:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5708606512854456210\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, October 19, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2066098109992975784\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/practical-and-impractical-advice-for.html\">Practical and Impractical Advice for Philosophers Writing Fiction</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Hugh D. Reynolds has written up a fun, vivid summary of my talk at Oxford Brookes last spring, on fiction writing for philosophers!<p>\n\n-----------------------------------<p>\n\nEric Schwitzgebel has a pleasingly liberal view of what constitutes philosophy. A philosopher is anyone wrestling with the \u201cbiggest picture framing issues\u201d of... well, anything.<p>\n\nIn a keynote session at the Fiction Writing for Philosophers Workshop that was held at Oxford Brookes University in June 2017, Schwitzgebel, Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside, shared his advice\u2013which he stated would be both practical and impractical.<p>\n\nSchwitzgebel tells us of a leading coiffeur who styles himself as a \u201cPhilosopher of Hair\u201d. We laugh \u2013 but there\u2019s something in this \u2013 the vagary, the contingency in favoured forms of philosophical output. And it\u2019s not just hairdressers that threaten to encroach upon the Philosophy Department\u2019s turf. Given that the foundational issues in any branch of science or art are philosophical in nature, it follows that most people \u201cdoing\u201d philosophy today aren\u2019t professional philosophers.<p>\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXG_Ju8hljI/WekqVa31D0I/AAAAAAAAAcI/_i-NSRx-K7Aj5vl63Z9FQ_z2H564JOoUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Hair.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"155\" data-original-width=\"307\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HXG_Ju8hljI/WekqVa31D0I/AAAAAAAAAcI/_i-NSRx-K7Aj5vl63Z9FQ_z2H564JOoUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Hair.jpg\"/></a><p>\n\nThere are a host of ways one could go about doing philosophy, but of late a consensus has emerged amongst those that write articles for academic journals: the only proper way to \u201cdo\u201d philosophy is by writing articles for academic journals. Is it time to re-stock the tool shed? Philosophical nuts come in all shapes and sizes; yet contemporary attempts to crack them are somewhat monotone.<p>\n\nAs Schwitzgebel wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0719-schwitzgebel-philosophy-articles-20150717-story.html\">Los Angeles Times op-ed piece</a>:\n\n<blockquote>Too exclusive a focus on technical journal articles excludes non-academics from the dialogue \u2014 or maybe, better said, excludes us philosophers from non-academics\u2019 more important dialogue.</blockquote><p>\n\n[Hugh's account of my talk <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2017/10/18/practical-and-impractical-advice-for-philosophers-writing-fiction/\">continues here</a>.]<p>\n\n\n-----------------------------------<p>\n\nThanks also to Helen De Cruz for setting up the talk and to Skye Cleary for finding a home for Hugh's account on the APA blog.<p>\n\n[image detail from APA Blog]\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/10/practical-and-impractical-advice-for.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-10-19T15:43:00-07:00\">3:43 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2066098109992975784\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, September 12, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1101019932700355190\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/writing-for-10.html\">Writing for the 10%</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[The following is adapted from my advice to aspiring writers of philosophical fiction at the <a href=\"https://www.brookes.ac.uk/hpc/research/philosophy-through-fiction/\">Philosophy Through Fiction workshop</a> at Oxford Brookes last June.]<p>\n\nI have a <a href=\"http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/schwitzgebel_09_17/\">new science fiction story</a> out this month in <i>Clarkesworld</i>.  I'm delighted!  Clarkesworld is one of my favorite magazines and a terrific location for thoughtful speculative fiction.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xJNWnII1B7o/WbgL2fxNhnI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/RxuLoudnk34hM1Iub1nl67EdUU6erBKdACLcBGAs/s1600/Galaxy-cassiopeia.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"974\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xJNWnII1B7o/WbgL2fxNhnI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/RxuLoudnk34hM1Iub1nl67EdUU6erBKdACLcBGAs/s320/Galaxy-cassiopeia.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div>\n<p>\n\nHowever, I doubt that you'll like my story.  I don't say this out of modesty or because I think this story is especially unlikable.  I say it partly to help defuse expectations: Please feel free not to like my story!  I won't be offended.  But I say it too, in this context, because I think it's important for writers to remind themselves regularly of one possibly somewhat disappointing fact: <i>Most people don't like most fiction.</i>  So most people are probably not going to like <i>your</i> fiction -- no matter how wonderful it is.<p>\n\nIn fiction, so much depends on taste.  Even the very best, most famous fiction in the world is disliked by most people.  I can't stand Ernest Hemingway or George Eliot.  I don't dispute that they were great writers -- just not my taste, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Similarly, most people don't like most poetry, no matter how famous or awesome it is.  And most people don't like most music, when it's not in a style that suits them.<p>\n\nA few stories do appear to be enjoyed by almost everyone who reads them (\"<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/2015/04/20/ep490-flowers-for-algernon/\">Flowers for Algernon</a>\"? \"<a href=\"http://escapepod.org/2012/05/17/ep345-the-paper-menagerie/\">The Paper Menagerie</a>\"?), but those are <i>peak stories of great writers' careers</i>.  To expect even a very good story by an excellent writer to achieve almost universal likability is like hearing that a philosopher has just put out a new book and then expecting it to be as beloved and influential as <i>Naming and Necessity</i>.<p>\n\nEven if someone likes your expository philosophy, they probably won't like your fiction.  The two types of writing are so different!  Even someone who enjoys philosophically-inspired fiction probably won't like your fiction in particular.  Too many other parameters of taste also need to align.  They'll find your prose style too flowery or too dry, your characters too flat or too cartoonishly clever, your plot too predictable or too confusing, your philosophical elements too heavy-handed or too understated....<p>\n\nI draw two lessons.<p>\n\nFirst lesson: Although you probably want your friends, family, and colleagues to enjoy your work, and some secret inner part of you might <i>expect </i>them to enjoy it (because it's so wonderful!), it's best to suppress that desire and expectation.  You need to learn to expect indifference without feeling disappointed.  It's like expecting your friends and family and colleagues to like your favorite band.  Almost none of them will -- even if some part of you screams out \"of course everyone should love this song it's so great!\"  Aesthetic taste doesn't work like that.  <i>It's perfectly fine if almost no one you know you likes your writing.</i>  They shouldn't feel bad about that, and you shouldn't feel bad about that.<p>\n\nSecond lesson: Write for the people who will like it.  Sometimes one hears the advice that you should \"just write for yourself\" and forget the potential audience.  I can see how this might be good advice if the alternative is to try to please everyone, which will never succeed and might along the way destroy what is most distinctive about your voice and style.  However, I don't think that advice is quite right, for most writers.  If you really are just writing for yourself -- well, isn't that what diaries are for?  If you're only writing for yourself you needn't think about comprehensibility, since of course <i>you </i>understand everything.  If you're only writing for yourself, you needn't think about suspense, since of course <i>you</i> know what's going to happen.  And so forth.  The better advice here is <i>write for the 10%</i>.  Maybe 10% of the people around you have tastes similar enough to your own that there's a chance that your story will please them.  They are your target audience.  Your story needn't be comprehensible to everyone, but it should be comprehensible to them.  Your story needn't work intellectually and emotionally for everyone, but you should try to make it work intellectually and emotionally for them.<p>\n\nWhen sending your story out for feedback, ignore the feedback of the 90%, and treasure the feedback of the 10%.  Don't try to implement every change that everyone recommends, or even the majority of changes.  Most people will never like the story that you would write.  You wouldn't want your favorite punk band taking aesthetic advice from your country-music loving uncle.  But listen intently to the 10%, to the readers who are almost there, the ones who have the <i>potential </i>to love your story but don't quite love it yet.  They are the ones to listen to.  Make it great for them, and forget everyone else.<p>\n\n[Cross-posted at <a href=\"http://blog.apaonline.org/2017/09/12/writing-for-the-ten-percent/\">The Blog of the APA</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/09/writing-for-10.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2017-09-12T09:23:00-07:00\">9:23 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1101019932700355190\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/science%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">science fiction</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/speculative%20fiction\" rel=\"tag\">speculative fiction</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, September 26, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5307959721207846829\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/09/a-modest-proposal.html\">A Modest Proposal</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>That no new form-filling be added to our lives without retiring an existing form that takes equal time to complete.<p>\n\nI will consider any arguments that readers care to advance on behalf of the thesis that we do not spend sufficient time completing forms.

That's what I want to do with my time.  What I <i>don't </i>want to do is spend lots of time applying for grant money.<p>\n\nAnd society should feel the same way.  I'm an employee of the University of California, my salary funded by taxpayers.  Taxpayers want me to teach.  Taxpayers should want me to do research too -- if for no other reason than to make me the kind of leading scholar who can teach cutting-edge classes.  But taxpayers should not be paying me to spend large amounts of time writing down stuff to convince some committee that I deserve money more than Professors X, Y, and Z deserve money.  The amount of time academics spend applying for grants is a giant, loathsome waste of energy of some of the most capable minds in the world.<p>\n\nPlus, why should we want to tie researchers down to what they thought they wanted to do two years ago, when they applied?  Times change, ideas mature, opportunities arise!<p>\n\nBut society has to fund research, right?  So there need to be grants out there to support researchers.<p>\n\nThe solution is simple: <i>Give money to researchers for their research without their having to apply, and let them spend it on any reasonable research expenses</i>.  That should be the dominant model of grant funding.  The committees that award grant money should spend their time finding out who, based on recent performance, is likely to put research money to best use, and they should simply hand those people the money.  This will free up the time of those people to do more of their interesting research.  Think <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/\">MacArthur \"genius\" grants</a> on a small scale.<p>\n\nA few strings should be attached, so that recipients don't just pocket the money as salary.  Suppose you're a foundation with $1 million a year to fund philosophical research on Topic X.  Here's how you might do it.  Form a committee of leading scholars on Topic X.  Have them find 40 people who are actively doing excellent work on Topic X -- from post-docs through distinguished professors, some at every level.  And then send each of the potential recipients a letter offering them $25,000 over the course of five years, with the following two conditions: (1.) The money be spent only on documented research expenses (provide a list of allowable expenses), and (2.) In the last year they receive money, they come to your annual conference to present some of their research on Topic X.  (Right, you now have to host an annual conference on Topic X, where your brilliant researchers can argue with each other.  That seems like a good idea anyway, doesn't it?)<p>\n\n(Or make it $10,000 to 100, or $100,000 to 10, or whatever -- depending on the committee's vision.)<p>\n\nA good committee (maybe eventually composed of past recipients) can easily identify a good pool of leading active researchers on Topic X.  Look at who is publishing; look at who is presenting at conferences; etc.  Those are the people to fund.  They want to travel; they want to buy sabbatical time to be able to focus better on their research; they want to spend money on books and equipment and graduate student research assistants. I predict that the committee would end up funding better research overall, with less waste -- at least in philosophy -- than if they wait for applicants to come to them, funding on the basis of shiny-tight-looking proposals.<p>\n\nIf the committee is especially interested in encouraging certain sorts of activities, the committee could also offer some funding contingent on executing those activities: $15,000 of research money if the recipient is willing to use it to organize a mini-conference, $4,000 bonus research money if the recipient speaks at four universities in continental Europe, whatever.<p>\n\nTo counteract some of the elitism inherent in the proposal, the committee should be especially directed to look for researchers with large teaching loads and non-elite appointments who are able to be research-productive nonetheless.  Such people especially deserve funding, and they might be especially likely to put their funding to good use.<p>\n\nI don't think this is the only way research should be funded.  The standard model can still play a role: People with no brilliant track record, or who have been overlooked by the committee, should be funded if they can put together excellent proposals.  Some people might have especially ambitious visions requiring sums of money larger than the usual amounts.  For these cases -- but, I would argue, <i>only</i> for these cases -- the standard granting model makes sense.<p>\n\n(<a href=\"http://www.templeton.org/\">Templeton</a>, are you listening?)<p>\n<i>Update March 19:</i><p>\nIn the comments, <a href=\"//www.blogger.com/profile/12586131772199247420\">Neil </a>reminded me about people whose salary is paid for by grants.  This can easily be added to my system.  One way is contingent directed funding: Offer some recipients $N of funding for a post-doc if they are willing to do the search and supervision.  Another way is to have people apply for either renewable or non-renewable salaried grants, much as they might apply for a job.  For the renewable ones, continuation would be based on actual performance during the lifetime of the grant.<p>\n<i>Update April 9:<p></p></i>\nSee Helen De Cruz's <a href=\"http://www.newappsblog.com/2013/04/grant-writing-wasted-time-and-red-queen-effects.html\">excellent post on this at NewAPPS</a>, too.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-to-give-1-million-year-to.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-03-18T14:49:00-07:00\">2:49 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4174201467112669221\" onclick=\"\">12\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, January 02, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4888664706371156653\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/01/on-trusting-your-sense-of-fun.html\">On Trusting Your Sense of Fun</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Maybe, like me, you're a <i>philosophy dork</i>. Maybe, like me, when you were thirteen, you said to your friends, \"Is there really a world behind that closed door? Or does the outside world only pop into existence when I open the door?\", and they said, \"Dude, you're weird! Let's go play basketball.\" Maybe, like me, when you were in high school you read science fiction and wondered whether an entirely alien moral code might be as legitimate as our own, and this prevented you from taking your World History teacher entirely seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a deep-down philosophy dork, then you might have a certain underappreciated asset: a philosophically-tuned sense of what's <i>fun</i>. You should trust that sense of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's fun -- at least <i>I</i> find it fun -- to think about whether there's some way <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-external-world-further-experimental.html\">to prove that the external world exists</a>. It's fun to see whether ethics books are any less likely to be stolen than other philosophy books. (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsBooks.htm\">They're actually <i>more </i>likely to be stolen,</a>\u00a0it turns out.) It's fun to think about <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DreamB&amp;W.htm\">why people used to say they dreamed in black and white</a>, to think about <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/SelfUcs.htm\">how weirdly self-ignorant people often are</a>, to think about <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm\">what sorts of bizarre aliens might be conscious</a>, to think about <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/GradBel.htm\">whether babies know that things continue exist outside of their perceptual fields</a>.\u00a0At every turn in my career, I have faced choices about whether to pursue what seems to me to be boring, respectable, philosophically mainstream, and at first glance the better career choice, or whether instead to follow my sense of fun. Rarely have I regretted it in the long term when I have chosen fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see three main reasons a philosophy dork should trust her sense of fun:<br/>\n<br/>\n(1.) If you truly are a philosophy dork in the sense I intend the phrase -- and I assume most readers of this blog are (consider: <i>this</i> is how you're spending your free time?!) -- then your sense of what's fun will tend to manifest some sort of attunement to what really is philosophically worth pursuing. You might not be able quite to put your finger on why it's worth pursuing, at first. It might even just seem a pointless intellectual lark. But my experience is that the deeper significance will eventually reveal itself. Maybe it's just that <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/01/for-all-x-theres-philosophy-of-x.html\">everything can be explored philosophically and brought around back to main themes</a>, if one plunges deep enough. But I'm inclined to think it's not <i>just</i> that. The true dork's mind has a horse-sense of where it needs to go next.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2.) It energizes you. Few things are more dispiriting than doing something tedious because \"it's good for your career\". You'll find yourself wondering whether this is really the career for you, whether you're really cut out for philosophy. You'll find yourself procrastinating, checking Facebook, spacing out while reading, prioritizing other responsibilities. In contrast, if you chase the fun first, you will find yourself positively eager, at a visceral level, to do your research. And this eagerness can then be harnessed back into a sense of responsibility. Finding your weird passion first, and figuring out what you want to say about it, can energize you to go back later and read what others have said about your topic, so you can fill in the references, connect it with previous research, sophisticate your view in light of others' work. It's much more rewarding to read the great philosophers, and one's older contemporaries, when you have a lens to read them through than when you're slogging through them from a vague sense of duty.<br/>\n<br/>\n(3.) Fun is contagious. So is boredom. Readers are unlikely to enjoy your work and be enthusiastic about your ideas, if even <i>you </i>don't have that joy and enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese remarks probably generalize across disciplines. I think of Richard Feynman's description of how he recovered from his early-career doldrums (see the last fifth of <a href=\"http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/52/2/dignified.htm\">this autobiographical essay</a>).</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/01/on-trusting-your-sense-of-fun.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-01-02T14:01:00-08:00\">2:01 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4888664706371156653\" onclick=\"\">16\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, November 06, 2012</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5540869684469037622\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/11/tips-for-writing-philosophy-papers.html\">Tips for Writing Philosophy Papers</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>In my undergraduate classes, I normally distribute tips for writing philosophy papers along with my essay assignments. Perhaps others will find these tips helpful.<p>\n<b>General Instructions on Writing Philosophy Papers</b><p>\n\nPhilosophy papers can take a variety of forms; no single formula suffices to describe them all.  However, most philosophy papers are built around two components: textual analysis and critical discussion.  The simplest and most common form of a philosophy paper is the presentation of a particular author\u2019s point of view, coupled with an argument against that view.  Another common form is to contrast the views of two authors on a particular issue and to support one author\u2019s view against the other.<p>\n<i>The first element: textual analysis.</i>  The first element of a successful philosophy paper is an accurate, sympathetic, and cogent presentation of a point of view \u2013 typically the point of view of one or more of the authors we have been reading in the class.  For longer papers, you should probably present not only a sketch of the author\u2019s position, but also, as sympathetically as possible, some of the reasons the author gives for accepting his or her view.  You might also offer your own, or others\u2019, arguments supporting the author\u2019s view.  Using your own fresh examples, in the context of more abstract exposition, can especially effectively convey your command of the material.<p>\nYou should put special care into accurately representing views with which you disagree, since it is tempting to oversimplify or caricature such views.  You should also use citations to support your analysis (see below).<p>\n<i>The second element: critical discussion.</i>  The second element of a successful philosophy paper is a critical discussion of the view (or views) presented.  A plausible argument must be mounted either for or against at least one point of view.  In constructing this argument, you may use ideas from the readings, lectures, class discussion, or any other source.  When using an idea that you obtained from someone else, you must cite the source (see below).  While it is not expected in most cases that you will discover wholly novel arguments, you will be expected to put the arguments in your own words, take your own angle on them, and use your own examples, going deeper into at least one issue or objection than we have in class.  You should also bear in mind how an opponent might respond to your argument.  The best papers often explicitly develop a potential line of criticism against the view the student favors and then show how the view advocated can withstand that criticism.  (Of course, it is of little value to do this if the criticism anticipated is too weak to be advocated by thoughtful opponents of your position.)  One or two powerful criticisms developed in convincing detail is almost always better than a barrage of quick criticisms treated superficially.  Students sometimes relegate their critical discussion to the last paragraph or last page of their papers.  Generally, that is a mistake.  This is what the rest of the paper is building towards.  Spend some time with it; work it out in detail.<p>\n\nOne common mistake is to simply state (or restate) your position, or the position of one of the authors, as your critical discussion.  Instead, you should mount an argument that brings new considerations to bear or shows some specific weakness in the position or argument you are criticizing.  Give <i>reasons</i> for accepting the view you endorse.<p>\n<i>Sentences.</i>  You should separately evaluate each sentence of your paper along the following three dimensions.<p>\n\n(1.) Is it clear?  Although philosophers such as Kant and Heidegger are notorious for their opacity, opacity is not generally accepted in student papers.  It should be clear what every sentence means, on the face of it.  Avoid technical terms as much as is feasible.  When you do use a technical term, for the most part it should be clearly defined in advance.  Generally speaking, you should aim to write so that an intelligent person with no background in philosophy can understand most of your paper.<p>\n\n(2.) Is it true or plausible?  Every claim you make in a philosophy paper \u2013 indeed, every element of every claim \u2013 should be either true or plausibly true.  Claims that are true or plausible on their face (e.g., \u201cdamage to the brain can affect the capacity to think\u201d) may be offered without further support.  Claims likely to be questioned by an alert reader (e.g., \u201cnothing immaterial can cause the motion of a material object\u201d) should either precede or be preceded by some sort of consideration or argument in support, although in some cases the support may be fairly simple or preliminary, especially if the point is subsidiary or taken for granted by all the relevant parties.<p>\n\n(3.) Is it relevant?  Often, the aim of a philosophy paper is to criticize the view of some particular author.  In that case, most of the sentences should serve either to articulate relevant parts of the view that is to be criticized, or they should somehow support the criticism, or they should serve summary or \u201csignpost\u201d functions.  In longer papers, digressions and speculations, if they are of sufficient interest, are also acceptable.  In more purely interpretive papers, relevance may be harder to assess, but generally you should try to confine yourself either to a single interpretive thesis (e.g., \u201cDescartes would not have accepted Malebranche\u2019s occasionalism\u201d) or you should focus on a narrow enough range of ideas that you can present an insightfully deep exploration of one aspect of the author\u2019s view (as opposed to a scattered, superficial treatment).<p>\n<i>Paragraphs.</i>  The basic unit of writing is not the sentence but the paragraph.  As a general rule, every major point deserves its own paragraph.  To make a claim <i>clear </i>it is often desirable to do at least one of the following: Restate it in different words, qualify and delimit it, contrast it to a related point with which it may be confused, present an example of its application, or expand it into several subpoints.  To make a claim <i>plausible</i>, it is often desirable to present an example or application, show how it is supported by another claim that is plausible on the face of it, rephrase it in a way that brings out its commonsensicality, or cite an author who supports it.  In your critical discussion, it is generally desirable that every major objection you raise receive at least a full paragraph of explanation.<p>\n\nIf you treat the paragraph as the basic unit of writing, you will find that only a few points can truly be made well in any one paper, and five or even seven pages will start to seem (if it does not already) a narrow stricture.<p>\n<i>Preparation for the paper.</i>  In preparing for the paper, I advise that you review the readings and notes relevant to the topic in question.  If you have thought of what you consider to be a convincing objection to something in the texts or the lectures, you might want to build your paper around that, carefully describing the view or argument you oppose and then showing why you think we ought not accept that view or argument.  If you raise your objection in class discussion, in office hours, or in discussion with friends, then you can see whether others find it convincing and perhaps how someone who disagrees with you would be inclined to respond.<p>\n<i>Use of sources.</i>  Frequent citations should be used to back up the claims you make in your paper, both in describing an author\u2019s view and in mounting your criticisms, if you depend on the ideas of other people in doing so.  Citations serve two purposes: (1.) They credit people for their views, omission of this credit being plagiarism.  (2.) If I disagree with your interpretation or recollection of what an author has said, a page reference allows me to check what you have said against the text \u2013 otherwise, in cases of disagreement I will have simply to assume that you are mistaken.  Citations to particular authors and pages should be included parenthetically in the text, and the bulk of your references should be <i>paraphrases, not direct quotations</i>.  Quotes take a lot of space and do not make clear what it is you mean to highlight or extract from the quoted passage, nor do they effectively convey that you understand the quoted material.<p>\n\nBelow are two examples of parenthetical citation format for paraphrases.  Both are written in the student's own words, not quoting from but rather conveying the crucial idea of the cited text:<p>\n\nIt might be thought that materialism cannot be true because people can talk quite intelligently about mental states without knowing anything about brain states \u2013 without even believing that the brain is involved in thinking.  Consider, however, the case of lightning as an electrical discharge: One can talk intelligently about lightning without knowing about electrical discharges, but this does not prove that lightning is not an electrical discharge (Smart, p. 171).<p>\n\nOr:<p>\n\nIn support of the view that the mind continues to exist after death, Paterson cites evidence from reports of near-death experiences.  Occasionally, Paterson claims, people who have near-death experiences report details of objects and places it would have been impossible for them normally to observe, such as friends unexpectedly arriving in the hospital waiting room (p. 146).<p>\n\nIt is not necessary to appeal to secondary sources in discussing your interpretation of the texts.  If you do choose to refer to such sources, you should always make your own judgment about whether what they say is plausible and back up your judgment, if possible, with references to the primary texts.  Information found on the internet should be treated with special caution.  Wikipedia is an unreliable source for philosophy; the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is usually much better.  If you find information on the internet that in any way informs your paper, you should be certain to cite it (including the U.R.L.) as you would any other sort of secondary material.<p>\n<i>Audience.</i>  Imagine the audience of your paper to be a mediocre student taking this class.  You need not explain such basic things as who Descartes is.  However, you should not assume that your reader has any more than the most rudimentary acquaintance with the texts and arguments or any knowledge at all of literature not assigned in the class.  Jargon should be minimized.  When you do use jargon, explain carefully what you mean by it.<p>\n<i>Introductions.</i>  For such a short paper, there is no need for a general introduction to the issues or the particular thinkers being discussed.  Get right to the point.  The first paragraph should probably contain an explicit statement of what you take your primary point or points to be.  There is no need to keep the reader in suspense.<p>\n<i>Drafts, outlines, sketches.</i>  Many people find it helpful to create an outline of the paper before writing.  At a minimum, one should have a general idea, in advance, of the main points one will make.  One potential danger with outlines for philosophy papers is that it is often difficult to judge in advance the proper amount of time to spend on any particular sub-claim.  Brief sketches of one\u2019s main points and arguments \u2013 e.g., a summary of the main project of the paper in one or two paragraphs \u2013 are sometimes more helpful.  Once you have completed the paper, it can be very rewarding to set it aside for a few days and then return to it, rewriting it from scratch from the beginning.  Such rewriting forces you to rethink every sentence afresh as you retype it, which generally results in a clearer, tighter, and more coherent paper.  (I rewrite my own essays multiple times before submitting them for publication.)</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/11/tips-for-writing-philosophy-papers.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2012-11-06T11:37:00-08:00\">11:37 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5540869684469037622\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, February 15, 2012</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3170759495871291723\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/02/surprising-and-disappointing-predictors.html\">The Surprising and Disappointing Predictors of Success in UCR's Philosophy PhD Program</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Well, surprising and disappointing to me at least!  You might be neither surprised or disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the background: I'm on the UCR Philosophy PhD admissions committee again this year.  I'm a fan of treating senior-year GPA in philosophy as a crucially important part of an application.  Here's the kind of thing I tend to say to other members of the admissions committee: \"For each A-minus, imagine an unwritten letter saying that this student isn't quite top notch and not really ready for a PhD program in philosophy\".  I'm also a fan of not putting too much weight on the reputation of students' undergrad institutions.  I'm cheering <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/10/sorry-cal-state-students-no-princeton.html\">for the Cal State underdogs</a>.  And the GRE I'm inclined to regard as having no predictive value once GPA, writing sample, and letters of recommendation are factored in.  (I compare GRE to the bench press as a predictor of athletic performance.  If you knew nothing else, it would be somewhat predictive, but once you've seen the person in the field, it really doesn't matter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing an empirically-minded philosopher, though, I'm not happy with mere armchair plausibility.  So I thought I could give extra weight to my arguments by looking at how current UCR grad-student performance relates to undergrad GPA, to undergrad institution of origin, and to GRE scores.  The staff in the department office kindly provided me with data for all grad students from the entering class of 2007 to the present.  This is only 37 students total (with some missing cells), but I thought I might at least pick up some trends.  My two measures of academic success at UCR are GPA in the program (setting 3.5 as a floor because of two outliers with some Fs) and whether the student dropped out of the program.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like everything I thought I knew is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>I couldn't make undergrad GPA predictive</b>.  I tried several different ways.  I tried including undergrad GPA for all students and I tried excluding those who had done some master's work before coming to UCR.  When overall GPA didn't work I asked the staff to recode the data with just senior-year GPA in philosophy courses.  Still no correlation.  Maybe on a much larger sample GPA would show up as predictive, but on this sample it's not even close, not even close to close.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo important caveats: First, <i>all </i>the students had excellent undergrad GPAs (except for one who repaired with a Master's degree).  We're comparing 3.7's vs. 3.9's here, not 3.0's vs. 3.9's.  In philosophy courses, their GPAs are even better: Median senior year philosophy GPA was 3.91.  So surely this is a ceiling effect of some sort.  Still, in my mind, 50% A-minuses in senior-year philosophy looks very different in a PhD application than does straight A's in senior-year philosophy.  I would have thought the second sort of student much more promising overall.  Second: The students with relatively lower GPA's who were nonetheless admitted (and thus the only students in this sample) presumably had especially excellent letters and writing samples, to help compensate for their disadvantage in GPA relative to other applicants.  So maybe that's the explanation.  (See, I just can't abandon my opinion!)<br/>\n<br/>\nEqually annoyingly, given my biases, the <b>verbal section of the GRE was highly predictive</b>.  (Math was not predictive.)  Verbal GRE score correlates at .49 with graduate student GPA in Philosophy at UCR (p = .004).  Our students' median verbal GRE score is 680.  Those who scored above median have a mean UCR GPA of 3.91.  Those who scored median or below have a mean UCR GPA of 3.76 (t test, p = .001).  (Yes, we mostly give our PhD students grades ranging from B+ to A.  If you're getting mostly A-minuses and B-pluses in our program, you're \"struggling\".)  This shows up especially strikingly in a 2x2 split-half analysis.  11/14 (79%) of students with above-median verbal GREs have above-median GPAs in our program, while only 5/18 (28%) of students with at-or-below-median verbal GREs have above-median GPAs in our program (chi-square, p = .004).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also a trend for <b>overall GRE score to predict sticking with the program</b>: Dropouts had a mean GRE of 1243.  Non-dropouts had a mean GRE of 1385.  (This was not statistically significant, partly because the dropout group had much higher GRE variance, messing up straightforward application of the t test; p = .13, p = .01 assuming equal variances.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd <b>reputation of undergrad institution was predictive of GPA in our program</b>.  Students whose undergrad institution is a US News top-50 National University or top-25 National Liberal Arts College had a mean 3.91 GPA at UCR, while those not from those elite institutions had a mean GPA of 3.77 (t test, p = .01, equal variance not assumed).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one bright spot for my preconceptions was this: <b>Students with graduate-level training</b> (usually an MA) before entering UCR <b>tended to do well</b> in the program.  Their GPA was 3.87, compared to 3.77 for students with no prior graduate-level training (t test, p = .06); and they were much less likely to drop out: 1/18 (6%) vs. 8/19 (42%) (chi-square, p = .01).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm tempted to claim the philosopher's prerogative of rejecting empirical evidence I don't like and sticking with my armchair intuitions.  Surely there's something in Kant I can use to prove a priori from principles of pure reason that undergrad GPA is more important than GRE!  One thought is this: Since we don't take GRE very seriously in admissions and we do take undergrad GPA very seriously, whatever predictiveness GRE has isn't washed out through the admissions process in the way that the predictive value of GPA probably is to some extent washed out (per caveat 2 in the GPA discussion).  If we started taking GRE very seriously in admissions, its predictive value among admitted students might vanish, since those with low GREs would have to be all the more excellent in the other dimensions of their application.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd be interested to hear if other professors at PhD have similar data, and whether they find similar results.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/02/surprising-and-disappointing-predictors.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2012-02-15T18:00:00-08:00\">6:00 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3170759495871291723\" onclick=\"\">31\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, October 18, 2011</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"473166318238408031\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/10/graduate-school-application-advice.html\">Graduate School Application Advice</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Readers interested in graduate school in philosophy might be interested to see my seven-part series on PhD admissions, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/applying-to-phd-programs-in-philosophy.html\">collected here</a>.  It's time to start thinking about the application process, if you're aiming to begin a PhD program in fall 2012.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor advice on applying to Master's programs, see the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/09/applying-to-ma-programs-in-philosophy.html\">guest post</a> by <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/philosophy/faculty/schwartz.cfm\">Robert Schwartz</a> of <a href=\"http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Philosophy/index.html\">University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy impression is that admissions are somewhat more competitive in recessions than in boom times, since there are fewer options outside of academia to draw top students out of the applicant pool.  Regarding the job market for newly minted philosophy PhDs, we should probably think of the period from about 1999-2007, bruising and competitive though it was, as boom times unlikely to be replicated in the near future.  So don't be misled by departments' placement records from that period.  On the other hand, the horrible job market of the past two years is probably also an aberration.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/10/graduate-school-application-advice.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2011-10-18T08:38:00-07:00\">8:38 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=473166318238408031\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, September 22, 2009</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4039616442831640840\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/09/applying-to-ma-programs-in-philosophy.html\">Applying to MA Programs in Philosophy</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>by guest blogger <a href=\"http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Philosophy/faculty/schwartz.html\">Robert Schwartz</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Philosophy/index.html\">Department of Philosophy, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee</a><br/><br/><i>Disclaimer</i><br/><br/>Although I will try to speak in generalities, my knowledge of MA programs is based primarily on my experience as chair of admissions at UWM.  Thus some of my remarks may not generalize. For example, the criteria our admissions committee uses in evaluating applicants may not be the same as that of other schools. <br/><br/><i>Kinds of Programs</i><br/><br/>There are essentially three types of MA programs:<br/><br/>1. Those that are part of PhD programs<br/><br/>Comment- Unless they indicate otherwise, by and large these programs do not focus on placing students in PhD programs, including their own.<br/> <br/>2. Those that are geared mainly toward awarding terminal degrees in philosophy<br/><br/>Comment- These schools are not appropriate for someone wishing to go on for a PhD in philosophy.<br/><br/>3. Those that focus on placing students in PhD programs<br/><br/>Comment- These schools are appropriate, and my remarks will be limited to such programs.<br/> <br/><i>Who should apply to these MA programs?</i><br/><br/>The commitment and reasons for pursuing an MA degree are not necessarily the same as those for pursuing a PhD.  With few exceptions those seeking PhD\u2019s in philosophy wish to have academic careers. At UWM almost all of our students have such plans, but not all do.  Some intend to apply to law school, some are unsure of their career plans and wish to determine whether philosophy and teaching are what they really want, some may not want to pursue a research career but hope to teach philosophy in high schools, etc.<br/><br/>I would advise anyone who is determined to pursue a career in academia to look at the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/applying-to-phd-programs-in-philosophy.html\">applying to PhD programs</a> post.  This site provides a thoughtful and forthright assessment of the difficulties achieving this goal.  I might add that although ES is right to stress the advantages of attending a \u201ctop ranked\u201d or \u201cprestigious\u201d PhD program, I think the picture he paints of the alternatives may be overly bleak.<br/><br/><i>MA program as opposed to a PhD program</i><br/> <br/>Students have various reasons/strategies for applying to MA programs. <br/><br/> 1. They do not have sufficient background in philosophy to gain direct admission to a   PhD program or to a PhD program that suits their needs.<br/><br/>Comment- Some, including very good, PhD programs will consider non-philosophy majors if they have strong undergraduate records and have background in areas related to philosophy, for example, math, linguistics or psychology.  However, even if a PhD program is willing to consider such students, it is often difficult for them to evaluate the student\u2019s philosophical abilities from their undergrad records, letters, etc.<br/><br/>In general, I think it most advisable for students who fall into this first category to consider seriously the MA route.  MA programs will be much more willing to take a \u201cgamble\u201d on such students.  Attending an MA program will mean that you will not be eliminated by PhD programs on the grounds that you do not have sufficient background in philosophy.  Preparation in an MA program may also make it less likely you will feel in over your head or behind your fellow students.  Indeed, you have a good chance of being better prepared than others admitted to the program. <br/><br/>2. As a safety school in case they do not get into a PhD program.<br/><br/>Comment- Given the vagaries and long odds of being accepted at one\u2019s first choice(s), it is a good policy to apply to safety schools when applying to either MA or PhD programs.  Students, though, should consider in advance if the safety schools are ones they would actually accept if they do not get into a program of their choice.  Students should also take into account that admissions into a MA program may be more competitive than at many PhD programs -- more competitive not only in terms of number of applicants but in terms of the strength of records of the applicants.  Students who fail to gain admissions into our MA program are often successful in being admitted to PhD programs.<br/><br/>3. To improve their chances of being accepted at better PhD programs.<br/><br/>Comment- This strategy makes sense in some cases, but is not to be relied on.  First, MA programs do not get students into PhD programs.  A student\u2019s ability, work habits, performance in the program, GRE scores, etc. do.  MA programs do help better prepare a student for PhD work and can help with the application process. Second, the top schools are so competitive that one\u2019s chances of being admitted are slim no matter how good a student\u2019s record is. Third, students who apply and are accepted into PhD programs should consider seriously whether it is wise to give up a bird in the hand for the possibility of doing better after attending an MA program.<br/><br/>Before making such a decision I advise students to ask themselves the following:   Although the PhD program is not one of your preferred schools, does it look as if it will be able to fulfill your academic needs?  Will you have regrets or keep second-guessing your decision to attend the less than \u201cideal\u201d PhD program? Will you feel the other students in the program are not on your level and thus holding back your education and job prospects?  Suppose you attend an MA program and in the end are not admitted to a PhD program better than the one you turned down, will you feel your MA studies were a waste of your time?<br/><br/><i>PhD programs' views of applicants with MA\u2019s</i><br/><br/>Until MA programs were developed that focused specifically on preparing students for PhD programs students who took MA\u2019s rather than applying to PhD programs after their undergraduate degree were often looked upon with some skepticism. Things have changed now, but not everywhere. Some PhD programs seem to continue with old assumptions.  From my experience at UWM, for example, there are several schools that have not admitted our students no matter how good they are.  We have had students who have gotten into many/all of the very top PhD programs and are turned down (not even put on a waiting list) by schools that are ranked lower or much lower.  Also some PhD programs are skittish/reluctant to admit students who do not come from a prestigious undergraduate school.  Completing a good MA program can reduce their concerns, but the \u201cglow\u201d factor that results from having an undergraduate degree from a prestigious university often does have an influence.<br/><br/>In sum, attending a good MA program will improve your philosophical skills, background and for many students their confidence. Not having PhD students, an MA program can provide much one-on-one attention. This enables the program to better tailor its courses and a student\u2019s course of study to fit his or her individual needs.  Moreover, MA programs have a lot of experience guiding students through the admissions process. At UWM the department as a whole, not merely a student\u2019s advisor, plays a role helping  students decide where to apply, balancing their application list in terms of admission probabilities, advising them on the choice of writing sample to submit and counseling  them in their acceptance decisions.  We also provide a good deal of personalized guidance walking a student through the application/admissions process and keeping an eye on problems that may develop along the way.<br/><br/>As the placement records of many MA programs show, students from MA programs are increasingly being admitted to top schools.  In the case of UWM the talent and accomplishments of students we have sent to schools has often led these schools to look favorably on our graduates. I think a similar advantage would hold for students attending other MA programs.<br/><br/><i>MA Completion and Placement Records</i><br/><br/>Students should try to get information about the program\u2019s completion record; these do vary from program to program. Student should also check the placement records of the MA program, especially how they have performed in recent years.  Comparing this data is not always easy as the schools use different methods of counting and provide different information.  Some do not break the data down by year; so the record will reflect many years of placement, not the performance in any particular year. Some may be selective in reporting or list not only the school's students attend but all acceptances. Hence if one student was admitted to numerous very good schools it can skew the data.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier MA programs do not get students into PhD programs; they prepare them to apply.  Thus placement records reflect the quality of the students enrolled in the program, and this can vary from year to year.  UWM\u2019s success in placing students at top programs is largely due to the strength of the students in the program. Many who apply to UWM do so in the hope that it will enable them to be admitted to a better program.  They probably could and some in fact have been admitted to pretty good PhD programs.  I have indicated above my thoughts on the pros and cons of gambling that they will be admitted to a better school.<br/><br/><i>MA Applications and Admissions</i><br/><br/>Much information is likely to be found on a program\u2019s web site concerning the application process, requirements, the nature of the program and the faculty. Check this for suitability to your needs.  At UWM our primary criterion for selecting students is our assessment of the student\u2019s <i>potential</i> for work in philosophy.  We do not require students be philosophy majors or have even taken philosophy courses.  A good number of students who have been most successful in gaining admission to top PhD programs fall into this category.<br/><br/>Our admission decisions are most influenced by the writing sample and letters of recommendation. The student\u2019s statement of purpose is important, too, in that it provides background information that can help us assess the student\u2019s overall record, as well as determine if the student\u2019s goals, interests and areas of study fit our program. We have no set standards for GRE scores and grades.  They play a role only after our overall assessment of a student\u2019s talents. GRE\u2019s tend to play a much greater role in PhD admissions. We urge student who do not have very good GRE\u2019s to retake them before applying to PhD programs. There are, however, quite good US, Canadian and UK schools that do not require GRE scores.<br/><br/>At UWM we do not give much weight per se to the undergraduate school the student has attended, but as in the case of PhD programs it does play some role in assessment. Attending a high-powered school usually means a student has a long standing record of high achievement and her or his general abilities have to some extent been \u201cprescreened\u201d.   A school\u2019s status can also affect how letters of recommendation and other materials are evaluated.  For example, if a letter writer says the student is in the top 10% of recent graduates it can be harder to evaluate the significance of the fact when the letter comes from a school with little track record as opposed to a school that consistently produces strong philosophy majors.  It is also likely members of the admissions committee will know more about the background and standards of the person writing the letter if the person is from a well-known program.<br/><br/><i>Letters</i><br/><br/>The better the writer knows you and your work and will take the time to spell it out, the more useful the letter. Since many of our applicants have little formal training in philosophy we recognize that not all the letters may come from philosophers.  Informative letters from non-philosophers are reviewed like any others but there often are two problems evaluating them. 1. At times the letters are from a professor who had you in a course that is not readily related to philosophy. 2. The course work is on a more philosophical topic, but the instructor has little background in philosophy and evaluates your work in terms of that are not very informative about your philosophical talents.  <br/><br/>Also if a student has, say, had only one philosophy course the letter or the student\u2019s statement of purpose should spell out how this minimal background has led the student to undertake the study of philosophy at the graduate level.<br/><br/><i>Writing Sample</i><br/><br/>It is hard to evaluate a student\u2019s philosophical potential if the paper submitted is only tangentially on a philosophical topic or examined from a non-philosophical perspective.  Most of the papers submitted to our program were written originally for a course.  Do not assume that the paper that received the best grade is the best to send. Grading varies from instructor to instructor and that paper may not best informatively reflect your potential. Speak to your instructor and your undergraduate advisor about the paper you intend to submit and what you may want to do to improve it.<br/><br/>Papers that although good are mainly repeats of course content or simply follow the readings give less indication of the student\u2019s talents than one that shows independent research and an attempt to say something of your own. Similarly papers that largely lay out A\u2019s and B\u2019s position and declare a winner in the debate tend not to make the best case for the student\u2019s philosophical research skills. <br/><br/><i>Admissions Decisions</i><br/><br/>Below are the Council of Graduate School guidelines for decision dates that most, but not all, MA and PhD programs go by:<blockquote>Acceptance of an offer of financial support (such as a graduate scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship) for the next academic year by a prospective or enrolled graduate student completes an agreement that both student and graduate school expect to honor. In that context, the conditions affecting such offers and their acceptance must be defined carefully and understood by all parties.<br/><br/>Students are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15; earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. In those instances in which a student accepts an offer before April 15, and subsequently desires to withdraw that acceptance, the student may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 15 commits the student not to accept another offer without first obtaining a written release from the institution to which a commitment has been made. Similarly, an offer by an institution after April 15 is conditional on presentation by the student of the written release from any previously accepted offer. It is further agreed by the institutions and organizations subscribing to the above Resolution that a copy of this Resolution should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer.</blockquote>Waiting to hear about admission decisions can be very stressful and not all MA and PhD programs do much to alleviate the pressure.  To some extent though students frequently expect more or more definite information before a department really knows what to tell the student.  Different MA and PhD programs operate on different time schedules. Once a department accepts and offers to support a student she or he has until April 15 to respond.  Naturally the student does not want to make a decision until all the facts are in. So if the student is still in the running for a place at a school she or he would prefer they can and most frequently do delay until April 15.<br/><br/>It is also the case that schools have different policies concerning waiting lists.  Usually no school gets acceptances from all those admitted. Some admit more than they want assuming that in the end they will have about as many acceptances as they aim for. Other universities only admit the number of students they are aiming for and put others who they think have a good chance of being accepted on a waiting list.  Schools also adopt different policies as to the number of students they put on their waiting lists.  This may be determined by their past experience as to how far they have usually gone down their list before filling the class.  Some MA and PhD programs less certain of the likely percent of acceptances or not wanting to take chances put a very large number of applicants on their waiting list.  And they may not let those on the list know their fate or even where they stand until they actually fill the class.  In any case departments often do not know how far they will actually go down their waiting list until quite late, since many students do not make their decisions until April 15.<br/><br/><i>Blogs</i><br/><br/>There are a number of student blogs that provide useful information about a school\u2019s practices, acceptance policies and also attempt to keep track of who has been accepted, rejected or put on waiting lists.  One must be careful depending on this information, as it is not always accurate.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/09/applying-to-ma-programs-in-philosophy.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2009-09-22T09:33:00-07:00\">9:33 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4039616442831640840\" onclick=\"\">39\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice\" rel=\"tag\">advice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/applying%20to%20grad%20school\" rel=\"tag\">applying to grad school</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/advice?updated-max=2009-09-22T09:33:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=15&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

Thursday 4-6 I'm commenting on Wayne Wu's \"Introspection as Attention and Action\".  This post is adapted from those comments.<p>\n\n(Also Wed 6 pm I'm presenting my paper \"A Pragmatic Approach to the Metaphysics of Belief\" and Sat 6-9 I'm critic in an author-meets-critics on Jay Garfield's <i>Engaging Buddhism</i>.  Feel free to stop by!)<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------<p>\n\nWhat does <b>introspective attention to one's perceptual experiences amount to?</b>  As I look at my desk, I can attend to or think about my ongoing sensory experiences, reaching judgments about their quality or character.  For example, I'm visually experiencing a brownish, slightly complicated oblong shape in my visual periphery (which I know to be my hat).  I'm having auditory experience of my coffee-maker spitting and bubbling as it brews the pot.  What exactly am I doing, in the process of reaching these judgments?<p>  \n\nOne thing that I'm <i>not </i>doing, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~waynewu/My_Academic_Site/Home.html\">Wayne Wu</a>, is launching a new process, distinct from the perceptual processes of seeing the hat and hearing the coffee-maker, which turns an \"attentional spotlight\" upon those perceptual processes.  <b>Introspective attention</b>, Wu argues -- and I agree -- <b>is a matter of applying phenomenal concepts in the course of ordinary perceiving</b>, with the goal of arriving at a judgment about your perceptual experience -- doing so in a way that isn't radically different from the way in which, according to your goals, you can aim to categorize the things you perceive along any of several different dimensions.<p>\n\nI hope the following is a Wu-friendly way of developing the idea.  Suppose you're looking at a coffee mug.  You can do so with any of a variety of perceptual goals in mind.  You can look at it with the aim of noticing details about its color -- its precise shade and how consistent or variable its color is across its face.  You can look at it with the aim of noticing details of its shape.  You can look at it with the aim of thinking about how it could effectively be used as a weapon.  You can look at it with a critical aesthetic eye.  Each of these aims is a way of attending differently to the mug, resulting in judgments that employ different conceptual categories.<p>\n\nYou can also look at the mug with an introspective aim, or rather with one of several introspective aims.  You can look at the mug with the aim of reaching conclusions about what your<i> visual experience</i> is as you look at the mug rather than with the aim of reaching conclusions about the physical mug itself.  You might be interested in noticing your experience of the mug's color, possibly distinct from mug's real color.  According to Wu, this is not a process radically different from ordinary acts of perception.  Introspection your visual experience of the color or shape of the mug is <b>not a two-stage process that consists of <i>first </i>perceiving the mug and then <i>second </i> of introspecting the experiences that arise in the course of that perceptual act.</b><p>\n\nThe approach Wu and I favor is especially attractive in thinking about what the early introspective psychologists <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_B._Titchener\">E.B. Titchener</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Boring\">E.G. Boring</a> called \"R-error\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1413768\">stimulus error</a>\".  Imagine that you're lying on your stomach and an experimenter is gently poking the bare skin of your back with either one or two toothpicks.  You might have one of two different tasks.  An <i>objective</i> task would be to guess whether you are being poked by only one toothpick or instead by both toothpicks at once.  You answer with either \"one\" or \"two\".  It's easy to tell that you're being poked by two if the toothpicks are several centimeters apart, but once they are brought close enough together, the task becomes difficult.  Two toothpicks placed within a centimeter of each other on your back are likely to feel like only a single toothpick.  The <i>objective</i> task would be to guess how many toothpicks you are being poked with in reality.<p>\n\nAn <i>introspective</i> task might be very similar but with a crucial difference: You are asked to report whether you have <i>tactile experience</i> of two separate regions of pressure or only one region.  Again you might answer \"one\" or \"two\".  This is of course not the same as the objective task.  You're reporting not on facts about the toothpicks but rather on facts about your experience of the toothpicks.  The objective task and the introspective task have different truth conditions.  For example if two toothpicks are pressed to your back only 6 millimeters apart and you say \"one\" you've given the wrong answer if your task is objective but quite possibly the right answer if your task is introspective.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_aa_x4C25wk/Vvq8f5yUg-I/AAAAAAAABT0/DsA8M8EIc-gZLta2my-42iXmo17gq-vOw/s1600/Edwin_G._Boring.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_aa_x4C25wk/Vvq8f5yUg-I/AAAAAAAABT0/DsA8M8EIc-gZLta2my-42iXmo17gq-vOw/s400/Edwin_G._Boring.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n[Edwin G. Boring in 1961]<p>\n\nHere's the thing that Titchener and Boring noticed, which they repeatedly warn against in their discussions of introspective methodology: People very easily slide back and forth between the introspective task and the objective task.  It's not entirely natural to keep them distinct in your mind over the course of a long series of stimuli.  You might be assigned the introspective task, for example, and start saying \"one\", \"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"two\", \"two\", \"two\" -- at first your intentions are clearly introspective, but then by the thirtieth trial you have slipped into the more familiar objective way of responding and you're just guessing how many toothpicks there actually are, rather than reporting introspectively.  If you've slipped from the introspective to the objective mode of reporting, you've committed what Titchener and Boring call <i>stimulus error</i>.<p>\n\nFor Wu's and my view, the crucial point is this: It's very easy to shift unintentionally between the two ways of deploying your perceptual faculties.  In fact I'm inclined to think -- I don't know if Wu would agree with me about this -- that <b>for substantial stretches of the experiment your intentions might be vague enough that there's no determinate fact about the content of your utterances.</b>  Is your \"one\" really a report about your experience or a report about the world outside?  It might be kind of muddy, kind of in-between.  You're just rolling along not very thoughtful of the distinction. <b> What distinguishes the introspective judgment from the perceptual judgment in this case is a kind of minor thing about your background intentions in making your report.</b><p>\n\nIntrospection of perceptual experience is perception with a twist, with an aim slightly different from the usual aim of reporting on the outside world.  That's the idea.  It's not a distinct cognitive process that begins after the perceptual act ends, ontologically distinct from the perceptual act and taking the perceptual act as its target.<p>\n\nWhen you know that your experience might be misleading, the difference can matter to your reporting.  For example, if you know that you're pretty bad at detecting two toothpicks when they're close together and you have reason to think that lots of the trials will have toothpicks close together, and if your focus is on objective reporting, you might say: \"Well, 50-50% -- might be one, might be two for all I know\".  For introspective reporting, in contrast, you might say something like \"Sure feels like one, though I know you might well actually be touching me with two\".<p>\n\nIn visual experience, noticing blurriness is similar.  Take off your glasses or cross your eyes.  You know enough about the world to know that your coffee mug hasn't become objectively vague-edged and blurry.  So you attribute the blurriness to your experience.  This is a matter of seeing the world and reaching judgments about your experience in the process.  You reach an experiential judgment rather than or in addition to an objective judgment just because of certain background facts about your cognition.  Imagine someone so naive and benighted as to think that maybe actual real-world coffee mugs do in fact become vague bordered and blurry edged when she takes off her glasses.  It seems conceivable that we could so bizarrely structure someone's environment that she actually came to adulthood thinking this.  That person might then not know whether to apply blurriness to the outward object or to her experience of the object.  <b>It's a similar perceptual act of looking at the mug, but given different background concepts and assumptions in one case she reaches an introspective attribution while in the other case she reaches an objective attribution.</b><p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Boring\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Related:<p></p></i>\n<li>\"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrospectionWhat.htm\">Introspection, What?</a>\" (2012), in D.

The headline finding is this: 270 psychologists jointly attempted to replicate the results of 100 recent studies in three top psychology journals.  In fewer than 40% of cases were the researchers able to replicate the originally reported effect.<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfgah9PkadU/VfCVjaNxU7I/AAAAAAAABBQ/TUY0uROVOxM/s1600/ReplicationTail.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-gfgah9PkadU/VfCVjaNxU7I/AAAAAAAABBQ/TUY0uROVOxM/s400/ReplicationTail.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nBut here's perhaps an even more telling finding: <b>Only 47% of the originally reported effect sizes were within the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size.</b>  In other words, if you just used the replication study as your basis for guessing the real effect size, you would not expect the real effect size to be as large the effect size originally reported.  [Note 1]  This reported result inspired me to look at the raw data, to try a related analysis that the original replication study did not appear to report: <b>What percentage of the replications find a <i>significantly lower effect size</i> than the original reported study?  By my calculations: 36/95, or 38%.</b>  [See Note 2 for what I did.]<p>\n\n(A rather surprising additional ten studies showed statistically marginal trends toward lower effect sizes, which it is tempting to interpret as combination of a non-effect with a poorly powered original study or replication.  A representative case is one study with an effect size of r = .22 on 96 participants and a replication effect size of r = .02 on 108 participants (one-tailed p value for difference between the r's = .07).  Thus, it seems likely that 38% is a conservative estimate of the tendency toward lower effect size in replications.)<p>\n\nThis study-by-study statistical comparison of effect sizes is useful because it helps distinguish the <i>file drawer problem</i> from what we might call the <i>invisible factor problem</i>.<p>\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.psychfiledrawer.org/TheFiledrawerProblem.php\">file drawer problem</a> is this: Researchers are more likely to publish statistically significant findings than findings that show no statistically significant effect.  Statistically chance results will sometimes occur, and if mostly these results are published, it might look like there's a real effect when actually there is no real effect.<p>\n\nThe <b>invisible factor problem</b> is this: There are a vast number of unreported features of every experiment.  <b>Possibly one of those unreported features, invisible to the study's readership, is an important contributor to the reported findings.</b>  In infancy research for example, it's not common to report the experimenter's pre-testing interactions with the infant, if any, but pre-testing interactions might have a big effect.  In cognitive research, it's not common to report what time of day participants performed the tasks, but time of day can influence arousal and performance.  And so on.<p>\n\nThe file drawer problem is normally managed in meta-analysis by assuming a substantial number of unpublished null-result studies (maybe five times as many as the published studies) and then seeing if the result still proves significant in a merged analysis.  But this is only an adequate approach if the only risk to be considered is a <i>chance </i>tendency for a non-effect to show up as significant in some studies.  <b>If, on the other hand, there are a large number of invisible factors, or moderators, that dependably confound studies, leading to statistically significant positive results other than by chance, standard meta-analytic file-drawer compensations will not suffice.</b>  The invisible factors might be large and non-chance, unintentionally sought out and settled upon by well-meaning researchers, perhaps even passed along teacher to student.  (\"It works best if you do it like this.\")<p>\n\nHere's how I think psychological research sometimes goes.  You try an experiment one way and it \"fails\" -- that is, it doesn't produce the hoped-for result.  So you try another way and it fails again.  So then you try a third way and it succeeds.  Maybe to make sure it's not chance, you do it that same way again and it still succeeds, so you publish.  But there might be no real underlying effect of the sort you think there is.  What you might have done is find the right set of moderating factors (time of day, nonverbal experimenter cues, whatever), to get the pattern of results you want.  If those factors are visible -- that is, reported in the published study -- then others can evaluate and critique and try to manipulate them.  <b>But if those factors are invisible, then you will have an irreproducible result, but one not due to chance.</b>  In a way this is a file-drawer effect, since null results are disproportionately non-reported, but it's one driven by biased search for experimental procedures that \"succeed\" because of real moderating factors rather than just chance fluctuations.<p>\n\nIf failure of replication in psychology is due to publishing results that by mere statistical chance happen to fall below the threshold for statistical significance, then most failed replications will not be statistically significantly different from the originally reported results -- just closer to zero and non-significant.  But <b>if the failure of replication in psychology is due to invisible moderating factors unreported in the original experiment, then failed replications with decent statistical power will tend to find significantly different results from the original experiment.</b><p>\n\nI think that is what we see.<p>\n\n[revised Sep. 10]<p>\n\n----------------------------------------<p>\n\nRelated posts:</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/what-non-effect-looks-like.html\">What a Non-Effect Looks Like</a> (Aug. 7, 2013)\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/meta-analysis-of-effect-of-religion-on.html\">Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Religion on Crime: The Missing Positive Tail</a> (Apr. 11, 2014)\n<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/psychology-research-in-age-of-social.html\">Psychology Research in the Age of Social Media</a> (Jan. 7, 2015)<p>\n\n\n----------------------------------------<p>\n\nNote 1: In no case was the original study's effect size outside the 95% interval for the replication study because the original study's effect size was too low.<p>\n\nNote 2: I used the r's and N's reported in the study's z-to-r conversions for non-excluded studies, then plugged the ones that were not obviously either significant or non-significant one-by-one into <a href=\"http://vassarstats.net/rdiff.html?\">Lowry's online calculator</a> for significant difference between correlation coefficients, using one-tailed p values and a significance threshold of p &lt; .05.

I was particularly struck by this fact on Monday when these two links popped up:\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/274046/what-wealth-does-to-your-soul\n\">What Wealth Does to Your Soul</a> (The Week)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/opinion/why-are-some-cultures-more-individualistic-than-others.html\">Wheat People vs. Rice People</a> (New York Times)</li></ul>\n\nThe links were striking to me because both of the articles reported studies that I regarded as methodologically rather weak, though interesting and fun.  It occurred to me to wonder whether <b>social media might be seriously aggravating the perennial plague of sexy but dubious psychological research</b>.<p>\n\nBelow, I will present some dubious data on this very issue!<p>\n\nBut first, why think these two studies are methodologically dubious?  [Skip the next two paragraphs if you like.]<p>\n<i>The first article</i>, on whether the rich are jerks, is based largely on a study I critiqued <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/03/on-whether-rich-are-jerks.html\">here</a>.  Among that study's methodological oddities: The researchers set up a jar of candy in their lab, ostensibly for children in another laboratory, and then measured whether wealthy participants took more candy from the jar than less-wealthy participants.  Cute!  Clever!  But here's the weird thing.  <b>Despite the fact that the jar was in their own lab, they measured candy-stealing by <em>asking</em> participants whether they had taken candy rather than by directly observing how much candy was taken.</b>  What could possibly justify this methodological decision, which puts the researchers at a needless remove from the behavior being measured and conflates honesty with theft?  The linked news article also mentions a study suggesting that expensive cars are more likely to be double-parked.  Therefore, see, the rich really are jerks!  Of course, another possibility is that the wealthy are just more willing to risk the cost of a parking ticket.<p>\n<i>The second article</i> highlights a study that examines a few recently-popular measures of \"individualistic\" vs. \"collectivistic\" thinking, such as the \"triad\" task (e.g., whether the participant pairs trains with buses [because of their category membership, supposedly individualistic] or with tracks [because of their functional relation, supposedly collectivistic] when given the three and asked to group two together).  According to the study, the northern Chinese, from wheat-farming regions, are more likely to score as individualistic than are the southern Chinese, from rice-farming regions.  A clever theory is advanced: wheat farming is individualistic, rice farming communal!  (I admit, this is a cool theory.)  How do we know <i>that difference </i>is the source of the different performance on the cognitive tasks?  Well, two alternative hypotheses are tested and found to be less predictive of \"individualistic\" performance: pathogen prevalence and regional GDP per capita.  Now, the wheat vs. rice difference is almost a perfect north-south split.  <b>Other things also differ between northern and southern China -- other aspects of cultural history, even the spoken language.</b>  So although the data fit nicely with the wheat-rice theory, many other possible explanations of the data remain unexplored.  A natural starting place might be to look at rice vs. wheat regions in other countries to see if they show the same pattern.  At best, the conclusion is premature.<p>\n\nI see the appeal of this type of work: It's fun to think that the rich are jerks, or that there are major social and cognitive differences between people based on the agricultural methods of their ancestors.  Maybe, even, the theories are true.  But it's a problem if the process by which these kinds of studies trickle into social media has much more do to with how fun the results are than with the quality of the work.  <b>I suspect the problem is especially serious if academic researchers who are not specialists in the area take the reports at face value, and if these reports then become a major part of their background sense of what psychological research has recently revealed.</b><p>\n\nHypothetically, suppose a researcher measured whether poor people are jerks by judging whether people in more or less expensive clothing were more or less likely to walk into a fast-food restaurant with a used cup and steal soda.  This would not survive peer review, and if it did get published, objections would be swift and angry.  It wouldn't propagate through Facebook, except perhaps as the butt of critical comments.  It's methodologically similar, but the social filters would be against it.  I conjecture that we should expect to find studies arguing that the rich are morally worse, or finding no difference between rich and poor, but not studies arguing that the poor are morally worse (though they might be found to have more criminal convictions or other \"bad outcomes\").  (For evidence of such a filtering effect on studies of the relationship between religion and morality, see <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/meta-analysis-of-effect-of-religion-on.html\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nNow I suspect that in the bad old days before Facebook and Twitter, popular media reports about psychology had less influence on philosophers' and psychologists' thinking about areas outside their speciality than they do now.  I don't know how to prove this, but I thought it would be interesting to look at the usage statistics on the 25 <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/reports/most-read\">most-downloaded <i>Psychological Science</i> articles</a> in December 2014 (excluding seven brief articles without links to their summary abstracts).<p>\n\nThe article with the most views of its abstracted summary was <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract\">The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand over Laptop Note Taking</a>.  Fun!  Useful!  The article had 22,389 abstract views in December, 2014.  It also had 1,320 full text or PDF downloads.  <b>Thus, it looks like at most 6% of the abstract viewers bothered to glance at the methodology. </b> (I say \"at most\" because some viewers might go straight through to the full text without viewing the abstract separately.  See below for evidence that this happens with other articles.)  Thirty-seven news outlets picked up the article, according to <i>Psychological Science</i>, tied for highest with <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/07/15/0956797614534694.abstract\">Sleep Deprivation and False Memories</a>, which had 4,786 abstract views and 645 full text or PDF downloads (at most 13% clicking through).<p>\n\nContrast these articles with the \"boring\" articles (not boring to specialists!).  The single most downloaded article was <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/11/07/0956797613504966\">The New Statistics: Why and How</a>: 1,870 abstract views, 4,717 full-text and PDF views -- more than twice as many full views as abstract views.  <i>Psychological Science </i>reports no media outlets picking this one up.  I guess people interested in statistical methods want to see the details of the articles about statistical methods.  One other article had more full views than abstract views: the ponderously titled <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/03/16/0956797611400615\">Retraining Automatic Action Tendencies Changes Alcoholic Patients\u2019 Approach Bias for Alcohol and Improves Treatment Outcome</a>: 164 abstract views and 274 full views (67% more full views than abstract views).  That article was only picked up by one media outlet.  Overall, I found a r = -.49 (p = .01) correlation between the number of news-media pickups and the log of the ratio of full-text views to abstract views.<p>\n\nI suppose it's not surprising that articles picked up by the media attract more casual readers who will view the abstract only.  I have no way of knowing that many of these readers are fellow academics in philosophy, psychology, and the other humanities and social sciences.  But <i>if</i> so, and <b>if my hypothesis is correct that academic researchers are increasingly exposed to psychological research based on Tweetability rather than methodological quality, that's bad news for the humanities and social sciences.  Even if the rich really are jerks.</b></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/01/psychology-research-in-age-of-social.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-01-07T12:31:00-08:00\">12:31 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6589484992776502736\" onclick=\"\">12\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/professional%20issues%20in%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">professional issues in philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods\" rel=\"tag\">psychological methods</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, April 11, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"839068182084067900\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/meta-analysis-of-effect-of-religion-on.html\">Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Religion on Crime: The Missing Positive Tail</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I think the most recent meta-analysis of the relationship between religosity and crime is still <a href=\"http://jrc.sagepub.com/content/38/1/3.short\">Baier and Wright 2001</a>.  I'm reviewing it again in preparation for a talk I'm giving Sunday on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/what-non-effect-looks-like.html\">what happens when there's a non-effect in psychology but researchers are disposed</a> to think there must be an effect.<p>\n\nI was struck by this graph from the Baier and Wright:<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-KGiqi-72udw/U0gTEtLr0vI/AAAAAAAAAlI/bnN5quCQLyg/s1600/BaierWright2001figure.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-KGiqi-72udw/U0gTEtLr0vI/AAAAAAAAAlI/bnN5quCQLyg/s400/BaierWright2001figure.png\"/></a></div>\n\nNote that the x-axis scale is negative, showing the predicted negative relationship between religiosity and crime.  (Religiosity is typically measured either by self-reported religious belief or by self-reported religious behavior such as attendance at weekly services.)<p>\n\nThe authors comment: <blockquote>The mean reported effect size was r = -.12 (SD = .09), and the median was r = -.11.  About two-thirds of the effects fell between -.05 and -.20, <b>and, significantly, none of them was positive.</b> (p. 14, emphasis added).</blockquote>\n\nHm, I think.  No positive tail?!  I'm not sure that I would interpret that fact the same way Baier and Wright seem to.<p>\n\nThen I think: Hey, let's try some <a href=\"http://blog.minitab.com/blog/understanding-statistics/monte-carlo-is-not-as-difficult-as-you-think\">Monte Carlos</a>!<p>\n\nBaier and Wright report 79 effect sizes from previous studies, graphed above.  Although the distribution doesn't look quite normal, I'll start my Monte Carlos by assuming normality, using B&amp;W's reported mean and SD.  Then I'll generate 10,000 sets of 79 random values (representating hypothetical effect sizes) normally distributed around that mean and standard deviation (SD).<p>\n<b>Of the 10,000 simulated distributions of 79 effect sizes with that mean and SD, only 9 distributions (0.09%) are entirely zero to negative.</b>  So I think we can conclude that it's not chance that the positive tail is missing.  Options are: (a.) The population mean is higher than B&amp;W report or the SD is lower, (b.) The distribution isn't normal, (c.) The positive effect-size studies aren't being reported.<p>\n\nMy money is on (c).  But let's try (a).  <b>How high would the mean have to be (holding SD fixed) for at least 20% of the Monte Carlos to show no positive values?</b>  In my Monte Carlos it happens between mean -.18 and -.19.  But<b> the graph above is clearly not a graph of a sample from a population with that mean</b> (which would be near the top of the fourth bar from left).  This is confirmable by a t-test on the distribution of effect sizes reported in their study (one-sample vs. -.185, p &lt; .001).  Similar considerations show that it can't be an SD issue.<p>\n\nHow about (b)?  The eyeball distribution looks a bit skewed, anyway -- maybe that's the problem?  The graph can be <b>easily unskewed simply by taking the square root</b> of the absolute values of the effect sizes.  The resulting distribution is very close to normal (both eyeball and by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson%E2%80%93Darling_test\">Anderson-Darling</a>).  <b>This delivers the desired conclusion</b>: Only 35% of my Monte Carlos end up with even a single positive-tail study, <b>but it delivers this result at the cost of making sense</b>.  Taking the square root magnifies the difference between very small effect sizes and diminishes the difference between large effect sizes, inflating the difference between a study with effect size r = .00 and a study with effect size r = -.02 to a larger magnitude difference than the difference between effect size r = -.30 and effect size r = -.47.  (All these r's are actually present in the B&amp;W dataset.)  <b>The two r = .00 studies in the B&amp;W dataset become outliers far from the three r = -.02 studies in their dataset, and it's this artificial inflation of that immaterial difference that explains the seeming Monte Carlo confirmation after the square-root \"correction\"</b>.<p>\n\nSo the best explanation would seem to be (c): We're not seeing the missing tail because, at least as of 2001, <b>the research that would be expected, even if just by chance, to show even a non-significant positive relationship between religiosity and crime simply isn't published</b>.<p>\n\nIf researchers also show a systematic bias toward publishing their research that shows the largest negative relationship between religiosity and crime, we can even get something like Baier and Wright's distribution with a mean effect size of zero.<p>\n\nHere's the way I did it: I assumed that mean effect size of religiosity on crime is 0.0 and the SD for the effect size among the studies was 0.12.  I assumed 100 researchers, 25% of whom only ran one independent analysis, 25% of whom ran 2 analyses, 25% of whom ran 4, and 25% of whom ran 8.  I assumed that each researcher published only their \"best\" result (i.e., greatest negative relationship), but only if the trend was non-positive.  I then ran 10,000 Monte Carlos.  <b>The average number of studies published was 80, the average published study's effect size was r = -.12, and the average SD of the effect sizes was .08.</b><p>\n\nAnd it wasn't too hard to find a graph like this:\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-FgZqBAQagNY/U0hhVagDWII/AAAAAAAAAlY/jzNvTutUljQ/s1600/MonteCarlo.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-FgZqBAQagNY/U0hhVagDWII/AAAAAAAAAlY/jzNvTutUljQ/s400/MonteCarlo.jpg\"/></a></div>\nPretty similar except for Baier &amp; Wright's two outlier studies.<p>\n\nI don't believe that this analysis shows that religion and crime are unrelated.  I suspect they are related, <a href=\"http://www.tc.umn.edu/~pemeehl/144WhySummaries.pdf\">if in no other way than by means of uncontrolled confounds</a>.  But I do think this analysis suggests that <b>a non-effect plus a substantial positivity bias in publication <i>could </i>result in a pattern of reported effects that looks a lot like the pattern that is actually reported</b>.<p>\n\nThis is, of course, a <a href=\"http://www.psychfiledrawer.org/TheFiledrawerProblem.php\">file-drawer effect</a>, and perhaps it could be corrected by a decent file-drawer analysis.  But: Baier and Wright don't attempt such an analysis.  And maybe more importantly: <b>The typical Rosenthal-style file-drawer analysis assumes that the average unpublished result has an effect size of zero, whereas the effect above involves removing wrong-sign studies disproportionately often</b>, and so couldn't be fully corrected by such an analysis.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/04/meta-analysis-of-effect-of-religion-on.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2014-04-11T15:31:00-07:00\">3:31 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=839068182084067900\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods\" rel=\"tag\">psychological methods</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, January 15, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"821150998461905411\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/01/waves-of-mind-wandering-in-live.html\">Waves of Mind-Wandering in Live Performances</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I'm thinking (again) about beeping people during aesthetic experiences.  The idea is this.  Someone is reading a story, or watching a play, or listening to music.  She has been told in advance that a beep will sound at some unexpected time, and when the beep sounds, <b>she is to immediately stop attending to the book, play, or whatever, and note what was in her stream of experience at the last undisturbed moment before the beep</b>, as best she can tell.  (See <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Investigating-Pristine-Inner-Experience-Moments/dp/0521279127/\">Hurlburt 2011</a> for extensive discussion of such \"experience sampling\" methods.) <p>\n\nI've posted about this issue <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-experience-of-reading-imagery-inner.html\">before</a>; and although professional philosophy talks aren't paradigmatic examples of aesthetic performances, I have beeped people during some of my talks.  One striking result: <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/04/whats-in-peoples-stream-of-experience.html\">People spend lots of time thinking about things other than the explicit content of the performance</a> -- for example, thinking instead about needing to go to the bathroom, or a sports bet they just won, or the weird color of an advertising flyer.  And I'd bet <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2007/12/what-do-you-think-about-when-watching.html\">Nutcracker audiences are similarly scatterbrained</a>. (See also <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2004-18818-010\">Schooler, Reichle, and Halpern 2004</a>; <a href=\"http://baywood.metapress.com/link.asp?id=75700jlvg70u2111\">Schubert, Vincs, and Stevens 2013</a>.)\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cs1qwP97Noc/UtbmI-D1XBI/AAAAAAAAAis/LFXOyZWGZ_4/s1600/wandering_mind_hat-p148007924783259564xwzf_325.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cs1qwP97Noc/UtbmI-D1XBI/AAAAAAAAAis/LFXOyZWGZ_4/s320/wandering_mind_hat-p148007924783259564xwzf_325.jpg\"/></a></div>\n<span style=\"color: #999999; font-size: x-small;\">\n(image source: <a href=\"http://www.fitnessmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wandering_mind_hat-p148007924783259564xwzf_325.jpg\">*</a>)</span><p>\n<b>But I also get the sense that if I pause, I can gather the audience up.</b>  A brief pause is commanding -- in music (e.g. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxanne_(song)\">Roxanne</a>), in film -- but especially in a live performance like a talk.  Partly, I suspect this is due to contrast with previous noise levels, but also it seems to raise curiosity about what's next -- a topic change, a point of emphasis, some unplanned piece of human behavior.  (How interesting it is when the speaker drops his cup! -- much more interesting, usually, in a sad and wonderfully primate way, than the talk itself.)<p>\n<b>I picture people's conscious attention coming in waves.</b>  We launch out together reasonably well focused, but soon people start drifting their various directions.  The speaker pauses or does something else that draws attention, and that gathers everyone briefly back together.  Soon the audience is off drifting again.<p>\n\nWe could study this with beepers.  We could see if I'm right about pauses.  We could see what parts of performance tend to draw people back from their wanderings and what parts of performance tend to escape conscious attention.  We could see how immersive a performance is (in <i>one </i>sense of \"immersive\") by seeing how frequently people report being off topic vs. on a tangentially related topic vs. being focused on the immediate content of the performance. <b>We could vastly improve our understanding of the audience experience.</b>  New avenues for criticism could open up.  Knowing how to capture and manipulate the waves could help writers and performers create a performance more in line with their aesthetic goals.  Maybe artists could learn to <i>want </i>waves and gatherings of a certain sort, adding a new dimension to their aesthetic goals.<p>\n<b>As far as I can tell, no one has ever done a systematic experience sampling study during aesthetic experience that explores these issues.

Now, <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/10/28/0956797613497968.abstract\">hot off the press at Psychological Science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/kdieter/Home.html\">Kevin Dieter</a> and colleagues offer empirical confirmation.<p>\n\nThe Spelunker Illusion, well-known among cave explorers, is this: In absolute darkness, you wave your hand before your eyes.  Many people report seeing the motion of the hand, despite the absolute darkness.  If a friend waves her hand in front of your face, you don't see it.<p>\n\nI see three possible explanations:<p>\n(1.) The brain's motor output and your own proprioceptive input create hints of visual experience of hand motion.<p>\n\n(2.) Since you know you are moving your hand, you interpret low-level sensory noise in conformity with your knowledge that your hand is in such-and-such a place, moving in such-and-such a way, much as you might see a meaningful shape in a random splash of line segments.<p>\n\n(3.) There is no visual experience of motion at all, but you mistakenly think there is such experience because you expect there to be.  (Yes, I think you can be <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh7.htm\">radically wrong</a> about your own stream of sensory experience.)<p>\n\nDieter and colleagues had participants wave their hands in front of their faces while blindfolded.  About a third reported seeing motion.  (None reported seeing motion when the experimenter waved his hand before the participants.)  Dieter and colleagues add two interesting twists: One is that they add a condition in which participants wave a cardboard silhouette of a hand rather than the hand itself.  Under these conditions the effect remains, almost as strong as when the hand itself is waved.  The other twist is that they track participants' eye movements.<p>\n\nEye movements tend to be jerky, jumping around the scene.  One exception to this, however, is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_pursuit\">smooth pursuit</a>, when one stabilizes ones gaze on a moving object.  This is not under voluntary control: Without an object to track, most people cannot move their eyes smoothly even if they try.  In 1997, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9282225\">Katsumi Watanabe and Shinsuke Shimojo found</a> that although people had trouble smoothly moving their eyes in total darkness, they could do so if they were trying to track their (\"invisible\") hand motion in darkness.  Dieter and colleagues confirmed smooth hand-tracking in blindfolded participants and, strikingly, found that participants who reported sensations of hand motion were able to move their eyes much more smoothly than those who reported no sensations of motion.<p>\n\nI'm a big fan of corroborating subjective reports about consciousness with behavioral measures that are difficult to fake, so I love this eye-tracking measure.  I believe that it speaks pretty clearly against hypothesis (3) above.<p>\n\nDieter and colleagues embrace hypothesis (1): Participants have actual visual experience of their hands, caused by some combination of proprioceptive inputs and efferent copies of their motor outputs.  However, it's not clear to me that we should exclude hypothesis (2).  And (1) and (2) are, I think, different.  People's experience in darkness is <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh8.htm\">not merely blank or pure black</a>, but contains a certain amount (perhaps a lot) of noise.  Hypothesis (2) is that the effect arises \"top down\", as it were, from one's high-level knowledge of the position of one's hand.  This top-down knowledge then allows you to experience that noisy buzz as containing motion -- perhaps changing the buzz itself, or perhaps not.  (As long as one can find a few pieces of motion in the noise to string together, one might even fairly smoothly track that motion with one's eyes.)<p>\n\nHere's one way to start to pull (1) apart from (2): Have someone else move your hand in front of your face, so that your hand motion is passive.  Although this won't eliminate proprioceptive knowledge of one's hand position, it should eliminate the cues from motor output.  If efferent copies of motor output drive the Spelunker Illusion, then the Spelunker Illusion should disappear in this condition.<p>\n\nAnother possibility: Familiarize participants with a swinging pendulum synchronized with a sound, then suddenly darken the room.  If hypothesis (2) is correct and the sound is suggestive enough of the pendulum's exact position, perhaps participants will report still visually experiencing that motion.<p>\n<i>Update, April 28, 2014</i>:<p>\nLeonard Rosgole and Miguel Roig point out to me that these phenomena were reported in the psychological literature in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5267180\">Hofstetter 1970</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4747359\">Brosgole and Neylon 1973</a>, <a href=\"http://www.journalofmentalimagery.com/backissues5.html#7b\">Brosgole and Roig 1983</a>.

The literature has several features that I've come to associate with non-effects in psychology. Another literature like this is the literature <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh3.htm\">attempting to find objective behavioral correlates of the subjective reports of imagery experiences</a>.  The same holds for the literature on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2007/07/religion-and-crime.html\">the relationship between religiosity and moral behavior</a> and the literature on the psychological significance of colored dreaming (back when people <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh1.htm\">thought they mostly dreamed in black and white</a>).<p>\n\nHowever, the typical review article or quantitative meta-analysis in these fields does <i>not </i>conclude that there is no effect.  Below, I'll discuss why.<p>\n\nThe features are:<p>\n(1.) A majority of studies show the predicted positive effects, but <b>a substantial minority of studies</b> (maybe a third) <b>show no statistically significant effect</b>.<p>\n(2.) The studies showing positive vs. negative effects <b>don't fit into a clearly interpretable pattern</b> -- e.g., it's not like the studies looking for X result almost all show effects while those looking for Y result do not.<p>\n(3.) Researchers reporting positive effects often use multiple measures or populations and<b> the effect is found only for some of those measures or populations</b> (e.g., for women but not men, for high-IQ subjects but not for low-IQ subjects, by measure A but not by measure B) -- but again not in a way that appears to replicate across studies or to have been antecedently predicted.<p>\n(4.) Little of the research involves random assignment and <b>confounding factors readily suggest themselves</b> (e.g., maybe participants with a certain personality or set of interests  are both more likely to have taken a business ethics class and less likely to cheat in a laboratory study of cheating, an association really better explained by those unmeasured differences in personality or interest rather than by the fact that business ethics instruction is highly effective in reducing cheating).<p>\n(5.) Much of the research is <b>done in a way that seems almost to beg the participants to confirm the hypothesis</b> (e.g., participants are asked to report their general imagery vividness and then they are given a visual imagery task that is a transparent attempt to confirm their claims of high or low imagery vividness; or a business ethics professor asks her students to rate the wrongness of various moral scenarios, then teaches a semester's worth of classes, then asks those same students to rate the wrongness of those same moral scenarios).<p>\n(6.) <b>There is a positive hypothesis that researchers in the area are likely to find attractive</b>, with no equally attractive negative hypothesis (e.g., that subjective reports of imagery correlate with objective measures of imagery; or that business ethics instruction of the sort the researcher favors leads students to adopt more ethical attitudes).<p>\nThe really striking thing to me about these literatures is that despite what seems likely some pretty strong positive-effect biases (features 4-6), <i>still </i>researchers in these areas struggle to show a consistent pattern of statistical significance.<p>\nIn my mind this is the picture of a non-effect.<p>\n\nThe typical meta-analysis will report a real effect, I think, for two reasons, one mathematical and one sociological.  Mathematically, if you combine one-third null-effect studies with two-thirds positive-effect studies, you'll typically find a statistically significant effect (even with the typical \"file-drawer\" corrections).  And sociologically, these reviews are conducted by researchers in the field, often including their own work and the work of their friends and colleagues.  And who wants to devalue the work in their own little academic niche?  See, for example, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-008-9875-0\">this meta-analysis</a> of the business ethics literature and <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1996-29151-001\">this one</a> of the imagery literature.<p>\n\nIn a way, the mathematical conclusion of such meta-analyses is correct.  There is a mathematically discoverable non-chance effect underneath the patterns of findings -- the combined effects of experimenter bias, participants' tendency to confirm hypotheses they suspect the researcher is looking for, and unmeasured confounding variables that often enough align positively for positively-biased researchers to unwittingly take advantage of them.  But of course, that's not the sort of positive relationship that researchers in the field are attempting to show.<p>\n\nFor fun (my version of fun!) I did a little mock-up Monte Carlo simulation.  I ran 10,000 sample experiments predicting a randomly distributed Y from a randomly distributed X, with 60 participants in each control group and 60 in each treatment group, adding two types of distortion: First, two small uncontrolled confounds in random directions (average absolute value of correlation, r = .08), and second a similarly small random positive correlation to model some positive-effect bias.  (Both X and Y were normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  The confounding correlation coefficients were chosen by randomly selecting r from a normal distribution centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 0.1; for the one positive-bias correlation, I took the absolute value.)<p>\n\nEven with only these three weak confounds, not all positive, and fairly low statistical power, 23% of experiments had statistically significant results at a two-tailed p value of &lt; .05 (excluding the 5% in which the control group correlation was significant by chance).  If we assume that each researcher conducts four independent tests of the hypothesis, of which only the  \"best\", i.e., most positive, correlation is pursued and emphasized as the \"money\" result in publication, <b>then 65% of researchers will report a statistically significant positive result, the average \"money\" correlation will be r = .28 (approaching \"medium\" size), and no researcher will emphasize in publication a statistically significant negative result</b>.<p>\nYeah, that's about the look of it.<p>\n\n(Slightly revised 10:35 AM.)<p>\n<i>Update August 8th:</i><p>\nThe Monte Carlo analysis finds 4% with a significantly negative effect.  My wife asks: Wouldn't researchers publish those effects too, and not just go for the strongest positive effect?  I think not, in most cases.  If the effect is due to a large negative uncontrolled confound, a positive-biased researcher, prompted by the weird result, might search for negative confounds that explain the result, then rerun the experiment in a different way that avoids those hypothetized confounds, writing off the first as a quirky finding due to bad method.  If the negative effect is due to chance, the positive-biased author or journal referee, seeing (say) p = .03 in the unpredicted direction, might want to confirm the \"weird result\" by running a follow-up -- and being due to chance it will likely be unconfirmed and the paper unpublished.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/08/what-non-effect-looks-like.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-08-07T08:56:00-07:00\">8:56 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3794147198774829515\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods\" rel=\"tag\">psychological methods</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, July 31, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6445145844113700600\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/07/schoenfeld-and-ioannidis-is-everything.html\">Schoenfeld and Ioannidis: Is Everything We Eat Associated with Cancer? A Systematic Cookbook Review</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Okay, I'm now officially a <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/John_Ioannidis/\">John Ioannidis</a> fanboy.<p>\n\nYou might have heard of Ioannidis.  In 2005 he published the notorious and elegant \"<a href=\"http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0020124\">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</a>\".  But what he has been up to recently, I wondered, and went to his homepage.  Just reading the titles and abstracts of his <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/frdActionServlet?choiceId=showFacPublications&amp;fid=18745&amp;\">recent publications</a> was a pleasure for a nerdy, stats-loving skeptic like me!<p>\n\nLet me share just one: Schoenfeld and Ioannidis 2013: \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23193004\">Is Everything We Eat Associated with Cancer? A Systematic Cookbook Review</a>\".  Schoenfeld and Ioannidis chose recipes at random from a recent cookbook and compiled a list of 50 ingredients used in those recipes (almonds, bacon, baking soda, bay leaf, beef, bread, butter, carrot, celery...).  Then they searched the medical literature for evidence that the selected ingredients were associated with cancer.  For 40 of the 50 ingredients, there was at least one study.  39% of published studies concluded that the ingredient was associated with an increased risk of cancer; 33% concluded a decreased risk; 5% concluded a borderline risk; and only 23% found no evidence of an association.  Of the 40 ingredients, 36 had at least one study claiming increased or decreased risk.<p>\n\nSchoenfeld and Ioannidis do not conclude that almost everything we eat either causes or prevents cancer.  Rather, they conclude that the methodology and reporting standards in the field are a mess.  About half of the ingredients are exonerated in meta-analyses, but Schoenfeld and Ioannidis argue that even meta-analyses might tend to overstate associations given standard practices in the field.<p>\n\nA similar tendency to report spurious positive findings probably distorts psychology (see, e.g., <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/feb/27/psychologists-bmc-psychology\">here</a>).  Certainly, that has been my own impression when I have systematically reviewed various subliteratures such as those <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh3.htm\">attempting to associate self-reports of visual imagery vividness with performance on visual tasks</a> and <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2007/08/do-business-ethics-courses-do-any-good.html\">attempting to demonstrate the effectiveness of university-level ethics instruction</a>.  (I'm currently updating my knowledge of the latter literature -- new post soon, I hope.)<p>\n\nOkay, I can't resist mentioning Ioannidis's <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7366/pdf/477529a.pdf\">delightful piece on grant funding</a>.  First sentence: \"The research funding system is broken: scientists don't have time for science any more\". (I've written about this <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-to-give-1-million-year-to.html\">here</a> and Helen De Cruz has a nice post <a href=\"http://www.newappsblog.com/2013/04/grant-writing-wasted-time-and-red-queen-effects.html\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nOh, and here he is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23571845\">bashing the use of statistics in neuroscience</a>.  I guess I couldn't mention only one study after all.

Numerous people have sent me the article, correctly surmising that I'd be interested given my own research on the moral behavior of (generally high socioeconomic status) ethicists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article nicely displays some of the difficulties of researching moral behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, let me express a thought about the article's reception.  If Piff and collaborators had found no differences in behavior, it seems a reasonable conjecture that the article would have received less attention.  It might even have been difficult to publish at all.  The same might be true even if Piff et al had found significant results but in the opposite direction, that is, if they had found the rich better behaved.  Readers' and referees' critical acumen would probably have been activated, much more so than for a sexy result that tickles our fancy.  Consider the many filters that a study must pass -- from approval by one's advisor, to design, to data collection, to analysis and write-up, to refereeing, to editorial acceptance, to public dissemination.  At each step, the sexy study has an advantage over less-sexy competitors.  The cumulative advantage in the marketplace of ideas should make us nervous about forming our opinions based on what we see in the news.  (I recognize this applies to my own research on ethics professors too.  So far, my most frequently mentioned study on ethicists is <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515080903409952\">the one study</a> that found ethicists behaving worse.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let's consider the methods.  The authors report the results of seven different studies.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo studies examine the rudeness of drivers.  Piff et al report that people driving fancy cars are less likely to wait their turn at a four-way stop and less likely to stop for a pedestrian entering a crosswalk.  While I like the real-world naturalness of this study (\"ecological validity\"!), this particular measure seems very likely to be subject to experimenter effects -- that is, distortion in coding and results so as to favor the hypothesis of the experimenter.  Experimenter effects can be large even when there is no obvious source of bias (hence medical research typically aims to be \"double blind\").  In this case the sources of possible coder bias seem obvious and very difficult to control.  This is especially true of the crosswalk study.  A confederate of the experimenter steps out into the crosswalk, and the experimenter codes both the perceived status of the car and whether it stops.  Wisely, the status of the car is coded before the experimenter knows whether it has stopped.  But anyone who has been a pedestrian in the San Francisco Bay Area (where the study was conducted) knows that the crosswalk is a place of subtle communication between ped and driver: You take a step out, you catch the driver's eye.  How confidently you step, the look on your face, your reaction (or not) to the driver's glance and to the change (or not) of velocity -- all this has a big effect on what happens.  The results might as easily reflect the expectations of the experimenter as any real difference in driving patterns.  So this is exactly the sort of case in which one would expect large experimenter effects.  Since the results have only mid-grade p values (.05 &gt; p &gt; .01), a small experimenter effect could vitiate them entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Piff et al state that the coders and confederates were \"blind to the hypothesis of the study\", but it is hard to imagine that the coders don't at least have strong suspicions, given that they are being asked to code the luxuriousness of the vehicles.  At the very least, this should make vehicle status very salient to them, amping up any of the coders' prior expectations of a relationship between vehicle status and driving behavior.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about the other studies?  Studies 3 and 5 asked participants to read scenarios and then describe how ethically or unethically they would act in those scenarios.  Piff et al report that participants reporting higher social class also report that they would act less ethically in such scenarios.  Would it seem too fussy of me to say that I don't fully trust self-report of moral behavior in hypothetical scenarios?  I would like some evidence that this isn't, say, actually a measure of honesty and frankness instead of a measure of differences in how one would really act in such scenarios, with self-reports of less moral behavior revealing <i>more </i>honesty and frankness than do self-reports of moral perfection.  That interpretation would completely flip the moral significance of Piff et al's results.  Or maybe the measure is really something more like a measure of one's opinion about one's own moral character, which might have a zero correlation with real differences in moral character (as I suggest <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/SelfUcs.htm\">here</a>)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Study 4, after completing filler tasks, participants were offered candy from a jar ostensibly for children in a nearby laboratory.  Afterwards, they were asked how many candies they had taken from the jar.  Participants who had been primed to think of themselves as relatively low class (by being asked to compare themselves to the rich, the well educated, and the prestigiously employed) reported having taken less candy than participants who had been primed to think of themselves as relatively high class [edited 5/28].  \"Wait, what?\" I hear you asking.  They <i>reported </i>having taken more candy?  But did they <i>actually </i>take more candy?  If I'm reading the article correctly, the experimenters chose not to measure actual theft, relying on self-report instead, though the subjects' fingers were right there in the jar!  Thus, honesty is confounded with immorality, as in Studies 3 and 5.  Perhaps I can also mention the weirdness of coming into a psychology lab and then being offered candy ostensibly for children elsewhere.  Are participants really buying this cover story?  I participated in a few psychology studies as an undergrad, and I suspect I wouldn't have bought it for a minute.  Educated undergrads expect to be lied to by psychologists.<br/>\n<br/>\nStudy 6 also has cover story problems (see also <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/12/creativity-and-dishonesty.html\">my discussion of a similar study by Gino and Ariely</a>).  Participants are set in front of a computer ostensibly presenting them with the outcome of random die rolls.  Participants are asked to self-report the outcome -- without the experimenter checking -- and they are told they will have a higher chance of winning a prize if they self-report higher results.  I ask you to imagine yourself as a participant in this experiment.  What do you think is going on?  Is there a moral obligation to tell the truth?  Or is the whole thing just silly?  The experimenters have brought you into this weird situation in which they seem, pretty much explicitly, to be asking you to lie to them.  They, of course, are themselves lying to you, as you probably suspect.  The connection between behavior in this setting and real-world honesty seems dubious at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Study 7, participants were either asked to list three things about their day or three benefits of greed.  They were then asked to self-report whether they would engage in immoral behavior in hypothetical scenarios.  Participants who had been asked to list positive features of greed said that they would engage in more immoral behavior in the hypothetical scenarios, and this was especially the case for the lower socioeconomic status participants.  Therefore...?  In addition to the general types of concerns raised above, I might mention that an experimental context in which a researcher is asking you to list advantages of greed might encourage the respondent to entertain certain hypotheses about the experiment that influence her answers.  It might also encourage the respondent to expect a more forgiving moral atmosphere in which self-report of selfish behavior would be viewed less negatively.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal moral behavior is hard to measure.  I appreciate the difficulty of the researchers' task.  Three cheers for convergent measures!  I think it's cool that this is being done, and I enjoyed reading the article and thinking about the issues.  But I hope I will be forgiven for not buying it in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Update, May 28:</i>\nReaders of the post might also be interested in <a href=\"http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.de/2012/05/rich-people-may-not-be-so-unethical.html\">this critical reaction and response</a> (HT Rolf Degen).</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/03/on-whether-rich-are-jerks.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2012-03-31T06:57:00-07:00\">6:57 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5441917549649976343\" onclick=\"\">10\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/jerks\" rel=\"tag\">jerks</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods\" rel=\"tag\">psychological methods</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, November 19, 2009</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4694592700149770507\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/11/on-measuring-people-twice.html\">On Measuring People Twice</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Lots of psychological studies involve measuring people twice.  For example, in the imagery literature, there's a minor industry that seeks to relate self-reports about imagery to performance on cognitive tasks that seem to involve visual imagery, such visual memory tests or mental rotation tasks.<br/><br/>(A typical mental rotation task presents two line drawings of 3-D figures and asks if one is a simple rotation of the other, for example:<a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/_sfH_hnTwg5s/SwWube229cI/AAAAAAAAAHI/Jf2OlVgkCKc/s1600/mental-rotation-test.gif\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5405918714891007426\" src=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/_sfH_hnTwg5s/SwWube229cI/AAAAAAAAAHI/Jf2OlVgkCKc/s400/mental-rotation-test.gif\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 330px;\"/></a>Image from <a href=\"http://www.skeptic.com\">http://www.skeptic.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-03-15images/mental-rotation-test.gif\">here</a>.)<br/><br/>Participants in such studies thus receive two tests, the cognitive test in question and also a self-report imagery test of some sort, such as the <a href=\"http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/d.marks/vviq.htm\">Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)</a>, which asks people to form various visual images and then rate their vividness.  Correlations will often -- <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PerplexitiesCh3.htm\">though by no means always</a> -- be found.  This will be taken to show that people with better (e.g. more vivid) imagery do in fact have more skill at the cognitive task in question.<br/><br/>This drives me nuts.<br/><br/><em>Reactivity between measures</em> is, I think, a huge deal in such cases.  Let me clarify by developing the imagery example a little farther.<br/><br/>Suppose you\u2019re a participant in an experiment on mental imagery \u2013 an undergraduate, say, volunteering to participate in some studies to fulfill psychology course requirements.  First, you\u2019re given the VVIQ, that is, you\u2019re asked how vivid your visual imagery is.  Then, immediately afterward, you\u2019re given a test of your visual memory \u2013 for example, a test of how many objects you can correctly recall after staring for a couple of minutes at a complex visual display.  Now if I were in such an experiment and I had rated myself as an especially good visualizer when given the VVIQ, I might, when presented with the memory test, think something like this: \u201cDamn!  This experimenter is trying to see whether my imaging ability is really as good as I said it was!  It\u2019ll be embarrassing if I bomb.  I\u2019d better try especially hard.\u201d  Conversely, if I say I\u2019m a poor visualizer, I might not put too much energy into the memory task, so as to confirm my self-report or what I take to be the experimenter\u2019s hypothesis.  Reactivity can work the other way, too, if the subjective report task is given second.  Say I bomb the memory (or some other) task, then I\u2019m given the VVIQ.  I might be inclined to think of myself as a poor visualizer in part because I know I bombed the first task.<br/><br/>In general, participants are not passive innocents.  Any time you give them two different tests, you should <em>expect </em>their knowledge of the first test to affect their performance on the second.  Exactly how subjects will react to the second test in light of the first may be difficult to predict, but the probability of such reactivity should lead us to anticipate that, even if measures like the VVIQ <em>utterly fail</em> as measures of real, experienced imagery vividness, some researchers should find correlations between the VVIQ and performance on cognitive tasks.  Therefore the fact that some researchers do find such correlations <i>is no evidence at all</i> of the reality of the posited relationship, unless there's a pattern in the correlations that could not just as easily be explained by reactivity.<br/><br/>In the particular case at hand, actually, I think the overall pattern of data positively suggests that reactivity is the main driving force behind the correlations.  For example, to the extent there is a pattern in the relationship between the VVIQ and memory performance, the tendency is for the correlations to be higher in free recall tasks than in recognition tasks. Free recall tasks (like trying to list items in a remembered display) generally require more effort and energy from the subject than recognition tests (like \u201cdid you see this, yes or no?\u201d) and so might be expected to show more reactivity between the measures.<br/><br/>The problem of reactivity between measures will plague any psychological subliterature in which participants are generally aware of being measured twice -- including much <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/07/on-relying-on-self-report-happiness-and.html\">happiness research</a>, almost any area of consciousness studies that seeks to relate self-reported experience and cognitive skills, the vast majority of longitudinal psychological studies, almost all studies on the effectiveness of psychotherapy or training programs, etc. Rarely, however, is it even given passing mention as a source of concern by people publishing in those areas.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/11/on-measuring-people-twice.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2009-11-19T12:42:00-08:00\">12:42 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4694592700149770507\" onclick=\"\">6\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/imagery\" rel=\"tag\">imagery</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods\" rel=\"tag\">psychological methods</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, August 18, 2009</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3007928247913256852\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/08/philosophers-honesty-in-responding-to.html\">Philosophers' Honesty in Responding to Questionnaires</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/08/in-recruiting-members-apa-doesnt-appeal.html\">Last week</a>, and in <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/07/professors-on-morality-of-voting.html\">various</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/05/do-ethicists-eat-less-meat.html\">previous</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/06/are-ethicists-any-more-responsive-to.html\">posts</a>, I've discussed a questionnaire Josh Rust and I sent to several hundred ethicists and non-ethicist professors (both inside and outside philosophy), soliticiting self-reports of their moral attitudes and moral behavior on a variety of issues, such as vegetarianism and voting. Our guiding question: Do ethicists behave any better, or any more in accord with their espoused principles, than do non-ethicists? Based on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/08/in-recruiting-members-apa-doesnt-appeal.html\">our</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/07/professors-on-morality-of-voting.html\">analyses</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/05/do-ethicists-eat-less-meat.html\">so</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/06/are-ethicists-any-more-responsive-to.html\">far</a>, it doesn't look like ethicists' behavior is any better.<br/><br/>You might wonder, though -- as I do -- how honestly our survey respondents are answering our questions. Are those who have behaved (at least by their own lights) less than ideally well really going to report that fact, even in an anonymous survey like ours? Maybe ethicists really do behave better than non-ethicists but don't <em>look</em> that way because they respond more honestly. Josh and I tried to get a handle on this, in part, by asking a few questions <em>whose answers we could verify</em>. Respondents' honesty on these questions might help us estimate the honesty of their responses overall. Since honesty, of course, is also a moral behavior, it merits examination in its own right.<br/><br/>We asked one question whose answer we could directly verify for all philosophy professors: whether they were dues-paying members of the American Philosophical Association. (The APA publishes an annual list of members, which includes people up to 10 months late with their dues.) Among the philosopher respondents, 138 non-ethicists and 128 ethicists were listed by the APA as members. Of the remaining 59 non-ethicist respondents -- that is, those <em>not</em> on the APA membership list -- 23 (39.0%) claimed to be members. Of the remaining 61 ethicist respondents, 27 (44.3%) claimed to be members. In other words, nearly half of the respondents with the arguably immoral behavior (free-riding by not belonging to the APA) denied that behavior.<br/><br/>The APA's list is not perfect, I'm sure, and people's memories are sometimes fallible for reasons entirely innocent, but it seems plausible to me that much of the effect here is due to culpable inaccuracies -- even if not <em>deliberate</em> lying, a blameworthy bias toward misremembering and misportraying oneself in a positive light. (More attributable, probably, to purely innocent error, either by the respondents or the APA, are the 4% of respondents -- 7 ethicists and 8 non-ethicists -- who were on the APA's lists but did not claim to be members.)<br/><br/>Of course, it's disputable whether philosophy professors should, morally speaking, belong to the APA. In the attitudinal part of the survey, a majority of philosophers (64.7%) said it was morally good to \"regularly [pay] membership dues to support one's main academic disciplinary society (the APA, the MLA, etc., as appropriate)\", but that left a substantial minority who said it was morally neutral (very few said it was bad). Non-members who claimed to be members may have been somewhat more likely to say it is morally good to support the APA through one's membership dues than were the non-members who truly stated that they were non-members, but if so, the trend was modest (62.0% vs. 52.9%), and not statistically significant, given our relatively small sample of APA non-members.<br/><br/>So the answer to our question about how accurately philosophers portrayed their negative behavior in our survey appears to be: not very accurately at all. Nor do ethicists seem any more honest; in fact the trend (not statistically significant) was toward less honesty. This also fits with professors' evident exaggeration, in our survey, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/06/are-ethicists-any-more-responsive-to.html\">of their responsiveness to undergraduate emails</a> (with ethicists appearing just as prone to such exaggeration). Josh and I have some other tests of honesty, too, not all analyzed, which I'll discuss later.<br/><br/>Incidentally, near the the end of the questionnaire we asked about the morality of \"responding dishonestly to survey questions such as the ones presented here\" and also \"Were you dishonest in your answers to any previous questions?\" Those who appear to have falsely claimed APA membership trended, if anything, toward being <em>more</em> likely than those who truly stated their non-membership to say it is bad to respond to such questions dishonestly (93.2% vs. 85.3%, chi-square p = .17). Also, 2 of 49 in the first group (4.1%) and 3 of 65 in the second group (4.6%) admitted having answered a survey question dishonestly.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/08/philosophers-honesty-in-responding-to.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2009-08-18T15:15:00-07:00\">3:15 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3007928247913256852\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods\" rel=\"tag\">psychological methods</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, July 21, 2009</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5492306397034121501\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/07/on-relying-on-self-report-happiness-and.html\">On Relying on Self-Report: Happiness and Charity</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>To get published in a top venue in sociology or social or personality psychology, one must be careful about many things -- but not about the accuracy of self-report as a measure of behavior or personality.  Concerns about the accuracy of self-report tend to receive merely a token nod, after which they are completely ignored.  This drives me nuts.<br/><br/>(Before I go further, let me emphasize that the problem here -- what I see as a problem -- is not universal: Some social psychologists -- <a href=\"http://people.virginia.edu/~tdw/\">Timothy Wilson</a>, <a href=\"http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/ojohn.html\">Oliver John</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.simine.com/\">Simine Vazire</a> for example -- are appropriately wary of self-report.)<br/><br/>Although the problem is by no means confined to popular books, two popular books have been irking me acutely in this regard: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Happiness-Scientific-Approach-Getting/dp/159420148X\">The How of Happiness</a>, by my UC Riverside colleague <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/\">Sonja Lyubomirsky</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Who-Really-Cares-Compassionate-Conservatism/dp/B000WCTRPA/\">Who Really Cares</a>, by <a href=\"http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/acbrooks/\">Arthur Brooks</a> (who has a named chair in Business and Government Policy at Syracuse).<br/><br/>The typical -- but not universal -- methodology in work by Lyubomirsky and those she cites is this: (A1.) Ask some people how happy (or satisfied, etc.) they are. (A2.) Try some intervention.  (A3.) Ask them again how happy they are.  Or: (B1.) Randomly assign some people to two or three groups, one of which receives the key intervention.  (B2.) Ask the people in the different groups how happy they are.  If people report greater happiness in A3 than in A1, conclude that the intervention increases happiness.  If people in the intervention group report greater happiness in B2 than people in the other groups, likewise conclude that the intervention increases happiness.<br/><br/>This makes me pull out my hair.  (Sorry, Sonja!)  What is clear is that, in a context in which people know they are being studied, the intervention increases <i>reports</i> of happiness.  Whether it actually increases happiness is a completely different matter.  If the intervention is obviously intended to increase happiness, participants may well report more happiness post-intervention simply to conform to their own expectations, or because they endorse a theory on which the intervention should increase happiness, or because they've invested time in the intervention procedure and they'd prefer not to think of their time as wasted, or for any of a number of other reasons.  Participants might think something like, \"I reported a happiness level of 3 before, and now that I've done this intervention I should report 4\" -- not necessarily in so many words.<br/><br/>As <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/danhaybron/\">Dan Haybron</a> has emphasized, the vast majority of the U.S. population describe themselves as happy (despite our high rate of depression and anger problems), and self-reports of happiness are probably driven less by accurate perception of one's level of happiness than by factors like the need to see and to portray oneself <i>as</i> a happy person (otherwise, isn't one something of a failure?).  My own background assumption, in looking at people's self-reports of happiness, life-satisfaction, and the like, is that those reports are driven primarily by the need to perceive oneself a certain way, by image management, by contextual factors, by one's own theories of happiness, and by pressure to conform to perceived experimenter expectations.  Perhaps there's a little something real underneath, too -- but not nearly enough, I think, to justify conclusions about the positive effects of interventions from facts about differences in self-report.<br/><br/>In <em>Who Really Cares?</em> Brooks aims to determine what sorts of people give the most to charity.  Brooks bases his conclusions almost (but not quite) entirely on self-reports of charitable giving in large survey studies.  His main finding is that self-described political conservatives report giving more to charity (even excluding religious charities) than do self-described political liberals.  What he concludes -- as though this were unproblematically the same thing -- is that conservatives give more to charity than do liberals.  Now maybe they do; it wouldn't be entirely surprising, and he has a little bit of non-self-report evidence that seems to support that conclusion (though how assiduously he looked for counterevidence is another question).  But I doubt that people have any especially accurate sense of how much they really give to charity (even after filling out IRS forms, for the minority who itemize charitable deductions), and even if they did have such a sense I doubt that would be accurately reflected in self-report on survey studies.<br/><br/>As with happiness, I suspect self-reports of charitable donation are driven at least as much by the need to perceive oneself, and to have others perceive one, a particular way as by real rates of charitable giving.  Rather than assuming, as Brooks seems to, that political conservatives and political liberals are equally subject to such distortional demands in their self-reports and thus attributing differences in self-reported charity to actual differences in giving, it seems to me just as justified -- that is to say, hardly justified at all -- to assume that the real rates of charitable giving are the same and thus attribute differences in reported charity to differences in the degree of distortion in the self-descriptive statements of political conservatives and political liberals.<br/><br/>Underneath sociologists' and social and personality psychologists' tendency to ignore the sources of distortion in self-report is this, I suspect: It's <i>hard</i> to get accurate, real-life measures of things like happiness and overall charitable giving.  Such real-life measures will almost always themselves be only flawed and partial.  In the face of an array of flawed options, it's tempting to choose the easiest of those options.  Both the individual researcher and the research community as a whole then become invested in downplaying the shortcomings of the selected methods.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2009/07/on-relying-on-self-report-happiness-and.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2009-07-21T14:32:00-07:00\">2:32 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5492306397034121501\" onclick=\"\">15\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods\" rel=\"tag\">psychological methods</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/psychological%20methods?updated-max=2009-07-21T14:32:00-07:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=20&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

{"content_html": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I've done a lot of empirical work on the apparently meager practical effects of studying philosophical ethics.  Although most philosophers seem to view my work either neutrally or positively, or have concerns about the empirical details of this or that study, others react quite negatively to the whole project, more or less in principle.<p>\n\nAbout a month ago on Facebook, <a href=\"http://samrickless.com/\">Samuel Rickless</a> did such a nice job articulating some general concerns (see his comment on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10214223222607081\">this public post</a>) that I thought I'd quote his comments here and share some of my reactions.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qoHvKKHU3g/WxFX5nlo1KI/AAAAAAAAA1k/Mz41tMXygJsV7PTMLjuwcydr2sEfcI9MQCLcBGAs/s1600/Boethius_initial_consolation_philosophy.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"599\" data-original-width=\"785\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qoHvKKHU3g/WxFX5nlo1KI/AAAAAAAAA1k/Mz41tMXygJsV7PTMLjuwcydr2sEfcI9MQCLcBGAs/s320/Boethius_initial_consolation_philosophy.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n<i>First, My Research:<p></p></i>\n\n* In a series of studies published from 2009 to 2014, mostly in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.stetson.edu/other/faculty/profiles/joshua-rust.php\">Joshua Rust</a> (and summarized <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">here</a>), I've empirically explored the moral behavior of ethics professors.  As far as I know, no one else had ever systematically examined this question.  <b>Across 17 measures of (arguably) moral behavior,</b> ranging from rates of charitable donation to staying in contact with one's mother to vegetarianism to littering to responding to student emails to peer ratings of overall moral behavior, <b>I have found not a single main measure on which ethicists appeared to act morally better than comparison groups of other professors</b>; nor do they appear to behave better overall when the data are merged meta-analytically.  (Caveat: on some secondary measures we found ethicists to behave better.  However, on other measures we found them to behave worse, with no clearly interpretable overall pattern.)<p>\n\n* In a pair of studies with <a href=\"https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/fiery-cushman\">Fiery Cushman</a>, published in <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">2015</a>, I've found that <b>philosophers, including professional ethicists, seem to be no less susceptible than non-philosophers to apparently irrational order effects and framing effects in their evaluation of moral dilemmas</b>.<p>\n\n* More recently, I've turned my attention to philosophical pedagogy.  In an <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsClasses.htm\">unpublished critical review from 2013</a>, I found <b>little good empirical evidence that business ethics or medical ethics instruction has any practical effect on student behavior</b>.  I have been following up with some empirical research of my own with several different collaborators.  None of it is complete yet, but preliminary results tend to confirm the lack of practical effect, except perhaps when there's the right kind of narrative or emotional engagement.  On grounds of armchair plausibility, I tend to favor multi-causal, canceling explanations over the view that philosophical reflection is simply inert (<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.643.9791\">contra </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777\">Jon Haidt</a>); thus I'm inclined to explore how backfire effects might on average tend to cancel positive effects.  It was a post on the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/04/three-ways-your-ethics-class-might.html\">possible backfire effects of teaching ethics</a> that prompted Rickless's comment.<p>\n<i>Rickless's Objection:</i></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>The <i>order </i>in which moral dilemmas are presented matters to people's judgments and can substantially influence later judgments about abstract moral principles.  This is true even among professional ethicists with PhD's in philosophy.  In <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">2015</a>, <a href=\"http://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/\">Fiery Cushman</a> and I published empirical evidence supporting these claims.  We invite a metaphilosophical conclusion: <b>If even professional philosophers' expert judgments are easily swayed by order of presentation, then such judgments might not be stable enough to serve as secure grounds for philosophical theorizing.</b><p>\n<i>Synthese </i>has recently published two critiques of the literature on order effects in philosophy, which address Fiery's and my work (HT <a href=\"http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/xphi/2015/12/two-papers-critical-of-order-effect-research-at-synthese.html\">Wesley Buckwalter</a>).  Both critiques make valuable points.  However  both also admit of some clear replies.<p>\n\nTo fix ideas, consider two versions of the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">Trolley Problem</a>:<blockquote>\n<i>Push:</i> A runaway boxcar is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  Jane can stop the boxcar by pushing a hiker with a heavy backpack in front of the boxcar, killing him but saving the five.<p>\n<i>Switch:</i> A runaway boxcar is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  Vicki can stop the boxcar by flipping a switch to divert it to a sidetrack where it will kill one person instead of the five.</p></blockquote><p>\n\nFiery and I presented Push-type and Switch-type scenarios (fleshed with a bit more detail) to professional philosophers and two comparison groups of non-philosophers.  We found that when professional philosophers saw a Push-type scenario before a Switch-type scenario, 73% rated the two scenarios equivalently on a 7-point scale.  Then later in the questionnaire when asked about the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/\">Doctrine of the Double Effect</a> -- a moral principle often interpreted implying that Push-type cases are morally worse than Switch-type cases -- only a minority, 46%, endorsed that principle.  In contrast, among philosophers who saw Switch before Push only 54% rated the two scenarios equivalently, and then later a majority, 62%, endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Endorsement of the principle thus seemed to shift, post-hoc, to rationalize philosophers' order-manipulated judgments about the scenarios.<p>\n\nWe found similar effects for <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/\">Action-Omission</a>, <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/\">Moral Luck</a>, and \"<a href=\"http://psych.hanover.edu/classes/cognition/papers/tversky81.pdf\">Asian disease</a>\" type cases (though not consistently for every measure across the board).\n\nPhilosophers with PhDs and self-reported competence or specialization in ethics showed no smaller effects than other philosophers or than comparison groups of non-philosophers -- and in fact trended slightly (non-significantly) toward showing larger order effects.<p>\n\nIn general, we found pretty substantial effect sizes, suggesting substantial instability of judgment even in philosophical respondents' areas of expertise.  Hence the metaphilosophical worry.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Critique by <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-015-0985-9\">Zachary Horne and Jonathan Livengood</a>.</i><p>\n\nHorne and Livengood make three main points about the literature on order effects in philosophy:<p>\n\n(A.) First, they helpfully <b>distinguish between what they call \"updating effects\" and \"genuine ordering effects\".</b>  Genuine ordering effects, in their terminology, are effects measured only <i>after </i>all the stimuli have been presented.  \"Updating effects\" are measures taken along the way, and might well reflect participants' learning.  There is of course nothing irrational in judging Scenario B differently as a result of seeing Scenario A because one <i>learned </i>something by seeing Scenario A.  Most philosophical research on order effects, they note, takes the measures along the way -- and thus might be measuring learning rather than true order effects.<p>\n\n(B.) Second, they point out that <b>perceptual judgments also show order effects</b>.  Thus, if we are to reject any type of evidence that shows order effects, then we must reject perceptual evidence too, which would lead to radical skepticism.<p>\n\n(C.) Third, they point out that <b>order can sometimes reasonably make a difference to the evaluation of evidence.</b>  For example, a smile followed by a frown, on the same person's face, is a different type of evidence than a frown followed by a smile.<p>\n\nOn (A): I find the labels tendentious (since if we know there isn't learning-type updating going on, what we might want to call \"genuine order effects\" can plausibly be measured mid-stream), however it probably is correct that most studies do not sufficiently rule out the possibility of learning or updating in the course of the experiment, if they have novice participants and take the measurements after each scenario rather than after both scenarios.  However, since our participants were experts, <b>we think it unlikely that a significant number learned anything in the process of our brief experiment that would rationally justify shifting their judgment</b> about the equivalency or non-equivalency of Push and Switch.  And as Horne and Livengood note, <b>our measure of endorsement of the Doctrine of the Double Effect is a measurement of a \"genuine ordering effect\" even by their own lights</b>.<p>\n\nOn (B): Yes, of course it would be silly to reject all means of learning that are subject to any order effects!  The epistemic sting, as they note, depends not on the mere existence of an order effect in one case, but on how <i>large </i>and how <i>prevalent </i>the order effects are.  This is an open empirical question.  But the limited empirical evidence that exists suggests that order effects are substantial and prevalent in moral dilemma cases.  <b>So far, we have found order effects in all of the scenario types we've tried, with about a 10-20% shift in opinion on the moral equivalency of our scenario pairs</b> and in preference for the risky option in the \"Asian disease\" cases.<p>\n\nOn (C): It's interesting to consider cases in which earlier evidence rightly colors our reaction to later evidence, but trolley problems presented to disciplinary experts seems a different kind of case.<p>\n\nFinally, Horne and Livengood suggest that exposure to a pair of dilemmas in our study is unlikely to have a long-lasting impact on professional philosophers' beliefs.  I agree.  They continue, \"But if there is no long-lasting impact, then we think the effect is unlikely to matter to actual philosophical practice outside of the laboratory\" (p. 17).  I don't think this follows.  Fiery's and my view is not that philosophers' opinions are <i>permanently influenced</i> by the order in which the scenarios are presented on any single occasion, but rather that their opinions are <i>unstable </i>-- possibly influenced one direction on one occasion, in another direction on another occasion.  This instability is what drives the metaphilosophical worry.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Critique by <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-014-0579-y\">Regina Rini</a>:</i><p>\n\nRini -- a recent <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Regina%20Rini\">guest blogger</a> here at the Splintered Mind -- looks only at our 2012 study.  (Our 2015 study wasn't published until after her paper was in press.)  She finds it plausible that if professional philosophers were already familiar with these cases they would not exhibit order effects of the sort Fiery and I find.  She suggests that perhaps respondents were not previously familiar with the cases -- or at least not familiar in the right sort of way.  She calls this the \"familiarity problem\" and offers four possible explanations:<p>\n\n(1.) The respondents were <b>not really experts</b>.  She wonders if our participants, recruited through the internet, really had the degrees they claimed to have.<p>\n\n(2.) The respondents<b> didn't carefully attend</b> to our scenarios.  Maybe they breezed through them so quickly that they failed to notice relevant features.<p>\n\n(3.) The respondents <b>might not have familiar responses</b> to these types of scenarios.  Perhaps they have so far refrained from forming judgments on such cases and principles.<p>\n\n(4.) The respondents might not have <b>diachronically stable familiar responses</b>.  This is the explanation Fiery and I favor.  However, Rini helpfully points out that <b>as long as philosophers are <i>aware </i>that their responses are not diachronically stable, the metaphilosophical threat is reduced</b>: Presumably philosophers who are aware that their responses are not stable would be reluctant to ground their theorizing on those responses.<p>\n\nOn (1): I am not aware of a general problem in the survey literature of respondents' frequently misreporting their educational status -- though certainly a bit of misreporting is possible.  One specific piece of evidence against this possibility in our own study is that we recruited philosophers mostly by asking department chairs to forward a recruitment email to faculty and graduate students in their departments.  <b>Most of our \"philosopher\" participants took the survey within just a few days of these emails.</b><p>\n\nOn (2): The <b>median response time on the first scenario was 40 seconds</b>, on the second scenario was 34 seconds.  While these are not huge response times, if you stop to count out 34 seconds now, you'll probably notice that it's a reasonable amount of time for a thoughtful response to a brief scenario.<p>\n\nOn (3) and (4): These are potentially quite serious issues, and in fact our follow-up study in 2015 was designed specifically to address them, after we saw an early version of Rini's critique.  In our 2015 study we <i>specifically asked</i> participants if they were previously familiar with the scenarios.  We also asked whether they regarded themselves as \"having had a stable opinion\" about the issues before participating in the experiment, and whether they regarded themselves as experts on those very issues.  We also added a \"reflection\" condition to help address concern (2).  In the reflection condition we asked participants to reflect carefully before responding and enforced a minimum 15-second delay between when participants reported having finished reading the scenario and when their response options appeared.<p>\n<b>We did not find that self-reported familiarity or stability reduced the size of order effects in two different types of scenario pairs (trolley problems and risky-choice \"Asian disease\"-type problems), nor did we find reduced order effects in the reflection condition compared to a normal control condition without special instructions to reflect.</b><p>\n\nFor example, percentage rating the Push and Switch scenarios equivalently:<p>\n<a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-0cCzBDK8wpE/VnshpBgzymI/AAAAAAAABOw/JyvdvyMsctA/s1600/Stability2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-0cCzBDK8wpE/VnshpBgzymI/AAAAAAAABOw/JyvdvyMsctA/s400/Stability2.jpg\"/></a>\n\nThus, I am inclined to think that Rini's fourth suggestion is the most plausible -- that participants do not have diachronically stable familiar responses, despite high levels of expertise.  But since those who <i>report </i>having stable responses were no less subject to order effects than were those who reported not having stable responses, self-knowledge of stability appears to be largely absent.  Despite Rini's interesting suggestion that instability is metaphilosophically non-threatening if people are aware of it, Fiery's and my results suggest that we should not hasten to that comfort.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n\nBoth Horne and Livengood and Rini emphasize that we only have very limited evidence about order effects on professional philosophers' judgments.  I agree!  Fiery's and my two studies are hardly decisive.  Convergent evidence from several different labs would be necessary before drawing any confident conclusions, especially if those conclusions are at variance with what one feels one knows from personal experience.  Rini also makes positive suggestions for follow-up experimental work that might be done, which I am inclined to support.  Both critiques raise important methodological concerns that ought to help shape and direct future work on this topic.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/FieryCushman/Home.html\">Fiery Cushman</a> and I have a <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">new paper</a> in draft, exploring the question of whether professional philosophers' judgments about moral dilemmas are less influenced than non-philosophers' by factors such as order of presentation and phrasing differences.<p>\n\nWe recruited hundreds of academic participants with graduate degrees in philosophy and a comparison group of academics with graduate degrees in other fields.  We gave them two \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a>\" and two <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)\">\"Asian disease\"-type framing effect</a> cases.<p>\n\nWe presented the trolley problems either with a Switch case first (the protagonist saves five people by Switching a runaway trolley onto a side track where it kills one), followed by a Push or Drop case (saving five by Pushing one person into the trolley's path or by Dropping him into its path); or Push/Drop first, followed by Switch.  For each scenario, participants rated the protagonists' choice to kill the one person to save the five others, using a 7-point scale from \"extremely morally good\" to \"extremely morally bad\".<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">Our previous research</a> suggests that non-philosophers are much more likely to judge the Push case and the Switch case equivalently when Push is presented first than when Switch is presented first.  On some views of <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phc3.12154/abstract\">philosophical expertise</a>, philosophers' judgments about these cases should be less dependent on order of presentation than are non-philosophers' judgments.  In other words, philosophers, due to their familiarity with scenarios of this type and their expertise in applying moral principles to them, should have more stable opinions, less influenced by order of presentation.  <b>We wanted to see if philosophers with prior familiarity with the cases, or self-reported expertise in the area, or self-reported stability of opinion, would show smaller order effects.</b>  We also wanted to see if we could reduce order effects by enforcing a delay before responding during which we encouraged participants to reflect carefully on different versions of the scenario and different ways of phrasing the scenarios.<p>\n\nWe were unable to find any level of expertise at which the order effects were detectably reduced.  Nor did adding a reflection condition appear to reduce the order effects.  This figure shows the rates at which Switch was rated as morally equivalent to either Drop or Push on the 7-point scale:<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-ORv9cv_xgsI/VD7mgpWpyEI/AAAAAAAAArs/FA4BxCMPI9M/s1600/Stability1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-ORv9cv_xgsI/VD7mgpWpyEI/AAAAAAAAArs/FA4BxCMPI9M/s400/Stability1.jpg\"/></a></div>[click to enlarge]<p>\n<b>The order effect, as indicated by the differences in height between the black and the gray bars, is basically the same for philosophers and the non-philosophers, even in the \"reflection\" condition.</b><p>\n\nThis next figure breaks the results down by degree of self-reported expertise among philosopher respondents:<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujUEvdwrOsg/VD7n7-Qd2RI/AAAAAAAAAr4/H5WN91JVl8M/s1600/Stability2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujUEvdwrOsg/VD7n7-Qd2RI/AAAAAAAAAr4/H5WN91JVl8M/s400/Stability2.jpg\"/></a></div>\n[click to enlarge]<p>\n<b>Note that at no level of expertise does the order effect appear to be reduced: not among philosophers reporting being professors with a specialization in ethics, nor among philosophers reporting having a \"stable opinion\" about trolley problems of this sort.</b>  If anything, the trend appears to be toward <i>larger </i>order effects with increasing expertise.<p>\n\nSome of the most famous results in psychology are the Tversky-Kahneman \"loss aversion\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)\">framing effects</a>.  Participants are asked to imagine that an unusual disease will kill 600 people if nothing is done and then given a choice between two programs: On Program A, 200 people will be saved.  On Program B, there's a one-third probability that 600 people will be saved and a two-thirds probability that no people will be saved.  When the decision is framed this way, in terms of the number \"saved\", most people favor the non-risky Program A.  When what are (<a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2013-30638-001/\">purportedly</a>) the exact same options are presented in terms of how many will die (400 will die vs. one-third probability that none will die and two-thirds probability that 600 will die), respondents tend to favor the risky Program B.<p>\n\nThe results:</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>You know the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a>.  A runaway train trolley will kill five people ahead on the tracks if nothing is done.  But -- yay! -- you can intervene and save those five people!  There's a catch, though: your intervention will cost one person's life.  Should you intervene?  Both philosophers' and non-philosophers' judgments vary depending on the details of the case.  <b>One interesting question is how sensitive philosophers and non-philosophers are to details that might be morally relevant</b> (as opposed to presumably irrelevant distracting features like <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">order of presentation</a> or the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/12/second-vs-third-person-presentations-of.html\">point-of-view used in expressing the scenario</a>).<p>\n\nConsider, then, these four variants of the trolley dilemma:<p>\n<b>Switch</b>: You can flip a switch to divert the trolley onto a dead-end side-track where it will kill one person instead of the five.<p>\n<b>Loop</b>: You can flip a switch to divert the trolley into a side-track that loops back around to the main track.  It will kill one person on the side track, stopping on his body.  If his body weren't there to block it, though, the trolley would have continued through the loop and killed the five.<p>\n<b>Drop</b>: There is a hiker with a heavy backpack on a footbridge above the trolley tracks.  You can flip a switch which will drop him through a trap door and onto the tracks in front of the runaway trolley.  The trolley will kill him, stopping on his body, saving the five.<p>\n<b>Push</b>: Same as Drop, except that you are on the footbridge standing next to the hiker and the only way to intervene is to push the hiker off the bridge into the path of the trolley.  (Your own body is not heavy enough to stop the trolley.)<p>\n\nSure, all of this is pretty artificial and silly.  But orthodox opinion is that it's permissible to flip the switch in Switch but impermissible to push the hiker in Push; and it's interesting to think about whether that is correct, and if so why.\n<p>\n<b><a href=\"http://brown.edu/Research/Cushman-Lab/FieryCushman/Home.html\">Fiery Cushman</a> and I decided to compare philosophers' and non-philosophers' responses to such cases, to see if philosophers show evidence of different or more sophisticated thinking about them.</b>  We presented both trolley-type setups like this and also similarly structured scenarios involving a motorboat, a hospital, and a burning building (for our full list of stimuli see Q14-Q17 <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/OrderEffects-SOM-110113.pdf\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nIn our published article on this, we found that philosophers were <a href=\"http://brown.edu/Research/Cushman-Lab/docs/schwitzgebel&amp;cushman_2012.pdf\">just as subject to order effects</a> in evaluating such scenarios as were non-philosophers.  But we focused mostly on Switch vs. Push -- and also some <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/\">moral luck</a> and <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/\">action/omission</a> cases -- and we didn't have space to really explore Loop and Drop.<p>\n\nAbout 270 philosophers (with master's degree or more) and about 670 non-philosophers (with master's degree or more) rated paragraph-length versions of these scenarios, presented in random order, on a 7-point scale from 1 (extremely morally good) through 7 (extremely morally bad; the midpoint at 4 was marked \"neither good nor bad\").  Overall, all the scenarios were rated similarly and near the midpoint of the scale (from a mean of 4.0 for Switch to 4.4 for Push [paired t = 5.8, p &lt; .001]), and philosophers and non-philosophers mean ratings were very similar.<p>\n\nPerhaps more interesting than mean ratings, though, are equivalency ratings: <b>How likely were respondents to rate scenario pairs equivalently?</b>  The Loop case is subtly different from the Switch case: Arguably, in Loop but not Switch, the man's death is a means or cause of saving the five, as opposed to a merely foreseen side effect of an action that saves the five.  Might philosophers care about this subtle difference more than non-philosophers?  Likewise, the Drop case is different from the Push case, in that Push but not Drop requires proximity and physical contact.  If that difference in physical contact is morally irrelevant, might philosophers be more likely to appreciate that fact and rate the scenarios equivalently?<p>\n<b>In fact, the majority of participants rated <i>all </i>the scenarios exactly the same -- and philosophers were no less likely to do so than non-philosophers</b>: 63% of philosophers gave identical ratings to all four scenarios, vs. 58% of non-philosophers (Z = 1.2, p = .23).<p>\n\nI find this somewhat odd.  To me, it seems pretty flat-footed a form of consequentialism that says that Push is not morally worse than Switch.  But I find that my judgment on the matter swims around a bit, so maybe I'm wrong.  In any case, it's interesting to see both philosophers and non-philosophers seeming to reject the standard orthodox view, and at very similar rates.<p>\n\nHow about<b> Switch vs. Loop</b>?  Again, we found no difference in equivalency ratings between philosophers and non-philosophers: <b>83% of both groups rated the scenarios equivalently</b> (Z = 0.0, p = .98).<p>\n<b>However, philosophers <i>were </i>more likely than non-philosophers to rate Push and Drop equivalently</b>: 83% of philosophers did, vs. 73% of non-philosophers (Z = 3.4, p = .001; 87% vs. 77% if we exclude participants who rated Drop <i>worse</i> than Push).<p>\n\nHere's another interesting result.  Near the end of the study we asked whether it was worse to kill someone as a means of saving others than to kill someone as a side-effect of saving others -- one way of setting up the famous <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/\">Doctrine of the Double Effect</a>, which is often evoked to defend the view that Push is worse than Switch (in Push, the one person's death is arguably the means of saving the other five, in Switch the death is only a foreseen side-effect of the action that saves the five).  Loop is interesting in part because although superficially similar to Switch, if the one person's death is the means of saving the five, then maybe the case is more morally similar to Push than to Switch (see <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1729524\">Otsuka 2008</a>).  However, <b>only 18% of the philosophers who said it was worse to kill as a means of saving others rated Loop worse than Switch</b>.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>You know the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a>, of course.  An out-of-control trolley is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  You can flip a switch and send it to a side track where it will kill one different person instead.  Should you flip the switch?  What if, instead of flipping a switch, the only way to save the five is to push someone into the path of the trolley, killing that one person?<p>\n\nIn evaluating this scenario, does it matter if the person standing near the switch with the life-and-death decision to make is \"John\" as opposed to \"you\"?  <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/NADTAB\">Nadelhoffer &amp; Feltz</a> presented the switch version of the trolley problem to undergraduates from Florida State University.  Forty-three saw the problem with \"you\" as the actor; 65% of the them said it was permissible to throw the switch.  Forty-two saw the problem with \"John\" as the actor; 90% of them said it was permissible to throw the switch, a statistically significant difference.<p>\n\nTobia, Buckwalter &amp; Stich <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/TOBMIA\">followed up</a>, presenting a famous moral dilemma from <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-bernard/\">Bernard Williams</a> in which someone can save a group of innocent villagers from a gunman by choosing personally to shoot one of the villagers.  Forty undergraduates were presented this scenario.  When \"you\" were given the chance to shoot one villager to save the rest, 19% of said it was morally obligatory to do so; when \"Jim\" was given the chance, 53% said it was obligatory (again statistically significant).<p>\n\nHowever, Tobia and colleagues also gave the scenario to 62 professional philosophers and found the opposite effect: 9% of philosophers found it obligatory for \"Jim\" and 36% found it obligatory for \"you\".  They also presented a trolley-switching case to 49 professional philosophers.  Again, the effect was in the opposite direction from that observed among undergraduates: 89% of philosophers said it was permissible to flip the switch in the second-person condition vs. 64% in the third-person condition.<p>\n\nFiery Cushman and I have some unpublished data on this that I thought I'd throw into the mix, since our results are a bit different from those of Tobia and colleagues.  We collected these data for our <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012 paper on order effects</a> in philosophers' and non-philosophers' judgments about moral scenarios.  Most of the scenarios were presented third-person, but as we mention in the published paper, some scenarios also had second-person variants.  We didn't find large effects, and the paper was already very complicated, so we didn't detail the second-person/third-person differences.<p>\n\nIn that experiment, we had four scenarios that differed 2nd person vs. 3rd person.  However, they differed not in whether the <i>actor</i> was described as \"you\", but rather in whether the <i>victim </i>was.<p>\n\nOne scenario was a version of Williams' hostage scenario.  \"Nancy\" and other villagers are captured by a warlord.  Nancy is given the choice of shooting \"you\" (2nd person variant) or \"a fellow hostage\" (3rd person variant) to save the captured villagers.  Respondents rated Nancy's \"shooting you\" or \"shooting a fellow hostage\" on a 7-point scale from  \"extremely morally good\" (1) through \"extremely morally bad\" (7), with \"morally neutral\" in the middle (4).  We had three groups of respondents: 324 professional philosophers (MA or PhD in philosophy, mostly recruited via email to Leiter-ranked philosophy departments), 753 non-philosopher academics (Master's or PhD not in philosophy, mostly recruited via email to comparison departments at the same universities), and 1389 non-academics (a convenience sample of others who happened upon the test site).<p>\n\nWe found non-philosophers a bit more likely to rate Nancy's shooting one to save the others toward the \"morally good\" side of the scale if the victim was \"you\",  but philosophers showed only a small, non-significant trend on our 7-point scale (using t-tests):<blockquote>Non-academics: 3.6 (2nd person victim) vs. 4.1 (3rd person victim) (p &lt; .001).</blockquote></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://philosophyofbrains.com/2013/07/15/do-women-have-different-philosophical-intuitions-than-men-responding-to-buckwalter-and-stich.aspx\">Very interesting critique</a> by  at the Brains blog of the original <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1683066\">Buckwalter and Stich study</a> on this question.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Central to contemporary epistemology is the question of what it is to know something.  And the orthodox starting point in discussions of what it is to know something is the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/#KnoJusTruBel\">\"JTB account\" of knowledge</a>: Knowledge is justified (J) true (T) belief (B), plus maybe some fourth condition to take care of weird cases where justified beliefs are true merely by accident (so-called <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/#GetPro\">Gettier cases</a>).  Discussion tends to focus on how to understand the J condition and whether some further fourth condition is necessary.  The truth and belief conditions are typically regarded as unproblematic.<p>\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KB.htm\">a forthcoming paper</a>, Blake Myers-Schulz and I pick up a mostly-cold torch from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/may/22/guardianobituaries.humanities\">Colin Radford</a> (whose seminal work on this topic was in the 1960s) and challenge the belief condition.  Can one know that something is the case even if one doesn't believe that it's the case?  We offer five plausible cases (one adapted from Radford) along with empirical evidence that our intuitions [note 1] about these cases are not idiosyncratic.<p>\n\nThis paper has already drawn several follow-up studies, some critical and some supportive -- but interestingly, <b>even the critical studies can be read as contributing to an emerging consensus that problematizes the belief condition</b>.  (I don't predict the consensus will last.  They never do in philosophy.  But still!)<p>\n\nFirst, to give you a feel for it, our cases:<blockquote>\n1. An unconfident examinee who feels like she is guessing the answer but non-accidentally gets it right;<p>\n2. An absent-minded driver who momentarily forgets that a bridge he normally takes to work is closed and continues en route toward that bridge;<p>\n3. A prejudiced professor, who intellectually appreciates that her athletic students are just as capable as her non-athletic students but who nonetheless is persistently biased in her reactions to student-athletes;<p>\n4. A freaked-out movie-watcher who seems to have the momentary impression that the scenario depicted in a horror film is real;<p>\n5. A self-deceived husband who has lots of evidence that his wife is cheating and some emotional responses that seem to reveal that he knows this, but who refuses to admit the truth to himself.</p></p></p></p></blockquote>\n\nNow maybe not all the cases work, but we think in each case there's at least some plausibility to the thought that the person in question <i>knows</i> (that Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, that the bridge is closed, that athletic students are just as capable, that aliens won't come out of her faucet, that his wife is cheating) but does not <i>believe </i>-- at least not as fully and determinately as she knows.  And lots of undergraduates seem to agree with us!  So we think the B condition on knowledge should at least be open for discussion.  It should not be regarded as <i>uncontroversially nonproblematic.</i><p>\n\nFollow-up studies (e.g., <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/ROSKED\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9279/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/BUCBTT\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-013-0132-9\">here</a>) have added some new plausible cases.  Our favorite of these is:<blockquote>\n6. A religious fundamentalist geocentrist who aces her astronomy class -- seeming to know that Earth revolves around the sun but not to believe it.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough some of these follow-up studies are pitched as in agreement with us and others as critique, we think there's actually a pretty clear thread of consensus through it all, from a bird's-eye view:<p>\n<b>Knowledge requires</b> <i>some</i> sort of psychological connection to the justified, true proposition -- <b>something broadly <i>like </i>a belief condition; but it doesn't seem to require full-on act-it-and-live-it-and-breathe-it belief.</b>  However reasonable it might be to think the Earth goes round the sun, that fact has to register with me cognitively in <i>some </i>way if I am to qualify as knowing it; but the fact needn't play the full functional role of belief as envisioned in behaviorally-rich accounts of belief <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">like my own</a>.  <b>But how exactly should we should conceptualize this somewhat weak but broadly beliefish psychological-connectedness condition?  At this point, that's wide open.</b><p>\n\nBlake and I suggest that one must have the capacity to act on the stored information that P; Rose and Schaffer seem to suggest that what's crucial is that the information be \"available to the mind\"; Buckwalter and colleagues suggest that one must believe but only in some \"thin\" sense of belief; Murray and colleagues suggest that one need to be disposed to \"assent\" to the content.  None of these approaches are well specified (and I've simplified them somewhat; apologies).  Figuring out what's going on with the B condition thus seems like a potentially fruitful task that brings together core issues in epistemology and philosophy of mind.<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------------<p>\n[note 1] Yes, I use the word \"intuition\".  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-without-Intuitions-Herman-Cappelen/dp/0199644861\">Herman Cappelen</a> has me worried about the term.  But I <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/12/intuitions-philosophy-and-experiment.html\">stand firm</a>!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Bertrand Russell writes:<blockquote>There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into existence five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that \"remembered\" a wholly unreal past.  There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago....  I am not here suggesting that the non-existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.  Like all sceptical hypotheses, it is logically tenable but uninteresting (<i>The Analysis of Mind,</i> 1921, p. 159-160).</blockquote>Wait... what?!  We can't prove that the world has existed for more than five minutes, but who cares, <i>bo</i>-ring?<p>\n\nI'd think rather the opposite: We <i>can</i> prove that the world has existed for more than five minutes.  And if I didn't think I could prove that fact, I wouldn't say ho-hum, whatevs, maybe everything I thought really happened is just an illusion, *yawn*.<p>\n\nOkay, well, \"prove\" is too strong.  Logical certainty of the 2+2=4 variety, I can't provide.  But I think I can provide, at least to myself, some good empirical evidence that the past existed five minutes ago.  I can begin by opening up the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">New York Times</a>.  It tells me that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/sports/hockey/larry-kwongs-shift-for-rangers-in-1947-48-broke-a-barrier.html?hp\">Larry Kwong was the Jeremy Lin of his day</a>.  Therefore, the past exists.<p>\n\nNow hold on, you'll say.  I've begged the question against Russell.  For Russell is asking us to consider the possibility that the world was created five minutes ago with everything exactly as it then was, including the New York Times website.  I can't disconfirm that hypothesis by going to the New York Times website!  The young-world hypothesis and the old-world hypothesis make exactly the same prediction about what I will find, and therefore the evidence does not distinguish between them.<p>\n\nHere I need to think carefully about the form of the young-world hypothesis and the reasons I might entertain it.  For example, I should consider what reason I have to prefer the hypothesis that a planet-sized external world was created five minutes ago vs. the hypothesis that just I and my immediate environment were created five minutes ago.  Is there reason to regard the first hypothesis as more likely than the second hypothesis?  I think not.  And similarly for temporal extent: There's nothing privileged about 5 minutes ago vs. 7.22 minutes ago vs. 27 hours ago, vs. 10 seconds ago, etc. (perhaps up to the bound of the \"<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience/#4\">specious present</a>\").<p>\n\nSo if I'm in a skeptical enough mood to take young-world hypotheses seriously, I should have a fairly broad range of young-world hypotheses in mind as live options.  Right?<p>\n\nIn the spirit of skeptical indifference, let's say that I go ahead and assign a 50% probability to a standard non-skeptical old-world hypothesis and a 50% probability to a young-world hypothesis based on my subjective experience of a seeming-external-world <i>right now</i>.  Conditional on the young-world hypothesis, I then further distribute my probabilities, say, 50-50% between the I-and-my-immediate-environment hypothesis and the whole-planet hypothesis.  The exact probabilities don't matter, and clearly there will be many other possibilities; this is just to show the form of the argument.  So, right now, my probabilities are 50% old-world, 25% young-small-world, and 25% young-large-world.<p>\n\nNow, if the world is young and small, then all should be void, or chaos, beyond the walls of this room.  (In a certain sense such a world might be large, but the Earthly stuff in my vicinity is small.)  In particular, the New York Times web servers should not exist.  So if I try to visit the New York Times' webpage, based on my entirely false seeming-memories of how the world works, New York Times content which is not currently on my computer should not then appear on my computer.  After all the hypothesis is that the world was created five minutes ago as it then was, and my computer did not have the newest NYT content at that time.  But, I check the site and new content appears!  Alternatively, I open my office door and behold, there's a hallway!  So now, I reduce the probability of the young-small-world hypothesis to zero.  (Zero makes the case simple, but the argument doesn't depend on that.)  Distributing that probability back onto the remaining two hypotheses, the old-world hypothesis is now 67% and young-large-world is 33%.  Thus, by looking at the New York Times website, I've given myself empirical evidence that the world is more than five minutes old.<p>\n\nAdmittedly, I'd hope for better than 67% probability that the world is old, so the result is a little disappointing.  If I could justify the proposition that <i>if</i> the world is young, then it is probably small enough not to contain the New York Times web servers, then I can get final probabilities higher.  And maybe I can justify that proposition.  Maybe the likeliest young-world scenario is a spontaneous congealment scenario (i.e., a <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/07/confessions-of-boltzmann-brain.html\">Boltzmann brain</a> scenario) or a scenario in which this world is a small-scale computer simulation (see my <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/09/bostroms-response-to-my-discussion-of.html\">earlier</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/08/on-bostroms-argument-that-you-may-well.html\">posts</a> on Bostrom's simulation argument).  For example, if the initial probabilities are 50% old, 45% young-small, 5% young-large, then after ruling out young-small, the old-world hypothesis rises above 90% -- an almost-publishable p value!  And maybe the probability of the old-world hypothesis continues to rise as I find that the world continues to exist in a stable configuration, since I might reasonably think that if the world is only 5 minutes old or 12 minutes old, it stands a fair chance of collapsing soon -- a possibility that seems less likely on the standard non-skeptical old-world hypothesis.  (However, there is the worry that after a minute or so, I will need to restart my anti-skeptical argument again due to the possibility that I only falsely remember having checked the New York Times site.  Such are the bitters of trying to refute skepticism.)<p>\n\nYou might object that the most likely young-small-world hypothesis is one on which there is an outside agent who will feed me the seeming-New York Times website on demand, purposely to trick me.  But I'm not sure that's so.  And in any case, with that move we're starting to drift toward something like <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/#3.2\">Cartesian demon doubt</a>, which deserves separate treatment.<p>\n\n[Slightly edited 6:33 pm in light of helpful clarificatory questions from Jonathan Weisberg.]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Is the world simple or complex?  Is a simple hypothesis more likely to be true than a complex hypothesis that fits the data equally well?  <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/\">The issue is gnarly</a>.  Sometimes the best approach to a gnarly issue is crude stupidity.  Crude stupidity is my plan today.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what I did.  I thought up 30 pairs of variables that would be easy to measure and that might relate in diverse ways.  Some variables were physical (the distance vs. apparent brightness of nearby stars), some biological (the length vs. weight of sticks found in my back yard), and some psychological or social (the S&amp;P 500 index closing value vs. number of days past).  Some I would expect to show no relationship (the number of pages in a library book vs. how high up it is shelved in the library), some I would expect to show a roughly linear relationship (distance of McDonald's franchises from my house vs. MapQuest estimated driving time), and some I expected to show a curved or complex relationship (forecasted temperature vs. time of day, size in KB of a JPG photo of my office vs. the angle at which the photo was taken).  See <a href=\"http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/variables-measured-for-post-preliminary.html\">here</a> for the full list of variables.  I took 11 measurements of each variable pair.  Then I analyzed the resulting data.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if the world is massively complex, then it should be difficult to predict a third datapoint from any two other data points.  Suppose that two measurements of some continuous variable yield values of 27 and 53.  What should I expect the third measured value to be?  Why not 1,457,002?  Or 3.22 x 10^-17?  There are just as many functions (that is, infinitely many) containing 27, 53, and 1,457,002 as there are containing 27, 53, and some more pedestrian-seeming value like 44.  On at least some ways of thinking about massive complexity, we ought to be no more surprised to discover that third value to be over a million than to discover that third value to be around 40.  Call the thesis that a wildly distant third value is no less likely than a nearby third value the <i>Wild Complexity Thesis</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can use my data to test the Wild Complexity Thesis, on the assumption that the variables I have chosen are at least roughly representative of the kinds of variables we encounter in the world, in day-to-day human lives as experienced in a technologically advanced Earthly society.  (I don't generalize to the experiences of aliens or to aspects of the world that are not salient to experience, such as Planck-scale phenomena.)  The denial of Wild Complexity might seem obvious to you.  But that is an empirical claim, and it deserves empirical test.  As far as I know, no philosopher has formally conducted this test.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo conduct the test, I used each pair of dependent variables to predict the value of the next variable in the series (the 1st and 2nd observations predicting the value of the 3rd, the 2nd and 3rd predicting the value of the 4th, etc.), yielding 270 predictions for the 30 variables.  I counted an observation \"wild\" if its absolute value was 10 times the maximum of the absolute value of the two previous observations or if its absolute value was below 1/10 of the minimum of the absolute value of the two previous observations.  Separately, I also looked for flipped signs (either two negative values followed by a positive or two positive values followed by a negative), though most of the variables only admitted positive values.  This measure of wildness yielded three wild observations out of 270 (1%) plus another three flipped-sign cases (total 2%).  (A few variables were capped, either top or bottom, in a way that would make an above-10x or below-1/10th observation analytically unlikely, but excluding such variables wouldn't affect the result much.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it looks like the Wild Complexity Thesis might be in trouble.  Now admittedly a caveat is in order: If the world is wild enough, then I probably shouldn't trust my memory of having conducted this test (since maybe my mind with all its apparent memories just popped into existence out of a disordered past), or maybe I shouldn't trust the representativeness of this sample (I got 2% wild this time, but maybe in the next test I'll get 50% wild).  However, if we are doubtful about the results for either of those reasons, it might be difficult to escape collapse into radical skepticism.  If we set aside radically skeptical worries, we might still wonder how wild the world is.  These results give us a preliminary estimate.  To the extent the variables are representative, the answer seems to be: not too wild -- though with some surprises, such as the $20,000 listed value of the uncirculated 1922 Lincoln wheat penny.  (No, I didn't know about that before seeking the data.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we use a Wildness criterion of two (two times the max or 1/2 the min), then there are 33 wild instances in 270 observations, or about 12%, overlapping in one case with the three flipped-sign cases, for 13% total.  I wouldn't take this number <i>too</i> seriously, since it will presumably vary considerably depending on the variables chosen for analysis -- but still it's smaller than it might have been, and maybe okay as a first approximation to the extent the variables of interest resemble those on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/variables-measured-for-post-preliminary.html\">my list</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had meant to do some curve fitting in this post, too -- comparing linear and quadratic predictions with more complex predictions -- but since this is already a good-sized post, we'll curve fit another day.<br/>\nI admit, this is a ham-handed approach.  It uses crude methods, it doesn't really establish anything we didn't already know, and I'm sure it won't touch the views of those philosophers who deny that the world is simple (who probably aren't committed to the Wild Complexity Thesis).  I highlight these concessions by calling the project \"stupid epistemology\".  If we jump too quickly to clever, though, sometimes we miss the necessary groundwork of stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Note: This post was substantially revised Feb. 6.</i><br/></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/RationalistDelusion.htm\">A new essay</a> with <a href=\"http://www2.stetson.edu/~jrust/\">Joshua Rust</a>.<p>\n\nIn the first part, we summarize our empirical research on the moral behavior of ethics professors.<p>\n\nIn the second part, we consider five possible explanations of our finding that ethics professors behave, on average, no better than do other professors.<p>\n<i>Explanation 1:</i> Philosophical moral reflection has no material impact on real-world moral behavior.  <a href=\"http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/home.html\">Jonathan Haidt</a> has called the view that explicit moral reflection does have a substantial effect on one's behavior \"the rationalist delusion\".<p>\n<i>Explanation 2:</i> Philosophical moral reflection influences real world moral behavior, but only in very limited domains of professional focus.  Those domains are sufficiently narrow and limited that existing behavioral measures can't unequivocally detect them.  Also, possibly, any improvement in such narrow domains might be cancelled out, in terms of overall moral behavior, by psychological factors like <a href=\"http://wat1224.ucr.edu/Morality/Monin%202010%20Compass%20on%20Moral%20Licensing.pdf\">moral licensing</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion\">ego depletion</a>.<p>\n<i>Explanation 3:</i> Philosophical moral reflection might lead one to behave <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/01/might-ethicists-behave-more-permissibly.html\">more morally permissibly but no morally better</a>.  The idea here is that philosophical moral reflection might lead one to avoid morally impermissible behavior while also reducing the likelihood of doing any <i>more</i> than is strictly morally required.  Contrast the sometimes-sinner sometimes-saint with the person who never goes beyond the call of duty but also never does anything really wrong.<p>\n<i>Explanation 4:</i> Philosophical moral reflection might compensate for deficient moral intuitions.  Maybe, from early childhood or adolescence, some people tend to lack strongly motivating moral emotions.  And maybe some of those people are also drawn to intellectual styles of moral reflection.  Without that moral reflection, they would behave morally worse than the average person, but moral reflection helps them behave better than they otherwise would.  If enough ethicists are like this, then philosophical moral reflection might have an important positive effect on the moral behavior of those who engage in it, but looking at ethicists as a group, that effect might be masked if it's compensating for lower rates of moral behavior arising from emotional gut intuitions.<p>\n<i>Explanation 5:</i> Philosophical moral reflection might have powerful effects on moral behavior, but in both moral <i>and </i>countermoral directions, approximately cancelling out on average.  It might have positive effects, for example, if it leads us to discover moral truths on which we then act.  But perhaps equally often it becomes <i>toxic rationalization</i>, licensing morally bad behavior that we would otherwise have avoided.<p>\n\nJosh and I decline to choose among these possibilties.  There might be some truth in all or most of them.  And there are still other possibilities, too.  Ethicists might in fact engage in moral reflection relevant to their personal lives no more often than do other professors.  Ethicists might find themselves increasingly disillusioned about the value of morality at the same time they improve their knowledge of what morality in fact requires.  Ethicists might learn to shield their personal behavior from the influence of their professional reflections, as a kind of self-defense against the apparent unfairness of being held to higher standards because of their choice of profession....<p>\n\nFull essay <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/RationalistDelusion.htm\">here</a>.

I have a simple argument against this view.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst: I define \"intuition\" very broadly. A judgment is \"intuitive\", in my view, just in case it arises by some cognitive process other than explicit, conscious reasoning. By this definition, snap judgments about the grammaticality of sentences, snap judgments about the distance of objects, snap judgments about the moral wrongness of an action in a hypothetical scenario, and snap folk-psychological judgments are generally going to be intuitive. Intuitive judgments don't <i>have </i>to be snap judgments -- they don't have to be fast -- but the absence of explicit conscious reasoning is clearest when the judgment is quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis definition of \"intuition\" is similar to one\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.alisongopnik.com/\">Alison Gopnik</a> and I worked with in a <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/WhoseConcepts.htm\">1998 article</a>, and it is much more inclusive than Cappelen's own characterizations. Thus, it's quite possible that intuitions in Cappelen's narrow sense are inessential to philosophy while intuitions in my broader sense are essential. But I don't think that Cappelen and I have\u00a0<i>merely </i>a terminological dispute. There's a politics of definition. One's terminological choices highlight and marginalize different facets of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy characterization of intuition is also broader than most other philosophers' -- <a href=\"http://udel.edu/~jpust/\">Joel Pust</a> in his <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuition\">Stanford Encyclopedia article on intuition</a>, for example, seems to regard it as straightforward that perceptual judgments should not be called \"intuitions\" -- but I don't think my preferred definition is entirely quirky. In fact, in a <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-011-0047-2\">recent study</a>, J.R. Kuntz and J.R.C Kuntz found that professional philosophers were more likely to \"agree to a very large extent\" with Gopnik's and my definition of intuition than with any of six other definitions proposed by other authors (32% giving it the top rating on a seven-point scale). I think professional psychologists and linguists\u00a0might also sometimes use \"intuition\" in something like Alison's and my sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we accept this broad definition of intuition, then it seems hard to deny that, contra Cappelen,\u00a0philosophy depends essentially on intuition -- as does all cognition. One can't explicitly consciously reason one's way to every one of one's premises, on pain of regress. One must start somewhere, even if only tentatively and subject to later revision.<br/>\n<br/>\nCappelen has, in conversation, accepted this consequence of my broad definition of \"intuition\". The question then becomes what to make of the epistemology of intuition in this sense. And this epistemological question is, I think, largely an empirical one, with several disciplines empirically relevant, including cognitive psychology, experimental philosophy, and study of the historical record. Based on the empirical evidence, what might we expect to be the strengths and weaknesses of explicit reasoning? And, alternatively, what might we expect to be the strengths and weaknesses of intuitive judgment?<br/>\n<br/>\nThose empirical questions become especially acute when the two paths to judgment appear to deliver conflicting results. When your ordinary-language spontaneous judgments about the applicability of a term to a scenario (or at least your <i>inclinations </i>to judge) conflict with what you would derive from your explicit theory, or when your spontaneous moral judgments (or inclinations) do, what should you conclude? The issue is crucial to philosophy as we all live and perform it, and the answer one gives ought to be informed, if possible, by empirically discoverable facts about the origins and reliability of different types of judgments or inclinations. (This isn't to say that a uniform answer is likely to win the day: Things might vary from time to time, person to person, topic to topic, and depending on specific features of the case.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be strange to suppose that the psychology of philosophy is irrelevant to its epistemology. And yet Cappelen's dismissal of the enterprise of experimental philosophy on grounds of the irrelevance of \"intuitions\" to philosophy would seem to invite us toward that exactly that dubious supposition.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>What is \"experimental philosophy\"?  There is, I think, some tension in how philosophers use the term -- tension between a narrow and a wide conception.<p>\n\nMost of the work canonically identified as \"experimental philosophy\" surveys ordinary people's judgments (or \"intuitions\") about philosophical concepts, and it does so by soliciting people's responses to questions about hypothetical scenarios. (See, e.g., Knobe's <a href=\"http://www.unc.edu/~knobe/Side-Effect.pdf\">chairman study</a> regarding intentional action, <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/courses/saw.pdf\">Swain et al.'s study</a> of order effects on knowledge judgments, and <a href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~machery/papers/verson%20publiee.pdf\">Machery et al.'s study</a> of cultural variation in the perceived reference of proper names.)  Thus, philosophers sometimes think of \"experimental philosophy\" as the enterprise of running these sorts of studies.  <a href=\"http://www.siena.edu/pages/1855.asp\">Joshua Alexander</a>, for example, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Experimental-Philosophy-Introduction-Joshua-Alexander/dp/0745649181\">in his 2012 book</a> portrays experimental philosophy as the study of people's philosophical intuitions, as does <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/members/philosophy_panel/tim_williamson\">Timothy Williamson</a>, in his <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/26739/Xphireview.pdf\">forthcoming critique</a> of the \"Experimental Philosophy revolution\".<p>\n\nConceived narrowly in this way, experimental philosophy is a coherent and (mostly) recent movement, with a distinctive methodology and an interrelated network of results.  It is possible to discuss and critique it as a unified body.<p>\n\nHowever, there also seems to be a broader conception of experimental philosophy -- a conception that has never, I think, been adequately articulated, a conception that <a href=\"http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/\">Josh Knobe</a> and <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/\">Shaun Nichols</a>, for example, gesture toward in their \"<a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/Manifesto.pdf\">Experimental Philosophy Manifesto</a>\", before they shift their focus to experimental philosophy in the narrow sense.  In this broad sense, philosophers who do empirical work aimed at addressing traditionally philosophical questions are also experimental philosophers, even if they don't survey people about their intuitions.  In practice, the narrow/broad distinction hasn't meant too much because almost all of the empirical work of almost all of the people who are canonically recognized as \"experimental philosophers\" fits within both the narrow and the broad conceptualizations.<p>\n\nMy own work, however, tends to fit only within the broad conception, not the narrow (with a couple of <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KB.htm\">exceptions</a>).  So the difference has personal importance to me, affecting both my and others' conceptualization of my role in the \"x-phi\" community.<p>\n\nHow to articulate the broad conception?  <i>Experimental work done by people in philosophy departments</i> seems an odd category, since similar work can be done by people in different departments.  <i>Experimental work that addresses traditionally philosophical issues</i>, however, seems far too broad, sweeping in too much research that we would not ordinary conceptualize as philosophical, including physics experiments on the structure of space and time, biological research on the origins of our social roles, and psychological work on the origins of our concepts, since these issues are at the root of philosophy of physics, philosophy of biology, and philosophy of psychology; and sometimes what the most theoretically ambitious physicists, biologists, and psychologists say is not so different from what philosophers of those disciplines say; if by adding experimentation to that, we get experimental philosophers, then most experimental philosophers are employed by science departments.<p>\n\nHere's a thought that is perhaps more satisfactory: Experimental philosophy in the broad sense is <i>empirical research that is thoroughly contextualized within an intimate knowledge of the philosophical literature on which it bears, and which is presented, primarily, as advancing that philosophical literature</i>.  (For present purposes, we can define \"philosophical literature\" sociologically as what is published in philosophy journals and in books classified as philosophy books by academic presses.)  This will omit the typical developmental psychologist working on conceptual categories, but probably allow as marginal cases of \"experimental philosophers\" the most philosophically informed developmental psychologists (such as <a href=\"http://www.alisongopnik.com/\">Alison Gopnik</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/index.html?carey.html\">Susan Carey</a>).  It will allow in, as central, work by Shaun Nichols that is not typical intuition-polling x-phi (such as his work on <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/on_the_genealogy_of_norms\">disgust norms</a> and on <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/RiseofCompatibilism\">quantitative history of philosophy</a>).  Maybe some of <a href=\"http://mypage.iu.edu/~ealloyd/\">Elisabeth Lloyd</a>'s empirical work on the female orgasm will also qualify.<p>\n\nAnd of course (my main, not-so-secret intention in developing this account) so also will all of my own empirical work.  Included, for example, will be my work on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search?q=ethics+professors\">the moral behavior of ethics professors</a>, which does tend to be recognized as \"experimental philosophy\" by the x-phi crowd, despite not fitting the narrow conception; and also my empirical research on consciousness (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Describing-Inner-Experience-Proponent-Bradford/dp/0262083663/\">here</a>, and chapters 1 and 6 <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262014904/\">here</a>), which is less often mentioned as x-phi.<p>\n\nBut more than that, I think this conception explicitly encourages the thought that a broad range of traditionally philosophical issues can be illuminated by empirical studies, even though they have not yet commonly been approached with the tools of empirical science.  For example, empirical research might help illuminate the question of whether philosophical study, over the centuries, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/09/has-civilization-made-moral-progress.html\">tends to progress toward the truth</a>.  We might be able to take <a href=\"http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2012/08/the-external-world-further-experimental-evidence-of-its-existence.html\">an experimental approach to the question of whether the external world exists</a>.  Questions in the history of philosophy might be approachable by means of the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search?q=discussion+arcs\">systematic study of citation patterns in philosophical venues</a>.  And so forth.<p>\n\nExperimental philosophers, break free!  There is so much more to do than just surveying intuitions!<p>\n\n(No accident maybe, that I was a student of Gopnik and Lloyd?)</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>From a certain perspective, current liberal Western civilization seems to be a moral pinnacle. We have rejected slavery. We have substantially de-legitimized aggressive warfare. We have made huge progress in advancing the welfare of children. We have made huge progress toward gender and racial equality. In his 2011 book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/0670022950\">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a>, Steven Pinker says he is prepared to call our recent ancestors \"morally retarded\" (p. 658). Imagine how we would react if a Westerner today were seriously to endorse a set of views that would not have been radical in 1800: denying women the vote (or maybe even advocating a return to monarchy), viewing slavery and twelve-hour days of child labor in coal mines as legitimate business enterprises, advocating military conquest for the sake of glory, etc. \"Morally retarded\" might seem a fair assessment!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom another perspective, though, it appears almost inevitable that the average person in any culture will see his or her own culture's values as morally superior. Suppose that the average person in Culture 1 endorses values A, B, C, and D, the average person in Culture 2 endorses values A, B, -C, and E, and the average person in Culture 3 endorses values A, -B, D, and F. The average person from Culture 1 will think, \"Well the average person in my culture has A, B, C, and D right! The people in culture 2 have C wrong and really should pay attention to D rather than E, while the people in Culture 3 have B wrong and should attend to C rather than F. So my culture's values are superior.\" If Culture 1 is temporally more recent than Cultures 2 and 3, then our average person from Culture 1 can laud the change in values as \"progress\".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, of course, that it might not be progress at all, but rather only a preference for local values. Call this the <i>Local Pinnacle Illusion</i>. Someone from the past might suffer the same illusion looking forward at us, condemning (say) our liberal Western neglect of proper class and gender role distinctions, our relative irreligiosity, and our relative tolerance of homosexuality, masturbation, divorce, and moneylending -- calling the changes \"decadence\" rather than progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question then is whether there's a good way to tell whether those of us with a Pinkeresque preference for contemporary liberal values are merely victims of the Local Pinnacle Illusion, or whether we really have made huge moral progress in the last few centuries or millennia. I've been thinking about whether there might be a way to explore this empirically, using the history of philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's my thought: The temporal picture of progress and the temporal picture of a random walk look very different. If, say, rational reflection over the very long haul tends to guide us ever closer to right moral principles, as Pinker thinks, then issue-by-issue we ought to see opinion changes over the very long haul that look like progressive trends of moral philosophical discovery. If, in contrast, all that's going on is the Local Pinnacle Illusion, trends should be relatively short-lived, due to local cultural pressures, and not consistently directional over the very long haul.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose we chose twelve issues that have been broadly discussed since ancient times and that in at least some eras -- not necessarily our own -- are regarded as morally important issues. If we could chart philosophers' opinions on these issues quantitatively (e.g., from strong support for democracy to strong support for monarchy with moderate views in the middle, from strong support for gender-neutral role expectations to strong support for gender-specific role expectations, etc.), using -1 and +1 to mark the average position in the historically most extreme eras for each pole of each issue, then on a random-walk picture, we ought to see something like this pattern among those issues:\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-5OAaSWM5-7s/UEj9owTC8lI/AAAAAAAAAa8/yy5ej7L0SsU/s1600/Random12.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"290\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-5OAaSWM5-7s/UEj9owTC8lI/AAAAAAAAAa8/yy5ej7L0SsU/s400/Random12.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></div>\nI have assumed here a random starting spread from -1 to 1 and a random fluctuation from -0.3 to +0.3 in each successive period; then I renormalized the maximum value of each run to 1 and the minimum to -1. The result is basically a noisy walk, with extreme values as likely in the middle as at the ends.<br/>\n<div>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if there's moral progress through philosophical reflection, the chart ought to look more like this:\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-KE7SBJJtJm8/UEkByOu1C7I/AAAAAAAAAbM/76vn4bIGGvA/s1600/MoralProgressA.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"316\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-KE7SBJJtJm8/UEkByOu1C7I/AAAAAAAAAbM/76vn4bIGGvA/s400/MoralProgressA.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></div>\nFor this chart, I assumed a progress factor, negative or positive, of one-third of the spread of the random fluctuation (i.e., adding or subtracting 0.1 to each step, in addition to the -0.3 to +0.3 random fluctuation). For the \"toward 0\" positions, I assumed positive incremental pressure when the previous period value was (absolutely) negative and negative incremental pressure when the previous period was positive. As with the previous graph, at the end I normalized the maximum and minimum values to +1 and -1.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see,\u00a0many more moral issues show consistent trend directions over time and the most extreme positions tend to be held at the beginning and the end of the analysis period. The latter pattern follows from the fact that even if the initial historical position at time zero is by some objective standard moderate, as long as it is not spot on the target number, the trend over time should be roughly unidirectional toward the target number; and then the normalizing will make that initial position look extreme.<br/>\n<div>\n<br/>\nTwo caveats and a final note:<br/>\n<br/>\nCaveat 1: It will of course be difficult to code this objectively, and it's quite possible that the final outcome will vary depending on hard-to-justify coding decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaveat 2: My guess is that if we were to chart moral and political positions from the 1600s to the present we would see a chart somewhat like the second (progressive) chart, whereas if we were to chart equal time intervals back to the ancient West, we would see a more random-looking chart like the first. So which time period should be examined? A case for choosing the shorter period might be that it is only after the printing press and widespread communication of philosophical ideas that we should expect to see rationally-driven moral progress. However a consideration against choosing the shorter period is this: There might be cultural factors, such as industrialization and capitalization, that have created consistent unidirectional pressures on moral and political norms, independently of the rational case for adopting those norms; and for that reason the broader the temporal span the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal note: We might be able to construct similar charts to evaluate whether there has been progress in metaphysics.<br/>\n<br/>\n(By the way,\u00a0see\u00a0<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/04/steven-pinker-wow-how-awesome-we.html\">here</a>\u00a0for another post of mine on Pinker's intellectualist liberalism.)</div>\n</div>\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>(collaborative with <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ucr.edu/people/grads/moore/index.html\">Alan Moore</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me to doubt whether the external world exists -- that is, whether anything exists other than my own stream of conscious experience. Radical solipsism is of course <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">crazy</a>. But can I <i>show</i> it to be wrong? Or is my only recourse simply to <i>assume </i>it's wrong, since any attempt at proof would be circular? Can I break out of the solipsistic circle, using facts about my own stream of experience, knowable from within the solipsistic perspective, to license an inference to the existence of something beyond my stream of experience?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most famous philosophical attempts to prove the existence of an external world from solipsism-compatible assumptions and methods -- for example, Descartes's and Kant's -- are generally acknowledged by the philosophical community to fail. \u00a0I'm inclined to think those attempts fail because they set the bar too high: They aim for certainty through deductive proof. \u00a0Better, perhaps, to aim lower -- to use scientific methods and scientific standards, licensing only tentative conclusions as the current best explanation of the available evidence. In another way, too, I aim low: I aim only to refute solipsistic doubts in particular, not other sorts of skeptical doubts such as doubts about memory or reasoning. In fact, I will take the general standards of science for granted, insofar as those general standards are compatible with solipsism. I aim to do solipsistic science.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year on my blog I presented the results of two experiments designed to provide evidence that an external world does indeed exist.\u00a0<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/06/external-word-preliminary-experimental.html\">The first experiment</a> suggested that something exists (\"my computer\") that is swifter than I at calculating prime numbers. <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/09/external-world-more-experimental.html\">The second experiment</a> suggested that the world has some constancy to it that exceeds the constancy of my memory. Today, I will report on a third experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf solipsism is true, nothing in the universe should exist that is better than I am at chess. Nothing should exist with chess-playing practical capacities that exceed my own. Now I believe that I stink at chess, and my seeming student \"Alan\" seems to have told me that he is good at chess. If solipsism is true, then he should not be able to beat me at rates higher than statistical chance. I agreed with this seeming-Alan to play twenty games of speed chess, with a limit of about five seconds per move.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what seems to be a picture of our procedure:<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZXBsRbF1NBs/UCWRxprTFpI/AAAAAAAAAYI/sleCzGYUg7c/s1600/IMG_9419-bw.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZXBsRbF1NBs/UCWRxprTFpI/AAAAAAAAAYI/sleCzGYUg7c/s400/IMG_9419-bw.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><br/>\n(photo credit: seeming-Gerardo Sanchez)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results: seeming-Alan won 17, I won 2, and one stalemate. 17/19 is statistically higher than 50%, p &lt; .001 (hand calculated).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me that I might have hoped to lose, so as to generate results confirming my preferred hypothesis that the external world exists. Against this concern, I comfort myself with the following thoughts: If it was an <i>unconscious </i>desire to lose, then that implies that something exists in the universe besides my own stream of conscious experience, namely, an unconscious part of my mind. So radical solipsism is false. If it was, instead, a <i>conscious </i>desire to lose, I should have been able to detect it, barring an unusual degree of introspective skepticism. What I detected was a desire to win as many games as I could, given my background assumption that if Alan actually exists I would be hard pressed to win even one or two games. I found myself repeatedly and forcefully struck by the impression that the universe contained a practical intelligence superior to my own and bent on defeating me -- an impression, of course, confirmed by the results. The most natural scientific explanation of the pattern in my experience is that that impression is correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might easily enough <i>dream </i>of being consistently defeated in chess. But dreams of this sort, as I seem to remember, differ from the present experiment in one crucial way: They are vague on the specific moves or unrealistic about those moves. In the same way, I might dream of having proven Fermat's last theorem. Both types of case involve dream-like gappiness or irrationality or delusive credulity -- the type of gappiness or irrationality or delusive credulity that might make me see nothing remarkable in my daughter's growing wings or in discovering a new whole number between 5 and 6. Genuine dream doubt might involve doubt about my basic rational capacities, but if so such doubts are additional to simply solipsistic doubt. Whether I am dreaming or not, if I consistently experience specific clever and perceptive chess moves that repeatedly exploit flaws in my own conscious strategizing, flaws that I experience as surprising, it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that something exists that surpasses my own conscious intelligence in at least this one area.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>People's responses to hypothetical moral scenarios can vary substantially depending on the order in which those scenarios are presented (e.g., <a href=\"http://cognition.berkeley.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Lombrozo-CogSci-2009.pdf\">Lombrozo 2009</a>).  Consider the well-known \"Switch\" and \"Push\" versions of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">The Trolley Problem</a>.  In the Switch version, an out-of-control boxcar is headed toward five people whom it will kill if nothing is done.  You're standing by a railroad switch, and you can divert the boxcar onto a side-track, saving the five people.  However, there's one person on the side-track, who would then be killed.  Many respondents will say that there's nothing morally wrong with flipping the switch, killing the one to save the five.  Some will even say that you're morally obliged to flip the switch.  In the Push version, instead of being able to save the five by flipping a switch, you can do so by pushing a heavy man into the path of the boxcar, killing him but saving the five as his weight slows the boxcar.  Despite the surface similarity to the Switch case, most people think it's not okay to push the man.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the order effect: If you present the Push case first, people are much less likely to say it's okay to flip the switch when you then later present the Switch case than if you present the Switch case first.  In one study, <a href=\"http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~cushman/\">Fiery Cushman</a> and I found that if we presented Push first, respondents tended to rate the two cases equivalently (on a seven-point scale from \"extremely morally good\" to \"extremely morally bad\").  But if we presented Switch first, only about half the respondents rated the scenarios equivalently.  Somewhat simplified: People who see Push first will say that it's morally bad to push the man, and then when they see Switch they will say it's similarly bad to flip the switch.  People who see Switch first will say it's okay to flip the switch, but then when they see the Push case they don't say \"Oh, I guess that's okay too\".  Rather, they dig in their heels and say that pushing the man is bad despite the superficial similarity to the Switch case, and thus they rate the two scenarios inequivalently.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrikingly, Fiery and I found that professional philosophers show the same size order effects on their judgment about hypothetical scenarios as do non-philosophers.  Even when we restricted our analysis to respondents reporting a PhD in philosophy and an area of specialization or competence in ethics, we found no overall reduction of the magnitude of the order effect.    (This research is forthcoming in <a href=\"http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0268-1064\">Mind &amp; Language</a>; manuscript draft available <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">here</a>.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/\">Doctrine of the Double Effect</a> is the orthodox (but by no means universally accepted) explanation of why it might be okay to flip the switch but not okay to push the man.  According to the Doctrine of the Double Effect, it's worse to harm someone as a <i>means </i>of bringing about a good outcome than it is to harm someone as merely a <i>foreseen side-effect</i> of bringing about a good outcome.  Applied to the trolley case, the thought is this: If you flip the switch, the means of saving the five is diverting the boxcar to the side-track, and the death of the one person is just a foreseen side effect.  However, if you push the man, killing him is the means of saving the five.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow maybe this is a sound doctrine, soundly applied, or maybe not.  But what Fiery and I did was this: At the end of our experiment, we asked our participants whether they endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Specifically we asked the following:<br/>\n<blockquote>Sometimes it is necessary to use one person\u2019s death as a means to saving several more people\u2014killing one helps you accomplish the goal of saving several.  Other times one person\u2019s death is a side-effect of saving several more people\u2014the goal of saving several unavoidably ends up killing one as a consequence.  Is the first morally better, worse, or the same as the second?<br/>\n<br/>\n[Response options: \u2018better\u2019 \u2018worse\u2019 or \u2018same\u2019]</blockquote>Non-philosophers' responses to this question were unrelated to the order of the presentation of the scenarios.  We suspect that many of them didn't see the connection between this abstract principle and the Push and Switch scenarios presented much earlier in the questionnaire.  But philosophers' responses <i>were </i>related to the order of presentation of the Push and Switch scenarios.  Specifically, the majority of philosophers (62%) who saw the Switch scenario first endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  However, the doctrine was endorsed only by a minority of philosophers (46%) who saw Push first (p = .02).  What seems to have happened is this: By manipulating order of presentation, Fiery and I influenced the likelihood that respondents would rate the scenarios equivalently or inequivalently.  We thereby also influenced the likelihood of our philosopher respondents' endorsing a doctrine that appears to justify inequivalent judgments about the scenarios, the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Rather than relying on stable principles to reach judgments about the cases, a certain portion of philosophers appear to have reached their scenario judgments on the basis of covert factors like order of presentation and then endorsed principles only post-hoc as a means of rationalizing their covertly influenced judgments about the specific cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nManipulating the order of <i>two </i>pairs of scenarios (a Push-Switch case and a <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/\">Moral Luck</a> case) appeared to amplify the magnitude of this effect, by pushing philosophers either generally toward or generally against endorsing inequivalency-supporting principles.  With two scenario pairs ordered to favor inequivalency, we found 70% of our philosopher respondents endorsing the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  With the two pairs ordered to favor equivalency, only 28% endorsed the doctrine (p &lt; .001).  This is a very large shift in opinion, given how well-known the doctrine is among philosophers and given that by this point in the questionnaire, all philosophers had viewed all versions of each scenario.  We then filtered our results, looking only at respondents reporting a PhD and an area of specialization or competence in ethics, thinking that these high-grade specialists (mostly ethics professors at <a href=\"http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/\">Leiter-ranked</a> institutions) might have more stable opinions about the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  They didn't.  When the two scenario pairs were arranged to favor inequivalency, 62% of ethics PhDs endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  When the two pairs were arranged to favor equivalency, 29% endorsed the doctrine (p &lt; .05).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simplest interpretation of our overall results, across three types of scenarios (Double Effect, Moral Luck, and <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/\">Action-Omission</a>), is that in cases like these skill in philosophy doesn't manifest as skill in consistently applying explicitly endorsed abstract principles to reach stable judgments about hypothetical scenarios; rather, it manifests more as skill in choosing principles to rationalize, post-hoc, scenario judgments that are driven by the same types of factors that drive non-philosophers' judgments.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div> ", "url": "https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html dir=\"ltr\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:b=\"http://www.google.com/2005/gml/b\" xmlns:data=\"http://www.google.com/2005/gml/data\" xmlns:expr=\"http://www.google.com/2005/gml/expr\">\n<head>\n<link href=\"https://www.blogger.com/static/v1/widgets/2549344219-widget_css_bundle.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"/>\n<meta content=\"text/html;

Although most philosophers seem to view my work either neutrally or positively, or have concerns about the empirical details of this or that study, others react quite negatively to the whole project, more or less in principle.<p>\n\nAbout a month ago on Facebook, <a href=\"http://samrickless.com/\">Samuel Rickless</a> did such a nice job articulating some general concerns (see his comment on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10214223222607081\">this public post</a>) that I thought I'd quote his comments here and share some of my reactions.<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qoHvKKHU3g/WxFX5nlo1KI/AAAAAAAAA1k/Mz41tMXygJsV7PTMLjuwcydr2sEfcI9MQCLcBGAs/s1600/Boethius_initial_consolation_philosophy.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"599\" data-original-width=\"785\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qoHvKKHU3g/WxFX5nlo1KI/AAAAAAAAA1k/Mz41tMXygJsV7PTMLjuwcydr2sEfcI9MQCLcBGAs/s320/Boethius_initial_consolation_philosophy.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n<i>First, My Research:<p></p></i>\n\n* In a series of studies published from 2009 to 2014, mostly in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.stetson.edu/other/faculty/profiles/joshua-rust.php\">Joshua Rust</a> (and summarized <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">here</a>), I've empirically explored the moral behavior of ethics professors.  As far as I know, no one else had ever systematically examined this question.  <b>Across 17 measures of (arguably) moral behavior,</b> ranging from rates of charitable donation to staying in contact with one's mother to vegetarianism to littering to responding to student emails to peer ratings of overall moral behavior, <b>I have found not a single main measure on which ethicists appeared to act morally better than comparison groups of other professors</b>; nor do they appear to behave better overall when the data are merged meta-analytically.  (Caveat: on some secondary measures we found ethicists to behave better.  However, on other measures we found them to behave worse, with no clearly interpretable overall pattern.)<p>\n\n* In a pair of studies with <a href=\"https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/fiery-cushman\">Fiery Cushman</a>, published in <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">2015</a>, I've found that <b>philosophers, including professional ethicists, seem to be no less susceptible than non-philosophers to apparently irrational order effects and framing effects in their evaluation of moral dilemmas</b>.<p>\n\n* More recently, I've turned my attention to philosophical pedagogy.  In an <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsClasses.htm\">unpublished critical review from 2013</a>, I found <b>little good empirical evidence that business ethics or medical ethics instruction has any practical effect on student behavior</b>.  I have been following up with some empirical research of my own with several different collaborators.  None of it is complete yet, but preliminary results tend to confirm the lack of practical effect, except perhaps when there's the right kind of narrative or emotional engagement.  On grounds of armchair plausibility, I tend to favor multi-causal, canceling explanations over the view that philosophical reflection is simply inert (<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.643.9791\">contra </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777\">Jon Haidt</a>); thus I'm inclined to explore how backfire effects might on average tend to cancel positive effects.  It was a post on the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/04/three-ways-your-ethics-class-might.html\">possible backfire effects of teaching ethics</a> that prompted Rickless's comment.<p>\n<i>Rickless's Objection:</i></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n(shared with permission, adding lineation and emphasis for clarity)<p>\n\nRickless: And I\u2019ll be honest, Eric, all this stuff about how unethical ethicists are, and how counterproductive their courses might be, really bothers me. It\u2019s not that I think that ethics courses can\u2019t be improved or that all ethicists are wonderful people. But please understand that the takeaway from this kind of research and speculation, as it will likely be processed by journalists and others who may well pick up and run with it, will be that philosophers are shits whose courses turn their students into shits. And this may lead to the defunding of philosophy, the removal of ethics courses from business school, and, to my mind, a host of other consequences that are almost certainly far worse than the ills that you are looking to prevent.<p>\n\nSchwitzgebel: Samuel, I understand that concern. You might be right about the effects. However, I also think that if it is correct that ethics classes as standardly taught have little of the positive effect that some administrators and students hope for from them, we as a society should know that. It should be explored in a rigorous way. On the possibly bright side, a new dimension of my research is starting to examine conditions under which teaching does have a positive measurable effect on real-world behavior. I am hopeful that understanding that better will lead us to teach better.<p>\n\nRickless: In theory, what you say about knowing that courses have little or no positive effect makes sense. But in practice, I have the following concerns.<p>\n\nFirst, <b>no set of studies could possibly measure all the positive and negative effects</b> of teaching ethics this way or that way. You just can\u2019t control all the potentially relevant variables, in part because you don\u2019t know what all the potentially relevant variables are, in part because you can\u2019t fix all the parameters with only one parameter allowed to vary.<p>\n\nSecond, you need to be thinking very seriously about whether your own motives (particularly motives related to bursting bubbles and countering conventional wisdom) are playing a role in your research, because those motives can have unseen effects on the way that research is conducted, as well as the conclusions drawn from it. I am not imputing bad motives to you. Far from it, and quite the opposite. But I think that <b>all researchers, myself included, want their research to be striking and interesting, sometimes surprising</b>.<p>\n\nThird, <b>the tendency of researchers is to draw conclusions that go beyond the actual evidence</b>.<p>\n\nFourth, the combination of all these factors leads to <b>conclusions that have a significant likelihood of being mistaken</b>.<p>\n\nFifth, <b>those conclusions will likely be taken much more seriously by the powers-that-be</b> than by the researchers themselves. All the qualifiers inserted by researchers are usually removed by journalists and administrators.<p>\n\nSixth, <b>the consequences on the profession if negative results are taken seriously by persons in positions of power will be dire</b>.<p>\n\nUnder the circumstances, <b>it seems to me that research that is designed to reveal negative facts about the way things are taught had better be airtight before being publicized</b>. The problem is that there is no such research. This doesn\u2019t mean that there is no answer to problems of ineffective teaching. But that is an issue for another day.<p>\n<i>My Reply:</i><p>\n<i>On the issue of motives:</i> Of course it is fun to have striking research!  Given my <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/SelfUcs.htm\">general skepticism about self-knowledge</a>, including of motives, I won't attempt self-diagnosis.  However, I will say that except for recent studies that are not yet complete, I have published every empirical study I've done on this topic, with no file-drawered results.  I am not selecting only the striking material for publication.  Also, in my recent pedagogy research I am collaborating with other researchers who very much hope for positive results.<p>\n<b>On the likelihood of being mistaken:</b> I acknowledge that any one study is likely to be mistaken.  However, my results are pretty consistent across a wide variety of methods and behavior types, including some issues specifically chosen with the thought that they might show ethicists in a good light (the charity and vegetarianism measures in <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2012.727135\">Schwitzgebel and Rust 2014</a>).  I think this adds to credibility, though it would be better if other researchers with different methods and theoretical perspectives attempted to confirm or disconfirm our findings.  There is currently <a href=\"https://osf.io/35r48/\">one replication attempt</a> ongoing among German-language philosophers, so we will see how that plays out!<p>\n<b>On whether the powers-that-be will take the conclusions more seriously than the researchers:</b> I interpret Rickless here as meaning that they will tend to remove the caveats and go for the sexy headline.  I do think that is possible.  One potentially alarming fact from this point of view is that my most-cited and seemingly best-known study is the only study where I found ethicists seeming to behave worse than the comparison groups: the <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsBooks.htm\">study of missing library books</a>.  However, it was also my first published study on the topic, so I don't know to what extent the extra attention is a primacy effect.<p>\n<b>On possibly dire consequences:</b> The most likely path for dire consequences seems to me to be this: Part of the administrative justification for requiring ethics classes might be the implicit expectation that university-level ethics instruction positively influences moral behavior.  If this expectation is removed, so too is part of the administrative justification for ethics instruction.<p>\n\nRickless's conclusion appears to be that no empirical research on this topic, with negative or null results, should be published unless it is \"airtight\", and that it is practically impossible for such research to be airtight.  From this I infer that <b>Rickless thinks either that (a.) only positive results should be published</b>, while negative or null results remain unpublished because inevitably not airtight, <b>or that (b.) no studies of this sort should be published at all, whether positive, negative, or null</b>.<p>\n\nRickless's argument has merit, and I see the path to this conclusion.  Certainly there is a risk to the discipline in publishing negative or null results, and one ought to be careful.<p>\n\nHowever, both (a) and (b) seem to be bad policy.<p>\n<b>On (a): To think that only positive results should be published</b> (or more moderately that we should have a much higher bar for negative or null results than for positive ones) <b>runs contrary to the standards of open science</b> that have recently received so much attention in the social psychology <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis\">replication crisis</a>.  In the long run it is probably contrary to the interests of science, philosophy, and society as a whole for us to pursue a policy that will create an illusory disproportion of positive research.<p>\n\nThat said, there is a much more moderate strand of (a) that I could endorse: Being cautious and sober about one's research, rather than yielding to the temptation to inflate dubious, sexy results for the sake of publicity.  I hope that in my own work I generally meet this standard, and I would recommend that same standard for both positive <i>and </i>negative or null research.<p>\n<b>\nOn (b): It seems at least as undesirable to discourage all empirical research on these topics.</b>  Don't we want to know the relationship between philosophical moral reflection and real-world moral behavior?  Even if you think that studying the behavior of professional ethicists in particular is unilluminating, surely studying the effects of philosophical pedagogy is worthwhile.  We should want to know what sorts of effects our courses have on the students who take them and under what conditions -- <i>especially </i>if part of the administrative justification for requiring ethics courses is the assumption that they do have a practical effect.  To reject the whole enterprise of empirically researching the effects of studying philosophy because there's a risk that some studies will show that studying philosophy has little practical impact on real-world choices -- that seems radically antiscientific.<p>\n\nRickless raises legitimate worries.  I think the best practical response is more research, by more research groups, with open sharing of results, and open discussions of the issue by people working from a wide variety of perspectives.  In the long run, I hope that some of my null results can lay the groundwork for a fuller understanding of the moral psychology of philosophy.  Understanding the range of conditions under which philosophical moral reflection does and does not have practical effects on real-world behavior should ultimately empower rather than disempower philosophy as a discipline.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Boethius_initial_consolation_philosophy.jpg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/does-it-harm-philosophy-as-discipline.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-06-01T08:05:00-07:00\">8:05 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6688053486474536756\" onclick=\"\">13\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, December 23, 2015</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"3367914535046277057\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/12/a-response-to-critiques-of-cushmans-and.html\">A Response to Critiques of Cushman's and My Work on Philosophers' Susceptibility to Order Effects</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>The <i>order </i>in which moral dilemmas are presented matters to people's judgments and can substantially influence later judgments about abstract moral principles.  This is true even among professional ethicists with PhD's in philosophy.  In <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">2015</a>, <a href=\"http://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/\">Fiery Cushman</a> and I published empirical evidence supporting these claims.  We invite a metaphilosophical conclusion: <b>If even professional philosophers' expert judgments are easily swayed by order of presentation, then such judgments might not be stable enough to serve as secure grounds for philosophical theorizing.</b><p>\n<i>Synthese </i>has recently published two critiques of the literature on order effects in philosophy, which address Fiery's and my work (HT <a href=\"http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/xphi/2015/12/two-papers-critical-of-order-effect-research-at-synthese.html\">Wesley Buckwalter</a>).  Both critiques make valuable points.  However  both also admit of some clear replies.<p>\n\nTo fix ideas, consider two versions of the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">Trolley Problem</a>:<blockquote>\n<i>Push:</i> A runaway boxcar is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  Jane can stop the boxcar by pushing a hiker with a heavy backpack in front of the boxcar, killing him but saving the five.<p>\n<i>Switch:</i> A runaway boxcar is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  Vicki can stop the boxcar by flipping a switch to divert it to a sidetrack where it will kill one person instead of the five.</p></blockquote><p>\n\nFiery and I presented Push-type and Switch-type scenarios (fleshed with a bit more detail) to professional philosophers and two comparison groups of non-philosophers.  We found that when professional philosophers saw a Push-type scenario before a Switch-type scenario, 73% rated the two scenarios equivalently on a 7-point scale.  Then later in the questionnaire when asked about the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/\">Doctrine of the Double Effect</a> -- a moral principle often interpreted implying that Push-type cases are morally worse than Switch-type cases -- only a minority, 46%, endorsed that principle.  In contrast, among philosophers who saw Switch before Push only 54% rated the two scenarios equivalently, and then later a majority, 62%, endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Endorsement of the principle thus seemed to shift, post-hoc, to rationalize philosophers' order-manipulated judgments about the scenarios.<p>\n\nWe found similar effects for <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/\">Action-Omission</a>, <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/\">Moral Luck</a>, and \"<a href=\"http://psych.hanover.edu/classes/cognition/papers/tversky81.pdf\">Asian disease</a>\" type cases (though not consistently for every measure across the board).\n\nPhilosophers with PhDs and self-reported competence or specialization in ethics showed no smaller effects than other philosophers or than comparison groups of non-philosophers -- and in fact trended slightly (non-significantly) toward showing larger order effects.<p>\n\nIn general, we found pretty substantial effect sizes, suggesting substantial instability of judgment even in philosophical respondents' areas of expertise.  Hence the metaphilosophical worry.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Critique by <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-015-0985-9\">Zachary Horne and Jonathan Livengood</a>.</i><p>\n\nHorne and Livengood make three main points about the literature on order effects in philosophy:<p>\n\n(A.) First, they helpfully <b>distinguish between what they call \"updating effects\" and \"genuine ordering effects\".</b>  Genuine ordering effects, in their terminology, are effects measured only <i>after </i>all the stimuli have been presented.  \"Updating effects\" are measures taken along the way, and might well reflect participants' learning.  There is of course nothing irrational in judging Scenario B differently as a result of seeing Scenario A because one <i>learned </i>something by seeing Scenario A.  Most philosophical research on order effects, they note, takes the measures along the way -- and thus might be measuring learning rather than true order effects.<p>\n\n(B.) Second, they point out that <b>perceptual judgments also show order effects</b>.  Thus, if we are to reject any type of evidence that shows order effects, then we must reject perceptual evidence too, which would lead to radical skepticism.<p>\n\n(C.) Third, they point out that <b>order can sometimes reasonably make a difference to the evaluation of evidence.</b>  For example, a smile followed by a frown, on the same person's face, is a different type of evidence than a frown followed by a smile.<p>\n\nOn (A): I find the labels tendentious (since if we know there isn't learning-type updating going on, what we might want to call \"genuine order effects\" can plausibly be measured mid-stream), however it probably is correct that most studies do not sufficiently rule out the possibility of learning or updating in the course of the experiment, if they have novice participants and take the measurements after each scenario rather than after both scenarios.  However, since our participants were experts, <b>we think it unlikely that a significant number learned anything in the process of our brief experiment that would rationally justify shifting their judgment</b> about the equivalency or non-equivalency of Push and Switch.  And as Horne and Livengood note, <b>our measure of endorsement of the Doctrine of the Double Effect is a measurement of a \"genuine ordering effect\" even by their own lights</b>.<p>\n\nOn (B): Yes, of course it would be silly to reject all means of learning that are subject to any order effects!  The epistemic sting, as they note, depends not on the mere existence of an order effect in one case, but on how <i>large </i>and how <i>prevalent </i>the order effects are.  This is an open empirical question.  But the limited empirical evidence that exists suggests that order effects are substantial and prevalent in moral dilemma cases.  <b>So far, we have found order effects in all of the scenario types we've tried, with about a 10-20% shift in opinion on the moral equivalency of our scenario pairs</b> and in preference for the risky option in the \"Asian disease\" cases.<p>\n\nOn (C): It's interesting to consider cases in which earlier evidence rightly colors our reaction to later evidence, but trolley problems presented to disciplinary experts seems a different kind of case.<p>\n\nFinally, Horne and Livengood suggest that exposure to a pair of dilemmas in our study is unlikely to have a long-lasting impact on professional philosophers' beliefs.  I agree.  They continue, \"But if there is no long-lasting impact, then we think the effect is unlikely to matter to actual philosophical practice outside of the laboratory\" (p. 17).  I don't think this follows.  Fiery's and my view is not that philosophers' opinions are <i>permanently influenced</i> by the order in which the scenarios are presented on any single occasion, but rather that their opinions are <i>unstable </i>-- possibly influenced one direction on one occasion, in another direction on another occasion.  This instability is what drives the metaphilosophical worry.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Critique by <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-014-0579-y\">Regina Rini</a>:</i><p>\n\nRini -- a recent <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Regina%20Rini\">guest blogger</a> here at the Splintered Mind -- looks only at our 2012 study.  (Our 2015 study wasn't published until after her paper was in press.)  She finds it plausible that if professional philosophers were already familiar with these cases they would not exhibit order effects of the sort Fiery and I find.  She suggests that perhaps respondents were not previously familiar with the cases -- or at least not familiar in the right sort of way.  She calls this the \"familiarity problem\" and offers four possible explanations:<p>\n\n(1.) The respondents were <b>not really experts</b>.  She wonders if our participants, recruited through the internet, really had the degrees they claimed to have.<p>\n\n(2.) The respondents<b> didn't carefully attend</b> to our scenarios.  Maybe they breezed through them so quickly that they failed to notice relevant features.<p>\n\n(3.) The respondents <b>might not have familiar responses</b> to these types of scenarios.  Perhaps they have so far refrained from forming judgments on such cases and principles.<p>\n\n(4.) The respondents might not have <b>diachronically stable familiar responses</b>.  This is the explanation Fiery and I favor.  However, Rini helpfully points out that <b>as long as philosophers are <i>aware </i>that their responses are not diachronically stable, the metaphilosophical threat is reduced</b>: Presumably philosophers who are aware that their responses are not stable would be reluctant to ground their theorizing on those responses.<p>\n\nOn (1): I am not aware of a general problem in the survey literature of respondents' frequently misreporting their educational status -- though certainly a bit of misreporting is possible.  One specific piece of evidence against this possibility in our own study is that we recruited philosophers mostly by asking department chairs to forward a recruitment email to faculty and graduate students in their departments.  <b>Most of our \"philosopher\" participants took the survey within just a few days of these emails.</b><p>\n\nOn (2): The <b>median response time on the first scenario was 40 seconds</b>, on the second scenario was 34 seconds.  While these are not huge response times, if you stop to count out 34 seconds now, you'll probably notice that it's a reasonable amount of time for a thoughtful response to a brief scenario.<p>\n\nOn (3) and (4): These are potentially quite serious issues, and in fact our follow-up study in 2015 was designed specifically to address them, after we saw an early version of Rini's critique.  In our 2015 study we <i>specifically asked</i> participants if they were previously familiar with the scenarios.  We also asked whether they regarded themselves as \"having had a stable opinion\" about the issues before participating in the experiment, and whether they regarded themselves as experts on those very issues.  We also added a \"reflection\" condition to help address concern (2).  In the reflection condition we asked participants to reflect carefully before responding and enforced a minimum 15-second delay between when participants reported having finished reading the scenario and when their response options appeared.<p>\n<b>We did not find that self-reported familiarity or stability reduced the size of order effects in two different types of scenario pairs (trolley problems and risky-choice \"Asian disease\"-type problems), nor did we find reduced order effects in the reflection condition compared to a normal control condition without special instructions to reflect.</b><p>\n\nFor example, percentage rating the Push and Switch scenarios equivalently:<p>\n<a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-0cCzBDK8wpE/VnshpBgzymI/AAAAAAAABOw/JyvdvyMsctA/s1600/Stability2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-0cCzBDK8wpE/VnshpBgzymI/AAAAAAAABOw/JyvdvyMsctA/s400/Stability2.jpg\"/></a>\n\nThus, I am inclined to think that Rini's fourth suggestion is the most plausible -- that participants do not have diachronically stable familiar responses, despite high levels of expertise.  But since those who <i>report </i>having stable responses were no less subject to order effects than were those who reported not having stable responses, self-knowledge of stability appears to be largely absent.  Despite Rini's interesting suggestion that instability is metaphilosophically non-threatening if people are aware of it, Fiery's and my results suggest that we should not hasten to that comfort.<p>\n\n----------------------------------------------<p>\n\nBoth Horne and Livengood and Rini emphasize that we only have very limited evidence about order effects on professional philosophers' judgments.  I agree!  Fiery's and my two studies are hardly decisive.  Convergent evidence from several different labs would be necessary before drawing any confident conclusions, especially if those conclusions are at variance with what one feels one knows from personal experience.  Rini also makes positive suggestions for follow-up experimental work that might be done, which I am inclined to support.  Both critiques raise important methodological concerns that ought to help shape and direct future work on this topic.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/12/a-response-to-critiques-of-cushmans-and.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2015-12-23T14:23:00-08:00\">2:23 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3367914535046277057\" onclick=\"\">20\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/Regina%20Rini\" rel=\"tag\">Regina Rini</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, October 15, 2014</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2399164610829922094\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/10/professional-philosophers.html\">Professional Philosophers\u2019 Susceptibility to Order Effects and Framing Effects in Evaluating Moral Dilemmas</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/FieryCushman/Home.html\">Fiery Cushman</a> and I have a <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">new paper</a> in draft, exploring the question of whether professional philosophers' judgments about moral dilemmas are less influenced than non-philosophers' by factors such as order of presentation and phrasing differences.<p>\n\nWe recruited hundreds of academic participants with graduate degrees in philosophy and a comparison group of academics with graduate degrees in other fields.  We gave them two \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a>\" and two <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)\">\"Asian disease\"-type framing effect</a> cases.<p>\n\nWe presented the trolley problems either with a Switch case first (the protagonist saves five people by Switching a runaway trolley onto a side track where it kills one), followed by a Push or Drop case (saving five by Pushing one person into the trolley's path or by Dropping him into its path); or Push/Drop first, followed by Switch.  For each scenario, participants rated the protagonists' choice to kill the one person to save the five others, using a 7-point scale from \"extremely morally good\" to \"extremely morally bad\".<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">Our previous research</a> suggests that non-philosophers are much more likely to judge the Push case and the Switch case equivalently when Push is presented first than when Switch is presented first.  On some views of <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phc3.12154/abstract\">philosophical expertise</a>, philosophers' judgments about these cases should be less dependent on order of presentation than are non-philosophers' judgments.  In other words, philosophers, due to their familiarity with scenarios of this type and their expertise in applying moral principles to them, should have more stable opinions, less influenced by order of presentation.  <b>We wanted to see if philosophers with prior familiarity with the cases, or self-reported expertise in the area, or self-reported stability of opinion, would show smaller order effects.</b>  We also wanted to see if we could reduce order effects by enforcing a delay before responding during which we encouraged participants to reflect carefully on different versions of the scenario and different ways of phrasing the scenarios.<p>\n\nWe were unable to find any level of expertise at which the order effects were detectably reduced.  Nor did adding a reflection condition appear to reduce the order effects.  This figure shows the rates at which Switch was rated as morally equivalent to either Drop or Push on the 7-point scale:<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-ORv9cv_xgsI/VD7mgpWpyEI/AAAAAAAAArs/FA4BxCMPI9M/s1600/Stability1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-ORv9cv_xgsI/VD7mgpWpyEI/AAAAAAAAArs/FA4BxCMPI9M/s400/Stability1.jpg\"/></a></div>[click to enlarge]<p>\n<b>The order effect, as indicated by the differences in height between the black and the gray bars, is basically the same for philosophers and the non-philosophers, even in the \"reflection\" condition.</b><p>\n\nThis next figure breaks the results down by degree of self-reported expertise among philosopher respondents:<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujUEvdwrOsg/VD7n7-Qd2RI/AAAAAAAAAr4/H5WN91JVl8M/s1600/Stability2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-ujUEvdwrOsg/VD7n7-Qd2RI/AAAAAAAAAr4/H5WN91JVl8M/s400/Stability2.jpg\"/></a></div>\n[click to enlarge]<p>\n<b>Note that at no level of expertise does the order effect appear to be reduced: not among philosophers reporting being professors with a specialization in ethics, nor among philosophers reporting having a \"stable opinion\" about trolley problems of this sort.</b>  If anything, the trend appears to be toward <i>larger </i>order effects with increasing expertise.<p>\n\nSome of the most famous results in psychology are the Tversky-Kahneman \"loss aversion\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)\">framing effects</a>.

A runaway train trolley will kill five people ahead on the tracks if nothing is done.  But -- yay! -- you can intervene and save those five people!  There's a catch, though: your intervention will cost one person's life.  Should you intervene?  Both philosophers' and non-philosophers' judgments vary depending on the details of the case.  <b>One interesting question is how sensitive philosophers and non-philosophers are to details that might be morally relevant</b> (as opposed to presumably irrelevant distracting features like <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">order of presentation</a> or the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/12/second-vs-third-person-presentations-of.html\">point-of-view used in expressing the scenario</a>).<p>\n\nConsider, then, these four variants of the trolley dilemma:<p>\n<b>Switch</b>: You can flip a switch to divert the trolley onto a dead-end side-track where it will kill one person instead of the five.<p>\n<b>Loop</b>: You can flip a switch to divert the trolley into a side-track that loops back around to the main track.  It will kill one person on the side track, stopping on his body.  If his body weren't there to block it, though, the trolley would have continued through the loop and killed the five.<p>\n<b>Drop</b>: There is a hiker with a heavy backpack on a footbridge above the trolley tracks.  You can flip a switch which will drop him through a trap door and onto the tracks in front of the runaway trolley.  The trolley will kill him, stopping on his body, saving the five.<p>\n<b>Push</b>: Same as Drop, except that you are on the footbridge standing next to the hiker and the only way to intervene is to push the hiker off the bridge into the path of the trolley.  (Your own body is not heavy enough to stop the trolley.)<p>\n\nSure, all of this is pretty artificial and silly.  But orthodox opinion is that it's permissible to flip the switch in Switch but impermissible to push the hiker in Push; and it's interesting to think about whether that is correct, and if so why.\n<p>\n<b><a href=\"http://brown.edu/Research/Cushman-Lab/FieryCushman/Home.html\">Fiery Cushman</a> and I decided to compare philosophers' and non-philosophers' responses to such cases, to see if philosophers show evidence of different or more sophisticated thinking about them.</b>  We presented both trolley-type setups like this and also similarly structured scenarios involving a motorboat, a hospital, and a burning building (for our full list of stimuli see Q14-Q17 <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/OrderEffects-SOM-110113.pdf\">here</a>.)<p>\n\nIn our published article on this, we found that philosophers were <a href=\"http://brown.edu/Research/Cushman-Lab/docs/schwitzgebel&amp;cushman_2012.pdf\">just as subject to order effects</a> in evaluating such scenarios as were non-philosophers.  But we focused mostly on Switch vs. Push -- and also some <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/\">moral luck</a> and <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/\">action/omission</a> cases -- and we didn't have space to really explore Loop and Drop.<p>\n\nAbout 270 philosophers (with master's degree or more) and about 670 non-philosophers (with master's degree or more) rated paragraph-length versions of these scenarios, presented in random order, on a 7-point scale from 1 (extremely morally good) through 7 (extremely morally bad; the midpoint at 4 was marked \"neither good nor bad\").  Overall, all the scenarios were rated similarly and near the midpoint of the scale (from a mean of 4.0 for Switch to 4.4 for Push [paired t = 5.8, p &lt; .001]), and philosophers and non-philosophers mean ratings were very similar.<p>\n\nPerhaps more interesting than mean ratings, though, are equivalency ratings: <b>How likely were respondents to rate scenario pairs equivalently?</b>  The Loop case is subtly different from the Switch case: Arguably, in Loop but not Switch, the man's death is a means or cause of saving the five, as opposed to a merely foreseen side effect of an action that saves the five.  Might philosophers care about this subtle difference more than non-philosophers?  Likewise, the Drop case is different from the Push case, in that Push but not Drop requires proximity and physical contact.  If that difference in physical contact is morally irrelevant, might philosophers be more likely to appreciate that fact and rate the scenarios equivalently?<p>\n<b>In fact, the majority of participants rated <i>all </i>the scenarios exactly the same -- and philosophers were no less likely to do so than non-philosophers</b>: 63% of philosophers gave identical ratings to all four scenarios, vs. 58% of non-philosophers (Z = 1.2, p = .23).<p>\n\nI find this somewhat odd.  To me, it seems pretty flat-footed a form of consequentialism that says that Push is not morally worse than Switch.  But I find that my judgment on the matter swims around a bit, so maybe I'm wrong.  In any case, it's interesting to see both philosophers and non-philosophers seeming to reject the standard orthodox view, and at very similar rates.<p>\n\nHow about<b> Switch vs. Loop</b>?  Again, we found no difference in equivalency ratings between philosophers and non-philosophers: <b>83% of both groups rated the scenarios equivalently</b> (Z = 0.0, p = .98).<p>\n<b>However, philosophers <i>were </i>more likely than non-philosophers to rate Push and Drop equivalently</b>: 83% of philosophers did, vs. 73% of non-philosophers (Z = 3.4, p = .001; 87% vs. 77% if we exclude participants who rated Drop <i>worse</i> than Push).<p>\n\nHere's another interesting result.  Near the end of the study we asked whether it was worse to kill someone as a means of saving others than to kill someone as a side-effect of saving others -- one way of setting up the famous <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/\">Doctrine of the Double Effect</a>, which is often evoked to defend the view that Push is worse than Switch (in Push, the one person's death is arguably the means of saving the other five, in Switch the death is only a foreseen side-effect of the action that saves the five).  Loop is interesting in part because although superficially similar to Switch, if the one person's death is the means of saving the five, then maybe the case is more morally similar to Push than to Switch (see <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1729524\">Otsuka 2008</a>).  However, <b>only 18% of the philosophers who said it was worse to kill as a means of saving others rated Loop worse than Switch</b>.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/12/how-subtly-do-philosophers-analyze.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-12-11T12:00:00-08:00\">12:00 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7269334444603463332\" onclick=\"\">22\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, October 03, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"198900735450243521\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/10/second-person-vs-third-person.html\">Second-Person vs. Third-Person Presentation of Moral Dilemmas</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>You know the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a>, of course.  An out-of-control trolley is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  You can flip a switch and send it to a side track where it will kill one different person instead.  Should you flip the switch?  What if, instead of flipping a switch, the only way to save the five is to push someone into the path of the trolley, killing that one person?<p>\n\nIn evaluating this scenario, does it matter if the person standing near the switch with the life-and-death decision to make is \"John\" as opposed to \"you\"?  <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/NADTAB\">Nadelhoffer &amp; Feltz</a> presented the switch version of the trolley problem to undergraduates from Florida State University.  Forty-three saw the problem with \"you\" as the actor; 65% of the them said it was permissible to throw the switch.  Forty-two saw the problem with \"John\" as the actor; 90% of them said it was permissible to throw the switch, a statistically significant difference.<p>\n\nTobia, Buckwalter &amp; Stich <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/TOBMIA\">followed up</a>, presenting a famous moral dilemma from <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-bernard/\">Bernard Williams</a> in which someone can save a group of innocent villagers from a gunman by choosing personally to shoot one of the villagers.  Forty undergraduates were presented this scenario.  When \"you\" were given the chance to shoot one villager to save the rest, 19% of said it was morally obligatory to do so; when \"Jim\" was given the chance, 53% said it was obligatory (again statistically significant).<p>\n\nHowever, Tobia and colleagues also gave the scenario to 62 professional philosophers and found the opposite effect: 9% of philosophers found it obligatory for \"Jim\" and 36% found it obligatory for \"you\".  They also presented a trolley-switching case to 49 professional philosophers.  Again, the effect was in the opposite direction from that observed among undergraduates: 89% of philosophers said it was permissible to flip the switch in the second-person condition vs. 64% in the third-person condition.<p>\n\nFiery Cushman and I have some unpublished data on this that I thought I'd throw into the mix, since our results are a bit different from those of Tobia and colleagues.  We collected these data for our <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012 paper on order effects</a> in philosophers' and non-philosophers' judgments about moral scenarios.  Most of the scenarios were presented third-person, but as we mention in the published paper, some scenarios also had second-person variants.  We didn't find large effects, and the paper was already very complicated, so we didn't detail the second-person/third-person differences.<p>\n\nIn that experiment, we had four scenarios that differed 2nd person vs. 3rd person.  However, they differed not in whether the <i>actor</i> was described as \"you\", but rather in whether the <i>victim </i>was.<p>\n\nOne scenario was a version of Williams' hostage scenario.  \"Nancy\" and other villagers are captured by a warlord.  Nancy is given the choice of shooting \"you\" (2nd person variant) or \"a fellow hostage\" (3rd person variant) to save the captured villagers.  Respondents rated Nancy's \"shooting you\" or \"shooting a fellow hostage\" on a 7-point scale from  \"extremely morally good\" (1) through \"extremely morally bad\" (7), with \"morally neutral\" in the middle (4).  We had three groups of respondents: 324 professional philosophers (MA or PhD in philosophy, mostly recruited via email to Leiter-ranked philosophy departments), 753 non-philosopher academics (Master's or PhD not in philosophy, mostly recruited via email to comparison departments at the same universities), and 1389 non-academics (a convenience sample of others who happened upon the test site).<p>\n\nWe found non-philosophers a bit more likely to rate Nancy's shooting one to save the others toward the \"morally good\" side of the scale if the victim was \"you\",  but philosophers showed only a small, non-significant trend on our 7-point scale (using t-tests):<blockquote>Non-academics: 3.6 (2nd person victim) vs. 4.1 (3rd person victim) (p &lt; .001).</blockquote></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>Academic non-philosophers: 4.1 vs. 4.5 (p = .001).Philosophers: 3.9 vs. 4.0 (p = .60).<p>\n\nWe found similar results in a scenario in which a captain of a military submarine can shoot \"you\" (2nd person) or shoot another \"crew member\" (3rd person) to save the vessel:<blockquote>Non-academics: 2.7 vs. 3.1 (p &lt; .001).</blockquote></p>Academic non-philosophers: 2.9 vs. 3.2 (p = .050).Philosophers: 2.9 vs. 2.8 (p = .60).<p>\n\nWe also presented a scenario pair in which you and other passengers have fled a sinking ship.  You will drown without a life vest.  In one version, someone snatches a vest away from you.  In another version, someone declines to put himself at risk by giving you his vest.  The results:<p>\nSnatching the vest:<blockquote>\nNon-academics: 5.6 (2nd person victim) vs. 5.8 (3rd person victim) (p = .052).</blockquote></p></p>\nAcademic non-philosophers: 5.7 vs. 6.0 (p = .002).\nPhilosophers: 5.8 vs. 5.7 (p = .58).\nNot giving up the vest:<blockquote>Non-academics: 4.8 vs. 4.7 (p = .12).</blockquote>\nAcademic non-philosophers: 4.7 vs. 4.8 (p = .82).\nPhilosophers: 4.6 vs. 4.4 (p = .26)\n<b>In sum: The effects were small and inconsistent, but there was a general tendency for non-philosophers to rate harm to themselves as morally better than harm to other people -- a tendency not evident among philosopher respondents.</b><p>\n\nPersonally, I'm not inclined to make much of this, since I don't think people are generally in fact more morally lenient in judging harms to themselves than in judging harms to other people.  My guess is that these results reflect a small \"impression management\" or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias\">socially desirable responding</a> bias among the non-philosophers that we don't see among the philosophers, who might be more inclined to hear \"you\" pretty abstractly and impersonally when presented with familiar scenarios of this type.<p>\n\nIn an earlier unpublished version of this study, we also tried varying 2nd and 3rd person presentation of the actor who is faced with the choice, including in standard trolley type and hostage type cases of the sort described in Nadelhoffer &amp; Feltz and Tobia, Buckwalter &amp; Stich.  Due to a programming error, we couldn't use the data and can't fully interpret it, but <b>our general finding was that the effect was very subtle, and mostly non-detectable even with hundreds of participants</b> (394 philosophers and even more in the other groups).  That's why we shifted to trying out 2nd vs. 3rd person variation in the victim role -- maybe it would be a larger effect, we thought.<p>\n\nSo, for example, merging the push and switch versions of the trolley scenarios, we found the following ratings on our 7-point scale:<blockquote>Non-academics: 3.8 (2nd person actor) vs. 3.9 (3rd person actor) (p = .27).</blockquote></p></p></p>\nAcademic non-philosophers: 3.9 vs. 3.8 (p = .19).\nPhilosophers: 3.6 vs. 3.9 (p = .07)\n\nAnd in a shoot-the-villager type scenario, the results were:<blockquote>Non-academics: 4.3 vs. 4.3 (p = .46).</blockquote>\nAcademic non-philosophers: 4.6 vs. 4.5 (p = .18).\nPhilosophers: 3.9 vs. 4.2 (p = .14)\nHowever, in the life vest cases we did seem to see a small effect.<p>\nSnatching the vest:<blockquote>Non-academics: 6.0 vs. 5.9 (p = .053).</blockquote></p>\nAcademic non-philosophers: 6.1 vs. 5.9 (p = .03).\nPhilosophers: 5.8 vs. 5.8 (p = .94)\nNot giving up the vest:<blockquote>Non-academics: 4.9 vs. 4.7 (p = .008).</blockquote>\nAcademic non-philosophers: 4.8 vs. 4.7 (p = .08).\nPhilosophers: 4.7 vs. 4.4 (p = .12)\n<b>Thus, overall, we found some confirmation of the tendency for non-philosophers to rate actions a little more harshly in 2nd person than in 3rd person presentations, but the effect was small and inconsistent; and we did not find a tendency for philosophers to go in the opposite direction.</b><p>\n\nWe're not sure why we found much smaller effects here than have others.  Among the possibilities: Our scenarios were worded somewhat differently.  Our response scale (the 1-7 scale from \"extremely morally good\" to \"extremely morally bad\") was set up differently.  Our participants were recruited differently.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/10/second-person-vs-third-person.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-10-03T09:07:00-07:00\">9:07 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=198900735450243521\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, July 18, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1210389352741000166\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/07/do-women-have-different-philosophical.html\">Do Women Have Different Philosophical Intuitions Than Men?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://philosophyofbrains.com/2013/07/15/do-women-have-different-philosophical-intuitions-than-men-responding-to-buckwalter-and-stich.aspx\">Very interesting critique</a> by  at the Brains blog of the original <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1683066\">Buckwalter and Stich study</a> on this question.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/07/do-women-have-different-philosophical.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-07-18T10:39:00-07:00\">10:39 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1210389352741000166\" onclick=\"\">1 comments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, March 25, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"8260196310528792273\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/03/problematizing-b-condition-on-knowledge.html\">Problematizing the B Condition on Knowledge</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Central to contemporary epistemology is the question of what it is to know something.  And the orthodox starting point in discussions of what it is to know something is the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/#KnoJusTruBel\">\"JTB account\" of knowledge</a>: Knowledge is justified (J) true (T) belief (B), plus maybe some fourth condition to take care of weird cases where justified beliefs are true merely by accident (so-called <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/#GetPro\">Gettier cases</a>).  Discussion tends to focus on how to understand the J condition and whether some further fourth condition is necessary.  The truth and belief conditions are typically regarded as unproblematic.<p>\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KB.htm\">a forthcoming paper</a>, Blake Myers-Schulz and I pick up a mostly-cold torch from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/may/22/guardianobituaries.humanities\">Colin Radford</a> (whose seminal work on this topic was in the 1960s) and challenge the belief condition.  Can one know that something is the case even if one doesn't believe that it's the case?  We offer five plausible cases (one adapted from Radford) along with empirical evidence that our intuitions [note 1] about these cases are not idiosyncratic.<p>\n\nThis paper has already drawn several follow-up studies, some critical and some supportive -- but interestingly, <b>even the critical studies can be read as contributing to an emerging consensus that problematizes the belief condition</b>.  (I don't predict the consensus will last.  They never do in philosophy.  But still!)<p>\n\nFirst, to give you a feel for it, our cases:<blockquote>\n1. An unconfident examinee who feels like she is guessing the answer but non-accidentally gets it right;<p>\n2. An absent-minded driver who momentarily forgets that a bridge he normally takes to work is closed and continues en route toward that bridge;<p>\n3. A prejudiced professor, who intellectually appreciates that her athletic students are just as capable as her non-athletic students but who nonetheless is persistently biased in her reactions to student-athletes;<p>\n4. A freaked-out movie-watcher who seems to have the momentary impression that the scenario depicted in a horror film is real;<p>\n5. A self-deceived husband who has lots of evidence that his wife is cheating and some emotional responses that seem to reveal that he knows this, but who refuses to admit the truth to himself.</p></p></p></p></blockquote>\n\nNow maybe not all the cases work, but we think in each case there's at least some plausibility to the thought that the person in question <i>knows</i> (that Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, that the bridge is closed, that athletic students are just as capable, that aliens won't come out of her faucet, that his wife is cheating) but does not <i>believe </i>-- at least not as fully and determinately as she knows.  And lots of undergraduates seem to agree with us!  So we think the B condition on knowledge should at least be open for discussion.  It should not be regarded as <i>uncontroversially nonproblematic.</i><p>\n\nFollow-up studies (e.g., <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/ROSKED\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9279/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/BUCBTT\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-013-0132-9\">here</a>) have added some new plausible cases.  Our favorite of these is:<blockquote>\n6. A religious fundamentalist geocentrist who aces her astronomy class -- seeming to know that Earth revolves around the sun but not to believe it.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough some of these follow-up studies are pitched as in agreement with us and others as critique, we think there's actually a pretty clear thread of consensus through it all, from a bird's-eye view:<p>\n<b>Knowledge requires</b> <i>some</i> sort of psychological connection to the justified, true proposition -- <b>something broadly <i>like </i>a belief condition; but it doesn't seem to require full-on act-it-and-live-it-and-breathe-it belief.</b>  However reasonable it might be to think the Earth goes round the sun, that fact has to register with me cognitively in <i>some </i>way if I am to qualify as knowing it; but the fact needn't play the full functional role of belief as envisioned in behaviorally-rich accounts of belief <a href=\"http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/BeliefBox.htm\">like my own</a>.  <b>But how exactly should we should conceptualize this somewhat weak but broadly beliefish psychological-connectedness condition?  At this point, that's wide open.</b><p>\n\nBlake and I suggest that one must have the capacity to act on the stored information that P; Rose and Schaffer seem to suggest that what's crucial is that the information be \"available to the mind\"; Buckwalter and colleagues suggest that one must believe but only in some \"thin\" sense of belief; Murray and colleagues suggest that one need to be disposed to \"assent\" to the content.  None of these approaches are well specified (and I've simplified them somewhat; apologies).  Figuring out what's going on with the B condition thus seems like a potentially fruitful task that brings together core issues in epistemology and philosophy of mind.<p>\n\n-------------------------------------------------<p>\n[note 1] Yes, I use the word \"intuition\".  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-without-Intuitions-Herman-Cappelen/dp/0199644861\">Herman Cappelen</a> has me worried about the term.

Like all sceptical hypotheses, it is logically tenable but uninteresting (<i>The Analysis of Mind,</i> 1921, p. 159-160).</blockquote>Wait... what?!  We can't prove that the world has existed for more than five minutes, but who cares, <i>bo</i>-ring?<p>\n\nI'd think rather the opposite: We <i>can</i> prove that the world has existed for more than five minutes.  And if I didn't think I could prove that fact, I wouldn't say ho-hum, whatevs, maybe everything I thought really happened is just an illusion, *yawn*.<p>\n\nOkay, well, \"prove\" is too strong.  Logical certainty of the 2+2=4 variety, I can't provide.  But I think I can provide, at least to myself, some good empirical evidence that the past existed five minutes ago.  I can begin by opening up the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">New York Times</a>.  It tells me that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/sports/hockey/larry-kwongs-shift-for-rangers-in-1947-48-broke-a-barrier.html?hp\">Larry Kwong was the Jeremy Lin of his day</a>.  Therefore, the past exists.<p>\n\nNow hold on, you'll say.  I've begged the question against Russell.  For Russell is asking us to consider the possibility that the world was created five minutes ago with everything exactly as it then was, including the New York Times website.  I can't disconfirm that hypothesis by going to the New York Times website!  The young-world hypothesis and the old-world hypothesis make exactly the same prediction about what I will find, and therefore the evidence does not distinguish between them.<p>\n\nHere I need to think carefully about the form of the young-world hypothesis and the reasons I might entertain it.  For example, I should consider what reason I have to prefer the hypothesis that a planet-sized external world was created five minutes ago vs. the hypothesis that just I and my immediate environment were created five minutes ago.  Is there reason to regard the first hypothesis as more likely than the second hypothesis?  I think not.  And similarly for temporal extent: There's nothing privileged about 5 minutes ago vs. 7.22 minutes ago vs. 27 hours ago, vs. 10 seconds ago, etc. (perhaps up to the bound of the \"<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience/#4\">specious present</a>\").<p>\n\nSo if I'm in a skeptical enough mood to take young-world hypotheses seriously, I should have a fairly broad range of young-world hypotheses in mind as live options.  Right?<p>\n\nIn the spirit of skeptical indifference, let's say that I go ahead and assign a 50% probability to a standard non-skeptical old-world hypothesis and a 50% probability to a young-world hypothesis based on my subjective experience of a seeming-external-world <i>right now</i>.  Conditional on the young-world hypothesis, I then further distribute my probabilities, say, 50-50% between the I-and-my-immediate-environment hypothesis and the whole-planet hypothesis.  The exact probabilities don't matter, and clearly there will be many other possibilities; this is just to show the form of the argument.  So, right now, my probabilities are 50% old-world, 25% young-small-world, and 25% young-large-world.<p>\n\nNow, if the world is young and small, then all should be void, or chaos, beyond the walls of this room.  (In a certain sense such a world might be large, but the Earthly stuff in my vicinity is small.)  In particular, the New York Times web servers should not exist.  So if I try to visit the New York Times' webpage, based on my entirely false seeming-memories of how the world works, New York Times content which is not currently on my computer should not then appear on my computer.  After all the hypothesis is that the world was created five minutes ago as it then was, and my computer did not have the newest NYT content at that time.  But, I check the site and new content appears!  Alternatively, I open my office door and behold, there's a hallway!  So now, I reduce the probability of the young-small-world hypothesis to zero.  (Zero makes the case simple, but the argument doesn't depend on that.)  Distributing that probability back onto the remaining two hypotheses, the old-world hypothesis is now 67% and young-large-world is 33%.  Thus, by looking at the New York Times website, I've given myself empirical evidence that the world is more than five minutes old.<p>\n\nAdmittedly, I'd hope for better than 67% probability that the world is old, so the result is a little disappointing.  If I could justify the proposition that <i>if</i> the world is young, then it is probably small enough not to contain the New York Times web servers, then I can get final probabilities higher.  And maybe I can justify that proposition.  Maybe the likeliest young-world scenario is a spontaneous congealment scenario (i.e., a <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/07/confessions-of-boltzmann-brain.html\">Boltzmann brain</a> scenario) or a scenario in which this world is a small-scale computer simulation (see my <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/09/bostroms-response-to-my-discussion-of.html\">earlier</a> <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/08/on-bostroms-argument-that-you-may-well.html\">posts</a> on Bostrom's simulation argument).  For example, if the initial probabilities are 50% old, 45% young-small, 5% young-large, then after ruling out young-small, the old-world hypothesis rises above 90% -- an almost-publishable p value!  And maybe the probability of the old-world hypothesis continues to rise as I find that the world continues to exist in a stable configuration, since I might reasonably think that if the world is only 5 minutes old or 12 minutes old, it stands a fair chance of collapsing soon -- a possibility that seems less likely on the standard non-skeptical old-world hypothesis.  (However, there is the worry that after a minute or so, I will need to restart my anti-skeptical argument again due to the possibility that I only falsely remember having checked the New York Times site.  Such are the bitters of trying to refute skepticism.)<p>\n\nYou might object that the most likely young-small-world hypothesis is one on which there is an outside agent who will feed me the seeming-New York Times website on demand, purposely to trick me.  But I'm not sure that's so.  And in any case, with that move we're starting to drift toward something like <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/#3.2\">Cartesian demon doubt</a>, which deserves separate treatment.<p>\n\n[Slightly edited 6:33 pm in light of helpful clarificatory questions from Jonathan Weisberg.]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/02/empirical-evidence-that-world-was-not.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-02-19T16:14:00-08:00\">4:14 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5049814132775566843\" onclick=\"\">29\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/epistemology\" rel=\"tag\">epistemology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/skepticism\" rel=\"tag\">skepticism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, February 05, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"9166891525231202667\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/02/preliminary-evidence-that-world-is.html\">Preliminary Evidence That the World Is Simple (An Exercise in Stupid Epistemology)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Is the world simple or complex?  Is a simple hypothesis more likely to be true than a complex hypothesis that fits the data equally well?  <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/\">The issue is gnarly</a>.  Sometimes the best approach to a gnarly issue is crude stupidity.  Crude stupidity is my plan today.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what I did.  I thought up 30 pairs of variables that would be easy to measure and that might relate in diverse ways.  Some variables were physical (the distance vs. apparent brightness of nearby stars), some biological (the length vs. weight of sticks found in my back yard), and some psychological or social (the S&amp;P 500 index closing value vs. number of days past).  Some I would expect to show no relationship (the number of pages in a library book vs. how high up it is shelved in the library), some I would expect to show a roughly linear relationship (distance of McDonald's franchises from my house vs. MapQuest estimated driving time), and some I expected to show a curved or complex relationship (forecasted temperature vs. time of day, size in KB of a JPG photo of my office vs. the angle at which the photo was taken).  See <a href=\"http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/variables-measured-for-post-preliminary.html\">here</a> for the full list of variables.  I took 11 measurements of each variable pair.  Then I analyzed the resulting data.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if the world is massively complex, then it should be difficult to predict a third datapoint from any two other data points.  Suppose that two measurements of some continuous variable yield values of 27 and 53.  What should I expect the third measured value to be?  Why not 1,457,002?  Or 3.22 x 10^-17?  There are just as many functions (that is, infinitely many) containing 27, 53, and 1,457,002 as there are containing 27, 53, and some more pedestrian-seeming value like 44.  On at least some ways of thinking about massive complexity, we ought to be no more surprised to discover that third value to be over a million than to discover that third value to be around 40.  Call the thesis that a wildly distant third value is no less likely than a nearby third value the <i>Wild Complexity Thesis</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can use my data to test the Wild Complexity Thesis, on the assumption that the variables I have chosen are at least roughly representative of the kinds of variables we encounter in the world, in day-to-day human lives as experienced in a technologically advanced Earthly society.  (I don't generalize to the experiences of aliens or to aspects of the world that are not salient to experience, such as Planck-scale phenomena.)  The denial of Wild Complexity might seem obvious to you.  But that is an empirical claim, and it deserves empirical test.  As far as I know, no philosopher has formally conducted this test.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo conduct the test, I used each pair of dependent variables to predict the value of the next variable in the series (the 1st and 2nd observations predicting the value of the 3rd, the 2nd and 3rd predicting the value of the 4th, etc.), yielding 270 predictions for the 30 variables.  I counted an observation \"wild\" if its absolute value was 10 times the maximum of the absolute value of the two previous observations or if its absolute value was below 1/10 of the minimum of the absolute value of the two previous observations.  Separately, I also looked for flipped signs (either two negative values followed by a positive or two positive values followed by a negative), though most of the variables only admitted positive values.  This measure of wildness yielded three wild observations out of 270 (1%) plus another three flipped-sign cases (total 2%).  (A few variables were capped, either top or bottom, in a way that would make an above-10x or below-1/10th observation analytically unlikely, but excluding such variables wouldn't affect the result much.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it looks like the Wild Complexity Thesis might be in trouble.  Now admittedly a caveat is in order: If the world is wild enough, then I probably shouldn't trust my memory of having conducted this test (since maybe my mind with all its apparent memories just popped into existence out of a disordered past), or maybe I shouldn't trust the representativeness of this sample (I got 2% wild this time, but maybe in the next test I'll get 50% wild).  However, if we are doubtful about the results for either of those reasons, it might be difficult to escape collapse into radical skepticism.  If we set aside radically skeptical worries, we might still wonder how wild the world is.  These results give us a preliminary estimate.  To the extent the variables are representative, the answer seems to be: not too wild -- though with some surprises, such as the $20,000 listed value of the uncirculated 1922 Lincoln wheat penny.  (No, I didn't know about that before seeking the data.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we use a Wildness criterion of two (two times the max or 1/2 the min), then there are 33 wild instances in 270 observations, or about 12%, overlapping in one case with the three flipped-sign cases, for 13% total.  I wouldn't take this number <i>too</i> seriously, since it will presumably vary considerably depending on the variables chosen for analysis -- but still it's smaller than it might have been, and maybe okay as a first approximation to the extent the variables of interest resemble those on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/variables-measured-for-post-preliminary.html\">my list</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had meant to do some curve fitting in this post, too -- comparing linear and quadratic predictions with more complex predictions -- but since this is already a good-sized post, we'll curve fit another day.<br/>\nI admit, this is a ham-handed approach.  It uses crude methods, it doesn't really establish anything we didn't already know, and I'm sure it won't touch the views of those philosophers who deny that the world is simple (who probably aren't committed to the Wild Complexity Thesis).  I highlight these concessions by calling the project \"stupid epistemology\".  If we jump too quickly to clever, though, sometimes we miss the necessary groundwork of stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Note: This post was substantially revised Feb. 6.</i><br/></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/02/preliminary-evidence-that-world-is.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2013-02-05T12:55:00-08:00\">12:55 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=9166891525231202667\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/epistemology\" rel=\"tag\">epistemology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphysics\" rel=\"tag\">metaphysics</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Tuesday, January 15, 2013</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1637469252544209728\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-moral-behavior-of-ethicists-and.html\">The Moral Behavior of Ethicists and the Rationalist Delusion</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/RationalistDelusion.htm\">A new essay</a> with <a href=\"http://www2.stetson.edu/~jrust/\">Joshua Rust</a>.<p>\n\nIn the first part, we summarize our empirical research on the moral behavior of ethics professors.<p>\n\nIn the second part, we consider five possible explanations of our finding that ethics professors behave, on average, no better than do other professors.<p>\n<i>Explanation 1:</i> Philosophical moral reflection has no material impact on real-world moral behavior.  <a href=\"http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/home.html\">Jonathan Haidt</a> has called the view that explicit moral reflection does have a substantial effect on one's behavior \"the rationalist delusion\".<p>\n<i>Explanation 2:</i> Philosophical moral reflection influences real world moral behavior, but only in very limited domains of professional focus.  Those domains are sufficiently narrow and limited that existing behavioral measures can't unequivocally detect them.  Also, possibly, any improvement in such narrow domains might be cancelled out, in terms of overall moral behavior, by psychological factors like <a href=\"http://wat1224.ucr.edu/Morality/Monin%202010%20Compass%20on%20Moral%20Licensing.pdf\">moral licensing</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion\">ego depletion</a>.<p>\n<i>Explanation 3:</i> Philosophical moral reflection might lead one to behave <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/01/might-ethicists-behave-more-permissibly.html\">more morally permissibly but no morally better</a>.  The idea here is that philosophical moral reflection might lead one to avoid morally impermissible behavior while also reducing the likelihood of doing any <i>more</i> than is strictly morally required.  Contrast the sometimes-sinner sometimes-saint with the person who never goes beyond the call of duty but also never does anything really wrong.<p>\n<i>Explanation 4:</i> Philosophical moral reflection might compensate for deficient moral intuitions.  Maybe, from early childhood or adolescence, some people tend to lack strongly motivating moral emotions.  And maybe some of those people are also drawn to intellectual styles of moral reflection.  Without that moral reflection, they would behave morally worse than the average person, but moral reflection helps them behave better than they otherwise would.  If enough ethicists are like this, then philosophical moral reflection might have an important positive effect on the moral behavior of those who engage in it, but looking at ethicists as a group, that effect might be masked if it's compensating for lower rates of moral behavior arising from emotional gut intuitions.<p>\n<i>Explanation 5:</i> Philosophical moral reflection might have powerful effects on moral behavior, but in both moral <i>and </i>countermoral directions, approximately cancelling out on average.  It might have positive effects, for example, if it leads us to discover moral truths on which we then act.  But perhaps equally often it becomes <i>toxic rationalization</i>, licensing morally bad behavior that we would otherwise have avoided.<p>\n\nJosh and I decline to choose among these possibilties.  There might be some truth in all or most of them.  And there are still other possibilities, too.  Ethicists might in fact engage in moral reflection relevant to their personal lives no more often than do other professors.  Ethicists might find themselves increasingly disillusioned about the value of morality at the same time they improve their knowledge of what morality in fact requires.  Ethicists might learn to shield their personal behavior from the influence of their professional reflections, as a kind of self-defense against the apparent unfairness of being held to higher standards because of their choice of profession....<p>\n\nFull essay <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/RationalistDelusion.htm\">here</a>.

I have a simple argument against this view.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst: I define \"intuition\" very broadly. A judgment is \"intuitive\", in my view, just in case it arises by some cognitive process other than explicit, conscious reasoning. By this definition, snap judgments about the grammaticality of sentences, snap judgments about the distance of objects, snap judgments about the moral wrongness of an action in a hypothetical scenario, and snap folk-psychological judgments are generally going to be intuitive. Intuitive judgments don't <i>have </i>to be snap judgments -- they don't have to be fast -- but the absence of explicit conscious reasoning is clearest when the judgment is quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis definition of \"intuition\" is similar to one\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.alisongopnik.com/\">Alison Gopnik</a> and I worked with in a <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/WhoseConcepts.htm\">1998 article</a>, and it is much more inclusive than Cappelen's own characterizations. Thus, it's quite possible that intuitions in Cappelen's narrow sense are inessential to philosophy while intuitions in my broader sense are essential. But I don't think that Cappelen and I have\u00a0<i>merely </i>a terminological dispute. There's a politics of definition. One's terminological choices highlight and marginalize different facets of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy characterization of intuition is also broader than most other philosophers' -- <a href=\"http://udel.edu/~jpust/\">Joel Pust</a> in his <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuition\">Stanford Encyclopedia article on intuition</a>, for example, seems to regard it as straightforward that perceptual judgments should not be called \"intuitions\" -- but I don't think my preferred definition is entirely quirky. In fact, in a <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-011-0047-2\">recent study</a>, J.R. Kuntz and J.R.C Kuntz found that professional philosophers were more likely to \"agree to a very large extent\" with Gopnik's and my definition of intuition than with any of six other definitions proposed by other authors (32% giving it the top rating on a seven-point scale). I think professional psychologists and linguists\u00a0might also sometimes use \"intuition\" in something like Alison's and my sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we accept this broad definition of intuition, then it seems hard to deny that, contra Cappelen,\u00a0philosophy depends essentially on intuition -- as does all cognition. One can't explicitly consciously reason one's way to every one of one's premises, on pain of regress. One must start somewhere, even if only tentatively and subject to later revision.<br/>\n<br/>\nCappelen has, in conversation, accepted this consequence of my broad definition of \"intuition\". The question then becomes what to make of the epistemology of intuition in this sense. And this epistemological question is, I think, largely an empirical one, with several disciplines empirically relevant, including cognitive psychology, experimental philosophy, and study of the historical record. Based on the empirical evidence, what might we expect to be the strengths and weaknesses of explicit reasoning? And, alternatively, what might we expect to be the strengths and weaknesses of intuitive judgment?<br/>\n<br/>\nThose empirical questions become especially acute when the two paths to judgment appear to deliver conflicting results. When your ordinary-language spontaneous judgments about the applicability of a term to a scenario (or at least your <i>inclinations </i>to judge) conflict with what you would derive from your explicit theory, or when your spontaneous moral judgments (or inclinations) do, what should you conclude? The issue is crucial to philosophy as we all live and perform it, and the answer one gives ought to be informed, if possible, by empirically discoverable facts about the origins and reliability of different types of judgments or inclinations. (This isn't to say that a uniform answer is likely to win the day: Things might vary from time to time, person to person, topic to topic, and depending on specific features of the case.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be strange to suppose that the psychology of philosophy is irrelevant to its epistemology. And yet Cappelen's dismissal of the enterprise of experimental philosophy on grounds of the irrelevance of \"intuitions\" to philosophy would seem to invite us toward that exactly that dubious supposition.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/12/intuitions-philosophy-and-experiment.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2012-12-11T14:13:00-08:00\">2:13 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=3358400622332036521\" onclick=\"\">30\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Saturday, September 29, 2012</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"6556070359348441689\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/09/what-experimental-philosophy-might-be.html\">What Experimental Philosophy Might Be</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>What is \"experimental philosophy\"?  There is, I think, some tension in how philosophers use the term -- tension between a narrow and a wide conception.<p>\n\nMost of the work canonically identified as \"experimental philosophy\" surveys ordinary people's judgments (or \"intuitions\") about philosophical concepts, and it does so by soliciting people's responses to questions about hypothetical scenarios. (See, e.g., Knobe's <a href=\"http://www.unc.edu/~knobe/Side-Effect.pdf\">chairman study</a> regarding intentional action, <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/courses/saw.pdf\">Swain et al.'s study</a> of order effects on knowledge judgments, and <a href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~machery/papers/verson%20publiee.pdf\">Machery et al.'s study</a> of cultural variation in the perceived reference of proper names.)  Thus, philosophers sometimes think of \"experimental philosophy\" as the enterprise of running these sorts of studies.  <a href=\"http://www.siena.edu/pages/1855.asp\">Joshua Alexander</a>, for example, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Experimental-Philosophy-Introduction-Joshua-Alexander/dp/0745649181\">in his 2012 book</a> portrays experimental philosophy as the study of people's philosophical intuitions, as does <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/members/philosophy_panel/tim_williamson\">Timothy Williamson</a>, in his <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/26739/Xphireview.pdf\">forthcoming critique</a> of the \"Experimental Philosophy revolution\".<p>\n\nConceived narrowly in this way, experimental philosophy is a coherent and (mostly) recent movement, with a distinctive methodology and an interrelated network of results.  It is possible to discuss and critique it as a unified body.<p>\n\nHowever, there also seems to be a broader conception of experimental philosophy -- a conception that has never, I think, been adequately articulated, a conception that <a href=\"http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/\">Josh Knobe</a> and <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/\">Shaun Nichols</a>, for example, gesture toward in their \"<a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/Manifesto.pdf\">Experimental Philosophy Manifesto</a>\", before they shift their focus to experimental philosophy in the narrow sense.  In this broad sense, philosophers who do empirical work aimed at addressing traditionally philosophical questions are also experimental philosophers, even if they don't survey people about their intuitions.  In practice, the narrow/broad distinction hasn't meant too much because almost all of the empirical work of almost all of the people who are canonically recognized as \"experimental philosophers\" fits within both the narrow and the broad conceptualizations.<p>\n\nMy own work, however, tends to fit only within the broad conception, not the narrow (with a couple of <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/KB.htm\">exceptions</a>).  So the difference has personal importance to me, affecting both my and others' conceptualization of my role in the \"x-phi\" community.<p>\n\nHow to articulate the broad conception?  <i>Experimental work done by people in philosophy departments</i> seems an odd category, since similar work can be done by people in different departments.  <i>Experimental work that addresses traditionally philosophical issues</i>, however, seems far too broad, sweeping in too much research that we would not ordinary conceptualize as philosophical, including physics experiments on the structure of space and time, biological research on the origins of our social roles, and psychological work on the origins of our concepts, since these issues are at the root of philosophy of physics, philosophy of biology, and philosophy of psychology; and sometimes what the most theoretically ambitious physicists, biologists, and psychologists say is not so different from what philosophers of those disciplines say; if by adding experimentation to that, we get experimental philosophers, then most experimental philosophers are employed by science departments.<p>\n\nHere's a thought that is perhaps more satisfactory: Experimental philosophy in the broad sense is <i>empirical research that is thoroughly contextualized within an intimate knowledge of the philosophical literature on which it bears, and which is presented, primarily, as advancing that philosophical literature</i>.  (For present purposes, we can define \"philosophical literature\" sociologically as what is published in philosophy journals and in books classified as philosophy books by academic presses.)  This will omit the typical developmental psychologist working on conceptual categories, but probably allow as marginal cases of \"experimental philosophers\" the most philosophically informed developmental psychologists (such as <a href=\"http://www.alisongopnik.com/\">Alison Gopnik</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/index.html?carey.html\">Susan Carey</a>).  It will allow in, as central, work by Shaun Nichols that is not typical intuition-polling x-phi (such as his work on <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/on_the_genealogy_of_norms\">disgust norms</a> and on <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/RiseofCompatibilism\">quantitative history of philosophy</a>).  Maybe some of <a href=\"http://mypage.iu.edu/~ealloyd/\">Elisabeth Lloyd</a>'s empirical work on the female orgasm will also qualify.<p>\n\nAnd of course (my main, not-so-secret intention in developing this account) so also will all of my own empirical work.  Included, for example, will be my work on <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search?q=ethics+professors\">the moral behavior of ethics professors</a>, which does tend to be recognized as \"experimental philosophy\" by the x-phi crowd, despite not fitting the narrow conception; and also my empirical research on consciousness (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Describing-Inner-Experience-Proponent-Bradford/dp/0262083663/\">here</a>, and chapters 1 and 6 <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perplexities-Consciousness-Life-Mind-Philosophical/dp/0262014904/\">here</a>), which is less often mentioned as x-phi.<p>\n\nBut more than that, I think this conception explicitly encourages the thought that a broad range of traditionally philosophical issues can be illuminated by empirical studies, even though they have not yet commonly been approached with the tools of empirical science.  For example, empirical research might help illuminate the question of whether philosophical study, over the centuries, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/09/has-civilization-made-moral-progress.html\">tends to progress toward the truth</a>.  We might be able to take <a href=\"http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2012/08/the-external-world-further-experimental-evidence-of-its-existence.html\">an experimental approach to the question of whether the external world exists</a>.  Questions in the history of philosophy might be approachable by means of the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search?q=discussion+arcs\">systematic study of citation patterns in philosophical venues</a>.  And so forth.<p>\n\nExperimental philosophers, break free!  There is so much more to do than just surveying intuitions!<p>\n\n(No accident maybe, that I was a student of Gopnik and Lloyd?)</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/09/what-experimental-philosophy-might-be.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2012-09-29T14:42:00-07:00\">2:42 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=6556070359348441689\" onclick=\"\">8\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, September 06, 2012</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2751841717525125323\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/09/has-civilization-made-moral-progress.html\">Has Civilization Made Moral Progress? Sketch of an Empirical Test</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>From a certain perspective, current liberal Western civilization seems to be a moral pinnacle. We have rejected slavery. We have substantially de-legitimized aggressive warfare. We have made huge progress in advancing the welfare of children. We have made huge progress toward gender and racial equality. In his 2011 book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/0670022950\">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a>, Steven Pinker says he is prepared to call our recent ancestors \"morally retarded\" (p. 658). Imagine how we would react if a Westerner today were seriously to endorse a set of views that would not have been radical in 1800: denying women the vote (or maybe even advocating a return to monarchy), viewing slavery and twelve-hour days of child labor in coal mines as legitimate business enterprises, advocating military conquest for the sake of glory, etc. \"Morally retarded\" might seem a fair assessment!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom another perspective, though, it appears almost inevitable that the average person in any culture will see his or her own culture's values as morally superior. Suppose that the average person in Culture 1 endorses values A, B, C, and D, the average person in Culture 2 endorses values A, B, -C, and E, and the average person in Culture 3 endorses values A, -B, D, and F. The average person from Culture 1 will think, \"Well the average person in my culture has A, B, C, and D right! The people in culture 2 have C wrong and really should pay attention to D rather than E, while the people in Culture 3 have B wrong and should attend to C rather than F. So my culture's values are superior.\" If Culture 1 is temporally more recent than Cultures 2 and 3, then our average person from Culture 1 can laud the change in values as \"progress\".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, of course, that it might not be progress at all, but rather only a preference for local values. Call this the <i>Local Pinnacle Illusion</i>. Someone from the past might suffer the same illusion looking forward at us, condemning (say) our liberal Western neglect of proper class and gender role distinctions, our relative irreligiosity, and our relative tolerance of homosexuality, masturbation, divorce, and moneylending -- calling the changes \"decadence\" rather than progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question then is whether there's a good way to tell whether those of us with a Pinkeresque preference for contemporary liberal values are merely victims of the Local Pinnacle Illusion, or whether we really have made huge moral progress in the last few centuries or millennia. I've been thinking about whether there might be a way to explore this empirically, using the history of philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's my thought: The temporal picture of progress and the temporal picture of a random walk look very different. If, say, rational reflection over the very long haul tends to guide us ever closer to right moral principles, as Pinker thinks, then issue-by-issue we ought to see opinion changes over the very long haul that look like progressive trends of moral philosophical discovery. If, in contrast, all that's going on is the Local Pinnacle Illusion, trends should be relatively short-lived, due to local cultural pressures, and not consistently directional over the very long haul.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose we chose twelve issues that have been broadly discussed since ancient times and that in at least some eras -- not necessarily our own -- are regarded as morally important issues. If we could chart philosophers' opinions on these issues quantitatively (e.g., from strong support for democracy to strong support for monarchy with moderate views in the middle, from strong support for gender-neutral role expectations to strong support for gender-specific role expectations, etc.), using -1 and +1 to mark the average position in the historically most extreme eras for each pole of each issue, then on a random-walk picture, we ought to see something like this pattern among those issues:\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-5OAaSWM5-7s/UEj9owTC8lI/AAAAAAAAAa8/yy5ej7L0SsU/s1600/Random12.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"290\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-5OAaSWM5-7s/UEj9owTC8lI/AAAAAAAAAa8/yy5ej7L0SsU/s400/Random12.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></div>\nI have assumed here a random starting spread from -1 to 1 and a random fluctuation from -0.3 to +0.3 in each successive period; then I renormalized the maximum value of each run to 1 and the minimum to -1. The result is basically a noisy walk, with extreme values as likely in the middle as at the ends.<br/>\n<div>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if there's moral progress through philosophical reflection, the chart ought to look more like this:\n<br/>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-KE7SBJJtJm8/UEkByOu1C7I/AAAAAAAAAbM/76vn4bIGGvA/s1600/MoralProgressA.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"316\" src=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-KE7SBJJtJm8/UEkByOu1C7I/AAAAAAAAAbM/76vn4bIGGvA/s400/MoralProgressA.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></div>\nFor this chart, I assumed a progress factor, negative or positive, of one-third of the spread of the random fluctuation (i.e., adding or subtracting 0.1 to each step, in addition to the -0.3 to +0.3 random fluctuation). For the \"toward 0\" positions, I assumed positive incremental pressure when the previous period value was (absolutely) negative and negative incremental pressure when the previous period was positive. As with the previous graph, at the end I normalized the maximum and minimum values to +1 and -1.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see,\u00a0many more moral issues show consistent trend directions over time and the most extreme positions tend to be held at the beginning and the end of the analysis period. The latter pattern follows from the fact that even if the initial historical position at time zero is by some objective standard moderate, as long as it is not spot on the target number, the trend over time should be roughly unidirectional toward the target number; and then the normalizing will make that initial position look extreme.<br/>\n<div>\n<br/>\nTwo caveats and a final note:<br/>\n<br/>\nCaveat 1: It will of course be difficult to code this objectively, and it's quite possible that the final outcome will vary depending on hard-to-justify coding decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaveat 2: My guess is that if we were to chart moral and political positions from the 1600s to the present we would see a chart somewhat like the second (progressive) chart, whereas if we were to chart equal time intervals back to the ancient West, we would see a more random-looking chart like the first. So which time period should be examined? A case for choosing the shorter period might be that it is only after the printing press and widespread communication of philosophical ideas that we should expect to see rationally-driven moral progress. However a consideration against choosing the shorter period is this: There might be cultural factors, such as industrialization and capitalization, that have created consistent unidirectional pressures on moral and political norms, independently of the rational case for adopting those norms; and for that reason the broader the temporal span the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal note: We might be able to construct similar charts to evaluate whether there has been progress in metaphysics.<br/>\n<br/>\n(By the way,\u00a0see\u00a0<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/04/steven-pinker-wow-how-awesome-we.html\">here</a>\u00a0for another post of mine on Pinker's intellectualist liberalism.)</div>\n</div>\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/09/has-civilization-made-moral-progress.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2012-09-06T13:55:00-07:00\">1:55 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2751841717525125323\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Monday, August 13, 2012</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"1995129575565318019\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-external-world-further-experimental.html\">The External World: Further Experimental Evidence of Its Existence</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>(collaborative with <a href=\"http://www.philosophy.ucr.edu/people/grads/moore/index.html\">Alan Moore</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me to doubt whether the external world exists -- that is, whether anything exists other than my own stream of conscious experience. Radical solipsism is of course <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/CrazyMind.htm\">crazy</a>. But can I <i>show</i> it to be wrong? Or is my only recourse simply to <i>assume </i>it's wrong, since any attempt at proof would be circular? Can I break out of the solipsistic circle, using facts about my own stream of experience, knowable from within the solipsistic perspective, to license an inference to the existence of something beyond my stream of experience?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most famous philosophical attempts to prove the existence of an external world from solipsism-compatible assumptions and methods -- for example, Descartes's and Kant's -- are generally acknowledged by the philosophical community to fail. \u00a0I'm inclined to think those attempts fail because they set the bar too high: They aim for certainty through deductive proof. \u00a0Better, perhaps, to aim lower -- to use scientific methods and scientific standards, licensing only tentative conclusions as the current best explanation of the available evidence. In another way, too, I aim low: I aim only to refute solipsistic doubts in particular, not other sorts of skeptical doubts such as doubts about memory or reasoning. In fact, I will take the general standards of science for granted, insofar as those general standards are compatible with solipsism. I aim to do solipsistic science.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year on my blog I presented the results of two experiments designed to provide evidence that an external world does indeed exist.\u00a0<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/06/external-word-preliminary-experimental.html\">The first experiment</a> suggested that something exists (\"my computer\") that is swifter than I at calculating prime numbers. <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/09/external-world-more-experimental.html\">The second experiment</a> suggested that the world has some constancy to it that exceeds the constancy of my memory. Today, I will report on a third experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf solipsism is true, nothing in the universe should exist that is better than I am at chess. Nothing should exist with chess-playing practical capacities that exceed my own. Now I believe that I stink at chess, and my seeming student \"Alan\" seems to have told me that he is good at chess. If solipsism is true, then he should not be able to beat me at rates higher than statistical chance. I agreed with this seeming-Alan to play twenty games of speed chess, with a limit of about five seconds per move.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what seems to be a picture of our procedure:<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZXBsRbF1NBs/UCWRxprTFpI/AAAAAAAAAYI/sleCzGYUg7c/s1600/IMG_9419-bw.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZXBsRbF1NBs/UCWRxprTFpI/AAAAAAAAAYI/sleCzGYUg7c/s400/IMG_9419-bw.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a><br/>\n(photo credit: seeming-Gerardo Sanchez)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results: seeming-Alan won 17, I won 2, and one stalemate. 17/19 is statistically higher than 50%, p &lt; .001 (hand calculated).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me that I might have hoped to lose, so as to generate results confirming my preferred hypothesis that the external world exists. Against this concern, I comfort myself with the following thoughts: If it was an <i>unconscious </i>desire to lose, then that implies that something exists in the universe besides my own stream of conscious experience, namely, an unconscious part of my mind. So radical solipsism is false. If it was, instead, a <i>conscious </i>desire to lose, I should have been able to detect it, barring an unusual degree of introspective skepticism. What I detected was a desire to win as many games as I could, given my background assumption that if Alan actually exists I would be hard pressed to win even one or two games. I found myself repeatedly and forcefully struck by the impression that the universe contained a practical intelligence superior to my own and bent on defeating me -- an impression, of course, confirmed by the results. The most natural scientific explanation of the pattern in my experience is that that impression is correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might easily enough <i>dream </i>of being consistently defeated in chess. But dreams of this sort, as I seem to remember, differ from the present experiment in one crucial way: They are vague on the specific moves or unrealistic about those moves. In the same way, I might dream of having proven Fermat's last theorem. Both types of case involve dream-like gappiness or irrationality or delusive credulity -- the type of gappiness or irrationality or delusive credulity that might make me see nothing remarkable in my daughter's growing wings or in discovering a new whole number between 5 and 6. Genuine dream doubt might involve doubt about my basic rational capacities, but if so such doubts are additional to simply solipsistic doubt. Whether I am dreaming or not, if I consistently experience specific clever and perceptive chess moves that repeatedly exploit flaws in my own conscious strategizing, flaws that I experience as surprising, it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that something exists that surpasses my own conscious intelligence in at least this one area.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-external-world-further-experimental.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2012-08-13T14:52:00-07:00\">2:52 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=1995129575565318019\" onclick=\"\">30\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/epistemology\" rel=\"tag\">epistemology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/skepticism\" rel=\"tag\">skepticism</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, March 02, 2012</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"2033336107725809120\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/03/instability-of-professional.html\">The Instability of Professional Philosophers' Endorsement of the Famous \"Doctrine of the Double Effect\"</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>People's responses to hypothetical moral scenarios can vary substantially depending on the order in which those scenarios are presented (e.g., <a href=\"http://cognition.berkeley.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Lombrozo-CogSci-2009.pdf\">Lombrozo 2009</a>).

In the Switch version, an out-of-control boxcar is headed toward five people whom it will kill if nothing is done.  You're standing by a railroad switch, and you can divert the boxcar onto a side-track, saving the five people.  However, there's one person on the side-track, who would then be killed.  Many respondents will say that there's nothing morally wrong with flipping the switch, killing the one to save the five.  Some will even say that you're morally obliged to flip the switch.  In the Push version, instead of being able to save the five by flipping a switch, you can do so by pushing a heavy man into the path of the boxcar, killing him but saving the five as his weight slows the boxcar.  Despite the surface similarity to the Switch case, most people think it's not okay to push the man.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the order effect: If you present the Push case first, people are much less likely to say it's okay to flip the switch when you then later present the Switch case than if you present the Switch case first.  In one study, <a href=\"http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~cushman/\">Fiery Cushman</a> and I found that if we presented Push first, respondents tended to rate the two cases equivalently (on a seven-point scale from \"extremely morally good\" to \"extremely morally bad\").  But if we presented Switch first, only about half the respondents rated the scenarios equivalently.  Somewhat simplified: People who see Push first will say that it's morally bad to push the man, and then when they see Switch they will say it's similarly bad to flip the switch.  People who see Switch first will say it's okay to flip the switch, but then when they see the Push case they don't say \"Oh, I guess that's okay too\".  Rather, they dig in their heels and say that pushing the man is bad despite the superficial similarity to the Switch case, and thus they rate the two scenarios inequivalently.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrikingly, Fiery and I found that professional philosophers show the same size order effects on their judgment about hypothetical scenarios as do non-philosophers.  Even when we restricted our analysis to respondents reporting a PhD in philosophy and an area of specialization or competence in ethics, we found no overall reduction of the magnitude of the order effect.    (This research is forthcoming in <a href=\"http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0268-1064\">Mind &amp; Language</a>; manuscript draft available <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">here</a>.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/\">Doctrine of the Double Effect</a> is the orthodox (but by no means universally accepted) explanation of why it might be okay to flip the switch but not okay to push the man.  According to the Doctrine of the Double Effect, it's worse to harm someone as a <i>means </i>of bringing about a good outcome than it is to harm someone as merely a <i>foreseen side-effect</i> of bringing about a good outcome.  Applied to the trolley case, the thought is this: If you flip the switch, the means of saving the five is diverting the boxcar to the side-track, and the death of the one person is just a foreseen side effect.  However, if you push the man, killing him is the means of saving the five.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow maybe this is a sound doctrine, soundly applied, or maybe not.  But what Fiery and I did was this: At the end of our experiment, we asked our participants whether they endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Specifically we asked the following:<br/>\n<blockquote>Sometimes it is necessary to use one person\u2019s death as a means to saving several more people\u2014killing one helps you accomplish the goal of saving several.  Other times one person\u2019s death is a side-effect of saving several more people\u2014the goal of saving several unavoidably ends up killing one as a consequence.  Is the first morally better, worse, or the same as the second?<br/>\n<br/>\n[Response options: \u2018better\u2019 \u2018worse\u2019 or \u2018same\u2019]</blockquote>Non-philosophers' responses to this question were unrelated to the order of the presentation of the scenarios.  We suspect that many of them didn't see the connection between this abstract principle and the Push and Switch scenarios presented much earlier in the questionnaire.  But philosophers' responses <i>were </i>related to the order of presentation of the Push and Switch scenarios.  Specifically, the majority of philosophers (62%) who saw the Switch scenario first endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  However, the doctrine was endorsed only by a minority of philosophers (46%) who saw Push first (p = .02).  What seems to have happened is this: By manipulating order of presentation, Fiery and I influenced the likelihood that respondents would rate the scenarios equivalently or inequivalently.  We thereby also influenced the likelihood of our philosopher respondents' endorsing a doctrine that appears to justify inequivalent judgments about the scenarios, the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Rather than relying on stable principles to reach judgments about the cases, a certain portion of philosophers appear to have reached their scenario judgments on the basis of covert factors like order of presentation and then endorsed principles only post-hoc as a means of rationalizing their covertly influenced judgments about the specific cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nManipulating the order of <i>two </i>pairs of scenarios (a Push-Switch case and a <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/\">Moral Luck</a> case) appeared to amplify the magnitude of this effect, by pushing philosophers either generally toward or generally against endorsing inequivalency-supporting principles.  With two scenario pairs ordered to favor inequivalency, we found 70% of our philosopher respondents endorsing the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  With the two pairs ordered to favor equivalency, only 28% endorsed the doctrine (p &lt; .001).  This is a very large shift in opinion, given how well-known the doctrine is among philosophers and given that by this point in the questionnaire, all philosophers had viewed all versions of each scenario.  We then filtered our results, looking only at respondents reporting a PhD and an area of specialization or competence in ethics, thinking that these high-grade specialists (mostly ethics professors at <a href=\"http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/\">Leiter-ranked</a> institutions) might have more stable opinions about the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  They didn't.  When the two scenario pairs were arranged to favor inequivalency, 62% of ethics PhDs endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  When the two pairs were arranged to favor equivalency, 29% endorsed the doctrine (p &lt; .05).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simplest interpretation of our overall results, across three types of scenarios (Double Effect, Moral Luck, and <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/\">Action-Omission</a>), is that in cases like these skill in philosophy doesn't manifest as skill in consistently applying explicitly endorsed abstract principles to reach stable judgments about hypothetical scenarios; rather, it manifests more as skill in choosing principles to rationalize, post-hoc, scenario judgments that are driven by the same types of factors that drive non-philosophers' judgments.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Eric Schwitzgebel</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/03/instability-of-professional.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2012-03-02T08:23:00-08:00\">8:23 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2033336107725809120\" onclick=\"\">34\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">experimental philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"blog-pager\" id=\"blog-pager\">\n<span id=\"blog-pager-older-link\">\n<a class=\"blog-pager-older-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/experimental%20philosophy?updated-max=2012-03-02T08:23:00-08:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=15&amp;by-date=false\" id=\"Blog1_blog-pager-older-link\" title=\"Older Posts\">Older Posts</a>\n</span>\n<a class=\"home-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/\">Home</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n<div class=\"blog-feeds\">\n<div class=\"feed-links\">\nSubscribe to:\n<a class=\"feed-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default\" target=\"_blank\" type=\"application/atom+xml\">Posts (Atom)</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"sidebar-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"sidebar section\" id=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"widget HTML\" data-version=\"1\" id=\"HTML1\">\n<div class=\"widget-content\">\n<!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=1508379;

Although most philosophers seem to view my work either neutrally or positively, or have concerns about the empirical details of this or that study, others react quite negatively to the whole project, more or less in principle. \n\nAbout a month ago on Facebook,  Samuel Rickless   did such a nice job articulating some general concerns (see his comment on  this public post  ) that I thought I'd quote his comments here and share some of my reactions. \n    \n First, My Research:   \n\n* In a series of studies published from 2009 to 2014, mostly in collaboration with  Joshua Rust   (and summarized  here  ), I've empirically explored the moral behavior of ethics professors.  As far as I know, no one else had ever systematically examined this question.   Across 17 measures of (arguably) moral behavior,   ranging from rates of charitable donation to staying in contact with one's mother to vegetarianism to littering to responding to student emails to peer ratings of overall moral behavior,  I have found not a single main measure on which ethicists appeared to act morally better than comparison groups of other professors  ; nor do they appear to behave better overall when the data are merged meta-analytically.  (Caveat: on some secondary measures we found ethicists to behave better.  However, on other measures we found them to behave worse, with no clearly interpretable overall pattern.) \n\n* In a pair of studies with  Fiery Cushman  , published in  2012   and  2015  , I've found that  philosophers, including professional ethicists, seem to be no less susceptible than non-philosophers to apparently irrational order effects and framing effects in their evaluation of moral dilemmas  . \n\n* More recently, I've turned my attention to philosophical pedagogy.  In an  unpublished critical review from 2013  , I found  little good empirical evidence that business ethics or medical ethics instruction has any practical effect on student behavior  .  I have been following up with some empirical research of my own with several different collaborators.  None of it is complete yet, but preliminary results tend to confirm the lack of practical effect, except perhaps when there's the right kind of narrative or emotional engagement.  On grounds of armchair plausibility, I tend to favor multi-causal, canceling explanations over the view that philosophical reflection is simply inert ( contra   Jon Haidt  ); thus I'm inclined to explore how backfire effects might on average tend to cancel positive effects.  It was a post on the  possible backfire effects of teaching ethics   that prompted Rickless's comment. \n Rickless's Objection:          \n The  order   in which moral dilemmas are presented matters to people's judgments and can substantially influence later judgments about abstract moral principles.  This is true even among professional ethicists with PhD's in philosophy.  In  2012   and  2015  ,  Fiery Cushman   and I published empirical evidence supporting these claims.  We invite a metaphilosophical conclusion:  If even professional philosophers' expert judgments are easily swayed by order of presentation, then such judgments might not be stable enough to serve as secure grounds for philosophical theorizing.  \n Synthese   has recently published two critiques of the literature on order effects in philosophy, which address Fiery's and my work (HT  Wesley Buckwalter  ).  Both critiques make valuable points.  However  both also admit of some clear replies. \n\nTo fix ideas, consider two versions of the famous  Trolley Problem  : \n Push:   A runaway boxcar is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  Jane can stop the boxcar by pushing a hiker with a heavy backpack in front of the boxcar, killing him but saving the five. \n Switch:   A runaway boxcar is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  Vicki can stop the boxcar by flipping a switch to divert it to a sidetrack where it will kill one person instead of the five.   \n\nFiery and I presented Push-type and Switch-type scenarios (fleshed with a bit more detail) to professional philosophers and two comparison groups of non-philosophers.  We found that when professional philosophers saw a Push-type scenario before a Switch-type scenario, 73% rated the two scenarios equivalently on a 7-point scale.  Then later in the questionnaire when asked about the  Doctrine of the Double Effect   -- a moral principle often interpreted implying that Push-type cases are morally worse than Switch-type cases -- only a minority, 46%, endorsed that principle.  In contrast, among philosophers who saw Switch before Push only 54% rated the two scenarios equivalently, and then later a majority, 62%, endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Endorsement of the principle thus seemed to shift, post-hoc, to rationalize philosophers' order-manipulated judgments about the scenarios. \n\nWe found similar effects for  Action-Omission  ,  Moral Luck  , and \" Asian disease  \" type cases (though not consistently for every measure across the board).\n\nPhilosophers with PhDs and self-reported competence or specialization in ethics showed no smaller effects than other philosophers or than comparison groups of non-philosophers -- and in fact trended slightly (non-significantly) toward showing larger order effects. \n\nIn general, we found pretty substantial effect sizes, suggesting substantial instability of judgment even in philosophical respondents' areas of expertise.  Hence the metaphilosophical worry. \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n Critique by  Zachary Horne and Jonathan Livengood  .  \n\nHorne and Livengood make three main points about the literature on order effects in philosophy: \n\n(A.) First, they helpfully  distinguish between what they call \"updating effects\" and \"genuine ordering effects\".    Genuine ordering effects, in their terminology, are effects measured only  after   all the stimuli have been presented.  \"Updating effects\" are measures taken along the way, and might well reflect participants' learning.  There is of course nothing irrational in judging Scenario B differently as a result of seeing Scenario A because one  learned   something by seeing Scenario A.  Most philosophical research on order effects, they note, takes the measures along the way -- and thus might be measuring learning rather than true order effects. \n\n(B.) Second, they point out that  perceptual judgments also show order effects  .  Thus, if we are to reject any type of evidence that shows order effects, then we must reject perceptual evidence too, which would lead to radical skepticism. \n\n(C.) Third, they point out that  order can sometimes reasonably make a difference to the evaluation of evidence.    For example, a smile followed by a frown, on the same person's face, is a different type of evidence than a frown followed by a smile. \n\nOn (A): I find the labels tendentious (since if we know there isn't learning-type updating going on, what we might want to call \"genuine order effects\" can plausibly be measured mid-stream), however it probably is correct that most studies do not sufficiently rule out the possibility of learning or updating in the course of the experiment, if they have novice participants and take the measurements after each scenario rather than after both scenarios.  However, since our participants were experts,  we think it unlikely that a significant number learned anything in the process of our brief experiment that would rationally justify shifting their judgment   about the equivalency or non-equivalency of Push and Switch.  And as Horne and Livengood note,  our measure of endorsement of the Doctrine of the Double Effect is a measurement of a \"genuine ordering effect\" even by their own lights  . \n\nOn (B): Yes, of course it would be silly to reject all means of learning that are subject to any order effects!  The epistemic sting, as they note, depends not on the mere existence of an order effect in one case, but on how  large   and how  prevalent   the order effects are.  This is an open empirical question.  But the limited empirical evidence that exists suggests that order effects are substantial and prevalent in moral dilemma cases.   So far, we have found order effects in all of the scenario types we've tried, with about a 10-20% shift in opinion on the moral equivalency of our scenario pairs   and in preference for the risky option in the \"Asian disease\" cases. \n\nOn (C): It's interesting to consider cases in which earlier evidence rightly colors our reaction to later evidence, but trolley problems presented to disciplinary experts seems a different kind of case. \n\nFinally, Horne and Livengood suggest that exposure to a pair of dilemmas in our study is unlikely to have a long-lasting impact on professional philosophers' beliefs.  I agree.  They continue, \"But if there is no long-lasting impact, then we think the effect is unlikely to matter to actual philosophical practice outside of the laboratory\" (p. 17).  I don't think this follows.  Fiery's and my view is not that philosophers' opinions are  permanently influenced   by the order in which the scenarios are presented on any single occasion, but rather that their opinions are  unstable   -- possibly influenced one direction on one occasion, in another direction on another occasion.  This instability is what drives the metaphilosophical worry. \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n Critique by  Regina Rini  :  \n\nRini -- a recent  guest blogger   here at the Splintered Mind -- looks only at our 2012 study.  (Our 2015 study wasn't published until after her paper was in press.)  She finds it plausible that if professional philosophers were already familiar with these cases they would not exhibit order effects of the sort Fiery and I find.  She suggests that perhaps respondents were not previously familiar with the cases -- or at least not familiar in the right sort of way.  She calls this the \"familiarity problem\" and offers four possible explanations: \n\n(1.) The respondents were  not really experts  .  She wonders if our participants, recruited through the internet, really had the degrees they claimed to have. \n\n(2.) The respondents  didn't carefully attend   to our scenarios.  Maybe they breezed through them so quickly that they failed to notice relevant features. \n\n(3.) The respondents  might not have familiar responses   to these types of scenarios.  Perhaps they have so far refrained from forming judgments on such cases and principles. \n\n(4.) The respondents might not have  diachronically stable familiar responses  .  This is the explanation Fiery and I favor.  However, Rini helpfully points out that  as long as philosophers are  aware   that their responses are not diachronically stable, the metaphilosophical threat is reduced  : Presumably philosophers who are aware that their responses are not stable would be reluctant to ground their theorizing on those responses. \n\nOn (1): I am not aware of a general problem in the survey literature of respondents' frequently misreporting their educational status -- though certainly a bit of misreporting is possible.  One specific piece of evidence against this possibility in our own study is that we recruited philosophers mostly by asking department chairs to forward a recruitment email to faculty and graduate students in their departments.   Most of our \"philosopher\" participants took the survey within just a few days of these emails.  \n\nOn (2): The  median response time on the first scenario was 40 seconds  , on the second scenario was 34 seconds.  While these are not huge response times, if you stop to count out 34 seconds now, you'll probably notice that it's a reasonable amount of time for a thoughtful response to a brief scenario. \n\nOn (3) and (4): These are potentially quite serious issues, and in fact our follow-up study in 2015 was designed specifically to address them, after we saw an early version of Rini's critique.  In our 2015 study we  specifically asked   participants if they were previously familiar with the scenarios.  We also asked whether they regarded themselves as \"having had a stable opinion\" about the issues before participating in the experiment, and whether they regarded themselves as experts on those very issues.  We also added a \"reflection\" condition to help address concern (2).  In the reflection condition we asked participants to reflect carefully before responding and enforced a minimum 15-second delay between when participants reported having finished reading the scenario and when their response options appeared. \n We did not find that self-reported familiarity or stability reduced the size of order effects in two different types of scenario pairs (trolley problems and risky-choice \"Asian disease\"-type problems), nor did we find reduced order effects in the reflection condition compared to a normal control condition without special instructions to reflect.  \n\nFor example, percentage rating the Push and Switch scenarios equivalently: \n   \n\nThus, I am inclined to think that Rini's fourth suggestion is the most plausible -- that participants do not have diachronically stable familiar responses, despite high levels of expertise.  But since those who  report   having stable responses were no less subject to order effects than were those who reported not having stable responses, self-knowledge of stability appears to be largely absent.  Despite Rini's interesting suggestion that instability is metaphilosophically non-threatening if people are aware of it, Fiery's and my results suggest that we should not hasten to that comfort. \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\nBoth Horne and Livengood and Rini emphasize that we only have very limited evidence about order effects on professional philosophers' judgments.  I agree!  Fiery's and my two studies are hardly decisive.  Convergent evidence from several different labs would be necessary before drawing any confident conclusions, especially if those conclusions are at variance with what one feels one knows from personal experience.  Rini also makes positive suggestions for follow-up experimental work that might be done, which I am inclined to support.  Both critiques raise important methodological concerns that ought to help shape and direct future work on this topic.  \n  \n                                \n Fiery Cushman   and I have a  new paper   in draft, exploring the question of whether professional philosophers' judgments about moral dilemmas are less influenced than non-philosophers' by factors such as order of presentation and phrasing differences. \n\nWe recruited hundreds of academic participants with graduate degrees in philosophy and a comparison group of academics with graduate degrees in other fields.  We gave them two \" trolley problems  \" and two  \"Asian disease\"-type framing effect   cases. \n\nWe presented the trolley problems either with a Switch case first (the protagonist saves five people by Switching a runaway trolley onto a side track where it kills one), followed by a Push or Drop case (saving five by Pushing one person into the trolley's path or by Dropping him into its path); or Push/Drop first, followed by Switch.  For each scenario, participants rated the protagonists' choice to kill the one person to save the five others, using a 7-point scale from \"extremely morally good\" to \"extremely morally bad\". \n Our previous research   suggests that non-philosophers are much more likely to judge the Push case and the Switch case equivalently when Push is presented first than when Switch is presented first.  On some views of  philosophical expertise  , philosophers' judgments about these cases should be less dependent on order of presentation than are non-philosophers' judgments.  In other words, philosophers, due to their familiarity with scenarios of this type and their expertise in applying moral principles to them, should have more stable opinions, less influenced by order of presentation.   We wanted to see if philosophers with prior familiarity with the cases, or self-reported expertise in the area, or self-reported stability of opinion, would show smaller order effects.    We also wanted to see if we could reduce order effects by enforcing a delay before responding during which we encouraged participants to reflect carefully on different versions of the scenario and different ways of phrasing the scenarios. \n\nWe were unable to find any level of expertise at which the order effects were detectably reduced.  Nor did adding a reflection condition appear to reduce the order effects.  This figure shows the rates at which Switch was rated as morally equivalent to either Drop or Push on the 7-point scale:    [click to enlarge] \n The order effect, as indicated by the differences in height between the black and the gray bars, is basically the same for philosophers and the non-philosophers, even in the \"reflection\" condition.  \n\nThis next figure breaks the results down by degree of self-reported expertise among philosopher respondents:    \n[click to enlarge] \n Note that at no level of expertise does the order effect appear to be reduced: not among philosophers reporting being professors with a specialization in ethics, nor among philosophers reporting having a \"stable opinion\" about trolley problems of this sort.    If anything, the trend appears to be toward  larger   order effects with increasing expertise. \n\nSome of the most famous results in psychology are the Tversky-Kahneman \"loss aversion\"  framing effects  .  Participants are asked to imagine that an unusual disease will kill 600 people if nothing is done and then given a choice between two programs: On Program A, 200 people will be saved.  On Program B, there's a one-third probability that 600 people will be saved and a two-thirds probability that no people will be saved.  When the decision is framed this way, in terms of the number \"saved\", most people favor the non-risky Program A.  When what are ( purportedly  ) the exact same options are presented in terms of how many will die (400 will die vs. one-third probability that none will die and two-thirds probability that 600 will die), respondents tend to favor the risky Program B. \n\nThe results:            \n You know the  trolley problems  .  A runaway train trolley will kill five people ahead on the tracks if nothing is done.  But -- yay! -- you can intervene and save those five people!  There's a catch, though: your intervention will cost one person's life.  Should you intervene?  Both philosophers' and non-philosophers' judgments vary depending on the details of the case.   One interesting question is how sensitive philosophers and non-philosophers are to details that might be morally relevant   (as opposed to presumably irrelevant distracting features like  order of presentation   or the  point-of-view used in expressing the scenario  ). \n\nConsider, then, these four variants of the trolley dilemma: \n Switch  : You can flip a switch to divert the trolley onto a dead-end side-track where it will kill one person instead of the five. \n Loop  : You can flip a switch to divert the trolley into a side-track that loops back around to the main track.  It will kill one person on the side track, stopping on his body.  If his body weren't there to block it, though, the trolley would have continued through the loop and killed the five. \n Drop  : There is a hiker with a heavy backpack on a footbridge above the trolley tracks.  You can flip a switch which will drop him through a trap door and onto the tracks in front of the runaway trolley.  The trolley will kill him, stopping on his body, saving the five. \n Push  : Same as Drop, except that you are on the footbridge standing next to the hiker and the only way to intervene is to push the hiker off the bridge into the path of the trolley.  (Your own body is not heavy enough to stop the trolley.) \n\nSure, all of this is pretty artificial and silly.  But orthodox opinion is that it's permissible to flip the switch in Switch but impermissible to push the hiker in Push; and it's interesting to think about whether that is correct, and if so why.\n \n Fiery Cushman   and I decided to compare philosophers' and non-philosophers' responses to such cases, to see if philosophers show evidence of different or more sophisticated thinking about them.    We presented both trolley-type setups like this and also similarly structured scenarios involving a motorboat, a hospital, and a burning building (for our full list of stimuli see Q14-Q17  here  .) \n\nIn our published article on this, we found that philosophers were  just as subject to order effects   in evaluating such scenarios as were non-philosophers.  But we focused mostly on Switch vs. Push -- and also some  moral luck   and  action/omission   cases -- and we didn't have space to really explore Loop and Drop. \n\nAbout 270 philosophers (with master's degree or more) and about 670 non-philosophers (with master's degree or more) rated paragraph-length versions of these scenarios, presented in random order, on a 7-point scale from 1 (extremely morally good) through 7 (extremely morally bad; the midpoint at 4 was marked \"neither good nor bad\").  Overall, all the scenarios were rated similarly and near the midpoint of the scale (from a mean of 4.0 for Switch to 4.4 for Push [paired t = 5.8, p < .001]), and philosophers and non-philosophers mean ratings were very similar. \n\nPerhaps more interesting than mean ratings, though, are equivalency ratings:  How likely were respondents to rate scenario pairs equivalently?    The Loop case is subtly different from the Switch case: Arguably, in Loop but not Switch, the man's death is a means or cause of saving the five, as opposed to a merely foreseen side effect of an action that saves the five.  Might philosophers care about this subtle difference more than non-philosophers?  Likewise, the Drop case is different from the Push case, in that Push but not Drop requires proximity and physical contact.  If that difference in physical contact is morally irrelevant, might philosophers be more likely to appreciate that fact and rate the scenarios equivalently? \n In fact, the majority of participants rated  all   the scenarios exactly the same -- and philosophers were no less likely to do so than non-philosophers  : 63% of philosophers gave identical ratings to all four scenarios, vs. 58% of non-philosophers (Z = 1.2, p = .23). \n\nI find this somewhat odd.  To me, it seems pretty flat-footed a form of consequentialism that says that Push is not morally worse than Switch.  But I find that my judgment on the matter swims around a bit, so maybe I'm wrong.  In any case, it's interesting to see both philosophers and non-philosophers seeming to reject the standard orthodox view, and at very similar rates. \n\nHow about  Switch vs. Loop  ?  Again, we found no difference in equivalency ratings between philosophers and non-philosophers:  83% of both groups rated the scenarios equivalently   (Z = 0.0, p = .98). \n However, philosophers  were   more likely than non-philosophers to rate Push and Drop equivalently  : 83% of philosophers did, vs. 73% of non-philosophers (Z = 3.4, p = .001; 87% vs. 77% if we exclude participants who rated Drop  worse   than Push). \n\nHere's another interesting result.  Near the end of the study we asked whether it was worse to kill someone as a means of saving others than to kill someone as a side-effect of saving others -- one way of setting up the famous  Doctrine of the Double Effect  , which is often evoked to defend the view that Push is worse than Switch (in Push, the one person's death is arguably the means of saving the other five, in Switch the death is only a foreseen side-effect of the action that saves the five).  Loop is interesting in part because although superficially similar to Switch, if the one person's death is the means of saving the five, then maybe the case is more morally similar to Push than to Switch (see  Otsuka 2008  ).  However,  only 18% of the philosophers who said it was worse to kill as a means of saving others rated Loop worse than Switch  .  \n  \n                 \n You know the  trolley problems  , of course.  An out-of-control trolley is headed toward five people it will kill if nothing is done.  You can flip a switch and send it to a side track where it will kill one different person instead.  Should you flip the switch?  What if, instead of flipping a switch, the only way to save the five is to push someone into the path of the trolley, killing that one person? \n\nIn evaluating this scenario, does it matter if the person standing near the switch with the life-and-death decision to make is \"John\" as opposed to \"you\"?   Nadelhoffer & Feltz   presented the switch version of the trolley problem to undergraduates from Florida State University.  Forty-three saw the problem with \"you\" as the actor; 65% of the them said it was permissible to throw the switch.  Forty-two saw the problem with \"John\" as the actor; 90% of them said it was permissible to throw the switch, a statistically significant difference. \n\nTobia, Buckwalter & Stich  followed up  , presenting a famous moral dilemma from  Bernard Williams   in which someone can save a group of innocent villagers from a gunman by choosing personally to shoot one of the villagers.  Forty undergraduates were presented this scenario.  When \"you\" were given the chance to shoot one villager to save the rest, 19% of said it was morally obligatory to do so; when \"Jim\" was given the chance, 53% said it was obligatory (again statistically significant). \n\nHowever, Tobia and colleagues also gave the scenario to 62 professional philosophers and found the opposite effect: 9% of philosophers found it obligatory for \"Jim\" and 36% found it obligatory for \"you\".  They also presented a trolley-switching case to 49 professional philosophers.  Again, the effect was in the opposite direction from that observed among undergraduates: 89% of philosophers said it was permissible to flip the switch in the second-person condition vs. 64% in the third-person condition. \n\nFiery Cushman and I have some unpublished data on this that I thought I'd throw into the mix, since our results are a bit different from those of Tobia and colleagues.  We collected these data for our  2012 paper on order effects   in philosophers' and non-philosophers' judgments about moral scenarios.  Most of the scenarios were presented third-person, but as we mention in the published paper, some scenarios also had second-person variants.  We didn't find large effects, and the paper was already very complicated, so we didn't detail the second-person/third-person differences. \n\nIn that experiment, we had four scenarios that differed 2nd person vs. 3rd person.  However, they differed not in whether the  actor   was described as \"you\", but rather in whether the  victim   was. \n\nOne scenario was a version of Williams' hostage scenario.  \"Nancy\" and other villagers are captured by a warlord.  Nancy is given the choice of shooting \"you\" (2nd person variant) or \"a fellow hostage\" (3rd person variant) to save the captured villagers.  Respondents rated Nancy's \"shooting you\" or \"shooting a fellow hostage\" on a 7-point scale from  \"extremely morally good\" (1) through \"extremely morally bad\" (7), with \"morally neutral\" in the middle (4).  We had three groups of respondents: 324 professional philosophers (MA or PhD in philosophy, mostly recruited via email to Leiter-ranked philosophy departments), 753 non-philosopher academics (Master's or PhD not in philosophy, mostly recruited via email to comparison departments at the same universities), and 1389 non-academics (a convenience sample of others who happened upon the test site). \n\nWe found non-philosophers a bit more likely to rate Nancy's shooting one to save the others toward the \"morally good\" side of the scale if the victim was \"you\",  but philosophers showed only a small, non-significant trend on our 7-point scale (using t-tests): Non-academics: 3.6 (2nd person victim) vs. 4.1 (3rd person victim) (p < .001).           \n Very interesting critique   by  at the Brains blog of the original  Buckwalter and Stich study   on this question.  \n  \n  \n Central to contemporary epistemology is the question of what it is to know something.  And the orthodox starting point in discussions of what it is to know something is the  \"JTB account\" of knowledge  : Knowledge is justified (J) true (T) belief (B), plus maybe some fourth condition to take care of weird cases where justified beliefs are true merely by accident (so-called  Gettier cases  ).  Discussion tends to focus on how to understand the J condition and whether some further fourth condition is necessary.  The truth and belief conditions are typically regarded as unproblematic. \n\nIn  a forthcoming paper  , Blake Myers-Schulz and I pick up a mostly-cold torch from  Colin Radford   (whose seminal work on this topic was in the 1960s) and challenge the belief condition.  Can one know that something is the case even if one doesn't believe that it's the case?  We offer five plausible cases (one adapted from Radford) along with empirical evidence that our intuitions [note 1] about these cases are not idiosyncratic. \n\nThis paper has already drawn several follow-up studies, some critical and some supportive -- but interestingly,  even the critical studies can be read as contributing to an emerging consensus that problematizes the belief condition  .  (I don't predict the consensus will last.  They never do in philosophy.  But still!) \n\nFirst, to give you a feel for it, our cases: \n1. An unconfident examinee who feels like she is guessing the answer but non-accidentally gets it right; \n2. An absent-minded driver who momentarily forgets that a bridge he normally takes to work is closed and continues en route toward that bridge; \n3. A prejudiced professor, who intellectually appreciates that her athletic students are just as capable as her non-athletic students but who nonetheless is persistently biased in her reactions to student-athletes; \n4. A freaked-out movie-watcher who seems to have the momentary impression that the scenario depicted in a horror film is real; \n5. A self-deceived husband who has lots of evidence that his wife is cheating and some emotional responses that seem to reveal that he knows this, but who refuses to admit the truth to himself.      \n\nNow maybe not all the cases work, but we think in each case there's at least some plausibility to the thought that the person in question  knows   (that Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, that the bridge is closed, that athletic students are just as capable, that aliens won't come out of her faucet, that his wife is cheating) but does not  believe   -- at least not as fully and determinately as she knows.  And lots of undergraduates seem to agree with us!  So we think the B condition on knowledge should at least be open for discussion.  It should not be regarded as  uncontroversially nonproblematic.  \n\nFollow-up studies (e.g.,  here  ,  here  ,  here  , and  here  ) have added some new plausible cases.  Our favorite of these is: \n6. A religious fundamentalist geocentrist who aces her astronomy class -- seeming to know that Earth revolves around the sun but not to believe it.  \n\nAlthough some of these follow-up studies are pitched as in agreement with us and others as critique, we think there's actually a pretty clear thread of consensus through it all, from a bird's-eye view: \n Knowledge requires    some   sort of psychological connection to the justified, true proposition --  something broadly  like   a belief condition; but it doesn't seem to require full-on act-it-and-live-it-and-breathe-it belief.    However reasonable it might be to think the Earth goes round the sun, that fact has to register with me cognitively in  some   way if I am to qualify as knowing it; but the fact needn't play the full functional role of belief as envisioned in behaviorally-rich accounts of belief  like my own  .   But how exactly should we should conceptualize this somewhat weak but broadly beliefish psychological-connectedness condition?  At this point, that's wide open.  \n\nBlake and I suggest that one must have the capacity to act on the stored information that P; Rose and Schaffer seem to suggest that what's crucial is that the information be \"available to the mind\"; Buckwalter and colleagues suggest that one must believe but only in some \"thin\" sense of belief; Murray and colleagues suggest that one need to be disposed to \"assent\" to the content.  None of these approaches are well specified (and I've simplified them somewhat; apologies).  Figuring out what's going on with the B condition thus seems like a potentially fruitful task that brings together core issues in epistemology and philosophy of mind. \n\n------------------------------------------------- \n[note 1] Yes, I use the word \"intuition\".   Herman Cappelen   has me worried about the term.  But I  stand firm  !  \n  \n          \n Bertrand Russell writes: There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into existence five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that \"remembered\" a wholly unreal past.  There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago....  I am not here suggesting that the non-existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.  Like all sceptical hypotheses, it is logically tenable but uninteresting ( The Analysis of Mind,   1921, p. 159-160).  Wait... what?!  We can't prove that the world has existed for more than five minutes, but who cares,  bo  -ring? \n\nI'd think rather the opposite: We  can   prove that the world has existed for more than five minutes.  And if I didn't think I could prove that fact, I wouldn't say ho-hum, whatevs, maybe everything I thought really happened is just an illusion, *yawn*. \n\nOkay, well, \"prove\" is too strong.  Logical certainty of the 2+2=4 variety, I can't provide.  But I think I can provide, at least to myself, some good empirical evidence that the past existed five minutes ago.  I can begin by opening up the  New York Times  .  It tells me that  Larry Kwong was the Jeremy Lin of his day  .  Therefore, the past exists. \n\nNow hold on, you'll say.  I've begged the question against Russell.  For Russell is asking us to consider the possibility that the world was created five minutes ago with everything exactly as it then was, including the New York Times website.  I can't disconfirm that hypothesis by going to the New York Times website!  The young-world hypothesis and the old-world hypothesis make exactly the same prediction about what I will find, and therefore the evidence does not distinguish between them. \n\nHere I need to think carefully about the form of the young-world hypothesis and the reasons I might entertain it.  For example, I should consider what reason I have to prefer the hypothesis that a planet-sized external world was created five minutes ago vs. the hypothesis that just I and my immediate environment were created five minutes ago.  Is there reason to regard the first hypothesis as more likely than the second hypothesis?  I think not.  And similarly for temporal extent: There's nothing privileged about 5 minutes ago vs. 7.22 minutes ago vs. 27 hours ago, vs. 10 seconds ago, etc. (perhaps up to the bound of the \" specious present  \"). \n\nSo if I'm in a skeptical enough mood to take young-world hypotheses seriously, I should have a fairly broad range of young-world hypotheses in mind as live options.  Right? \n\nIn the spirit of skeptical indifference, let's say that I go ahead and assign a 50% probability to a standard non-skeptical old-world hypothesis and a 50% probability to a young-world hypothesis based on my subjective experience of a seeming-external-world  right now  .  Conditional on the young-world hypothesis, I then further distribute my probabilities, say, 50-50% between the I-and-my-immediate-environment hypothesis and the whole-planet hypothesis.  The exact probabilities don't matter, and clearly there will be many other possibilities; this is just to show the form of the argument.  So, right now, my probabilities are 50% old-world, 25% young-small-world, and 25% young-large-world. \n\nNow, if the world is young and small, then all should be void, or chaos, beyond the walls of this room.  (In a certain sense such a world might be large, but the Earthly stuff in my vicinity is small.)  In particular, the New York Times web servers should not exist.  So if I try to visit the New York Times' webpage, based on my entirely false seeming-memories of how the world works, New York Times content which is not currently on my computer should not then appear on my computer.  After all the hypothesis is that the world was created five minutes ago as it then was, and my computer did not have the newest NYT content at that time.  But, I check the site and new content appears!  Alternatively, I open my office door and behold, there's a hallway!  So now, I reduce the probability of the young-small-world hypothesis to zero.  (Zero makes the case simple, but the argument doesn't depend on that.)  Distributing that probability back onto the remaining two hypotheses, the old-world hypothesis is now 67% and young-large-world is 33%.  Thus, by looking at the New York Times website, I've given myself empirical evidence that the world is more than five minutes old. \n\nAdmittedly, I'd hope for better than 67% probability that the world is old, so the result is a little disappointing.  If I could justify the proposition that  if   the world is young, then it is probably small enough not to contain the New York Times web servers, then I can get final probabilities higher.  And maybe I can justify that proposition.  Maybe the likeliest young-world scenario is a spontaneous congealment scenario (i.e., a  Boltzmann brain   scenario) or a scenario in which this world is a small-scale computer simulation (see my  earlier    posts   on Bostrom's simulation argument).  For example, if the initial probabilities are 50% old, 45% young-small, 5% young-large, then after ruling out young-small, the old-world hypothesis rises above 90% -- an almost-publishable p value!  And maybe the probability of the old-world hypothesis continues to rise as I find that the world continues to exist in a stable configuration, since I might reasonably think that if the world is only 5 minutes old or 12 minutes old, it stands a fair chance of collapsing soon -- a possibility that seems less likely on the standard non-skeptical old-world hypothesis.  (However, there is the worry that after a minute or so, I will need to restart my anti-skeptical argument again due to the possibility that I only falsely remember having checked the New York Times site.  Such are the bitters of trying to refute skepticism.) \n\nYou might object that the most likely young-small-world hypothesis is one on which there is an outside agent who will feed me the seeming-New York Times website on demand, purposely to trick me.  But I'm not sure that's so.  And in any case, with that move we're starting to drift toward something like  Cartesian demon doubt  , which deserves separate treatment. \n\n[Slightly edited 6:33 pm in light of helpful clarificatory questions from Jonathan Weisberg.]  \n  \n            \n Is the world simple or complex?  Is a simple hypothesis more likely to be true than a complex hypothesis that fits the data equally well?   The issue is gnarly  .  Sometimes the best approach to a gnarly issue is crude stupidity.  Crude stupidity is my plan today.  \n  \nHere's what I did.  I thought up 30 pairs of variables that would be easy to measure and that might relate in diverse ways.  Some variables were physical (the distance vs. apparent brightness of nearby stars), some biological (the length vs. weight of sticks found in my back yard), and some psychological or social (the S&P 500 index closing value vs. number of days past).  Some I would expect to show no relationship (the number of pages in a library book vs. how high up it is shelved in the library), some I would expect to show a roughly linear relationship (distance of McDonald's franchises from my house vs. MapQuest estimated driving time), and some I expected to show a curved or complex relationship (forecasted temperature vs. time of day, size in KB of a JPG photo of my office vs. the angle at which the photo was taken).  See  here   for the full list of variables.  I took 11 measurements of each variable pair.  Then I analyzed the resulting data.  \n  \nNow, if the world is massively complex, then it should be difficult to predict a third datapoint from any two other data points.  Suppose that two measurements of some continuous variable yield values of 27 and 53.  What should I expect the third measured value to be?  Why not 1,457,002?  Or 3.22 x 10^-17?  There are just as many functions (that is, infinitely many) containing 27, 53, and 1,457,002 as there are containing 27, 53, and some more pedestrian-seeming value like 44.  On at least some ways of thinking about massive complexity, we ought to be no more surprised to discover that third value to be over a million than to discover that third value to be around 40.  Call the thesis that a wildly distant third value is no less likely than a nearby third value the  Wild Complexity Thesis  .  \n  \nI can use my data to test the Wild Complexity Thesis, on the assumption that the variables I have chosen are at least roughly representative of the kinds of variables we encounter in the world, in day-to-day human lives as experienced in a technologically advanced Earthly society.  (I don't generalize to the experiences of aliens or to aspects of the world that are not salient to experience, such as Planck-scale phenomena.)  The denial of Wild Complexity might seem obvious to you.  But that is an empirical claim, and it deserves empirical test.  As far as I know, no philosopher has formally conducted this test.  \n  \nTo conduct the test, I used each pair of dependent variables to predict the value of the next variable in the series (the 1st and 2nd observations predicting the value of the 3rd, the 2nd and 3rd predicting the value of the 4th, etc.), yielding 270 predictions for the 30 variables.  I counted an observation \"wild\" if its absolute value was 10 times the maximum of the absolute value of the two previous observations or if its absolute value was below 1/10 of the minimum of the absolute value of the two previous observations.  Separately, I also looked for flipped signs (either two negative values followed by a positive or two positive values followed by a negative), though most of the variables only admitted positive values.  This measure of wildness yielded three wild observations out of 270 (1%) plus another three flipped-sign cases (total 2%).  (A few variables were capped, either top or bottom, in a way that would make an above-10x or below-1/10th observation analytically unlikely, but excluding such variables wouldn't affect the result much.)  \n  \nSo it looks like the Wild Complexity Thesis might be in trouble.  Now admittedly a caveat is in order: If the world is wild enough, then I probably shouldn't trust my memory of having conducted this test (since maybe my mind with all its apparent memories just popped into existence out of a disordered past), or maybe I shouldn't trust the representativeness of this sample (I got 2% wild this time, but maybe in the next test I'll get 50% wild).  However, if we are doubtful about the results for either of those reasons, it might be difficult to escape collapse into radical skepticism.  If we set aside radically skeptical worries, we might still wonder how wild the world is.  These results give us a preliminary estimate.  To the extent the variables are representative, the answer seems to be: not too wild -- though with some surprises, such as the $20,000 listed value of the uncirculated 1922 Lincoln wheat penny.  (No, I didn't know about that before seeking the data.)  \n  \nIf we use a Wildness criterion of two (two times the max or 1/2 the min), then there are 33 wild instances in 270 observations, or about 12%, overlapping in one case with the three flipped-sign cases, for 13% total.  I wouldn't take this number  too   seriously, since it will presumably vary considerably depending on the variables chosen for analysis -- but still it's smaller than it might have been, and maybe okay as a first approximation to the extent the variables of interest resemble those on  my list  .  \n  \nI had meant to do some curve fitting in this post, too -- comparing linear and quadratic predictions with more complex predictions -- but since this is already a good-sized post, we'll curve fit another day.  \nI admit, this is a ham-handed approach.  It uses crude methods, it doesn't really establish anything we didn't already know, and I'm sure it won't touch the views of those philosophers who deny that the world is simple (who probably aren't committed to the Wild Complexity Thesis).  I highlight these concessions by calling the project \"stupid epistemology\".  If we jump too quickly to clever, though, sometimes we miss the necessary groundwork of stupid.  \n  \n Note: This post was substantially revised Feb. 6.    \n  \n  \n A new essay   with  Joshua Rust  . \n\nIn the first part, we summarize our empirical research on the moral behavior of ethics professors. \n\nIn the second part, we consider five possible explanations of our finding that ethics professors behave, on average, no better than do other professors. \n Explanation 1:   Philosophical moral reflection has no material impact on real-world moral behavior.   Jonathan Haidt   has called the view that explicit moral reflection does have a substantial effect on one's behavior \"the rationalist delusion\". \n Explanation 2:   Philosophical moral reflection influences real world moral behavior, but only in very limited domains of professional focus.  Those domains are sufficiently narrow and limited that existing behavioral measures can't unequivocally detect them.  Also, possibly, any improvement in such narrow domains might be cancelled out, in terms of overall moral behavior, by psychological factors like  moral licensing   or  ego depletion  . \n Explanation 3:   Philosophical moral reflection might lead one to behave  more morally permissibly but no morally better  .  The idea here is that philosophical moral reflection might lead one to avoid morally impermissible behavior while also reducing the likelihood of doing any  more   than is strictly morally required.  Contrast the sometimes-sinner sometimes-saint with the person who never goes beyond the call of duty but also never does anything really wrong. \n Explanation 4:   Philosophical moral reflection might compensate for deficient moral intuitions.  Maybe, from early childhood or adolescence, some people tend to lack strongly motivating moral emotions.  And maybe some of those people are also drawn to intellectual styles of moral reflection.  Without that moral reflection, they would behave morally worse than the average person, but moral reflection helps them behave better than they otherwise would.  If enough ethicists are like this, then philosophical moral reflection might have an important positive effect on the moral behavior of those who engage in it, but looking at ethicists as a group, that effect might be masked if it's compensating for lower rates of moral behavior arising from emotional gut intuitions. \n Explanation 5:   Philosophical moral reflection might have powerful effects on moral behavior, but in both moral  and   countermoral directions, approximately cancelling out on average.  It might have positive effects, for example, if it leads us to discover moral truths on which we then act.  But perhaps equally often it becomes  toxic rationalization  , licensing morally bad behavior that we would otherwise have avoided. \n\nJosh and I decline to choose among these possibilties.  There might be some truth in all or most of them.  And there are still other possibilities, too.  Ethicists might in fact engage in moral reflection relevant to their personal lives no more often than do other professors.  Ethicists might find themselves increasingly disillusioned about the value of morality at the same time they improve their knowledge of what morality in fact requires.  Ethicists might learn to shield their personal behavior from the influence of their professional reflections, as a kind of self-defense against the apparent unfairness of being held to higher standards because of their choice of profession.... \n\nFull essay  here  .  As always thoughts and comments welcome, either by email or attached to this post.  \n  \n           \n Herman Cappelen   has provocatively argued that  philosophers don't generally rely upon intuition   in their work and thus that work in  experimental philosophy   that aims to test people's intuitions about philosophical cases is really beside the point. I have a simple argument against this view.  \n  \nFirst: I define \"intuition\" very broadly. A judgment is \"intuitive\", in my view, just in case it arises by some cognitive process other than explicit, conscious reasoning. By this definition, snap judgments about the grammaticality of sentences, snap judgments about the distance of objects, snap judgments about the moral wrongness of an action in a hypothetical scenario, and snap folk-psychological judgments are generally going to be intuitive. Intuitive judgments don't  have   to be snap judgments -- they don't have to be fast -- but the absence of explicit conscious reasoning is clearest when the judgment is quick.  \n  \nThis definition of \"intuition\" is similar to one\u00a0 Alison Gopnik   and I worked with in a  1998 article  , and it is much more inclusive than Cappelen's own characterizations. Thus, it's quite possible that intuitions in Cappelen's narrow sense are inessential to philosophy while intuitions in my broader sense are essential. But I don't think that Cappelen and I have\u00a0 merely   a terminological dispute. There's a politics of definition. One's terminological choices highlight and marginalize different facets of the world.  \n  \nMy characterization of intuition is also broader than most other philosophers' --  Joel Pust   in his  Stanford Encyclopedia article on intuition  , for example, seems to regard it as straightforward that perceptual judgments should not be called \"intuitions\" -- but I don't think my preferred definition is entirely quirky. In fact, in a  recent study  , J.R. Kuntz and J.R.C Kuntz found that professional philosophers were more likely to \"agree to a very large extent\" with Gopnik's and my definition of intuition than with any of six other definitions proposed by other authors (32% giving it the top rating on a seven-point scale). I think professional psychologists and linguists\u00a0might also sometimes use \"intuition\" in something like Alison's and my sense.  \n  \nIf we accept this broad definition of intuition, then it seems hard to deny that, contra Cappelen,\u00a0philosophy depends essentially on intuition -- as does all cognition. One can't explicitly consciously reason one's way to every one of one's premises, on pain of regress. One must start somewhere, even if only tentatively and subject to later revision.  \n  \nCappelen has, in conversation, accepted this consequence of my broad definition of \"intuition\". The question then becomes what to make of the epistemology of intuition in this sense. And this epistemological question is, I think, largely an empirical one, with several disciplines empirically relevant, including cognitive psychology, experimental philosophy, and study of the historical record. Based on the empirical evidence, what might we expect to be the strengths and weaknesses of explicit reasoning? And, alternatively, what might we expect to be the strengths and weaknesses of intuitive judgment?  \n  \nThose empirical questions become especially acute when the two paths to judgment appear to deliver conflicting results. When your ordinary-language spontaneous judgments about the applicability of a term to a scenario (or at least your  inclinations   to judge) conflict with what you would derive from your explicit theory, or when your spontaneous moral judgments (or inclinations) do, what should you conclude? The issue is crucial to philosophy as we all live and perform it, and the answer one gives ought to be informed, if possible, by empirically discoverable facts about the origins and reliability of different types of judgments or inclinations. (This isn't to say that a uniform answer is likely to win the day: Things might vary from time to time, person to person, topic to topic, and depending on specific features of the case.)  \n  \nIt would be strange to suppose that the psychology of philosophy is irrelevant to its epistemology. And yet Cappelen's dismissal of the enterprise of experimental philosophy on grounds of the irrelevance of \"intuitions\" to philosophy would seem to invite us toward that exactly that dubious supposition.  \n  \n  \n What is \"experimental philosophy\"?  There is, I think, some tension in how philosophers use the term -- tension between a narrow and a wide conception. \n\nMost of the work canonically identified as \"experimental philosophy\" surveys ordinary people's judgments (or \"intuitions\") about philosophical concepts, and it does so by soliciting people's responses to questions about hypothetical scenarios. (See, e.g., Knobe's  chairman study   regarding intentional action,  Swain et al.'s study   of order effects on knowledge judgments, and  Machery et al.'s study   of cultural variation in the perceived reference of proper names.)  Thus, philosophers sometimes think of \"experimental philosophy\" as the enterprise of running these sorts of studies.   Joshua Alexander  , for example,  in his 2012 book   portrays experimental philosophy as the study of people's philosophical intuitions, as does  Timothy Williamson  , in his  forthcoming critique   of the \"Experimental Philosophy revolution\". \n\nConceived narrowly in this way, experimental philosophy is a coherent and (mostly) recent movement, with a distinctive methodology and an interrelated network of results.  It is possible to discuss and critique it as a unified body. \n\nHowever, there also seems to be a broader conception of experimental philosophy -- a conception that has never, I think, been adequately articulated, a conception that  Josh Knobe   and  Shaun Nichols  , for example, gesture toward in their \" Experimental Philosophy Manifesto  \", before they shift their focus to experimental philosophy in the narrow sense.  In this broad sense, philosophers who do empirical work aimed at addressing traditionally philosophical questions are also experimental philosophers, even if they don't survey people about their intuitions.  In practice, the narrow/broad distinction hasn't meant too much because almost all of the empirical work of almost all of the people who are canonically recognized as \"experimental philosophers\" fits within both the narrow and the broad conceptualizations. \n\nMy own work, however, tends to fit only within the broad conception, not the narrow (with a couple of  recent    exceptions  ).  So the difference has personal importance to me, affecting both my and others' conceptualization of my role in the \"x-phi\" community. \n\nHow to articulate the broad conception?   Experimental work done by people in philosophy departments   seems an odd category, since similar work can be done by people in different departments.   Experimental work that addresses traditionally philosophical issues  , however, seems far too broad, sweeping in too much research that we would not ordinary conceptualize as philosophical, including physics experiments on the structure of space and time, biological research on the origins of our social roles, and psychological work on the origins of our concepts, since these issues are at the root of philosophy of physics, philosophy of biology, and philosophy of psychology; and sometimes what the most theoretically ambitious physicists, biologists, and psychologists say is not so different from what philosophers of those disciplines say; if by adding experimentation to that, we get experimental philosophers, then most experimental philosophers are employed by science departments. \n\nHere's a thought that is perhaps more satisfactory: Experimental philosophy in the broad sense is  empirical research that is thoroughly contextualized within an intimate knowledge of the philosophical literature on which it bears, and which is presented, primarily, as advancing that philosophical literature  .  (For present purposes, we can define \"philosophical literature\" sociologically as what is published in philosophy journals and in books classified as philosophy books by academic presses.)  This will omit the typical developmental psychologist working on conceptual categories, but probably allow as marginal cases of \"experimental philosophers\" the most philosophically informed developmental psychologists (such as  Alison Gopnik   and  Susan Carey  ).  It will allow in, as central, work by Shaun Nichols that is not typical intuition-polling x-phi (such as his work on  disgust norms   and on  quantitative history of philosophy  ).  Maybe some of  Elisabeth Lloyd  's empirical work on the female orgasm will also qualify. \n\nAnd of course (my main, not-so-secret intention in developing this account) so also will all of my own empirical work.  Included, for example, will be my work on  the moral behavior of ethics professors  , which does tend to be recognized as \"experimental philosophy\" by the x-phi crowd, despite not fitting the narrow conception; and also my empirical research on consciousness (e.g.,  here  , and chapters 1 and 6  here  ), which is less often mentioned as x-phi. \n\nBut more than that, I think this conception explicitly encourages the thought that a broad range of traditionally philosophical issues can be illuminated by empirical studies, even though they have not yet commonly been approached with the tools of empirical science.  For example, empirical research might help illuminate the question of whether philosophical study, over the centuries,  tends to progress toward the truth  .  We might be able to take  an experimental approach to the question of whether the external world exists  .  Questions in the history of philosophy might be approachable by means of the  systematic study of citation patterns in philosophical venues  .  And so forth. \n\nExperimental philosophers, break free!  There is so much more to do than just surveying intuitions! \n\n(No accident maybe, that I was a student of Gopnik and Lloyd?)  \n  \n            \n From a certain perspective, current liberal Western civilization seems to be a moral pinnacle. We have rejected slavery. We have substantially de-legitimized aggressive warfare. We have made huge progress in advancing the welfare of children. We have made huge progress toward gender and racial equality. In his 2011 book  The Better Angels of Our Nature  , Steven Pinker says he is prepared to call our recent ancestors \"morally retarded\" (p. 658). Imagine how we would react if a Westerner today were seriously to endorse a set of views that would not have been radical in 1800: denying women the vote (or maybe even advocating a return to monarchy), viewing slavery and twelve-hour days of child labor in coal mines as legitimate business enterprises, advocating military conquest for the sake of glory, etc. \"Morally retarded\" might seem a fair assessment!  \n  \nFrom another perspective, though, it appears almost inevitable that the average person in any culture will see his or her own culture's values as morally superior. Suppose that the average person in Culture 1 endorses values A, B, C, and D, the average person in Culture 2 endorses values A, B, -C, and E, and the average person in Culture 3 endorses values A, -B, D, and F. The average person from Culture 1 will think, \"Well the average person in my culture has A, B, C, and D right! The people in culture 2 have C wrong and really should pay attention to D rather than E, while the people in Culture 3 have B wrong and should attend to C rather than F. So my culture's values are superior.\" If Culture 1 is temporally more recent than Cultures 2 and 3, then our average person from Culture 1 can laud the change in values as \"progress\".  \n  \nThe problem is, of course, that it might not be progress at all, but rather only a preference for local values. Call this the  Local Pinnacle Illusion  . Someone from the past might suffer the same illusion looking forward at us, condemning (say) our liberal Western neglect of proper class and gender role distinctions, our relative irreligiosity, and our relative tolerance of homosexuality, masturbation, divorce, and moneylending -- calling the changes \"decadence\" rather than progress.  \n  \nThe question then is whether there's a good way to tell whether those of us with a Pinkeresque preference for contemporary liberal values are merely victims of the Local Pinnacle Illusion, or whether we really have made huge moral progress in the last few centuries or millennia. I've been thinking about whether there might be a way to explore this empirically, using the history of philosophy.  \n  \nHere's my thought: The temporal picture of progress and the temporal picture of a random walk look very different. If, say, rational reflection over the very long haul tends to guide us ever closer to right moral principles, as Pinker thinks, then issue-by-issue we ought to see opinion changes over the very long haul that look like progressive trends of moral philosophical discovery. If, in contrast, all that's going on is the Local Pinnacle Illusion, trends should be relatively short-lived, due to local cultural pressures, and not consistently directional over the very long haul.  \n  \nSuppose we chose twelve issues that have been broadly discussed since ancient times and that in at least some eras -- not necessarily our own -- are regarded as morally important issues. If we could chart philosophers' opinions on these issues quantitatively (e.g., from strong support for democracy to strong support for monarchy with moderate views in the middle, from strong support for gender-neutral role expectations to strong support for gender-specific role expectations, etc.), using -1 and +1 to mark the average position in the historically most extreme eras for each pole of each issue, then on a random-walk picture, we ought to see something like this pattern among those issues:\n  \n \n    \nI have assumed here a random starting spread from -1 to 1 and a random fluctuation from -0.3 to +0.3 in each successive period; then I renormalized the maximum value of each run to 1 and the minimum to -1. The result is basically a noisy walk, with extreme values as likely in the middle as at the ends.  \n \n  \nOn the other hand, if there's moral progress through philosophical reflection, the chart ought to look more like this:\n  \n \n    \nFor this chart, I assumed a progress factor, negative or positive, of one-third of the spread of the random fluctuation (i.e., adding or subtracting 0.1 to each step, in addition to the -0.3 to +0.3 random fluctuation). For the \"toward 0\" positions, I assumed positive incremental pressure when the previous period value was (absolutely) negative and negative incremental pressure when the previous period was positive. As with the previous graph, at the end I normalized the maximum and minimum values to +1 and -1.  \n  \nAs you can see,\u00a0many more moral issues show consistent trend directions over time and the most extreme positions tend to be held at the beginning and the end of the analysis period. The latter pattern follows from the fact that even if the initial historical position at time zero is by some objective standard moderate, as long as it is not spot on the target number, the trend over time should be roughly unidirectional toward the target number; and then the normalizing will make that initial position look extreme.  \n \n  \nTwo caveats and a final note:  \n  \nCaveat 1: It will of course be difficult to code this objectively, and it's quite possible that the final outcome will vary depending on hard-to-justify coding decisions.  \n  \nCaveat 2: My guess is that if we were to chart moral and political positions from the 1600s to the present we would see a chart somewhat like the second (progressive) chart, whereas if we were to chart equal time intervals back to the ancient West, we would see a more random-looking chart like the first. So which time period should be examined? A case for choosing the shorter period might be that it is only after the printing press and widespread communication of philosophical ideas that we should expect to see rationally-driven moral progress. However a consideration against choosing the shorter period is this: There might be cultural factors, such as industrialization and capitalization, that have created consistent unidirectional pressures on moral and political norms, independently of the rational case for adopting those norms; and for that reason the broader the temporal span the better.  \n  \nFinal note: We might be able to construct similar charts to evaluate whether there has been progress in metaphysics.  \n  \n(By the way,\u00a0see\u00a0 here  \u00a0for another post of mine on Pinker's intellectualist liberalism.)  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n (collaborative with  Alan Moore  )  \n  \nIt occurs to me to doubt whether the external world exists -- that is, whether anything exists other than my own stream of conscious experience. Radical solipsism is of course  crazy  . But can I  show   it to be wrong? Or is my only recourse simply to  assume   it's wrong, since any attempt at proof would be circular? Can I break out of the solipsistic circle, using facts about my own stream of experience, knowable from within the solipsistic perspective, to license an inference to the existence of something beyond my stream of experience?  \n  \nThe most famous philosophical attempts to prove the existence of an external world from solipsism-compatible assumptions and methods -- for example, Descartes's and Kant's -- are generally acknowledged by the philosophical community to fail. \u00a0I'm inclined to think those attempts fail because they set the bar too high: They aim for certainty through deductive proof. \u00a0Better, perhaps, to aim lower -- to use scientific methods and scientific standards, licensing only tentative conclusions as the current best explanation of the available evidence. In another way, too, I aim low: I aim only to refute solipsistic doubts in particular, not other sorts of skeptical doubts such as doubts about memory or reasoning. In fact, I will take the general standards of science for granted, insofar as those general standards are compatible with solipsism. I aim to do solipsistic science.  \n  \nLast year on my blog I presented the results of two experiments designed to provide evidence that an external world does indeed exist.\u00a0 The first experiment   suggested that something exists (\"my computer\") that is swifter than I at calculating prime numbers.  The second experiment   suggested that the world has some constancy to it that exceeds the constancy of my memory. Today, I will report on a third experiment.  \n  \nIf solipsism is true, nothing in the universe should exist that is better than I am at chess. Nothing should exist with chess-playing practical capacities that exceed my own. Now I believe that I stink at chess, and my seeming student \"Alan\" seems to have told me that he is good at chess. If solipsism is true, then he should not be able to beat me at rates higher than statistical chance. I agreed with this seeming-Alan to play twenty games of speed chess, with a limit of about five seconds per move.  \n  \nHere is what seems to be a picture of our procedure:    \n(photo credit: seeming-Gerardo Sanchez)  \n  \nThe results: seeming-Alan won 17, I won 2, and one stalemate. 17/19 is statistically higher than 50%, p < .001 (hand calculated).  \n  \nIt occurs to me that I might have hoped to lose, so as to generate results confirming my preferred hypothesis that the external world exists. Against this concern, I comfort myself with the following thoughts: If it was an  unconscious   desire to lose, then that implies that something exists in the universe besides my own stream of conscious experience, namely, an unconscious part of my mind. So radical solipsism is false. If it was, instead, a  conscious   desire to lose, I should have been able to detect it, barring an unusual degree of introspective skepticism. What I detected was a desire to win as many games as I could, given my background assumption that if Alan actually exists I would be hard pressed to win even one or two games. I found myself repeatedly and forcefully struck by the impression that the universe contained a practical intelligence superior to my own and bent on defeating me -- an impression, of course, confirmed by the results. The most natural scientific explanation of the pattern in my experience is that that impression is correct.  \n  \nI might easily enough  dream   of being consistently defeated in chess. But dreams of this sort, as I seem to remember, differ from the present experiment in one crucial way: They are vague on the specific moves or unrealistic about those moves. In the same way, I might dream of having proven Fermat's last theorem. Both types of case involve dream-like gappiness or irrationality or delusive credulity -- the type of gappiness or irrationality or delusive credulity that might make me see nothing remarkable in my daughter's growing wings or in discovering a new whole number between 5 and 6. Genuine dream doubt might involve doubt about my basic rational capacities, but if so such doubts are additional to simply solipsistic doubt. Whether I am dreaming or not, if I consistently experience specific clever and perceptive chess moves that repeatedly exploit flaws in my own conscious strategizing, flaws that I experience as surprising, it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that something exists that surpasses my own conscious intelligence in at least this one area.  \n  \n  \n People's responses to hypothetical moral scenarios can vary substantially depending on the order in which those scenarios are presented (e.g.,  Lombrozo 2009  ).  Consider the well-known \"Switch\" and \"Push\" versions of  The Trolley Problem  .  In the Switch version, an out-of-control boxcar is headed toward five people whom it will kill if nothing is done.  You're standing by a railroad switch, and you can divert the boxcar onto a side-track, saving the five people.  However, there's one person on the side-track, who would then be killed.  Many respondents will say that there's nothing morally wrong with flipping the switch, killing the one to save the five.  Some will even say that you're morally obliged to flip the switch.  In the Push version, instead of being able to save the five by flipping a switch, you can do so by pushing a heavy man into the path of the boxcar, killing him but saving the five as his weight slows the boxcar.  Despite the surface similarity to the Switch case, most people think it's not okay to push the man.  \n  \nHere's the order effect: If you present the Push case first, people are much less likely to say it's okay to flip the switch when you then later present the Switch case than if you present the Switch case first.  In one study,  Fiery Cushman   and I found that if we presented Push first, respondents tended to rate the two cases equivalently (on a seven-point scale from \"extremely morally good\" to \"extremely morally bad\").  But if we presented Switch first, only about half the respondents rated the scenarios equivalently.  Somewhat simplified: People who see Push first will say that it's morally bad to push the man, and then when they see Switch they will say it's similarly bad to flip the switch.  People who see Switch first will say it's okay to flip the switch, but then when they see the Push case they don't say \"Oh, I guess that's okay too\".  Rather, they dig in their heels and say that pushing the man is bad despite the superficial similarity to the Switch case, and thus they rate the two scenarios inequivalently.  \n  \nStrikingly, Fiery and I found that professional philosophers show the same size order effects on their judgment about hypothetical scenarios as do non-philosophers.  Even when we restricted our analysis to respondents reporting a PhD in philosophy and an area of specialization or competence in ethics, we found no overall reduction of the magnitude of the order effect.    (This research is forthcoming in  Mind & Language  ; manuscript draft available  here  .)  \n  \nThe  Doctrine of the Double Effect   is the orthodox (but by no means universally accepted) explanation of why it might be okay to flip the switch but not okay to push the man.  According to the Doctrine of the Double Effect, it's worse to harm someone as a  means   of bringing about a good outcome than it is to harm someone as merely a  foreseen side-effect   of bringing about a good outcome.  Applied to the trolley case, the thought is this: If you flip the switch, the means of saving the five is diverting the boxcar to the side-track, and the death of the one person is just a foreseen side effect.  However, if you push the man, killing him is the means of saving the five.  \n  \nNow maybe this is a sound doctrine, soundly applied, or maybe not.  But what Fiery and I did was this: At the end of our experiment, we asked our participants whether they endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Specifically we asked the following:  \n Sometimes it is necessary to use one person\u2019s death as a means to saving several more people\u2014killing one helps you accomplish the goal of saving several.  Other times one person\u2019s death is a side-effect of saving several more people\u2014the goal of saving several unavoidably ends up killing one as a consequence.  Is the first morally better, worse, or the same as the second?  \n  \n[Response options: \u2018better\u2019 \u2018worse\u2019 or \u2018same\u2019]  Non-philosophers' responses to this question were unrelated to the order of the presentation of the scenarios.  We suspect that many of them didn't see the connection between this abstract principle and the Push and Switch scenarios presented much earlier in the questionnaire.  But philosophers' responses  were   related to the order of presentation of the Push and Switch scenarios.  Specifically, the majority of philosophers (62%) who saw the Switch scenario first endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  However, the doctrine was endorsed only by a minority of philosophers (46%) who saw Push first (p = .02).  What seems to have happened is this: By manipulating order of presentation, Fiery and I influenced the likelihood that respondents would rate the scenarios equivalently or inequivalently.  We thereby also influenced the likelihood of our philosopher respondents' endorsing a doctrine that appears to justify inequivalent judgments about the scenarios, the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  Rather than relying on stable principles to reach judgments about the cases, a certain portion of philosophers appear to have reached their scenario judgments on the basis of covert factors like order of presentation and then endorsed principles only post-hoc as a means of rationalizing their covertly influenced judgments about the specific cases.  \n  \nManipulating the order of  two   pairs of scenarios (a Push-Switch case and a  Moral Luck   case) appeared to amplify the magnitude of this effect, by pushing philosophers either generally toward or generally against endorsing inequivalency-supporting principles.  With two scenario pairs ordered to favor inequivalency, we found 70% of our philosopher respondents endorsing the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  With the two pairs ordered to favor equivalency, only 28% endorsed the doctrine (p < .001).  This is a very large shift in opinion, given how well-known the doctrine is among philosophers and given that by this point in the questionnaire, all philosophers had viewed all versions of each scenario.  We then filtered our results, looking only at respondents reporting a PhD and an area of specialization or competence in ethics, thinking that these high-grade specialists (mostly ethics professors at  Leiter-ranked   institutions) might have more stable opinions about the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  They didn't.  When the two scenario pairs were arranged to favor inequivalency, 62% of ethics PhDs endorsed the Doctrine of the Double Effect.  When the two pairs were arranged to favor equivalency, 29% endorsed the doctrine (p < .05).  \n  \nThe simplest interpretation of our overall results, across three types of scenarios (Double Effect, Moral Luck, and  Action-Omission  ), is that in cases like these skill in philosophy doesn't manifest as skill in consistently applying explicitly endorsed abstract principles to reach stable judgments about hypothetical scenarios; rather, it manifests more as skill in choosing principles to rationalize, post-hoc, scenario judgments that are driven by the same types of factors that drive non-philosophers' judgments.  \n  \n  ", "title_html": "<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/06/does-it-harm-philosophy-as-discipline.html\">Does It Harm Philosophy as a Discipline to Discuss the Apparently Meager Practical Effects of Studying Ethics?</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/12/a-response-to-critiques-of-cushmans-and.html\">A Response to Critiques of Cushman's and My Work on Philosophers' Susceptibility to Order Effects</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2014/10/professional-philosophers.html\">Professional Philosophers\u2019 Susceptibility to Order Effects and Framing Effects in Evaluating Moral Dilemmas</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/12/how-subtly-do-philosophers-analyze.html\">How Subtly Do Philosophers Analyze Moral Dilemmas?</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/10/second-person-vs-third-person.html\">Second-Person vs. Third-Person Presentation of Moral Dilemmas</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/07/do-women-have-different-philosophical.html\">Do Women Have Different Philosophical Intuitions Than Men?</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/03/problematizing-b-condition-on-knowledge.html\">Problematizing the B Condition on Knowledge</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/02/empirical-evidence-that-world-was-not.html\">Empirical Evidence That the World Was Not Created Five Minutes Ago</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/02/preliminary-evidence-that-world-is.html\">Preliminary Evidence That the World Is Simple (An Exercise in Stupid Epistemology)</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-moral-behavior-of-ethicists-and.html\">The Moral Behavior of Ethicists and the Rationalist Delusion</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/12/intuitions-philosophy-and-experiment.html\">Intuitions, Philosophy, and Experiment</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/09/what-experimental-philosophy-might-be.html\">What Experimental Philosophy Might Be</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2012/09/has-civilization-made-moral-progress.html\">Has Civilization Made Moral Progress?

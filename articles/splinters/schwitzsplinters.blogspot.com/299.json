Across nine different moral issues, we found that <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHTMB-4\">ethicists reported behaving overall no morally differently than the other two groups</a>, though on some issues, especially vegetarianism and charitable giving, they endorsed more stringent attitudes.  (In some cases, we also had observational behavioral data that didn't depend on self-report.  Here too we found no overall difference.)  Schoenegger and Wagner <b>translated our questionnaire into German</b> and added a few new questions, then distributed it by email to professors in German-speaking countries, achieving an overall response rate of 29.5% [corrected Mar 23].  (Josh and I had a response rate of 58%.)  With a couple of exceptions, Schoenegger and Wagner report similar results.<p>\n\nThe most interesting difference between Schoenegger and Wagner's results and Josh's and my results concerns vegetarianism.<p>\n<i>The Questions:</i><p>\n\nWe originally asked three questions about vegetarianism.  In the first part of the questionnaire, we asked respondents to rate \"regularly eating the meat of mammals, such as beef or pork\" on a nine-point scale from \"very morally bad\" to \"very morally good\", with \"morally neutral\" in the middle.<p>\n\nIn the second part of the questionnaire, we asked:<p>\n\n17.\u2003During about how many meals or snacks per week do you eat the meat of mammals such as beef or pork?<p>\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009enter number of times per week ____<p>\n\n18.\u2003Think back on your last evening meal, not including snacks. Did you eat the meat of a mammal during that meal?<p>\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003yes<p>\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003no<p>\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003don\u2019t recall<p>\n<i>U.S. Results in 2009<p></p></i>\n\nOn the attitude question, <b>60% of ethicist respondents rated meat-eating somewhere on the \"bad\" side</b> of the nine-point scale, compared to 45% of non-ethicist philosophers and only 19% of professors from other departments (ANOVA, F\u2009=\u200917.0, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001).  We also found substantial differences by both gender and age, with <b>women and younger respondents more likely to condemn meat-eating</b>.  For example, 81% of female philosophy respondents born 1960 or later rated eating the meat of mammals as morally bad, compared to 7% of male non-philosophers born before 1960.  That's a huge difference in attitude!<p>\n\nEight percent of respondents rated it at 1 or 2 on the nine-point scale -- either \"very bad\" or adjacent to very bad -- including 11% of ethicists (46/564 overall, 22/193 of ethicists).<p>\n\nOn self-report of behavior, Josh and I found much less difference.  <b>On our \"previous evening meal\" question, we detected at best a statistically marginal difference among the three main analysis groups</b>: 37% of ethicists reported having eaten meat at the previous evening meal, compared to 33% of non-ethicist philosophers and 45% of non-philosophers (chi-squared\u2009=\u20095.7, p\u2009=\u20090.06, excluding two respondents who answered \"don\u2019t recall\").<p>\n\nThe \"meals per week\" question was actually designed in part as a test of \"socially desirable responding\" or a tendency to fudge answers: We thought it would be difficult to accurately estimate the number, thus it would be tempting for respondents to fudge a bit.  And mathematically, they did seem to be guilty of fudging: For example, 21% of respondents who reported eating meat at one meal per week also reported eating meat at the previous evening meal.  Even if we assume that meat is only consumed at evening meals, the number should be closer to 14% (1/7).  If we assume, more plausibly, that approximately half of all meat meals are evening meals, then the number should be closer to 7%.  With that caveat in mind, on the meals-per-week question we found a mean of 4.1 for ethicists, compared to 4.6 for non-ethicist philosophers and 5.3 for non-philosophers (ANOVA [square-root transformed], F\u2009=\u20095.2, p\u2009=\u20090.006).<p>\n\nWe concluded that although a majority of U.S. ethicists, especially younger ethicists and women ethicists, thought eating meat was morally bad, they ate meat at approximately the same rate as did the non-ethicists.<p>\n<i>German Results in 2018:</i><p>\n\nSchoenegger and Wagner find, similarly, a majority of German ethicist respondents rating meat-eating as bad: 67%.  <b>Evidently, a majority of U.S. and German ethicists think that eating meat is morally bad.</b><p>\n<b>However, among the non-ethicist professors, Schoenegger and Wagner find higher rates of condemnation of meat-eating than Josh and I found</b>: 63% among German-speaking non-ethicist philosophers in 2018 compared to our 45% in the U.S. in 2009 (80/127 vs. 92/204, z = 3.2, p = .001), and even more strikingly 40% among German-speaking professors from departments other than philosophy in 2018 compared to only 19% in the U.S. in 2009 (52/131 vs/ 31/167, z = 4.0, p &lt; .001; [note 1]).<p>\n<b>German professors were also much more likely than U.S. professors in 2009 to think that eating meat is <i>very </i>bad, with 18% rating it 1 or 2 on the scale, including 23% of ethicists</b> (57/408 and 35/150, excluding non-respondents; two-proportion test U.S. vs German: overall z = 2.8, p = .005, ethicists z = 2.9, p = .004).<p>\n\n\nApparently, German-speaking professors are not as fond of their wurst as cultural stereotypes might suggest!<p>\n\nA number of explanations are possible: One is that in general German academics are more pro-vegetarian than are U.S. academics.  Another is that attitudes toward vegetarianism are changing swiftly over time (as suggested by the age differences in Josh's and my study) and that the nine years between 2009 and 2018 saw a substantial shift in both cultures.  Still another concerns non-response bias. (For non-philosophers, Schoenegger and Wagner's response rate was 30%, while Josh's and mine was 53%.)<p>\n\nIn Schoenegger and Wagner's data, ethicists report having eaten less meat at the previous evening meal than the other two groups: 25%, vs. 40% of non-ethicist philosophers and 39% of the non-philosophers (chi-squared = 9.3, p = .01 [note 2]).  The meals per week data are less clear.  Schoenegger report 2.1 meals per week for ethicists, compared to 2.8 and 3.0 for non-ethicist philosophers and non-philosophers respectively (ANOVA, F = 3.4, p = .03), but their data are highly right skewed, and due to skew Josh and I had used a square-root transformation for original 2009 analysis.  A similar square-root transformation on Schoenegger and Wagner's raw data eliminates any statistically detectable difference (F = 0.8, p = .45). And there is again evidence of fudging in the meals-per-week responses: Among those reporting only one meat meal per week, for example, 18% reported having had meat at their previous evening meal.<p>\n\nIf we take the meals-per-week data at face value, the German respondents ate substantially less meat in 2018 than did the U.S. respondents in 2009: 2.6 meals for the Germans vs. 4.6 for the U.S. respondents (median 2 vs median 4, Mann-Whitney W = 287793, p &lt; .001).  However, the difference was not statistically detectable on the previous evening meal question: 38% U.S. vs 34% German (z = 1.3, p = .21).<p>\n\nAll of this is a bit difficult to interpret, but here's the tentative conclusion I draw:<p>\n<b>\nGerman professors today -- especially ethicists -- are more likely to condemn meat eating than were U.S. professors ten years ago.  They might also be a bit less likely to eat meat, again perhaps especially the ethicists, though that is not entirely clear and might reflect a bit of fudging in the self-reports.</b><p>\n\nThe other difference Schoenegger and Wagner found was in the question of whether ethicists were on the whole more likely than other professors to embrace stringent moral views -- but full analysis of this will require some detail and will have to wait for another time.<p>\n\n\n*********************************************<p>\n\nNote 1: In the published paper, Schoenegger and Wagner report 39% instead of the 40% I find in reanalyzing their raw data.  This might either be a rounding error [39.69%] or some small difference in our analyses.<p>\n\nNote 2: In the published paper, Schoenegger and Wagner report 24%, which again might be a rounding error (from 24.65%) or a small analytic difference.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wurst_(Bruehwurst).jpg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rsOnRPTHCB0/XIvadESH5jI/AAAAAAAABis/XNGx0HbTky4ViTClq0hQke0Fk_1DOgLrQCLcBGAs/s1600/EthicalExperts.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"250\" data-original-width=\"250\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rsOnRPTHCB0/XIvadESH5jI/AAAAAAAABis/XNGx0HbTky4ViTClq0hQke0Fk_1DOgLrQCLcBGAs/s200/EthicalExperts.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\n\nErnest Sosa gave a lovely and fascinating talk yesterday at UC Riverside on the importance of \"firsthand intuitive insight\" in philosophy.  It has me thinking about the extent to which we ought, or ought not, defer to ethical experts when we are otherwise inclined to disagree with their conclusions.<p>\n\nTo illustrate the idea of firsthand intuitive insight, Sosa gives two examples.  One concerns mathematics.  Consider a student who learns that the Pythagorean theorem is true without learning its proof.  This student knows that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 but doesn't have any insight into <i>why </i>it's true.  Contrast this student with one who masters the proof and consequently does understand why it's true.  The second student, but not the first, has firsthand intuitive insight.  Sosa's other example is in ethics.  One child bullies another.  Her mother, seeing the act and seeing the grief in the face of the other child, tells the bullying child that she should apologize.  The child might defer to her mother's ethical judgment, sincerely concluding she really should apologize, but without understanding why what she has done is bad enough to require apology.  Alternatively, she might come to genuinely notice the other child's grief and more fully understand how her bullying was inappropriate, and thus gain firsthand intuitive insight into the need for apology.  (I worry that firsthand intuitive insight is a bit of a slippery concept, but I don't think I can do more with it here.)<p>\n<b>Sosa argues that a central aim of much of philosophy is firsthand intuitive insight of this sort.</b>  In the sciences and in history, it's often enough just to know that some fact is true (that helium has two protons, that the Qin Dynasty fell in 206 BCE).  On such matters, we happily defer to experts.  In philosophy, we're less likely to accept a truth without having our own personal, firsthand intuitive insight.  Expert metaphysicians might almost universally agree that barstool-shaped-aggregates but not barstools themselves supervene on collections of particles arranged barstoolwise.  Expert ethicists might almost universally agree that a straightforward pleasure-maximizing utilitarian ethics would require radical revision of ordinary moral judgments.  But we're not inclined to just take them at their word.  We want to understand for ourselves how it is so.<p>\n\nThis seems right.  And yet, there's a bit of a puzzle in it, if we think that it's important that our ethical opinions be <i>correct</i>.  (Yes, I'm assuming that ethics is a domain in which there are correct and incorrect opinions.)  What should we do when the majority of philosophical experts think P, but your own (apparent) firsthand intuitive insight suggests not-P?  If you care about correctness above all, maybe you should defer to the experts, despite your lack of understanding.  But Sosa appears to think, as I suspect many of us do, that often the right course instead is to stand <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disagreement/#SteaView\">steadfast</a>, continuing to judge according to your own best independent reasoning.<p>\n\nBorrowing an example from <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40658407\">Sarah McGrath's work on moral deference</a>, consider the case of vegetarianism.  Based on <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHTMB-4\">some of my work</a>, I think that probably the majority of professional ethicists in the United States believe that it is normally morally wrong to eat the meat of factory-farmed animals.  This might also be true <a href=\"https://osf.io/35r48/\">in German-speaking countries</a>.  Impressionistically, most of the philosophers I know who have given the issue serious and detailed consideration come to endorse vegetarianism, including two of the most prominent ethicists currently alive, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061711305/animal-liberation/\">Peter Singer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198753853\">Christine Korsgaard</a>.  Now suppose that you haven't given the matter nearly as much thought as they have, but you have given it some thought.  You're inclined still to think that eating meat is okay, and you can maybe mount one or two plausible-seeming defenses of your view.  Should you defer to their ethical expertise?<p>\n\nSosa compares philosophical reasoning with archery.  You not only want to hit the target (the truth), you want to do so by the exercise of your own skill (your own intuitive insight), rather than by having an expert guide your hand (deference to experts).  I agree that ideally this is so.  It's nice when you have have both truth and intuitive insight!  But when the aim of hitting the target conflicts with the aim of doing so by your own intuitive insight, your preference should depend on the stakes.  If it's an archery contest, you don't want the coach's help: The most important thing is the test of your own skill.  But if you're a subsistence hunter who needs dinner, then you probably ought to take any help you can get, if the target looks like it's about to escape.  And isn't ethics (outside the classroom, at least) more like subsistence hunting than like an archery contest?  <b>What should matter most is whether you actually come to the right moral conclusion about eating meat (or whatever) not whether you get there by your own insight.</b>  Excessive emphasis on the individual's need for intuitive insight, at the cost of truth or correctness, risks turning ethics into a kind of sport.<p>\n\nSo maybe, then, you should defer to the majority of ethical experts, and conclude that it is normally wrong to eat factory-farmed meat, even if that conclusion doesn't accord with your own best attempts at insight?<p>\n\nWhile I'm tempted to say this, I simultaneously feel pulled in Sosa's direction -- and perhaps I should defer to his expertise as one of the world's leading epistemologists!  There's something I like about non-deference in philosophy, and our prizing of people's standing fast in their own best judgments, even in the teeth of disagreement by better-informed experts.  So here are four brief defenses of non-deference.  I fear none of them is quite sufficient.  But maybe in combination they will take us somewhere?<p>\n<b>(1.) The \"experts\" might not be experts.</b>  This is McGrath's defense of non-deference in ethics.  Despite their seeming expertise, great ethicists have often been horribly wrong in the past.  See Aristotle on slavery, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html\">Kant on bastards, masturbation, homosexuality, wives, and servants</a>, the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/02/german-and-english-philosophers-in-1914.html\">consensus of philosophers in favor of World War I</a>, and ethicists' <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">seeming inability</a> to reason better even about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a> than non-ethicists.<p>\n<b>(2.) Firsthand intuitive insight might be highly intrinsically valuable.</b>  I'm a big believer in the intrinsic value of knowledge (including <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrinsicSelfK.htm\">self-knowledge</a>).  One of the most amazing and important things about life on Earth is that sometimes we bags of mostly water can stop and reflect on some of the biggest, most puzzling questions that there are.  An important component of the intrinsic value of philosophical reflection is the real understanding that comes with firsthand intuitive insight, or seeming insight, or partial insight -- our ability to reach our <i>own</i> philosophical judgments instead of simply deferring to experts.  This might be valuable enough to merit some substantial loss of ethical correctness to preserve it.<p>\n<b>(3.) The philosophical community might profit from diversity of moral opinion, even if individuals with unusual views are likely to be incorrect.</b>  The philosophical community as a whole might, over time, be more likely to converge upon correct ethical views if it fosters diversity of opinion.  If we all defer to whoever seems to be most expert, we might reach consensus too fast on a wrong, or at least a narrow and partial, ethical view.  Compare <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-Thomas-Kuhn/dp/0226458083\">Kuhn</a> and <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/4575.html\">Longino</a> on the value of diversity in scientific opinion: Intellectual communities need stubborn defenders of unlikely views, even if those stubborn folks are probably wrong -- since sometimes they have an important piece of the truth that others are missing.<p>\n<b>(4.) Proper moral motivation might require acting from one's own insight rather than from moral deference.</b>  The bully who apologizes out of deference gives, I think, a less perfect apology than the bully who has firsthand intuitive insight into the need to apologize.  Maybe in some cases, being motivated by one's own intuitive insight is so morally important that it's better to do the ethically wrong thing on the basis of your imperfect but non-deferential insight than to do the ethically right thing deferentially.<p>\n\nAs I said, none of these defenses of non-deference seems quite enough on its own.  Even if the experts <i>might </i>be wrong (Point 1), from a bird's-eye perspective it seems like our best guess should be that they're not.  And the considerations in Points 2-4 seem plausibly to be only secondary from the perspective of the person who wants really to have ethically correct views by which to guide her behavior.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ethical-experts-bloomfield-township\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Some academic disciplines have direct relevance to day-to-day life.  Studying these disciplines, you might think, would have an influence on one's practical behavior.  Studying nutritional health, it seems plausible to suppose, would have an influence of some sort on  your food choices.  Studying the stock market would likely have an influence on your investment strategies.  Studying parenting styles in developmental psychology would have an influence on your parenting decisions.  The effects might not be huge: A scholar of nutrition might not be able to entirely sacrifice Twinkies.  A scholar of parenting styles might sometimes lose her temper in ways she knows from her research to be counterproductive.  But it would be strange if studying such topics had <i>no effect whatsoever</i> -- if there were a perfect isolation between one's research on nutrition, investment, or parenting and one's personal food choices, investments, and approaches to parenting.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYjk48qxfr0/XGbygfbEuqI/AAAAAAAABdU/gekmizqHK0crGsPu_Dvhmi2gFbOXfwqMwCLcBGAs/s1600/DoctorSmokeCrop.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"407\" data-original-width=\"626\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYjk48qxfr0/XGbygfbEuqI/AAAAAAAABdU/gekmizqHK0crGsPu_Dvhmi2gFbOXfwqMwCLcBGAs/s320/DoctorSmokeCrop.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[A doctor doing what doctors <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/12/11/1167/1748983\">in fact don't do very much of</a>.]<p>\n\nOther academic topics have tenuous connections at best to practical matters of day-to-day life: studying the first second of the Big Bang, or mereological approaches to objecthood, or tortoise-shell divination in ancient China. Of course, studying such things <i>could </i>have behavioral effects.  Maybe immersion in Big Bang cosmology inspires one to a broader, less parochial worldview.  But I don't think we should particularly expect that or think something is strange if it doesn't.  It's not strange for a cosmologist to be parochial in the same way it would be for an anti-trans-fat health researcher to not attempt to reduce her own trans-fat intake.<p>\n\nEthics seems clearly to be in the category of academic disciplines that are directly relevant to scholars' day-to-day lives.  Not every sub-issue of every sub-specialization of ethics is so, of course.  Some ethical questions are highly abstract or concern matters irrelevant to the immediate choices of the scholars' lives; but few ethicists spend all of their energy on issues of that sort.  Issues like our obligations to the poor, the ethics of honesty and kindness, animal rights and environmentalism, prejudice, structural injustices in our society, the proper weighing of selfish concerns against the demands of others, the question of how much to abide by laws or directives with which you disagree -- all seem directly relevant to our lives.  It would be odd if devoting a substantial part of one's career to thinking about such issues had no influence of any sort on one's day-to-day behavior.<p>\n\nAnd yet it's not clear to me that studying ethics does have any influence on day-to-day behavior.  <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">Across a wide range of studies</a>, my collaborators and I have found no convincing evidence of systematic behavioral differences between ethicists and non-ethicists of similar social background.  Also, impressionistically, in my personal interactions with professional ethicists, my sense is that they behave overall similarly to non-ethicists.  Furthermore, there's <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsClasses.htm\">little evidence that university-level ethics classes influence students' behavior</a> either.<p>\n\nMaybe studying ethics does sometimes have a practical effect.  It would, in my mind, be stunning if studying ethics never had any influence of any sort on one's behavioral choices!  But the effects, if any, are subtle and difficult to detect empirically.<p>\n\nWhy this should be so is an underappreciated puzzle.<p>\n\nThe easiest answers -- \"academic ethics is all abstract and impractical\", \"ethics is all post-hoc rationalization of what you were going to do anyway\", \"our immoral desires are so compelling that no amount of rational thought could lead us to act otherwise\" -- don't withstand critical scrutiny as fully adequate answers (although each may have some element of truth).<p>\n\nFor several of my imperfect attempts to resolve this puzzle, see:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PowerReason.htm\">The Moral Behavior of Ethicists and the Power of Reason</a>\" (with Joshua Rust), <i>Advances in Experimental Moral Psychology</i> (ed.

One simple explanation (favored, for example, by Jon Haidt in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777\">his discussion</a> of Eric's work) is that philosophical moral reflection has little to no influence on people's moral behavior.  However, Eric and his frequent collaborator Joshua Rust have been hesitant to draw that conclusion without more empirical evidence (see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PowerReason.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">here</a> for possible alternative explanations).<p>\n\nMeanwhile, Eric's PhD student Chris was growing interested in the power of narratives to change behavior.  So we decided to collaborate on a project to compare the influence of narrative and argument on charitable giving.<p>\n<i>Design<p></p></i>\n\nFor our argument, we chose an argument constructed by philosopher Peter Singer with the aim of convincing ordinary readers to donate to charity.  The argument was originally written for a paper in draft by Luke Buckland, Matthew Lindauer, David Rodriguez-Arias, and Carissa Veliz.  (Thanks to them and to Peter Singer for sharing this argument with us.)  We supplemented Singer's argument with some additional clarificatory text.  It's a typical Singer-style argument, emphasizing that people have a duty to prevent death and suffering due to extreme poverty by donating money that they would otherwise spend on luxuries, and that our physical distance from those who are suffering does not excuse us from the obligation to help.<p>\n\nFor our narrative, we chose a true story, about the same word-length as the argument, about a family rescued from slavery by a charitable donation, which we adapted from the website of a charitable organization.<p>\n\nParticipants were 918 MTurk workers in the United States.  We divided them into four conditions: (1.) narrative only, (2.) argument only, (3.) narrative + argument, and (4.) control (who received a similar-length text from a middle-school physics textbook).  Participants were then asked to rate, on a 7-point scale, how much they agreed or disagreed with statements about the ethics of donation and their own motivation to donate (e.g., \"It is morally good to give money to charities that help those in extreme poverty\", \"Currently I feel motivated to give money to a charity that helps people in extreme poverty\").  In Experiment 1, we then asked them a hypothetical question about how much they would give to a charity if we offered them a bonus of $10.  In Experiment 2, we replaced the hypothetical-donation language with a lottery choice.  We'll report only on Experiment 2 here, but the results of Experiment 1 were very similar.<p>\n\nHere is the exact language for the lottery choice:\n<blockquote>Upon completion of this study, 10% of participants in this study will receive an additional $10. You have the option to donate some portion of this $10 to one of six well-known charities that have been shown to effectively fight suffering due to extreme poverty. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, the portion you decide to keep will appear as a bonus credited to your Mechanical Turk worker account, and the portion you decide to donate will be given to the charity you pick from the list below. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, how much of your additional $10 would you like to donate?</blockquote><p>\n\nParticipants then ticked a number on a scale from $0 to $10 in dollar intervals, indicating how much they would donate if they won the $10. \n (A big thanks to <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, especially Jon Behar, for funding this study!)<p>\n\nFinally, we asked questions designed to measure \"narrative transportation\" (i.e., how immersive and moving they found the narrative, or argument, or physics text), adapted from <a href=\"http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/the_role_of_transportation_in_the_persuasiveness_of_public_narratives.pdf\">Green and Brock 2000</a>.<p>\n\nWe thought we'd share some preliminary results.  We emphasize that these results are only preliminary.  Later, we'll want to double-check our numbers, confirm that we got the exclusions exactly right, etc.  (We have a preregistration at <a href=\"https://osf.io/\">Open Science Foundation</a>, but we haven't made it public yet.)<p>\n<i>Results<p></p></i>\n\nMean amount donated, by condition:<p>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NK7SVwP8u9c/W_LzoL_PQ1I/AAAAAAAABOU/VvH0S_R31Ak4n7gsETTXDNNgOl6alO7OACLcBGAs/s1600/MeanDonation-181119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"288\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NK7SVwP8u9c/W_LzoL_PQ1I/AAAAAAAABOU/VvH0S_R31Ak4n7gsETTXDNNgOl6alO7OACLcBGAs/s320/MeanDonation-181119.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n\n(Apologies for blurry image.  Click to enhance.  Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.)<p>\n\nStatistically, the conditions are different (ANOVA [913,3], F=4.99, p = .002).  In planned, pre-registered one-tailed t-tests, we found that the narrative and narrative+argument conditions generated more donation than the control condition (p = .02, .001) but the argument condition did not (p = .48).  Similarly in a multiple regression analysis we found that being in one of the narrative conditions (narrative only or narrative+argument) predicted donation amount but being in one of the argumentative conditions was not statistically significantly predictive.  <b>In other words, exposure to a Singer-style philosophical argument had no statistically detectable effect on charitable giving, but exposure to a narrative about a family rescued from slavery did have a detectable effect.</b>  This was also true in Experiment 1, concerning hypothetical donation.<p>\n\nThe results were even clearer for the measure of ethical opinion and motivation to donate, which was scored on a scale from 5 to 35, based on 5 questions:\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8TXqt8z9z5s/W_L55fVT4LI/AAAAAAAABOw/vXI947okp5UC89WSqOcww4kkyusTeYrKQCLcBGAs/s1600/CharityMotivation-181119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"392\" data-original-width=\"485\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8TXqt8z9z5s/W_L55fVT4LI/AAAAAAAABOw/vXI947okp5UC89WSqOcww4kkyusTeYrKQCLcBGAs/s320/CharityMotivation-181119.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n\nIt's not a huge effect size -- about 2 points on the scale -- but it's easier to see how the results for argument and control are similar to each other and different from the results for narrative and narrative+argument, which are also similar to each other (ANOVA [913,3], F=10.8, p &lt; .001; one-tailed t vs. control condition: argument p = .71, narrative p &lt; .001, nar+arg p &lt; .001). \n Similarly to the lottery donation results, a regression analysis of reported motivation and moral opinion finds being in a narrative condition predictive and being in an argument condition non-predictive.<p>\n\nAs expected, we also found that participants reported more narrative transportation in the narrative and narrative+argument conditions than in the other conditions (ANOVA, p &lt; .001) and that narrative transport, amount given, and motivation to give were mutually correlated (transport-amount given, r = .24; transport-motivation, r = .40, motivation-amount given, r = .50; all p's &lt; .001).<p>\n<i>Conclusion<p></p></i>\n<b>We regard this as preliminary evidence that exposure to at least one type of narrative influences charitable giving, motivation, and opinion, while exposure to one common type of philosophical argument has little if any influence.</b><p>\n\nIn our teaching, we also seem to find that Singer-style arguments have little effect on moral opinion or motivation to donate.  In another series of studies (collaborative with Peter Singer and Brad Cokelet), which we hope to be able to report on soon, professors and TAs at UC Riverside taught lower-division philosophy students philosophical arguments for charitable donation and for vegetarianism.  In subsequent questionnaires, students' self-reported attitudes toward charity don't appear to have been much influenced by the arguments, but their self-reported attitudes toward vegetarianism do appear to have been influenced.<p>\n\nThis is not to deny that <i>some</i> people are influenced to donate by Singer's arguments.  Eric believes that he has been, for example.  But the effect might be weak or uncommon or not effectively produced by brief exposures.<p>\n\nIn follow-up research, we plan to see if we find similar results with different types of arguments and narratives, and we hope to zero in on what underlying factors are at work behind these effects.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><i>Teaching Hitler</i><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Umxfp5RawNw/W8fdYuwKQ_I/AAAAAAAABJE/gLfAyivrnKAAk9uIBEiUi-aw63WW4xcmgCLcBGAs/s1600/Mein_Kampf_dust_jacket.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"681\" data-original-width=\"617\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Umxfp5RawNw/W8fdYuwKQ_I/AAAAAAAABJE/gLfAyivrnKAAk9uIBEiUi-aw63WW4xcmgCLcBGAs/s200/Mein_Kampf_dust_jacket.jpeg\" width=\"181\"/></a></div><p>\n\nAbout once a year, I teach a giant lower division class called \"Evil\", focused on the moral psychology of evil.  (This year, I have 420 students enrolled.)  We do a segment on the Holocaust, in which I assign Elie Wiesel, Hannah Arendt, Daniel Goldhagen, Ervin Staub, <i>Schindler's List</i>, and selections from <i>Mein Kampf</i>.<p>\n<b>I don't think we can properly understand the psychology of the Holocaust without understanding why ordinary Germans of the period found Hitler attractive.</b>  Hitler's attraction to ordinary Germans is incomprehensible if we see him through the usual lens of his presentation in U.S. culture.  I ask my students to read <i>Mein Kampf</i> so that we can see Hitler in his own words, and to try to understand the vision of the world that he presented to his followers.  I hope and assume, as I emphasize in lecture, that none of my hundreds of students finds <i>Mein Kampf</i> <i>too </i>attractive.  (Students who find the reading too repulsive to bear are permitted to choose an alternative reading.)<p>\n<b>One fascinating aspect of <i>Mein Kampf</i> is that Hitler makes an <i>ethical </i>case for the extermination of the Jews and the Poles.</b>  He argues that races of people differ genetically, and that we ought to expect some races to be genetically superior to others.  The \"Aryan\" race -- basically, White people especially from northwestern Europe, but the ancient Greeks and Romans too -- he argues, can be seen to be superior to other races because of their cultural and military achievements (the Parthenon, Beethoven, the Roman Empire, the conquest of the Americas, etc.).<p>\n<b>This \"Aryan\" superiority partly consists in their willingness to subordinate their interests to the greater good of the state.</b>  In <i>Mein Kampf</i> and, even more vividly in his speeches, Hitler appears to be at his most frighteningly \"inspiring\" when he praises ordinary Germans' willingness to become heroes, ready to sacrifice everything for the greater good of their nation.  (If you'll forgive the comparison, I am reminded of John F. Kennedy's remark, which many people in the U.S. have found inspiring, \"Ask not what your country can do for you \u2013 ask what you can do for your country.\").<p>\n\nHitler embraces a broadly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism\">Malthusian</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer\">Spencerian</a> vision of populations of humans destined to fight each other: Each nation or race will breed too many people to share the planet.  The natural and desirable consequence of this inevitable fight, Hitler argues, is that the stronger races will defeat the weaker races.  They will thus bequeath better genes or \"blood\" to subsequent generations than would happen if weaker races were permitted to reproduce at the same rate as stronger races.<p>\n\nFrom all of this, it follows, on Hitler's thinking, that it is the moral duty of \"Aryans\" to exterminate the Jews and other inferior races and also to invade nearby lands (esp. Poland), killing or displacing the inferior people there, so that healthy, fertile Germans will have room to expand and grow the population.  <b>Short-term bloodshed and suffering will ensure the flourishing of future races of superior human beings!  Every good German must stand ready to sacrifice for this great goal!</b>  One can see how such thinking might have been attractive to a certain sort of racist.<p>\n\nHitler was quite clear about all of this in <i>Mein Kampf</i>, of which about ten million copies were distributed in Germany.  He even gives political advice for how to most effectively implement genocide.  I do not think that Germans of the era can plausibly say that they were unaware of his violent eugenic plans.<p>\n<i>And My Neighbor's Attitude About the Holocaust</i><p>\n\nI do not think many people today would endorse such violent eugenic thinking -- but neither do I think that Hitler's reasoning is <i>so</i> alien that we cannot still hear echoes of it.<p>\n\nLast week, I flew to St. Louis to give a series of talks.  On the first leg of my flight, I ended up sitting next to a woman and man who lived in the neighborhood just south of mine in Riverside, California, near where my daughter attends school.  After finding out that I was a philosophy professor at U.C. Riverside, they asked me what I thought of politics in the U.S. today.  I said something about the value of listening across the political divide and respecting facts.<p>\n\nThe woman sitting next to me then launched into political conversation with me, and it became clear that she identified with the political right.  Despite her earlier approval of the value of listening, she seemed more interested in speaking than in hearing my perspective.  At one point I mentioned that I teach a class called Evil and that we were about to start the segment on the Holocaust.<p>\n<b>My seatmate said, \"I do think there was a reason that Hitler chose to exterminate the Jews.  Of all the people he could have chosen, he went after the Jews.\"</b>  She added something about Jews being rich lawyers and bankers.  \"It was all predicted two thousand years ago,\" she added.<p>\n\nI was stunned for a moment, and then she changed the topic and our conversation moved on.  In retrospect, I imagine many things I could have said in response; but I said none of them.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mein_Kampf_dust_jacket.jpeg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/2018/09/11/guest-post-eric-schwitzgebel-gives-one-point-five-cheers-for-a-hugo-award-for-a-tv-show-about-ethicists-moral-expertise/\">cross-posted</a> at <a href=\"http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/\">Kittywumpus</a>]<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5nZsAbBSKk/W5lddWu-TcI/AAAAAAAABEQ/Q8yWEODkRsMDE9FM8HuevArrfQN3wrEYQCLcBGAs/s1600/GoodTrolleyProblem.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5nZsAbBSKk/W5lddWu-TcI/AAAAAAAABEQ/Q8yWEODkRsMDE9FM8HuevArrfQN3wrEYQCLcBGAs/s320/GoodTrolleyProblem.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n\nWhen <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6951978/\"><i>The Good Place</i> episode \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</a> won one of science fiction\u2019s most prestigious awards, the Hugo, in the category of best dramatic presentation, short form, I celebrated. I celebrated not because I loved the episode (in fact, I had so far only seen a couple of The Good Place\u2019s earlier episodes) but because, as a philosophy professor aiming to build bridges between academic philosophy and popular science fiction, the awarding of a Hugo to a show starring a professor of philosophy discussing a famous philosophical problem seemed to confirm that science fiction fans see some of the same synergies I see between science fiction and philosophy.<p>\n\nI do think the synergies are there and that the fans see and value them \u2013 as also revealed by the enduring popularity of The Matrix, and by West World, and Her, and Black Mirror, among others \u2013 but \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d, considered as a free-standing episode, fumbles the job. (Below, I will suggest a twist by which The Good Place could redeem itself in later episodes.)<p>\n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to be fussy when maybe I should just cheer and praise. And I\u2019m going to take the episode more philosophically seriously than maybe I should, treating it as not just light humor. But taking good science fiction philosophically seriously is important to me \u2013 and that means engaging critically. So here we go.<p>\n<i>The Philosophical Trolley Problem</i><p>\n\nThe trolley problem \u2013 the classic academic philosophy version of the trolley problem \u2013 concerns a pair of scenarios.<p>\n\nIn one scenario, the Switch case, you are standing beside a railroad track watching a runaway railcar (or \u201ctrolley\u201d) headed toward five people it will surely kill if you do nothing. You are standing by a switch, however, and you can flip the switch to divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. Unfortunately, there is one person on the side track who will be killed if you divert the trolley. Question: Should you flip the switch?<p>\n\nIn another scenario, the Push case, you are standing on a footbridge when you see the runaway railcar headed toward the five people. In this case, there is no switch. You do, however, happen to be standing beside a hiker with a heavy backpack, who you could push off the bridge into the path of the trolley, which will then grind to a halt on his body, killing him and saving the five. (You are too light to stop the trolley with your own body.) He is leaning over the railing, heedless of you, so you could just push him over. Question: Should you push the hiker?<p>\n\nThe interesting thing about these problems is that most people say it\u2019s okay to flip the switch in Switch but not okay to push the hiker in Push, despite the fact that in both cases you appear to be killing one person to save five. Is there really a meaningful difference between the cases? If so, what is it? Or are our ordinary intuitions about one or the other case wrong?<p>\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely puzzle, much, much debated in academic philosophy, often with intricate variations on the cases. (Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">one of my papers about it</a>.)<p>\n<i>The Problem with \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\n\u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d episode nicely sets up some basic trolley scenarios, adding also a medical case of killing one to save five (an involuntary organ donor). The philosophy professor character, Chidi, is teaching the material to the other characters.<p>\n\nSpoilers coming.<p>\n\nThe episode stumbles by trying to do two conflicting things.<p>\n\nFirst, it seizes the trope of the philosophy professor who can\u2019t put his theories into practice. The demon Michael sets up a simulated trolley, headed toward five victims, with Chidi at the helm. Chidi is called on to make a fast decision. He hesitates, agonizing, and crashes into the five. Micheal reruns the scenario with several variations, and it\u2019s clear that Chidi, faced with a practical decision requiring swift action, can\u2019t actually figure out what\u2019s best. (However, Chidi is clear that he wouldn\u2019t cut up a healthy patient in an involuntary organ donor case.)<p>\n\nSecond, incompatibly, the episode wants to affirm Chidi\u2019s moral expertise. Michael, the demon who enjoys torturing humans, can\u2019t seem to take Chidi\u2019s philosophy lessons seriously, despite Chidi\u2019s great knowledge of ethics. Michael tries to win Chidi\u2019s favor by giving him a previously unseen notebook of Kant\u2019s, but Chidi, with integrity that I suppose the viewer is expected to find admirable, casts the notebook aside, seeing it as a bribe. What Chidi really wants is for Michael to recognize his moral expertise. At the climax of the episode, Michael seems to do just this, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.</blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from within the episode whether we are supposed to regard Michael as sincere. Maybe not. Regardless, the viewer is invited to think that it\u2019s what Michael should say, what his attitude should be \u2013 and Chidi accepts the apology.<p>\n\nBut this resolution hardly fits with Chidi\u2019s failure in actual ethical decision making in the moment (a vice he also reveals in other episodes). Chidi has abstract, theoretical knowledge about ethical quandaries such as the trolley problem, and he is in some ways the most morally admirable of the lead characters, but his failure in vividly simulated trolley cases casts his practical ethical expertise into doubt. Nothing in the episode satisfactorily resolves that practical challenge to Chidi\u2019s expertise, pro or con.<p>\n<i>Ethical Expertise?</i><p>\n\nNow, as it happens, I am the world\u2019s leading expert on the ethical behavior of professional ethicists. (Yes, really. Admittedly, the <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">competition is limited</a>.)<p>\n\nThe one thing that shows most clearly from my and others\u2019 work on this topic, and which is anyway pretty evident if you spend much time around professional ethicists, is that ethicists, on average, behave more or less similarly to other people of similar social background \u2013 not especially better, not especially worse. From the fact that Chidi is a professor of ethics, nothing in particular follows about his moral behavior. Often, indeed, expertise in philosophical ethics appears to become expertise in constructing <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">post-hoc intellectual rationales for what you were inclined to do anyway</a>.<p>\n\nI hope you will agree with me about the following, concerning the philosophy of philosophy: Real ethical understanding is not a matter of what words you speak in classroom moments. It\u2019s a matter of what you choose and what you do habitually, regardless of whether you can tell your friends a handsome story about it, grounded in your knowledge of Kant. It\u2019s not clear that Chidi does have especially good ethical understanding in this practical sense. Moreover, to the extent Chidi does have some such practical ethical understanding, as a somewhat morally admirable person, it is not in virtue of his knowledge of Kant.<p>\n\nMichael should not be so deferential to Chidi\u2019s expertise, and especially he should not be deferential on the basis of Chidi\u2019s training as a philosopher. If, over the seasons, the characters improve morally, it is, or should be, because they learn from the practical situations they find themselves in, not because of Chidi\u2019s theoretical lessons.<p>\n<i>How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\nThus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics).<p>\n\nWhen the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.overthinkingit.com/2017/10/23/the-good-place-unlocked-season-2-episode-6-the-trolley-problem/\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Update, October 21, 2018:</i><p>\n\nWisecrack has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds\">terrific treatment of the philosophy of <i>The Good Place</i></a>, revealing that the show has a more nuanced view of the role of ethics lessons than one might infer from treating \"The Trolley Problem\" as a stand-alone work.

(Of course, this might not be among your aims.)<p>\n\n(This post was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/janet.stemwedel/posts/10155146470001710\">Janet Stemwedel's Facebook/Twitter post</a> about students cheating in her ethics class, and subsequent discussion.)<p>\n<b>1. Creating the appearance that every pro has an equally good con.</b> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Postures_of_the_Mind.html?id=WjxRAAAAYAAJ\">Annette Baier</a> is among those who have emphasized this risk.  A typical philosophical teaching style is to present both sides of every major topic discussed, in a more-or-less even-handed way.  We tell students that they are welcome to defend either the pro or the con, and we encourage contrarian students who challenge the reasoning and conclusions of the assigned authors.  This even-handed debate-like format might lead some students to think that, in ethical reasoning, there are no right or wrong answers to be found, just interminable back and forth.  Probably this attitude will have little effect on students' practical choices outside of the classroom; but if it does have an effect, it might be to weaken their sense that ethical principles that they might otherwise have acted on are as sound and indisputable as they would previously have thought.<p>\n<b>2. Improving one's skill at moral rationalization.</b>  Suppose you want to do X -- <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsBooks.htm\">steal a library book</a>, for example.  Of course, you wouldn't do that.  It's wrong!  But wait.  Remember that ethics class you took?  Maybe you can construct a utilitarian defense of stealing the book.  No one would miss it that much, and you'd benefit greatly from keeping it.  The institution has much more money than you do, and can easily replace it.  Stealing the book would maximize human happiness!  (Especially yours.)  Such reasoning is <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">rationalization, in the pejorative sense of that term</a>, if your reasoning is basically just a biased search for reasons in support of the self-serving conclusion you'd like to reach.  If you're tempted to do something morally wrong, skill at philosophical reasoning, and knowledge of a diverse range of possibly relevant moral principles, might enable you to better construct superficially attractive arguments that free you to feel okay doing the bad thing that you might otherwise have unreflectively avoided.<p>\n<b>3. Giving the sense that unethical behavior is pervasive.</b>  I've argued that people mostly aim for <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">moral mediocrity</a>.  They aim, that is, not to be morally good by absolute standards but rather to be about as morally good as their peers, not especially better, not especially worse.  If so, then changes in your perception of what is typical behavior among your peers can cause you to calibrate your own behavior up or down.  If most people litter, or cheat, or selfishly screw over their co-workers, then it doesn't seem so bad if you do too, at least a little.  (Conversely, if you learn that almost everyone around you is honorable and true, that can inspire you not to want to be the one schmuck.)  Some ethics classes, perhaps especially business ethics classes, focus on case studies of grossly unethical behavior.  This company did this bad thing, this other company did this other bad thing, still another company did this other horrible thing....  Without a complementary range of inspirational examples of morally laudable behavior by other companies, students might get the sense that the world is even fuller of malfeasance than they had previously thought, leading them to calibrate their sense of mediocrity down.  If so many other people do so many bad things, then it hardly matters (perhaps even it's only fair) if I fudge a bit on my expense report.<p>\n\nDo ethics classes actually have any of these backfire effects?  I think we really have no idea.  The issue remains almost entirely unstudied in any rigorous, empirical way.<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2013/09/15\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"568\" data-original-width=\"839\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ly8zy3LKXlM/WuHxUhBPpdI/AAAAAAAAAzI/dzOLwsTNbFcLy_v6G_f97QcBsIjd69irwCLcBGAs/s400/CalvinHobbesCheating.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2013/09/15\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[Note: Somehow two different versions of this post went up.  Slightly updated version <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/engaging-with-evil-art-riefenstahls.html\">here</a>.]\n\nLast term, some grad students and I read Berys Gaut's book <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/art-emotion-and-ethics-9780199263219?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Art, Emotion, and Ethics.</a>  Gaut argues that although some morally noxious works of art have aesthetic merit, they never have aesthetic merit <i>in virtue of</i> their moral defects.  If an ethically flawed work is aesthetically good, it is good <i>despite </i>that flaw, not because of the flaw.<p>\n\nI find myself inclined to disagree.  Sometimes art is more thought-provoking, or more challenging or horrifying, because of its moral defects -- thought-provoking, challenging, or horrifying in ways that make the work more engaging, giving the work a kind of aesthetic interest in virtue of its moral terribleness.<p>\n\nBefore I offer examples, two caveats:<p>\n\n(1.) In praising the aesthetic merits that morally noxious artworks sometimes have in virtue of that very noxiousness, I <i>don't</i> commit to the view that being thought-provokingly morally awful outweighs other considerations.  Some of these works should be overall condemned.  Even just appreciating them aesthetically might be overall inappropriate, despite their merits.  And the world might be better off had the works never been produced.<p>\n\n(2.) I am (like Gaut) assuming pluralism about aesthetic value.  Aesthetic value does not reduce entirely to beauty, for example.  Being thought-provoking, challenging, or frightening can be (though it isn't always) as aesthetic merit in a work -- can be part of what makes a work aesthetically valuable.<p>\n\nTwo examples I've given some thought to are both films: Leni Riefenstahl's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Will\">Triumph of the Will</a> and Woody Allen's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097123/\">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>.<p>\n\nRiefenstahl and Allen are of course both morally flawed people themselves: Riefenstahl a Nazi propagandist, Allen plausibly accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with minors, including in his own family.  The moral noxiousness of their work might flow in part from their own personal ethical flaws -- but I don't want to rely on such biographical facts in evaluating the works.  I discuss their work with considerable trepidation, because of the electricity of discussions of Nazism and of sexual abuse.  Let me be clear that I will not be saying that their work is good <i>despite </i>its moral awfulness, as though we could simply bracket moral issues in aesthetic discussions.  Instead, my view is that it is the moral awfulness itself that makes these otherwise not-so-great films interestingly distressing to contemplate.<p>\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-va--ECcjil0/Wp8optP-inI/AAAAAAAAB24/qCGqj7pT9yg3gQgSKNmbyd-rnuHBszZDgCLcBGAs/s1600/Riefenstahl.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1129\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-va--ECcjil0/Wp8optP-inI/AAAAAAAAB24/qCGqj7pT9yg3gQgSKNmbyd-rnuHBszZDgCLcBGAs/s400/Riefenstahl.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7aRpe7KSFuI/Wo3TwNHJzfI/AAAAAAAAAsU/2yvnMif_flIfUGRluBMYwVpt4-L9a0kLQCLcBGAs/s1600/J%2Bellis.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"200\" data-original-width=\"300\" height=\"133\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7aRpe7KSFuI/Wo3TwNHJzfI/AAAAAAAAAsU/2yvnMif_flIfUGRluBMYwVpt4-L9a0kLQCLcBGAs/s200/J%2Bellis.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\n(with <a href=\"https://jonathanellis.sites.ucsc.edu/\">Jonathan E. Ellis</a>; originally appeared at the <a href=\"http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\">Imperfect Cognitions blog</a>)<p>\n\nLast week we <a href=\"http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence_13.html\">argued</a> that your intelligence, vigilance, and academic expertise very likely doesn't do much to protect you from the normal human tendency towards rationalization \u2013 that is, from the tendency to engage in biased patterns of reasoning aimed at justifying conclusions to which you are attracted for selfish or other epistemically irrelevant reasons \u2013 and that, in fact, you may be more susceptible to rationalization than the rest of the population. This week we\u2019ll argue that moral and philosophical topics are especially fertile grounds for rationalization.<p>\n\nHere\u2019s one way of thinking about it: Rationalization, like crime, requires a motive and an opportunity. Ethics and philosophy provide plenty of both.<p>\n\nRegarding motive: Not everyone cares about every moral and philosophical issue of course. But we all have some moral and philosophical issues that are near to our hearts \u2013 for reasons of cultural or religious identity, or personal self-conception, or for self-serving reasons, or because it\u2019s comfortable, exciting, or otherwise appealing to see the world in a certain way.<p>\n\nOn day one of their philosophy classes, students are often already attracted to certain types of views and repulsed by others. They like the traditional and conservative, or they prefer the rebellious and exploratory; they like confirmations of certainty and order, or they prefer the chaotic and skeptical; they like moderation and common sense, or they prefer the excitement of the radical and unintuitive. Some positions fit with their pre-existing cultural and political identities better than others. Some positions are favored by their teachers and elders \u2013 and that\u2019s attractive to some, and provokes rebellious contrarianism in others. Some moral conclusions may be attractively convenient, while others might require unpleasant contrition or behavior change. <p>\n\nThe motive is there. So is the opportunity. Philosophical and moral questions rarely admit of straightforward proof or refutation, or a clear standard of correctness. Instead, they open into a complexity of considerations, which themselves do not admit of straightforward proof and which offer many loci for rationalization.<p>\n\nThese loci are so plentiful and diverse! Moral and philosophical arguments, for instance, often turn crucially on a \u201csense of plausibility\u201d (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-4975.00010\">Kornblith, 1999</a>); or on one\u2019s judgment of the force of a particular reason, or the significance of a consideration. Methodological judgments are likewise fundamental in philosophical and moral thinking: What argumentative tacks should you first explore? How much critical attention should you pay to your pre-theoretic beliefs, and their sources, and which ones, in which respects? How much should you trust your intuitive judgments versus more explicitly reasoned responses? Which other philosophers, and which scientists (if any), should you regard as authorities whose judgments carry weight with you, and on which topics, and how much?<p>\n\nThese questions are usually answered only implicitly, revealed in your choices about what to believe and what to doubt, what to read, what to take seriously and what to set aside. Even where they are answered explicitly, they lack a clear set of criteria by which to answer them definitively. And so, if people\u2019s preferences can influence their perceptual judgments (including possibly of size, color, and distance: Balcetis and Dunning <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014288\">2006</a>, <a href=\"https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/cognitive-dissonance-and-the-perception-of-natural-environments\">2007</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20424036\">2010</a>) what is remembered (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2270237\">Kunda 1990</a>; <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6983.html\">Mele 2001</a>), what hypotheses are envisioned (<a href=\"https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/social-hypothesis-testing-cognitive-and-motivational-mechanisms\">Trope and Liberman 1997</a>), what one attends to and for how long (<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.1743&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Lord et al. 1979</a>; <a href=\"http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/nickersonConfirmationBias.pdf\">Nickerson 1998</a>) . . . it is no leap to assume that they can influence the myriad implicit judgments, intuitions, and choices involved in moral and philosophical reasoning.<p>\n\nFurthermore, patterns of bias can compound across several questions, so that with many loci for bias to enter, the person who is only slightly biased in each of a variety of junctures in a line of reasoning can ultimately come to a very different conclusion than would someone who was not biased in the same way. Rationalization can operate by way of a series or network of \u201cmicro-instances\u201d of motivated reasoning that together have a major amplificatory effect (synchronically, diachronically, or both), or by influencing you mightily at a crucial step (Ellis, manuscript). <p>\n\nWe believe that these considerations, taken together with the considerations we advanced last week about the likely inability of intelligence, vigilance, and expertise to effectively protect us against rationalization, support the following conclusion: Few if any of us should confidently maintain that our moral and philosophical reasoning is not substantially tainted by significant, epistemically troubling degrees of rationalization. This is of course one possible explanation of the seeming intractability of philosophical disagreement.<p>\n\nOr perhaps we the authors of the post are the ones rationalizing; perhaps we are, for some reason, drawn toward a certain type of pessimism about the rationality of philosophers, and we have sought and evaluated evidence and arguments toward this conclusion in a badly biased manner? Um\u2026. No way. We have reviewed our reasoning and are sure that we were not affected by our preferences....<p>\n\nFor our full-length paper on this topic, see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oKrs9YZ-N3I/Wo3TdMGqNvI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/x8DAvH06NfETav___ZJhiTsJpRBG4rePgCLcBGAs/s1600/J%2Bellis.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"200\" data-original-width=\"300\" height=\"133\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oKrs9YZ-N3I/Wo3TdMGqNvI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/x8DAvH06NfETav___ZJhiTsJpRBG4rePgCLcBGAs/s200/J%2Bellis.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\n(with <a href=\"https://jonathanellis.sites.ucsc.edu/\">Jonathan E. Ellis</a>; originally appeared at the <a href=\"http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence_13.html\">Imperfect Cognitions blog</a>)<p>\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there. You\u2019re arguing with someone \u2013 about politics, or a policy at work, or about whose turn it is to do the dishes \u2013 and they keep finding all kinds of self-serving justifications for their view. When one of their arguments is defeated, rather than rethinking their position they just leap to another argument, then maybe another. They\u2019re rationalizing \u2013coming up with convenient defenses for what they want to believe, rather than responding even-handedly to the points you're making. You try to point it out, but they deny it, and dig in more.<p>\n\nMore formally, in recent work we have defined rationalization as what occurs when a person favors a particular view as a result of some factor (such as self-interest) that is of little justificatory epistemic relevance, and then engages in a biased search for and evaluation of justifications that would seem to support that favored view.<p>\n\nYou, of course, never rationalize in this way! Or, rather, it doesn\u2019t usually feel like you do. Stepping back, you\u2019ll probably admit you do it sometimes. But maybe less than average? After all, you\u2019re a philosopher, a psychologist, an expert in reasoning \u2013 or at least someone who reads blog posts about philosophy, psychology, and reasoning. You're especially committed to the promotion of critical thinking and fair-minded reasoning. You know about all sorts of common fallacies, and especially rationalization, and are on guard for them in your own thinking. Don't these facts about you make you less susceptible to rationalization than people with less academic intelligence, vigilance, and expertise?<p>\n\nWe argue that no. You\u2019re probably just as susceptible to post-hoc rationalization, maybe even more, than the rest of the population, though the ways it manifests in your reasoning may be different. Vigilance, academic intelligence, and disciplinary expertise are not overall protective against rationalization. In some cases, they might even enhance one\u2019s tendency to rationalize, or make rationalizations more severe when they occur.<p>\n\nWhile some biases are less prevalent among those who score high on standard measures of academic intelligence, others appear to be no less frequent or powerful. <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721413480174\">Stanovich, West and Toplak (2013)</a>, reviewing several studies, find that the degree of myside bias is largely independent of measures of intelligence and cognitive ability. Dan Kahan finds that on several measures people who use more \u201cSystem 2\u201d type explicit reasoning show higher rates of motivated cognition rather than lower rates (<a href=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/2011/11/neutral-principles-motivated-cognition-and-some-problems-for-constitutional-law/\">2011</a>, <a href=\"http://journal.sjdm.org/13/13313/jdm13313.pdf\">2013</a>, <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1871503\">Kahan et al 2011</a>). Thinkers who are more knowledgeable have more facts to choose from when constructing a line of motivated reasoning (<a href=\"https://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/AJPS-2006-Taber.pdf\">Taber and Lodge 2006</a>; <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrn6c\">Braman 2009</a>). <p>\n\n\nNor does disciplinary expertise appear to be protective. For instance, Schwitzgebel and Cushman (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">2015</a>) presented moral dilemma scenarios to professional philosophers and comparison groups of non-philosophers, followed by the opportunity to endorse or reject various moral principles. Professional philosophers were just as prone to irrational order effects and framing effects as were the other groups, and were also at least as likely to \u201crationalize\u201d their manipulated scenario judgments by appealing to principles post-hoc in a way that would render those manipulated judgments rational. <p>\n\nFurthermore, since the mechanisms responsible for rationalization are largely non-conscious, vigilant introspection is not liable to reveal to the introspector that rationalization has occured. This may be one reason for the \u201cbias blind spot\u201d: People tend to regard themselves as less biased than others, sometimes even exhibiting more bias by objective measures the less biased they believe themselves to be (<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.576.6754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pronin, Gilovich and Ross 2004</a>; <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.576.6754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Uhlmann and Cohen 2005</a>). Indeed, efforts to reduce bias and be vigilant can amplify bias. You examine your reasoning for bias, find no bias because of your bias blind spot, and then inflate your confidence that your reasoning is not biased: \u201cI really am being completely objective and reasonable!\u201d (as suggested in <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167204271570\">Erhlinger, Gilovich and Ross 2005</a>). People with high estimates of their objectivity might also be less likely to take protective measures against bias (<a href=\"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096\">Scopeletti et al 2015</a>).<p>\n\nPartisan reasoning can be invisible to vigilant introspection for another reason: it need not occur in one fell swoop, at a sole moment or a particular inference. Rather, it can be the result of a series or network of \u201cmicro-instances\u201d of motivated reasoning (Ellis, manuscript). Celebrated cases of motivated reasoning typically involve a person whose evidence clearly points to one thing (that it\u2019s their turn, not yours, to do the dishes) but who believes the very opposite (that it\u2019s your turn). But motives can have much subtler consequences.<p>\n\nMany judgments admit of degrees, and motives can have impacts of small degree. They can affect the likelihood you assign to an outcome, or the confidence you place in a belief, or the reliability you attribute to a source of information, or the threshold for cognitive action (e.g., what would trigger your pursuit of an objection). They can affect these things in large or very small ways.<p>\n\nSuch micro-instances (you might call it motivated reasoning lite) can have significant amplificatory effects. This can happen over time, in a linear fashion. Or it can happen synchronically, spread over lots of assumptions, presuppositions, and dispositions. Or both. If introspection doesn't reveal motivated reasoning that happens in one fell swoop, micro-instances are liable to be even more elusive.<p>\n\nThis is another reason for the sobering fact that well-meaning epistemic vigilance cannot be trusted to preempt or detect rationalization. Indeed, people who care most about reasoning, or who have a high \u201c<a href=\"http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/ncs/\">need for cognition</a>\u201d, or who attend to their cognitions most responsibly, may be the most impacted of all. Their learned ability to avoid the more obvious types of reasoning errors may naturally come with cognitive tools that enable more sophisticated, but still unnoticed, rationalization. <p>\n\nComing tomorrow: <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\">Why Moral and Philosophical Disagreements Are Especially Fertile Grounds for Rationalization</a>.<p>\n\nFull length article on the topic <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I7a5lvffOqo/Wk6Ddydd03I/AAAAAAAAAnI/iCFifw0PeNULYakrqAukEZYmk0EGWvbEwCLcBGAs/s1600/menciusA.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"264\" data-original-width=\"250\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I7a5lvffOqo/Wk6Ddydd03I/AAAAAAAAAnI/iCFifw0PeNULYakrqAukEZYmk0EGWvbEwCLcBGAs/s1600/menciusA.jpg\"/></a></div><p>\n\nA favorite passage of mine from Mengzi (Mencius) is this one:<p>\n<blockquote>\nThat which people are capable of without learning is their genuine capability.  That which they know without pondering is their genuine knowledge.  Among babes in arms there are none that do not know to love their parents.  When they grow older, there are non that do not know to revere their elder brothers.  Treating one's parents as parents is benevolence.  Revering one's elders is righteousness.  There is nothing else to do but extend these to the world (7A15, Van Norden trans.)\n</blockquote><p>\n\nOne thing I like about this passage is that it assumes love and reverence for one's family as a given, rather than as a special achievement, portraying moral development as a matter of extending that natural love and reverence to new targets.<p>\n\nSimilarly, in passage 1A7, Mengzi notes the kindness that the vicious ruler King Xuan exhibits in saving a frightened ox from slaughter, and he urges King Xuan to extend similar kindness to the people of his kingdom.  Mengzi says that such extension is a matter of \"weighing\" things correctly -- a matter of treating similar things similarly and not overvaluing what merely happens to be nearby.<p>\n\nContrast this approach with \"The Golden Rule\": \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you\".  Contrast it also with the common advice to imagine yourself in someone else's shoes.  Golden Rule / others' shoes advice assumes self-interest as the starting point.  While Mengzian extension starts by assuming that people are already concerned about nearby others, and takes the developmental or cognitive challenge to be extending your concern beyond a narrow circle, The Golden Rule / others' shoes thinking starts by assuming egoistic self-interest, and takes the developmental or cognitive challenge to be generalizing beyond one's own self-interest.<p>\n\nMaybe we can model Golden Rule / others' shoes thinking as follows:<p>\n\n(1.) If I were in the situation of Person X, I would want to be treated according to Principle P.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I've been working on this essay off and on for years, \"Aiming for Moral Mediocrity\".  I think I've finally pounded it into circulating shape and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">I'm ready for feedback</a>.<p>\n\nI have an empirical thesis and a normative thesis.  The empirical thesis is that <b>most people aim to be <i>morally mediocre</i></b>.  They aim to be about as morally good as their peers, not especially better, not especially worse.  This mediocrity has two aspects.  It is peer-relative rather than absolute, and it is middling rather than extreme.  We do not aim to be good, or non-bad, or to act permissibly rather than impermissibly, by fixed moral standards.  Rather, we notice the typical behavior of people we regard as our peers and we aim to behave broadly within that range.  We -- most of us -- look around, notice how others are acting, then calibrate toward so-so.<p>\n\nThis empirical thesis is, I think, plausible on the face of it.  It also receives some support from two recent subliteratures in social psychology and behavioral economics.<p>\n\nOne is the literature on <i>following the (im-)moral crowd</i>.  I'm thinking especially of the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini\">Robert B. Cialdini</a> and <a href=\"https://philosophy.sas.upenn.edu/people/cristina-bicchieri\">Cristina Bicchieri</a>.  Cialdini argues that \"injunctive norms\" (that is, social or moral admonitions) most effectively promote norm-compliant behavior when they align with \"descriptive norms\" (that is, facts about how people actually behave).  People are <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prestos/Downloads/DC/pdfs/Krupka_Oct13_Cialdinietal1990.pdf\">less likely to litter</a> when they see others being neat, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/586910\">more likely to reuse their hotel towels</a> when they learn that others also do so, and <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x\">more likely to reduce their household energy consumption</a> when they see that they are using more than their neighbors.  Bicchieri argues that people are <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.621/abstract\">more likely to be selfish in \"dictator games\"</a> when they are led to believe that earlier participants had mostly been selfish and that <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/norms-in-the-wild-9780190622053?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">convincing communities to adopt new health practices</a> like family planning and indoor toilet use typically requires persuading people that their neighbors will also comply.  It appears that <b>people are more likely to abide by social or moral norms if they believe that others are also doing so.</b><p>\n\nThe other relevant literature concerns <i>moral self-licensing</i>.  A number of studies suggest that after having performed good acts, people are likely to behave less morally well than after performing a bad or neutral act.  For example, <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610363538\">after having done something good for the environment</a>, people might tend to make more selfish choices in a dictator game.  Even just recalling recent ethical behavior might <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21402752\">reduce people's intentions to donate blood, money, and time</a>.  The idea is that people are more motivated to behave well when their previous bad behavior is salient and less motivated to behave well when their previous good behavior is salient.  They appear to calibrate toward some middle state.<p>\n\nOne alternative hypothesis is that people aim not for mediocrity but rather for something better than that, though short of sainthood.  Phenomenologically, that might be how it seems to people.  Most people think that they are somewhat above average in moral traits like honesty and fairness (<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616673878\">Tappin and McKay 2017</a>); and maybe then people mostly think that they should more or less stay the course.  An eminent ethicist once told me he was aiming for a moral \"B+\".  However, I suspect that<b> most of us who like to think of ourselves as aiming for substantially above-average moral goodness aren't really willing to put in the work and sacrifice required</b>.  A close examination of how we actually calibrate our behavior will reveal us wiggling and veering toward a lower target.  (Compare the undergraduate who says they're \"aiming for B+\" in a class but who wouldn't be willing to put in more work if they received a C on the first exam.  It's probably better to say that they are <i>hoping</i> for a B+ than that they are <i>aiming</i> for one.)<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div> <div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-15054-002\">famous series of experiments</a> Justin Kruger and David Dunning found that people who scored in the lowest quartile of skill in grammar, logic, and (yes, they tried to measure this) humor tended to substantially overestimate their abilities, rating themselves as a bit above average in these skills.  In contrast, people in the top half of ability had more accurate estimations (even tending to underestimate a bit).

Across nine different moral issues, we found that <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHTMB-4\">ethicists reported behaving overall no morally differently than the other two groups</a>, though on some issues, especially vegetarianism and charitable giving, they endorsed more stringent attitudes.  (In some cases, we also had observational behavioral data that didn't depend on self-report.  Here too we found no overall difference.)  Schoenegger and Wagner <b>translated our questionnaire into German</b> and added a few new questions, then distributed it by email to professors in German-speaking countries, achieving an overall response rate of 29.5% [corrected Mar 23].  (Josh and I had a response rate of 58%.)  With a couple of exceptions, Schoenegger and Wagner report similar results.<p>\n\nThe most interesting difference between Schoenegger and Wagner's results and Josh's and my results concerns vegetarianism.<p>\n<i>The Questions:</i><p>\n\nWe originally asked three questions about vegetarianism.  In the first part of the questionnaire, we asked respondents to rate \"regularly eating the meat of mammals, such as beef or pork\" on a nine-point scale from \"very morally bad\" to \"very morally good\", with \"morally neutral\" in the middle.<p>\n\nIn the second part of the questionnaire, we asked:<p>\n\n17.\u2003During about how many meals or snacks per week do you eat the meat of mammals such as beef or pork?<p>\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009enter number of times per week ____<p>\n\n18.\u2003Think back on your last evening meal, not including snacks. Did you eat the meat of a mammal during that meal?<p>\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003yes<p>\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003no<p>\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003don\u2019t recall<p>\n<i>U.S. Results in 2009<p></p></i>\n\nOn the attitude question, <b>60% of ethicist respondents rated meat-eating somewhere on the \"bad\" side</b> of the nine-point scale, compared to 45% of non-ethicist philosophers and only 19% of professors from other departments (ANOVA, F\u2009=\u200917.0, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001).  We also found substantial differences by both gender and age, with <b>women and younger respondents more likely to condemn meat-eating</b>.  For example, 81% of female philosophy respondents born 1960 or later rated eating the meat of mammals as morally bad, compared to 7% of male non-philosophers born before 1960.  That's a huge difference in attitude!<p>\n\nEight percent of respondents rated it at 1 or 2 on the nine-point scale -- either \"very bad\" or adjacent to very bad -- including 11% of ethicists (46/564 overall, 22/193 of ethicists).<p>\n\nOn self-report of behavior, Josh and I found much less difference.  <b>On our \"previous evening meal\" question, we detected at best a statistically marginal difference among the three main analysis groups</b>: 37% of ethicists reported having eaten meat at the previous evening meal, compared to 33% of non-ethicist philosophers and 45% of non-philosophers (chi-squared\u2009=\u20095.7, p\u2009=\u20090.06, excluding two respondents who answered \"don\u2019t recall\").<p>\n\nThe \"meals per week\" question was actually designed in part as a test of \"socially desirable responding\" or a tendency to fudge answers: We thought it would be difficult to accurately estimate the number, thus it would be tempting for respondents to fudge a bit.  And mathematically, they did seem to be guilty of fudging: For example, 21% of respondents who reported eating meat at one meal per week also reported eating meat at the previous evening meal.  Even if we assume that meat is only consumed at evening meals, the number should be closer to 14% (1/7).  If we assume, more plausibly, that approximately half of all meat meals are evening meals, then the number should be closer to 7%.  With that caveat in mind, on the meals-per-week question we found a mean of 4.1 for ethicists, compared to 4.6 for non-ethicist philosophers and 5.3 for non-philosophers (ANOVA [square-root transformed], F\u2009=\u20095.2, p\u2009=\u20090.006).<p>\n\nWe concluded that although a majority of U.S. ethicists, especially younger ethicists and women ethicists, thought eating meat was morally bad, they ate meat at approximately the same rate as did the non-ethicists.<p>\n<i>German Results in 2018:</i><p>\n\nSchoenegger and Wagner find, similarly, a majority of German ethicist respondents rating meat-eating as bad: 67%.  <b>Evidently, a majority of U.S. and German ethicists think that eating meat is morally bad.</b><p>\n<b>However, among the non-ethicist professors, Schoenegger and Wagner find higher rates of condemnation of meat-eating than Josh and I found</b>: 63% among German-speaking non-ethicist philosophers in 2018 compared to our 45% in the U.S. in 2009 (80/127 vs. 92/204, z = 3.2, p = .001), and even more strikingly 40% among German-speaking professors from departments other than philosophy in 2018 compared to only 19% in the U.S. in 2009 (52/131 vs/ 31/167, z = 4.0, p &lt; .001; [note 1]).<p>\n<b>German professors were also much more likely than U.S. professors in 2009 to think that eating meat is <i>very </i>bad, with 18% rating it 1 or 2 on the scale, including 23% of ethicists</b> (57/408 and 35/150, excluding non-respondents; two-proportion test U.S. vs German: overall z = 2.8, p = .005, ethicists z = 2.9, p = .004).<p>\n\n\nApparently, German-speaking professors are not as fond of their wurst as cultural stereotypes might suggest!<p>\n\nA number of explanations are possible: One is that in general German academics are more pro-vegetarian than are U.S. academics.  Another is that attitudes toward vegetarianism are changing swiftly over time (as suggested by the age differences in Josh's and my study) and that the nine years between 2009 and 2018 saw a substantial shift in both cultures.  Still another concerns non-response bias. (For non-philosophers, Schoenegger and Wagner's response rate was 30%, while Josh's and mine was 53%.)<p>\n\nIn Schoenegger and Wagner's data, ethicists report having eaten less meat at the previous evening meal than the other two groups: 25%, vs. 40% of non-ethicist philosophers and 39% of the non-philosophers (chi-squared = 9.3, p = .01 [note 2]).  The meals per week data are less clear.  Schoenegger report 2.1 meals per week for ethicists, compared to 2.8 and 3.0 for non-ethicist philosophers and non-philosophers respectively (ANOVA, F = 3.4, p = .03), but their data are highly right skewed, and due to skew Josh and I had used a square-root transformation for original 2009 analysis.  A similar square-root transformation on Schoenegger and Wagner's raw data eliminates any statistically detectable difference (F = 0.8, p = .45). And there is again evidence of fudging in the meals-per-week responses: Among those reporting only one meat meal per week, for example, 18% reported having had meat at their previous evening meal.<p>\n\nIf we take the meals-per-week data at face value, the German respondents ate substantially less meat in 2018 than did the U.S. respondents in 2009: 2.6 meals for the Germans vs. 4.6 for the U.S. respondents (median 2 vs median 4, Mann-Whitney W = 287793, p &lt; .001).  However, the difference was not statistically detectable on the previous evening meal question: 38% U.S. vs 34% German (z = 1.3, p = .21).<p>\n\nAll of this is a bit difficult to interpret, but here's the tentative conclusion I draw:<p>\n<b>\nGerman professors today -- especially ethicists -- are more likely to condemn meat eating than were U.S. professors ten years ago.  They might also be a bit less likely to eat meat, again perhaps especially the ethicists, though that is not entirely clear and might reflect a bit of fudging in the self-reports.</b><p>\n\nThe other difference Schoenegger and Wagner found was in the question of whether ethicists were on the whole more likely than other professors to embrace stringent moral views -- but full analysis of this will require some detail and will have to wait for another time.<p>\n\n\n*********************************************<p>\n\nNote 1: In the published paper, Schoenegger and Wagner report 39% instead of the 40% I find in reanalyzing their raw data.  This might either be a rounding error [39.69%] or some small difference in our analyses.<p>\n\nNote 2: In the published paper, Schoenegger and Wagner report 24%, which again might be a rounding error (from 24.65%) or a small analytic difference.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wurst_(Bruehwurst).jpg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/03/most-us-and-german-ethicists-condemn.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2019-03-22T13:26:00-07:00\">1:26 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5772105575692616857\" onclick=\"\">0\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, March 15, 2019</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7827613721931262080\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/03/should-you-defer-to-ethical-experts.html\">Should You Defer to Ethical Experts?</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rsOnRPTHCB0/XIvadESH5jI/AAAAAAAABis/XNGx0HbTky4ViTClq0hQke0Fk_1DOgLrQCLcBGAs/s1600/EthicalExperts.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"250\" data-original-width=\"250\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rsOnRPTHCB0/XIvadESH5jI/AAAAAAAABis/XNGx0HbTky4ViTClq0hQke0Fk_1DOgLrQCLcBGAs/s200/EthicalExperts.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\n\nErnest Sosa gave a lovely and fascinating talk yesterday at UC Riverside on the importance of \"firsthand intuitive insight\" in philosophy.  It has me thinking about the extent to which we ought, or ought not, defer to ethical experts when we are otherwise inclined to disagree with their conclusions.<p>\n\nTo illustrate the idea of firsthand intuitive insight, Sosa gives two examples.  One concerns mathematics.  Consider a student who learns that the Pythagorean theorem is true without learning its proof.  This student knows that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 but doesn't have any insight into <i>why </i>it's true.  Contrast this student with one who masters the proof and consequently does understand why it's true.  The second student, but not the first, has firsthand intuitive insight.  Sosa's other example is in ethics.  One child bullies another.  Her mother, seeing the act and seeing the grief in the face of the other child, tells the bullying child that she should apologize.  The child might defer to her mother's ethical judgment, sincerely concluding she really should apologize, but without understanding why what she has done is bad enough to require apology.  Alternatively, she might come to genuinely notice the other child's grief and more fully understand how her bullying was inappropriate, and thus gain firsthand intuitive insight into the need for apology.  (I worry that firsthand intuitive insight is a bit of a slippery concept, but I don't think I can do more with it here.)<p>\n<b>Sosa argues that a central aim of much of philosophy is firsthand intuitive insight of this sort.</b>  In the sciences and in history, it's often enough just to know that some fact is true (that helium has two protons, that the Qin Dynasty fell in 206 BCE).  On such matters, we happily defer to experts.  In philosophy, we're less likely to accept a truth without having our own personal, firsthand intuitive insight.  Expert metaphysicians might almost universally agree that barstool-shaped-aggregates but not barstools themselves supervene on collections of particles arranged barstoolwise.  Expert ethicists might almost universally agree that a straightforward pleasure-maximizing utilitarian ethics would require radical revision of ordinary moral judgments.  But we're not inclined to just take them at their word.  We want to understand for ourselves how it is so.<p>\n\nThis seems right.  And yet, there's a bit of a puzzle in it, if we think that it's important that our ethical opinions be <i>correct</i>.  (Yes, I'm assuming that ethics is a domain in which there are correct and incorrect opinions.)  What should we do when the majority of philosophical experts think P, but your own (apparent) firsthand intuitive insight suggests not-P?  If you care about correctness above all, maybe you should defer to the experts, despite your lack of understanding.  But Sosa appears to think, as I suspect many of us do, that often the right course instead is to stand <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disagreement/#SteaView\">steadfast</a>, continuing to judge according to your own best independent reasoning.<p>\n\nBorrowing an example from <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40658407\">Sarah McGrath's work on moral deference</a>, consider the case of vegetarianism.  Based on <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHTMB-4\">some of my work</a>, I think that probably the majority of professional ethicists in the United States believe that it is normally morally wrong to eat the meat of factory-farmed animals.  This might also be true <a href=\"https://osf.io/35r48/\">in German-speaking countries</a>.  Impressionistically, most of the philosophers I know who have given the issue serious and detailed consideration come to endorse vegetarianism, including two of the most prominent ethicists currently alive, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061711305/animal-liberation/\">Peter Singer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198753853\">Christine Korsgaard</a>.  Now suppose that you haven't given the matter nearly as much thought as they have, but you have given it some thought.  You're inclined still to think that eating meat is okay, and you can maybe mount one or two plausible-seeming defenses of your view.  Should you defer to their ethical expertise?<p>\n\nSosa compares philosophical reasoning with archery.  You not only want to hit the target (the truth), you want to do so by the exercise of your own skill (your own intuitive insight), rather than by having an expert guide your hand (deference to experts).  I agree that ideally this is so.  It's nice when you have have both truth and intuitive insight!  But when the aim of hitting the target conflicts with the aim of doing so by your own intuitive insight, your preference should depend on the stakes.  If it's an archery contest, you don't want the coach's help: The most important thing is the test of your own skill.  But if you're a subsistence hunter who needs dinner, then you probably ought to take any help you can get, if the target looks like it's about to escape.  And isn't ethics (outside the classroom, at least) more like subsistence hunting than like an archery contest?  <b>What should matter most is whether you actually come to the right moral conclusion about eating meat (or whatever) not whether you get there by your own insight.</b>  Excessive emphasis on the individual's need for intuitive insight, at the cost of truth or correctness, risks turning ethics into a kind of sport.<p>\n\nSo maybe, then, you should defer to the majority of ethical experts, and conclude that it is normally wrong to eat factory-farmed meat, even if that conclusion doesn't accord with your own best attempts at insight?<p>\n\nWhile I'm tempted to say this, I simultaneously feel pulled in Sosa's direction -- and perhaps I should defer to his expertise as one of the world's leading epistemologists!  There's something I like about non-deference in philosophy, and our prizing of people's standing fast in their own best judgments, even in the teeth of disagreement by better-informed experts.  So here are four brief defenses of non-deference.  I fear none of them is quite sufficient.  But maybe in combination they will take us somewhere?<p>\n<b>(1.) The \"experts\" might not be experts.</b>  This is McGrath's defense of non-deference in ethics.  Despite their seeming expertise, great ethicists have often been horribly wrong in the past.  See Aristotle on slavery, <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2010/03/kant-on-killing-bastards-on.html\">Kant on bastards, masturbation, homosexuality, wives, and servants</a>, the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/02/german-and-english-philosophers-in-1914.html\">consensus of philosophers in favor of World War I</a>, and ethicists' <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">seeming inability</a> to reason better even about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problems</a> than non-ethicists.<p>\n<b>(2.) Firsthand intuitive insight might be highly intrinsically valuable.</b>  I'm a big believer in the intrinsic value of knowledge (including <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/IntrinsicSelfK.htm\">self-knowledge</a>).  One of the most amazing and important things about life on Earth is that sometimes we bags of mostly water can stop and reflect on some of the biggest, most puzzling questions that there are.  An important component of the intrinsic value of philosophical reflection is the real understanding that comes with firsthand intuitive insight, or seeming insight, or partial insight -- our ability to reach our <i>own</i> philosophical judgments instead of simply deferring to experts.  This might be valuable enough to merit some substantial loss of ethical correctness to preserve it.<p>\n<b>(3.) The philosophical community might profit from diversity of moral opinion, even if individuals with unusual views are likely to be incorrect.</b>  The philosophical community as a whole might, over time, be more likely to converge upon correct ethical views if it fosters diversity of opinion.  If we all defer to whoever seems to be most expert, we might reach consensus too fast on a wrong, or at least a narrow and partial, ethical view.  Compare <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-Thomas-Kuhn/dp/0226458083\">Kuhn</a> and <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/4575.html\">Longino</a> on the value of diversity in scientific opinion: Intellectual communities need stubborn defenders of unlikely views, even if those stubborn folks are probably wrong -- since sometimes they have an important piece of the truth that others are missing.<p>\n<b>(4.) Proper moral motivation might require acting from one's own insight rather than from moral deference.</b>  The bully who apologizes out of deference gives, I think, a less perfect apology than the bully who has firsthand intuitive insight into the need to apologize.  Maybe in some cases, being motivated by one's own intuitive insight is so morally important that it's better to do the ethically wrong thing on the basis of your imperfect but non-deferential insight than to do the ethically right thing deferentially.<p>\n\nAs I said, none of these defenses of non-deference seems quite enough on its own.  Even if the experts <i>might </i>be wrong (Point 1), from a bird's-eye perspective it seems like our best guess should be that they're not.  And the considerations in Points 2-4 seem plausibly to be only secondary from the perspective of the person who wants really to have ethically correct views by which to guide her behavior.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ethical-experts-bloomfield-township\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/03/should-you-defer-to-ethical-experts.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2019-03-15T09:58:00-07:00\">9:58 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=7827613721931262080\" onclick=\"\">18\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics%20professors\" rel=\"tag\">ethics professors</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, February 15, 2019</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"9205395215810015131\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/02/studying-ethics-should-influence-your.html\">Studying Ethics Should Influence Your Behavior (But It Doesn't Seem to)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>Some academic disciplines have direct relevance to day-to-day life.  Studying these disciplines, you might think, would have an influence on one's practical behavior.  Studying nutritional health, it seems plausible to suppose, would have an influence of some sort on  your food choices.  Studying the stock market would likely have an influence on your investment strategies.  Studying parenting styles in developmental psychology would have an influence on your parenting decisions.  The effects might not be huge: A scholar of nutrition might not be able to entirely sacrifice Twinkies.  A scholar of parenting styles might sometimes lose her temper in ways she knows from her research to be counterproductive.  But it would be strange if studying such topics had <i>no effect whatsoever</i> -- if there were a perfect isolation between one's research on nutrition, investment, or parenting and one's personal food choices, investments, and approaches to parenting.<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYjk48qxfr0/XGbygfbEuqI/AAAAAAAABdU/gekmizqHK0crGsPu_Dvhmi2gFbOXfwqMwCLcBGAs/s1600/DoctorSmokeCrop.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"407\" data-original-width=\"626\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZYjk48qxfr0/XGbygfbEuqI/AAAAAAAABdU/gekmizqHK0crGsPu_Dvhmi2gFbOXfwqMwCLcBGAs/s320/DoctorSmokeCrop.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n[A doctor doing what doctors <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/12/11/1167/1748983\">in fact don't do very much of</a>.]<p>\n\nOther academic topics have tenuous connections at best to practical matters of day-to-day life: studying the first second of the Big Bang, or mereological approaches to objecthood, or tortoise-shell divination in ancient China. Of course, studying such things <i>could </i>have behavioral effects.  Maybe immersion in Big Bang cosmology inspires one to a broader, less parochial worldview.  But I don't think we should particularly expect that or think something is strange if it doesn't.  It's not strange for a cosmologist to be parochial in the same way it would be for an anti-trans-fat health researcher to not attempt to reduce her own trans-fat intake.<p>\n\nEthics seems clearly to be in the category of academic disciplines that are directly relevant to scholars' day-to-day lives.  Not every sub-issue of every sub-specialization of ethics is so, of course.  Some ethical questions are highly abstract or concern matters irrelevant to the immediate choices of the scholars' lives; but few ethicists spend all of their energy on issues of that sort.  Issues like our obligations to the poor, the ethics of honesty and kindness, animal rights and environmentalism, prejudice, structural injustices in our society, the proper weighing of selfish concerns against the demands of others, the question of how much to abide by laws or directives with which you disagree -- all seem directly relevant to our lives.  It would be odd if devoting a substantial part of one's career to thinking about such issues had no influence of any sort on one's day-to-day behavior.<p>\n\nAnd yet it's not clear to me that studying ethics does have any influence on day-to-day behavior.  <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">Across a wide range of studies</a>, my collaborators and I have found no convincing evidence of systematic behavioral differences between ethicists and non-ethicists of similar social background.  Also, impressionistically, in my personal interactions with professional ethicists, my sense is that they behave overall similarly to non-ethicists.  Furthermore, there's <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsClasses.htm\">little evidence that university-level ethics classes influence students' behavior</a> either.<p>\n\nMaybe studying ethics does sometimes have a practical effect.  It would, in my mind, be stunning if studying ethics never had any influence of any sort on one's behavioral choices!  But the effects, if any, are subtle and difficult to detect empirically.<p>\n\nWhy this should be so is an underappreciated puzzle.<p>\n\nThe easiest answers -- \"academic ethics is all abstract and impractical\", \"ethics is all post-hoc rationalization of what you were going to do anyway\", \"our immoral desires are so compelling that no amount of rational thought could lead us to act otherwise\" -- don't withstand critical scrutiny as fully adequate answers (although each may have some element of truth).<p>\n\nFor several of my imperfect attempts to resolve this puzzle, see:<p>\n\n\"<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PowerReason.htm\">The Moral Behavior of Ethicists and the Power of Reason</a>\" (with Joshua Rust), <i>Advances in Experimental Moral Psychology</i> (ed.

One simple explanation (favored, for example, by Jon Haidt in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777\">his discussion</a> of Eric's work) is that philosophical moral reflection has little to no influence on people's moral behavior.  However, Eric and his frequent collaborator Joshua Rust have been hesitant to draw that conclusion without more empirical evidence (see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PowerReason.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">here</a> for possible alternative explanations).<p>\n\nMeanwhile, Eric's PhD student Chris was growing interested in the power of narratives to change behavior.  So we decided to collaborate on a project to compare the influence of narrative and argument on charitable giving.<p>\n<i>Design<p></p></i>\n\nFor our argument, we chose an argument constructed by philosopher Peter Singer with the aim of convincing ordinary readers to donate to charity.  The argument was originally written for a paper in draft by Luke Buckland, Matthew Lindauer, David Rodriguez-Arias, and Carissa Veliz.  (Thanks to them and to Peter Singer for sharing this argument with us.)  We supplemented Singer's argument with some additional clarificatory text.  It's a typical Singer-style argument, emphasizing that people have a duty to prevent death and suffering due to extreme poverty by donating money that they would otherwise spend on luxuries, and that our physical distance from those who are suffering does not excuse us from the obligation to help.<p>\n\nFor our narrative, we chose a true story, about the same word-length as the argument, about a family rescued from slavery by a charitable donation, which we adapted from the website of a charitable organization.<p>\n\nParticipants were 918 MTurk workers in the United States.  We divided them into four conditions: (1.) narrative only, (2.) argument only, (3.) narrative + argument, and (4.) control (who received a similar-length text from a middle-school physics textbook).  Participants were then asked to rate, on a 7-point scale, how much they agreed or disagreed with statements about the ethics of donation and their own motivation to donate (e.g., \"It is morally good to give money to charities that help those in extreme poverty\", \"Currently I feel motivated to give money to a charity that helps people in extreme poverty\").  In Experiment 1, we then asked them a hypothetical question about how much they would give to a charity if we offered them a bonus of $10.  In Experiment 2, we replaced the hypothetical-donation language with a lottery choice.  We'll report only on Experiment 2 here, but the results of Experiment 1 were very similar.<p>\n\nHere is the exact language for the lottery choice:\n<blockquote>Upon completion of this study, 10% of participants in this study will receive an additional $10. You have the option to donate some portion of this $10 to one of six well-known charities that have been shown to effectively fight suffering due to extreme poverty. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, the portion you decide to keep will appear as a bonus credited to your Mechanical Turk worker account, and the portion you decide to donate will be given to the charity you pick from the list below. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, how much of your additional $10 would you like to donate?</blockquote><p>\n\nParticipants then ticked a number on a scale from $0 to $10 in dollar intervals, indicating how much they would donate if they won the $10. \n (A big thanks to <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, especially Jon Behar, for funding this study!)<p>\n\nFinally, we asked questions designed to measure \"narrative transportation\" (i.e., how immersive and moving they found the narrative, or argument, or physics text), adapted from <a href=\"http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/the_role_of_transportation_in_the_persuasiveness_of_public_narratives.pdf\">Green and Brock 2000</a>.<p>\n\nWe thought we'd share some preliminary results.  We emphasize that these results are only preliminary.  Later, we'll want to double-check our numbers, confirm that we got the exclusions exactly right, etc.  (We have a preregistration at <a href=\"https://osf.io/\">Open Science Foundation</a>, but we haven't made it public yet.)<p>\n<i>Results<p></p></i>\n\nMean amount donated, by condition:<p>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NK7SVwP8u9c/W_LzoL_PQ1I/AAAAAAAABOU/VvH0S_R31Ak4n7gsETTXDNNgOl6alO7OACLcBGAs/s1600/MeanDonation-181119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"288\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NK7SVwP8u9c/W_LzoL_PQ1I/AAAAAAAABOU/VvH0S_R31Ak4n7gsETTXDNNgOl6alO7OACLcBGAs/s320/MeanDonation-181119.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a>\n\n(Apologies for blurry image.

In planned, pre-registered one-tailed t-tests, we found that the narrative and narrative+argument conditions generated more donation than the control condition (p = .02, .001) but the argument condition did not (p = .48).  Similarly in a multiple regression analysis we found that being in one of the narrative conditions (narrative only or narrative+argument) predicted donation amount but being in one of the argumentative conditions was not statistically significantly predictive.  <b>In other words, exposure to a Singer-style philosophical argument had no statistically detectable effect on charitable giving, but exposure to a narrative about a family rescued from slavery did have a detectable effect.</b>  This was also true in Experiment 1, concerning hypothetical donation.<p>\n\nThe results were even clearer for the measure of ethical opinion and motivation to donate, which was scored on a scale from 5 to 35, based on 5 questions:\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8TXqt8z9z5s/W_L55fVT4LI/AAAAAAAABOw/vXI947okp5UC89WSqOcww4kkyusTeYrKQCLcBGAs/s1600/CharityMotivation-181119.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"392\" data-original-width=\"485\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8TXqt8z9z5s/W_L55fVT4LI/AAAAAAAABOw/vXI947okp5UC89WSqOcww4kkyusTeYrKQCLcBGAs/s320/CharityMotivation-181119.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n\nIt's not a huge effect size -- about 2 points on the scale -- but it's easier to see how the results for argument and control are similar to each other and different from the results for narrative and narrative+argument, which are also similar to each other (ANOVA [913,3], F=10.8, p &lt; .001; one-tailed t vs. control condition: argument p = .71, narrative p &lt; .001, nar+arg p &lt; .001). \n Similarly to the lottery donation results, a regression analysis of reported motivation and moral opinion finds being in a narrative condition predictive and being in an argument condition non-predictive.<p>\n\nAs expected, we also found that participants reported more narrative transportation in the narrative and narrative+argument conditions than in the other conditions (ANOVA, p &lt; .001) and that narrative transport, amount given, and motivation to give were mutually correlated (transport-amount given, r = .24; transport-motivation, r = .40, motivation-amount given, r = .50; all p's &lt; .001).<p>\n<i>Conclusion<p></p></i>\n<b>We regard this as preliminary evidence that exposure to at least one type of narrative influences charitable giving, motivation, and opinion, while exposure to one common type of philosophical argument has little if any influence.</b><p>\n\nIn our teaching, we also seem to find that Singer-style arguments have little effect on moral opinion or motivation to donate.  In another series of studies (collaborative with Peter Singer and Brad Cokelet), which we hope to be able to report on soon, professors and TAs at UC Riverside taught lower-division philosophy students philosophical arguments for charitable donation and for vegetarianism.  In subsequent questionnaires, students' self-reported attitudes toward charity don't appear to have been much influenced by the arguments, but their self-reported attitudes toward vegetarianism do appear to have been influenced.<p>\n\nThis is not to deny that <i>some</i> people are influenced to donate by Singer's arguments.  Eric believes that he has been, for example.  But the effect might be weak or uncommon or not effectively produced by brief exposures.<p>\n\nIn follow-up research, we plan to see if we find similar results with different types of arguments and narratives, and we hope to zero in on what underlying factors are at work behind these effects.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/narrative-but-not-philosophical.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-11-21T08:13:00-08:00\">8:13 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=2869116372983638922\" onclick=\"\">3\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/sociology%20of%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">sociology of philosophy</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, October 18, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"9137666396104239695\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/10/teaching-hitler-and-my-neighbors.html\">Teaching Hitler, and My Neighbor's Attitude About the Holocaust</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><i>Teaching Hitler</i><p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Umxfp5RawNw/W8fdYuwKQ_I/AAAAAAAABJE/gLfAyivrnKAAk9uIBEiUi-aw63WW4xcmgCLcBGAs/s1600/Mein_Kampf_dust_jacket.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"681\" data-original-width=\"617\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Umxfp5RawNw/W8fdYuwKQ_I/AAAAAAAABJE/gLfAyivrnKAAk9uIBEiUi-aw63WW4xcmgCLcBGAs/s200/Mein_Kampf_dust_jacket.jpeg\" width=\"181\"/></a></div><p>\n\nAbout once a year, I teach a giant lower division class called \"Evil\", focused on the moral psychology of evil.  (This year, I have 420 students enrolled.)  We do a segment on the Holocaust, in which I assign Elie Wiesel, Hannah Arendt, Daniel Goldhagen, Ervin Staub, <i>Schindler's List</i>, and selections from <i>Mein Kampf</i>.<p>\n<b>I don't think we can properly understand the psychology of the Holocaust without understanding why ordinary Germans of the period found Hitler attractive.</b>  Hitler's attraction to ordinary Germans is incomprehensible if we see him through the usual lens of his presentation in U.S. culture.  I ask my students to read <i>Mein Kampf</i> so that we can see Hitler in his own words, and to try to understand the vision of the world that he presented to his followers.  I hope and assume, as I emphasize in lecture, that none of my hundreds of students finds <i>Mein Kampf</i> <i>too </i>attractive.  (Students who find the reading too repulsive to bear are permitted to choose an alternative reading.)<p>\n<b>One fascinating aspect of <i>Mein Kampf</i> is that Hitler makes an <i>ethical </i>case for the extermination of the Jews and the Poles.</b>  He argues that races of people differ genetically, and that we ought to expect some races to be genetically superior to others.  The \"Aryan\" race -- basically, White people especially from northwestern Europe, but the ancient Greeks and Romans too -- he argues, can be seen to be superior to other races because of their cultural and military achievements (the Parthenon, Beethoven, the Roman Empire, the conquest of the Americas, etc.).<p>\n<b>This \"Aryan\" superiority partly consists in their willingness to subordinate their interests to the greater good of the state.</b>  In <i>Mein Kampf</i> and, even more vividly in his speeches, Hitler appears to be at his most frighteningly \"inspiring\" when he praises ordinary Germans' willingness to become heroes, ready to sacrifice everything for the greater good of their nation.  (If you'll forgive the comparison, I am reminded of John F. Kennedy's remark, which many people in the U.S. have found inspiring, \"Ask not what your country can do for you \u2013 ask what you can do for your country.\").<p>\n\nHitler embraces a broadly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism\">Malthusian</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer\">Spencerian</a> vision of populations of humans destined to fight each other: Each nation or race will breed too many people to share the planet.  The natural and desirable consequence of this inevitable fight, Hitler argues, is that the stronger races will defeat the weaker races.  They will thus bequeath better genes or \"blood\" to subsequent generations than would happen if weaker races were permitted to reproduce at the same rate as stronger races.<p>\n\nFrom all of this, it follows, on Hitler's thinking, that it is the moral duty of \"Aryans\" to exterminate the Jews and other inferior races and also to invade nearby lands (esp. Poland), killing or displacing the inferior people there, so that healthy, fertile Germans will have room to expand and grow the population.  <b>Short-term bloodshed and suffering will ensure the flourishing of future races of superior human beings!  Every good German must stand ready to sacrifice for this great goal!</b>  One can see how such thinking might have been attractive to a certain sort of racist.<p>\n\nHitler was quite clear about all of this in <i>Mein Kampf</i>, of which about ten million copies were distributed in Germany.  He even gives political advice for how to most effectively implement genocide.  I do not think that Germans of the era can plausibly say that they were unaware of his violent eugenic plans.<p>\n<i>And My Neighbor's Attitude About the Holocaust</i><p>\n\nI do not think many people today would endorse such violent eugenic thinking -- but neither do I think that Hitler's reasoning is <i>so</i> alien that we cannot still hear echoes of it.<p>\n\nLast week, I flew to St. Louis to give a series of talks.  On the first leg of my flight, I ended up sitting next to a woman and man who lived in the neighborhood just south of mine in Riverside, California, near where my daughter attends school.  After finding out that I was a philosophy professor at U.C. Riverside, they asked me what I thought of politics in the U.S. today.  I said something about the value of listening across the political divide and respecting facts.<p>\n\nThe woman sitting next to me then launched into political conversation with me, and it became clear that she identified with the political right.  Despite her earlier approval of the value of listening, she seemed more interested in speaking than in hearing my perspective.  At one point I mentioned that I teach a class called Evil and that we were about to start the segment on the Holocaust.<p>\n<b>My seatmate said, \"I do think there was a reason that Hitler chose to exterminate the Jews.  Of all the people he could have chosen, he went after the Jews.\"</b>  She added something about Jews being rich lawyers and bankers.  \"It was all predicted two thousand years ago,\" she added.<p>\n\nI was stunned for a moment, and then she changed the topic and our conversation moved on.  In retrospect, I imagine many things I could have said in response; but I said none of them.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mein_Kampf_dust_jacket.jpeg\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/10/teaching-hitler-and-my-neighbors.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-10-18T07:50:00-07:00\">7:50 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=9137666396104239695\" onclick=\"\">20\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, September 12, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"7022839094017605819\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/09/one-point-five-cheers-for-hugo-award.html\">One-Point-Five Cheers for a Hugo Award for a TV Show about Ethicists\u2019 Moral Expertise</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/2018/09/11/guest-post-eric-schwitzgebel-gives-one-point-five-cheers-for-a-hugo-award-for-a-tv-show-about-ethicists-moral-expertise/\">cross-posted</a> at <a href=\"http://www.kittywumpus.net/blog/\">Kittywumpus</a>]<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5nZsAbBSKk/W5lddWu-TcI/AAAAAAAABEQ/Q8yWEODkRsMDE9FM8HuevArrfQN3wrEYQCLcBGAs/s1600/GoodTrolleyProblem.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5nZsAbBSKk/W5lddWu-TcI/AAAAAAAABEQ/Q8yWEODkRsMDE9FM8HuevArrfQN3wrEYQCLcBGAs/s320/GoodTrolleyProblem.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a></div><p>\n\nWhen <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6951978/\"><i>The Good Place</i> episode \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</a> won one of science fiction\u2019s most prestigious awards, the Hugo, in the category of best dramatic presentation, short form, I celebrated. I celebrated not because I loved the episode (in fact, I had so far only seen a couple of The Good Place\u2019s earlier episodes) but because, as a philosophy professor aiming to build bridges between academic philosophy and popular science fiction, the awarding of a Hugo to a show starring a professor of philosophy discussing a famous philosophical problem seemed to confirm that science fiction fans see some of the same synergies I see between science fiction and philosophy.<p>\n\nI do think the synergies are there and that the fans see and value them \u2013 as also revealed by the enduring popularity of The Matrix, and by West World, and Her, and Black Mirror, among others \u2013 but \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d, considered as a free-standing episode, fumbles the job. (Below, I will suggest a twist by which The Good Place could redeem itself in later episodes.)<p>\n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to be fussy when maybe I should just cheer and praise. And I\u2019m going to take the episode more philosophically seriously than maybe I should, treating it as not just light humor. But taking good science fiction philosophically seriously is important to me \u2013 and that means engaging critically. So here we go.<p>\n<i>The Philosophical Trolley Problem</i><p>\n\nThe trolley problem \u2013 the classic academic philosophy version of the trolley problem \u2013 concerns a pair of scenarios.<p>\n\nIn one scenario, the Switch case, you are standing beside a railroad track watching a runaway railcar (or \u201ctrolley\u201d) headed toward five people it will surely kill if you do nothing. You are standing by a switch, however, and you can flip the switch to divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. Unfortunately, there is one person on the side track who will be killed if you divert the trolley. Question: Should you flip the switch?<p>\n\nIn another scenario, the Push case, you are standing on a footbridge when you see the runaway railcar headed toward the five people. In this case, there is no switch. You do, however, happen to be standing beside a hiker with a heavy backpack, who you could push off the bridge into the path of the trolley, which will then grind to a halt on his body, killing him and saving the five. (You are too light to stop the trolley with your own body.) He is leaning over the railing, heedless of you, so you could just push him over. Question: Should you push the hiker?<p>\n\nThe interesting thing about these problems is that most people say it\u2019s okay to flip the switch in Switch but not okay to push the hiker in Push, despite the fact that in both cases you appear to be killing one person to save five. Is there really a meaningful difference between the cases? If so, what is it? Or are our ordinary intuitions about one or the other case wrong?<p>\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely puzzle, much, much debated in academic philosophy, often with intricate variations on the cases. (Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">one of my papers about it</a>.)<p>\n<i>The Problem with \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\n\u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d episode nicely sets up some basic trolley scenarios, adding also a medical case of killing one to save five (an involuntary organ donor). The philosophy professor character, Chidi, is teaching the material to the other characters.<p>\n\nSpoilers coming.<p>\n\nThe episode stumbles by trying to do two conflicting things.<p>\n\nFirst, it seizes the trope of the philosophy professor who can\u2019t put his theories into practice. The demon Michael sets up a simulated trolley, headed toward five victims, with Chidi at the helm. Chidi is called on to make a fast decision. He hesitates, agonizing, and crashes into the five. Micheal reruns the scenario with several variations, and it\u2019s clear that Chidi, faced with a practical decision requiring swift action, can\u2019t actually figure out what\u2019s best. (However, Chidi is clear that he wouldn\u2019t cut up a healthy patient in an involuntary organ donor case.)<p>\n\nSecond, incompatibly, the episode wants to affirm Chidi\u2019s moral expertise. Michael, the demon who enjoys torturing humans, can\u2019t seem to take Chidi\u2019s philosophy lessons seriously, despite Chidi\u2019s great knowledge of ethics. Michael tries to win Chidi\u2019s favor by giving him a previously unseen notebook of Kant\u2019s, but Chidi, with integrity that I suppose the viewer is expected to find admirable, casts the notebook aside, seeing it as a bribe. What Chidi really wants is for Michael to recognize his moral expertise. At the climax of the episode, Michael seems to do just this, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.</blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from within the episode whether we are supposed to regard Michael as sincere. Maybe not. Regardless, the viewer is invited to think that it\u2019s what Michael should say, what his attitude should be \u2013 and Chidi accepts the apology.<p>\n\nBut this resolution hardly fits with Chidi\u2019s failure in actual ethical decision making in the moment (a vice he also reveals in other episodes). Chidi has abstract, theoretical knowledge about ethical quandaries such as the trolley problem, and he is in some ways the most morally admirable of the lead characters, but his failure in vividly simulated trolley cases casts his practical ethical expertise into doubt. Nothing in the episode satisfactorily resolves that practical challenge to Chidi\u2019s expertise, pro or con.<p>\n<i>Ethical Expertise?</i><p>\n\nNow, as it happens, I am the world\u2019s leading expert on the ethical behavior of professional ethicists. (Yes, really. Admittedly, the <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthBehBlackwell.htm\">competition is limited</a>.)<p>\n\nThe one thing that shows most clearly from my and others\u2019 work on this topic, and which is anyway pretty evident if you spend much time around professional ethicists, is that ethicists, on average, behave more or less similarly to other people of similar social background \u2013 not especially better, not especially worse. From the fact that Chidi is a professor of ethics, nothing in particular follows about his moral behavior. Often, indeed, expertise in philosophical ethics appears to become expertise in constructing <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">post-hoc intellectual rationales for what you were inclined to do anyway</a>.<p>\n\nI hope you will agree with me about the following, concerning the philosophy of philosophy: Real ethical understanding is not a matter of what words you speak in classroom moments. It\u2019s a matter of what you choose and what you do habitually, regardless of whether you can tell your friends a handsome story about it, grounded in your knowledge of Kant. It\u2019s not clear that Chidi does have especially good ethical understanding in this practical sense. Moreover, to the extent Chidi does have some such practical ethical understanding, as a somewhat morally admirable person, it is not in virtue of his knowledge of Kant.<p>\n\nMichael should not be so deferential to Chidi\u2019s expertise, and especially he should not be deferential on the basis of Chidi\u2019s training as a philosopher. If, over the seasons, the characters improve morally, it is, or should be, because they learn from the practical situations they find themselves in, not because of Chidi\u2019s theoretical lessons.<p>\n<i>How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d</i><p>\n\nThus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics).<p>\n\nWhen the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://www.overthinkingit.com/2017/10/23/the-good-place-unlocked-season-2-episode-6-the-trolley-problem/\">image source</a>]<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------------<p>\n<i>Update, October 21, 2018:</i><p>\n\nWisecrack has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds\">terrific treatment of the philosophy of <i>The Good Place</i></a>, revealing that the show has a more nuanced view of the role of ethics lessons than one might infer from treating \"The Trolley Problem\" as a stand-alone work.

(Of course, this might not be among your aims.)<p>\n\n(This post was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/janet.stemwedel/posts/10155146470001710\">Janet Stemwedel's Facebook/Twitter post</a> about students cheating in her ethics class, and subsequent discussion.)<p>\n<b>1. Creating the appearance that every pro has an equally good con.</b> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Postures_of_the_Mind.html?id=WjxRAAAAYAAJ\">Annette Baier</a> is among those who have emphasized this risk.  A typical philosophical teaching style is to present both sides of every major topic discussed, in a more-or-less even-handed way.  We tell students that they are welcome to defend either the pro or the con, and we encourage contrarian students who challenge the reasoning and conclusions of the assigned authors.  This even-handed debate-like format might lead some students to think that, in ethical reasoning, there are no right or wrong answers to be found, just interminable back and forth.  Probably this attitude will have little effect on students' practical choices outside of the classroom; but if it does have an effect, it might be to weaken their sense that ethical principles that they might otherwise have acted on are as sound and indisputable as they would previously have thought.<p>\n<b>2. Improving one's skill at moral rationalization.</b>  Suppose you want to do X -- <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsBooks.htm\">steal a library book</a>, for example.  Of course, you wouldn't do that.  It's wrong!  But wait.  Remember that ethics class you took?  Maybe you can construct a utilitarian defense of stealing the book.  No one would miss it that much, and you'd benefit greatly from keeping it.  The institution has much more money than you do, and can easily replace it.  Stealing the book would maximize human happiness!  (Especially yours.)  Such reasoning is <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">rationalization, in the pejorative sense of that term</a>, if your reasoning is basically just a biased search for reasons in support of the self-serving conclusion you'd like to reach.  If you're tempted to do something morally wrong, skill at philosophical reasoning, and knowledge of a diverse range of possibly relevant moral principles, might enable you to better construct superficially attractive arguments that free you to feel okay doing the bad thing that you might otherwise have unreflectively avoided.<p>\n<b>3. Giving the sense that unethical behavior is pervasive.</b>  I've argued that people mostly aim for <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">moral mediocrity</a>.  They aim, that is, not to be morally good by absolute standards but rather to be about as morally good as their peers, not especially better, not especially worse.  If so, then changes in your perception of what is typical behavior among your peers can cause you to calibrate your own behavior up or down.  If most people litter, or cheat, or selfishly screw over their co-workers, then it doesn't seem so bad if you do too, at least a little.  (Conversely, if you learn that almost everyone around you is honorable and true, that can inspire you not to want to be the one schmuck.)  Some ethics classes, perhaps especially business ethics classes, focus on case studies of grossly unethical behavior.  This company did this bad thing, this other company did this other bad thing, still another company did this other horrible thing....  Without a complementary range of inspirational examples of morally laudable behavior by other companies, students might get the sense that the world is even fuller of malfeasance than they had previously thought, leading them to calibrate their sense of mediocrity down.  If so many other people do so many bad things, then it hardly matters (perhaps even it's only fair) if I fudge a bit on my expense report.<p>\n\nDo ethics classes actually have any of these backfire effects?  I think we really have no idea.  The issue remains almost entirely unstudied in any rigorous, empirical way.<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2013/09/15\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"568\" data-original-width=\"839\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ly8zy3LKXlM/WuHxUhBPpdI/AAAAAAAAAzI/dzOLwsTNbFcLy_v6G_f97QcBsIjd69irwCLcBGAs/s400/CalvinHobbesCheating.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2013/09/15\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/04/three-ways-your-ethics-class-might.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-04-26T08:48:00-07:00\">8:48 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4508376693689617069\" onclick=\"\">1 comments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/ethics\" rel=\"tag\">ethics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, March 07, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"66096378250196958\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/engaging-with-evil-art.html\">Engaging with Evil Art</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>[Note: Somehow two different versions of this post went up.  Slightly updated version <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/engaging-with-evil-art-riefenstahls.html\">here</a>.]\n\nLast term, some grad students and I read Berys Gaut's book <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/art-emotion-and-ethics-9780199263219?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Art, Emotion, and Ethics.</a>  Gaut argues that although some morally noxious works of art have aesthetic merit, they never have aesthetic merit <i>in virtue of</i> their moral defects.  If an ethically flawed work is aesthetically good, it is good <i>despite </i>that flaw, not because of the flaw.<p>\n\nI find myself inclined to disagree.  Sometimes art is more thought-provoking, or more challenging or horrifying, because of its moral defects -- thought-provoking, challenging, or horrifying in ways that make the work more engaging, giving the work a kind of aesthetic interest in virtue of its moral terribleness.<p>\n\nBefore I offer examples, two caveats:<p>\n\n(1.) In praising the aesthetic merits that morally noxious artworks sometimes have in virtue of that very noxiousness, I <i>don't</i> commit to the view that being thought-provokingly morally awful outweighs other considerations.  Some of these works should be overall condemned.  Even just appreciating them aesthetically might be overall inappropriate, despite their merits.  And the world might be better off had the works never been produced.<p>\n\n(2.) I am (like Gaut) assuming pluralism about aesthetic value.  Aesthetic value does not reduce entirely to beauty, for example.  Being thought-provoking, challenging, or frightening can be (though it isn't always) as aesthetic merit in a work -- can be part of what makes a work aesthetically valuable.<p>\n\nTwo examples I've given some thought to are both films: Leni Riefenstahl's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Will\">Triumph of the Will</a> and Woody Allen's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097123/\">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>.<p>\n\nRiefenstahl and Allen are of course both morally flawed people themselves: Riefenstahl a Nazi propagandist, Allen plausibly accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with minors, including in his own family.  The moral noxiousness of their work might flow in part from their own personal ethical flaws -- but I don't want to rely on such biographical facts in evaluating the works.  I discuss their work with considerable trepidation, because of the electricity of discussions of Nazism and of sexual abuse.  Let me be clear that I will not be saying that their work is good <i>despite </i>its moral awfulness, as though we could simply bracket moral issues in aesthetic discussions.  Instead, my view is that it is the moral awfulness itself that makes these otherwise not-so-great films interestingly distressing to contemplate.<p>\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-va--ECcjil0/Wp8optP-inI/AAAAAAAAB24/qCGqj7pT9yg3gQgSKNmbyd-rnuHBszZDgCLcBGAs/s1600/Riefenstahl.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1129\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-va--ECcjil0/Wp8optP-inI/AAAAAAAAB24/qCGqj7pT9yg3gQgSKNmbyd-rnuHBszZDgCLcBGAs/s400/Riefenstahl.jpg\" width=\"400\"/></a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\n[<a href=\"https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/image/triumph-will-propaganda-film\">image source</a>]<p>\n\nConsider <i>Triumph of the Will</i>.  The film is fascinating, in part, because it is both (sometimes) beautiful <i>and</i> a work of Nazi propaganda.  There's a horrifying tension between the beauty of the cinematography and the ugliness of the worldview it celebrates.  It would not be nearly as horrifyingly fascinating if it didn't star Hitler -- my god, there he is, arguably the most evil man on Earth, being fawned over! -- if it were, say, a piece of Allied propaganda rather than Nazi propaganda.<p>\n\nFurthermore, the fact that it is Nazi propaganda is not independent of the aesthetics of the film: It's not simply a beautiful film that happens (by sad chance) to be Nazi propaganda.  The fascistic perspective is itself visible in some of its scenes -- for example, in the striking shots of masses of seemingly-identical troops standing in huge, almost inhuman formations, in the unity and uniformness of the crowds' mood and action, in the extreme deference to Hitler, in Hitler's superficially tempting sham-ethical perspective as he praises people who sacrifice and submit everything for the good of Germany and the new Reich.<p>\n<i>Triumph of the Will</i> is fascinating not despite, but <i>because of</i> its moral horribleness.  Proper viewing of it requires keeping that horribleness always in view at the same time one feels pulled into the beauty of a shot or feels sympathetically how an ordinary German of the period might be emotionally moved by Hitler's calls for self-sacrifice.<p>\n\nAllen's <i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i> is also, I think, fundamentally morally noxious, but in a different way.  The film is clearly intended as a refutation of the idea of \"immanent justice\" of the sort one sees in Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky: the idea that crimes bring their own punishments naturally in their train.  In Shakespeare's Macbeth, for example, the title character murders King Duncan, and this leads to other crimes, and torments of guilt, and fear, and ultimately a terrible death.  In Dostoyevsky's <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, Raskolnikov commits a robbery, and it too leads to another crime (murder), and subsequent horrible guilt and fear; he never benefits, and he ends up driven to confess.  Allen's plausible starting point is that the world doesn't reliably work this way.  Often people commit horrible crimes, and get away with it, and don't feel too bad about it, and are better off in the end for having done so.  As I've stated it so far, this isn't yet a claim about what one should do.  It's just how the world happens to be, as portrayed in the film.<p>\n\nThe central ethical question of Allen's <i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i> is how to approach life <i>in light of the failure of immanent justice</i>, that is, given that the wicked often flourish.  Hypothetically, the message of the film could have been that you should act ethically anyway, even if you'll be worse off as a result, even if Shakespeare and the Bible and Dostoyevsky and children's tales are wrong, and crime does pay.  That is presumably what Mengzi would say.  But that is not, I think, the perspective conveyed in the film.<p>\n\nIn the perspective of the film, the lead character Judah, who murders his mistress so that she will not reveal their sexual affair to Judah's wife, proves to be the wisest character in the end.  Wiser than the rabbi Ben, who thinks that you must have faith in God and trust in the moral order of the world, and wiser than Allen's own character Cliff who thinks that it would be unbearable to have an unconfessed murder on one's conscience.  By the end of the film, Judah appears glad that he committed the murder in order to save his relationship with his wife.  The implicit message of the film is that if morality conflicts with self-interest, sometimes the wisest course is to act unethically -- even to the point of murder.  As Judah's brother Jack says, \"you only go around once.\"  Don't let anyone else, or the demands of morality, ruin it for you.<p>\n\nIf this interpretation of the film is correct, then the film is morally noxious -- indeed, proudly so.  (In its self-conscious rejection of morality, the film differs from <i>Triumph of the Will</i>.)  This morally noxious message is central to the film's aesthetic interest: It is what makes it horrifying and dark, and a challenge to think through, and a lively criticism of Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky.  If it didn't celebrate Judah's evil choice in a way that most of us would find morally odious, it would be a forgettable film.<p>\n\nContra Gaut, artworks that unapologetically celebrate evil, whether in full moral knowledge that they are doing so (<i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i>) or without full moral knowledge (<i>Triumph of the Will</i>), can be aesthetically interesting exactly because of their moral noxiousness.  They can be horrifyingly aesthetically fascinating, like a beautiful horrible moral disaster that we loathe and condemn at the same time we can't look away.<p>\n\nOr maybe you can look away, and should.  For my moral psychological work on evil, I often need to read in detail about the Holocaust and Stalin's purges and other horrible episodes of human history; and maybe engaging with evil art is like that -- helping to fill out a perspective, but not something that anyone should feel obliged to do.<p>\n<i>March 9 ETA:</i> I've been getting interesting pushback about my interpretation of <i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i> (e.g., Taylor and Howard <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/eschwitz/posts/10213819710879540?pnref=story\">here</a>.  Let me say that the basis of my interpretation is primarily that, as I see it, Judah (the murderer) comes out looking wiser than any of the other characters.  If the film were to be neutral between Judah's perspective and more moral perspectives, it would need, I think, a character who clearly recognizes the world's lack of moral order and yet chooses morality nonetheless.  There is no such character.<p>\n\n[revised 11:43 a.m.]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/engaging-with-evil-art.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-03-07T11:43:00-08:00\">11:43 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=66096378250196958\" onclick=\"\">1 comments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/aesthetics\" rel=\"tag\">aesthetics</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Thursday, February 22, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"364696833183407405\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\">Why Moral and Philosophical Disagreements Are Especially Fertile Grounds for Rationalization (with Jon Ellis)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7aRpe7KSFuI/Wo3TwNHJzfI/AAAAAAAAAsU/2yvnMif_flIfUGRluBMYwVpt4-L9a0kLQCLcBGAs/s1600/J%2Bellis.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"200\" data-original-width=\"300\" height=\"133\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7aRpe7KSFuI/Wo3TwNHJzfI/AAAAAAAAAsU/2yvnMif_flIfUGRluBMYwVpt4-L9a0kLQCLcBGAs/s200/J%2Bellis.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\n(with <a href=\"https://jonathanellis.sites.ucsc.edu/\">Jonathan E. Ellis</a>; originally appeared at the <a href=\"http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\">Imperfect Cognitions blog</a>)<p>\n\nLast week we <a href=\"http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence_13.html\">argued</a> that your intelligence, vigilance, and academic expertise very likely doesn't do much to protect you from the normal human tendency towards rationalization \u2013 that is, from the tendency to engage in biased patterns of reasoning aimed at justifying conclusions to which you are attracted for selfish or other epistemically irrelevant reasons \u2013 and that, in fact, you may be more susceptible to rationalization than the rest of the population. This week we\u2019ll argue that moral and philosophical topics are especially fertile grounds for rationalization.<p>\n\nHere\u2019s one way of thinking about it: Rationalization, like crime, requires a motive and an opportunity. Ethics and philosophy provide plenty of both.<p>\n\nRegarding motive: Not everyone cares about every moral and philosophical issue of course. But we all have some moral and philosophical issues that are near to our hearts \u2013 for reasons of cultural or religious identity, or personal self-conception, or for self-serving reasons, or because it\u2019s comfortable, exciting, or otherwise appealing to see the world in a certain way.<p>\n\nOn day one of their philosophy classes, students are often already attracted to certain types of views and repulsed by others. They like the traditional and conservative, or they prefer the rebellious and exploratory; they like confirmations of certainty and order, or they prefer the chaotic and skeptical; they like moderation and common sense, or they prefer the excitement of the radical and unintuitive. Some positions fit with their pre-existing cultural and political identities better than others. Some positions are favored by their teachers and elders \u2013 and that\u2019s attractive to some, and provokes rebellious contrarianism in others. Some moral conclusions may be attractively convenient, while others might require unpleasant contrition or behavior change. <p>\n\nThe motive is there. So is the opportunity. Philosophical and moral questions rarely admit of straightforward proof or refutation, or a clear standard of correctness. Instead, they open into a complexity of considerations, which themselves do not admit of straightforward proof and which offer many loci for rationalization.<p>\n\nThese loci are so plentiful and diverse! Moral and philosophical arguments, for instance, often turn crucially on a \u201csense of plausibility\u201d (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-4975.00010\">Kornblith, 1999</a>); or on one\u2019s judgment of the force of a particular reason, or the significance of a consideration. Methodological judgments are likewise fundamental in philosophical and moral thinking: What argumentative tacks should you first explore? How much critical attention should you pay to your pre-theoretic beliefs, and their sources, and which ones, in which respects? How much should you trust your intuitive judgments versus more explicitly reasoned responses? Which other philosophers, and which scientists (if any), should you regard as authorities whose judgments carry weight with you, and on which topics, and how much?<p>\n\nThese questions are usually answered only implicitly, revealed in your choices about what to believe and what to doubt, what to read, what to take seriously and what to set aside. Even where they are answered explicitly, they lack a clear set of criteria by which to answer them definitively. And so, if people\u2019s preferences can influence their perceptual judgments (including possibly of size, color, and distance: Balcetis and Dunning <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014288\">2006</a>, <a href=\"https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/cognitive-dissonance-and-the-perception-of-natural-environments\">2007</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20424036\">2010</a>) what is remembered (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2270237\">Kunda 1990</a>; <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6983.html\">Mele 2001</a>), what hypotheses are envisioned (<a href=\"https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/social-hypothesis-testing-cognitive-and-motivational-mechanisms\">Trope and Liberman 1997</a>), what one attends to and for how long (<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.1743&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Lord et al. 1979</a>; <a href=\"http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/nickersonConfirmationBias.pdf\">Nickerson 1998</a>) . . . it is no leap to assume that they can influence the myriad implicit judgments, intuitions, and choices involved in moral and philosophical reasoning.<p>\n\nFurthermore, patterns of bias can compound across several questions, so that with many loci for bias to enter, the person who is only slightly biased in each of a variety of junctures in a line of reasoning can ultimately come to a very different conclusion than would someone who was not biased in the same way. Rationalization can operate by way of a series or network of \u201cmicro-instances\u201d of motivated reasoning that together have a major amplificatory effect (synchronically, diachronically, or both), or by influencing you mightily at a crucial step (Ellis, manuscript). <p>\n\nWe believe that these considerations, taken together with the considerations we advanced last week about the likely inability of intelligence, vigilance, and expertise to effectively protect us against rationalization, support the following conclusion: Few if any of us should confidently maintain that our moral and philosophical reasoning is not substantially tainted by significant, epistemically troubling degrees of rationalization. This is of course one possible explanation of the seeming intractability of philosophical disagreement.<p>\n\nOr perhaps we the authors of the post are the ones rationalizing; perhaps we are, for some reason, drawn toward a certain type of pessimism about the rationality of philosophers, and we have sought and evaluated evidence and arguments toward this conclusion in a badly biased manner? Um\u2026. No way. We have reviewed our reasoning and are sure that we were not affected by our preferences....<p>\n\nFor our full-length paper on this topic, see <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-02-22T08:00:00-08:00\">8:00 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=364696833183407405\" onclick=\"\">7\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/epistemology\" rel=\"tag\">epistemology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/metaphilosophy\" rel=\"tag\">metaphilosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Wednesday, February 21, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4134902556961711630\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence.html\">Rationalization: Why Your Intelligence, Vigilance and Expertise Probably Don't Protect You (with Jon Ellis)</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oKrs9YZ-N3I/Wo3TdMGqNvI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/x8DAvH06NfETav___ZJhiTsJpRBG4rePgCLcBGAs/s1600/J%2Bellis.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"200\" data-original-width=\"300\" height=\"133\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oKrs9YZ-N3I/Wo3TdMGqNvI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/x8DAvH06NfETav___ZJhiTsJpRBG4rePgCLcBGAs/s200/J%2Bellis.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div><p>\n\n(with <a href=\"https://jonathanellis.sites.ucsc.edu/\">Jonathan E. Ellis</a>; originally appeared at the <a href=\"http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence_13.html\">Imperfect Cognitions blog</a>)<p>\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there. You\u2019re arguing with someone \u2013 about politics, or a policy at work, or about whose turn it is to do the dishes \u2013 and they keep finding all kinds of self-serving justifications for their view. When one of their arguments is defeated, rather than rethinking their position they just leap to another argument, then maybe another. They\u2019re rationalizing \u2013coming up with convenient defenses for what they want to believe, rather than responding even-handedly to the points you're making. You try to point it out, but they deny it, and dig in more.<p>\n\nMore formally, in recent work we have defined rationalization as what occurs when a person favors a particular view as a result of some factor (such as self-interest) that is of little justificatory epistemic relevance, and then engages in a biased search for and evaluation of justifications that would seem to support that favored view.<p>\n\nYou, of course, never rationalize in this way! Or, rather, it doesn\u2019t usually feel like you do. Stepping back, you\u2019ll probably admit you do it sometimes. But maybe less than average? After all, you\u2019re a philosopher, a psychologist, an expert in reasoning \u2013 or at least someone who reads blog posts about philosophy, psychology, and reasoning. You're especially committed to the promotion of critical thinking and fair-minded reasoning. You know about all sorts of common fallacies, and especially rationalization, and are on guard for them in your own thinking. Don't these facts about you make you less susceptible to rationalization than people with less academic intelligence, vigilance, and expertise?<p>\n\nWe argue that no. You\u2019re probably just as susceptible to post-hoc rationalization, maybe even more, than the rest of the population, though the ways it manifests in your reasoning may be different. Vigilance, academic intelligence, and disciplinary expertise are not overall protective against rationalization. In some cases, they might even enhance one\u2019s tendency to rationalize, or make rationalizations more severe when they occur.<p>\n\nWhile some biases are less prevalent among those who score high on standard measures of academic intelligence, others appear to be no less frequent or powerful. <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721413480174\">Stanovich, West and Toplak (2013)</a>, reviewing several studies, find that the degree of myside bias is largely independent of measures of intelligence and cognitive ability. Dan Kahan finds that on several measures people who use more \u201cSystem 2\u201d type explicit reasoning show higher rates of motivated cognition rather than lower rates (<a href=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/2011/11/neutral-principles-motivated-cognition-and-some-problems-for-constitutional-law/\">2011</a>, <a href=\"http://journal.sjdm.org/13/13313/jdm13313.pdf\">2013</a>, <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1871503\">Kahan et al 2011</a>). Thinkers who are more knowledgeable have more facts to choose from when constructing a line of motivated reasoning (<a href=\"https://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/AJPS-2006-Taber.pdf\">Taber and Lodge 2006</a>; <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrn6c\">Braman 2009</a>). <p>\n\n\nNor does disciplinary expertise appear to be protective. For instance, Schwitzgebel and Cushman (<a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthOrder.htm\">2012</a>, <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Stability.htm\">2015</a>) presented moral dilemma scenarios to professional philosophers and comparison groups of non-philosophers, followed by the opportunity to endorse or reject various moral principles. Professional philosophers were just as prone to irrational order effects and framing effects as were the other groups, and were also at least as likely to \u201crationalize\u201d their manipulated scenario judgments by appealing to principles post-hoc in a way that would render those manipulated judgments rational. <p>\n\nFurthermore, since the mechanisms responsible for rationalization are largely non-conscious, vigilant introspection is not liable to reveal to the introspector that rationalization has occured. This may be one reason for the \u201cbias blind spot\u201d: People tend to regard themselves as less biased than others, sometimes even exhibiting more bias by objective measures the less biased they believe themselves to be (<a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.576.6754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Pronin, Gilovich and Ross 2004</a>; <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.576.6754&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">Uhlmann and Cohen 2005</a>). Indeed, efforts to reduce bias and be vigilant can amplify bias. You examine your reasoning for bias, find no bias because of your bias blind spot, and then inflate your confidence that your reasoning is not biased: \u201cI really am being completely objective and reasonable!\u201d (as suggested in <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167204271570\">Erhlinger, Gilovich and Ross 2005</a>). People with high estimates of their objectivity might also be less likely to take protective measures against bias (<a href=\"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096\">Scopeletti et al 2015</a>).<p>\n\nPartisan reasoning can be invisible to vigilant introspection for another reason: it need not occur in one fell swoop, at a sole moment or a particular inference. Rather, it can be the result of a series or network of \u201cmicro-instances\u201d of motivated reasoning (Ellis, manuscript). Celebrated cases of motivated reasoning typically involve a person whose evidence clearly points to one thing (that it\u2019s their turn, not yours, to do the dishes) but who believes the very opposite (that it\u2019s your turn). But motives can have much subtler consequences.<p>\n\nMany judgments admit of degrees, and motives can have impacts of small degree. They can affect the likelihood you assign to an outcome, or the confidence you place in a belief, or the reliability you attribute to a source of information, or the threshold for cognitive action (e.g., what would trigger your pursuit of an objection). They can affect these things in large or very small ways.<p>\n\nSuch micro-instances (you might call it motivated reasoning lite) can have significant amplificatory effects. This can happen over time, in a linear fashion. Or it can happen synchronically, spread over lots of assumptions, presuppositions, and dispositions. Or both. If introspection doesn't reveal motivated reasoning that happens in one fell swoop, micro-instances are liable to be even more elusive.<p>\n\nThis is another reason for the sobering fact that well-meaning epistemic vigilance cannot be trusted to preempt or detect rationalization. Indeed, people who care most about reasoning, or who have a high \u201c<a href=\"http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/ncs/\">need for cognition</a>\u201d, or who attend to their cognitions most responsibly, may be the most impacted of all. Their learned ability to avoid the more obvious types of reasoning errors may naturally come with cognitive tools that enable more sophisticated, but still unnoticed, rationalization. <p>\n\nComing tomorrow: <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\">Why Moral and Philosophical Disagreements Are Especially Fertile Grounds for Rationalization</a>.<p>\n\nFull length article on the topic <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Rationalization.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-02-21T12:16:00-08:00\">12:16 PM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=4134902556961711630\" onclick=\"\">5\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/epistemology\" rel=\"tag\">epistemology</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, January 05, 2018</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"5942807509466486312\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/imagining-yourself-in-anothers-shoes-vs.html\">Imagining Yourself in Another's Shoes Vs.

That which they know without pondering is their genuine knowledge.  Among babes in arms there are none that do not know to love their parents.  When they grow older, there are non that do not know to revere their elder brothers.  Treating one's parents as parents is benevolence.  Revering one's elders is righteousness.  There is nothing else to do but extend these to the world (7A15, Van Norden trans.)\n</blockquote><p>\n\nOne thing I like about this passage is that it assumes love and reverence for one's family as a given, rather than as a special achievement, portraying moral development as a matter of extending that natural love and reverence to new targets.<p>\n\nSimilarly, in passage 1A7, Mengzi notes the kindness that the vicious ruler King Xuan exhibits in saving a frightened ox from slaughter, and he urges King Xuan to extend similar kindness to the people of his kingdom.  Mengzi says that such extension is a matter of \"weighing\" things correctly -- a matter of treating similar things similarly and not overvaluing what merely happens to be nearby.<p>\n\nContrast this approach with \"The Golden Rule\": \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you\".  Contrast it also with the common advice to imagine yourself in someone else's shoes.  Golden Rule / others' shoes advice assumes self-interest as the starting point.  While Mengzian extension starts by assuming that people are already concerned about nearby others, and takes the developmental or cognitive challenge to be extending your concern beyond a narrow circle, The Golden Rule / others' shoes thinking starts by assuming egoistic self-interest, and takes the developmental or cognitive challenge to be generalizing beyond one's own self-interest.<p>\n\nMaybe we can model Golden Rule / others' shoes thinking as follows:<p>\n\n(1.) If I were in the situation of Person X, I would want to be treated according to Principle P.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n(2.) Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.\n(3.) I will treat the person according to Principle P.<p>\n\nIn contrast, maybe we can model Mengzian extension as follows:<p>\n\n(1.) I care about Person X and want to treat them well.</p></p>\n(2.) Person Y, though perhaps more distant, is relevantly similar.\n(3.) Therefore, I should also treat Person Y well.<p>\n\nThere will be other more careful and detailed formulations, but this simple sketch captures, I hope, how radically different these two ways of modeling moral cognition are.  <b>Mengzian extension models general moral concern on the natural concern we already have for those nearby, while Golden Rule / others' shoes thinking models general moral concern on concern for oneself.</b><p>\n\nI like Mengzian extension better, for three reasons.<p>\n<b>First, Mengzian extension is more psychologically plausible.</b>  People do, naturally, have concern for and compassion for others around them.  Explicit exhortations aren't necessary to bring this about.  This natural concern for and compassion for others is likely the main seed from which mature moral cognition grows.  Our moral reactions to vivid, nearby cases become the bases for more general principles and policies.<p>\n<b>Second, Mengzian extension is less ambitious -- in a good way.</b>  The Golden Rule imagines a leap from self-interest to generalized good treatment of others.  The Golden Rule is sometimes excellent and helpful advice, perhaps especially for people who are already concerned about others and thinking about how to implement that concern.  But Mengzian extension has the advantage of starting the cognitive project much nearer the target, involving less of a leap, since it only moves from natural concern about nearby cases to similar treatment of relevantly similar but more distant cases.<p>\n<b>\nThird, Mengzian extension could arguably be turned back upon yourself,</b> if you are one of those people who has trouble standing up for your own interests and rights.  You would want to stand up for your loved ones and help them flourish.  Applying Mengzian extension, extend the same kindness to yourself that you would give to give to others you care about.  If you'd want your sister to be able to take a vacation, realize that you owe the same courtesy to yourself.  [Thanks to Yvonne Tam for emphasizing this point in discussion with me.  See also my post \"<a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/03/perils-of-sweetheart.html\">Perils of the Sweetheart</a>\"]<p>\n\nAlthough both Mengzi and Rousseau endorse the motto that \"human nature is good\", and have views that are similar in important ways (as I explore <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/HumanNature.htm\">here</a>), this is one difference between them.  In both <i>Emile</i> and <i>Discourse on Inequality</i>, Rousseau emphasizes self-concern as the starting point, treating natural pity or compassion for others as secondary and derivative.  He endorses the foundational importance of the Golden Rule, concluding that \"Love of men derived from love of self is the principle of human justice\" (<i>Emile</i>, trans. Bloom, p. 235).<p>\n\nThis difference between Mengzi and Rousseau does not, I think, reflect a general cultural difference between ancient China and the West.  Kongzi (Confucius), for example, endorses something like the Golden Rule: \"Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire\" (15.24, Slingerland trans.)  Mozi and Xunzi, also writing in period, imagine people acting mostly or entirely selfishly, until society artificially imposes regulations upon us, and so they cannot see Mengzian extension as the core of moral development.  (However, also see Mozi's argument for impartial concern that starts by assuming that one is concerned for one's parents [ch. 16].)  The extension approach is specifically Mengzian rather than generally Chinese.<p>\n\n[<a href=\"http://www.iep.utm.edu/mencius/\">image source</a>]</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\nPosted by\n<span class=\"fn\">Unknown</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\nat\n<a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/imagining-yourself-in-anothers-shoes-vs.html\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"permanent link\"><abbr class=\"published\" title=\"2018-01-05T07:33:00-08:00\">7:33 AM</abbr></a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-comment-link\">\n<a class=\"comment-link\" href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26951738&amp;postID=5942807509466486312\" onclick=\"\">4\ncomments</a>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-backlinks post-comment-link\">\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-icons\">\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-2\">\n<span class=\"post-labels\">\nLabels:\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/chinese%20philosophy\" rel=\"tag\">chinese philosophy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/search/label/moral%20psychology\" rel=\"tag\">moral psychology</a>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-3\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"date-outer\">\n<h2 class=\"date-header\"><span>Friday, December 01, 2017</span></h2>\n<div class=\"date-posts\">\n<div class=\"post-outer\">\n<div class=\"post hentry uncustomized-post-template\">\n<a name=\"4323464961763813519\"></a>\n<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/12/aiming-for-moral-mediocrity.html\">Aiming for Moral Mediocrity</a>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"post-header-line-1\"></div>\n<div class=\"post-body entry-content\">\n<p>I've been working on this essay off and on for years, \"Aiming for Moral Mediocrity\".  I think I've finally pounded it into circulating shape and <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">I'm ready for feedback</a>.<p>\n\nI have an empirical thesis and a normative thesis.  The empirical thesis is that <b>most people aim to be <i>morally mediocre</i></b>.  They aim to be about as morally good as their peers, not especially better, not especially worse.  This mediocrity has two aspects.  It is peer-relative rather than absolute, and it is middling rather than extreme.  We do not aim to be good, or non-bad, or to act permissibly rather than impermissibly, by fixed moral standards.  Rather, we notice the typical behavior of people we regard as our peers and we aim to behave broadly within that range.  We -- most of us -- look around, notice how others are acting, then calibrate toward so-so.<p>\n\nThis empirical thesis is, I think, plausible on the face of it.  It also receives some support from two recent subliteratures in social psychology and behavioral economics.<p>\n\nOne is the literature on <i>following the (im-)moral crowd</i>.  I'm thinking especially of the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini\">Robert B. Cialdini</a> and <a href=\"https://philosophy.sas.upenn.edu/people/cristina-bicchieri\">Cristina Bicchieri</a>.  Cialdini argues that \"injunctive norms\" (that is, social or moral admonitions) most effectively promote norm-compliant behavior when they align with \"descriptive norms\" (that is, facts about how people actually behave).  People are <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~prestos/Downloads/DC/pdfs/Krupka_Oct13_Cialdinietal1990.pdf\">less likely to litter</a> when they see others being neat, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/586910\">more likely to reuse their hotel towels</a> when they learn that others also do so, and <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x\">more likely to reduce their household energy consumption</a> when they see that they are using more than their neighbors.  Bicchieri argues that people are <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.621/abstract\">more likely to be selfish in \"dictator games\"</a> when they are led to believe that earlier participants had mostly been selfish and that <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/norms-in-the-wild-9780190622053?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">convincing communities to adopt new health practices</a> like family planning and indoor toilet use typically requires persuading people that their neighbors will also comply.  It appears that <b>people are more likely to abide by social or moral norms if they believe that others are also doing so.</b><p>\n\nThe other relevant literature concerns <i>moral self-licensing</i>.  A number of studies suggest that after having performed good acts, people are likely to behave less morally well than after performing a bad or neutral act.  For example, <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610363538\">after having done something good for the environment</a>, people might tend to make more selfish choices in a dictator game.  Even just recalling recent ethical behavior might <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21402752\">reduce people's intentions to donate blood, money, and time</a>.  The idea is that people are more motivated to behave well when their previous bad behavior is salient and less motivated to behave well when their previous good behavior is salient.  They appear to calibrate toward some middle state.<p>\n\nOne alternative hypothesis is that people aim not for mediocrity but rather for something better than that, though short of sainthood.  Phenomenologically, that might be how it seems to people.  Most people think that they are somewhat above average in moral traits like honesty and fairness (<a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616673878\">Tappin and McKay 2017</a>); and maybe then people mostly think that they should more or less stay the course.  An eminent ethicist once told me he was aiming for a moral \"B+\".  However, I suspect that<b> most of us who like to think of ourselves as aiming for substantially above-average moral goodness aren't really willing to put in the work and sacrifice required</b>.  A close examination of how we actually calibrate our behavior will reveal us wiggling and veering toward a lower target.  (Compare the undergraduate who says they're \"aiming for B+\" in a class but who wouldn't be willing to put in more work if they received a C on the first exam.  It's probably better to say that they are <i>hoping</i> for a B+ than that they are <i>aiming</i> for one.)<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n\nMy normative thesis is that <b>it's morally mediocre to aim for moral mediocrity</b>.  Generally speaking, it's somewhat morally bad, but not terribly bad, to aim for the moral middle.<p>\n\nIn defending this view, I'm mostly concerned to rebut the charge that it's perfectly morally fine to aim for mediocrity.  Two common excuses, which I think wither upon critical scrutiny, are the Happy Coincidence Defense and The-Most-You-Can-Do Sweet Spot.  <b>The Happy Coincidence Defense is an attractive rationalization strategy that attempts to justify doing what you prefer to do by arguing that it's also for the moral best</b> -- for example, that taking this expensive vacation now is really the morally best choice because you owe it to you family, and it will refresh you for your very important work, and....  <b>The Most-You-Can-Do Sweet Spot is a similarly attractive rationalization strategy that relies on the idea that if you tried to be any morally better than you in fact are, you would end up being morally worse</b> -- because you would collapse along the way, maybe, or you would become sanctimonious and intolerant, or you would lose the energy and joie de vivre on which your good deeds depend, or....  Of course it can sometimes be true that by Happy Coincidence your preferences align with the moral best or that you are already precisely in The-Most-You-Can-Do Sweet Spot.  But this reasoning is suspicious when deployed repeatedly to justify otherwise seemingly mediocre moral choices.<p>\n\nAnother normative objection is the <a href=\"http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2017/11/is-it-perfectly-fine-to-aim-to-be.html\">Fairness Objection</a>, which I discussed on the blog last month.  Since (by stipulation) most of your peers aren't making the sacrifices necessary for peer-relative moral excellence, it's unfair for you to be blamed for also declining to make such sacrifices.  If the average person in your financial condition gives X% to charity, for example, it would be unfair to blame you for not giving more.  If your colleagues down the hall cheat, shirk, lie, and flake X amount of the time, it's only fair that you should get to do the same.<p>\n<b>The simplest response to the Fairness Objection is to appeal to absolute moral standards.</b>  Although <i>some</i> norms are peer-relative, so that they become morally optional if most of your peers fail to comply with them, other norms aren't like that.  A Nazi death camp guard is wrong to kill Jews even if that is normal behavior among his peers.  More moderately, sexism, racism, ableism, elitism, and so forth are wrong and blameworthy, even if they are common among your peers (though blame is probably also partly mitigated if you are less biased than average).  If you're an insurance adjuster who denies or slow-walks important health benefits on shaky grounds because you guess the person won't sue, the fact that other insurance adjusters might do the same in your place is again at best only partly mitigating.  It would likely be unfair to blame you <i>more</i> than your peers are blamed; but if you violate absolute moral standards you deserve <i>some</i> blame, regardless of your peers' behavior.<p>\n\n-----------------------------------------<p>\n\nFull length version of the paper <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm\">here</a>.<p>\n\nAs always, comments welcome either by email to me or in the comments field of this post.

In contrast, people in the top half of ability had more accurate estimations (even tending to underestimate a bit).  The average participant in each quartile rated themselves as above average, and the correlation between self-rated skill and measured skill was small.<p>\n\nFor example, here's Kruger and Dunning's chart for logic ability and logic scores:<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zIIwto8x3Lk/Wg3WuerIrQI/AAAAAAAAAe4/RMK6a_j_Pl8IMkfYXiNNJ5PIlMEKlDuvQCLcBGAs/s1600/KrugerDunning.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"399\" data-original-width=\"447\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zIIwto8x3Lk/Wg3WuerIrQI/AAAAAAAAAe4/RMK6a_j_Pl8IMkfYXiNNJ5PIlMEKlDuvQCLcBGAs/s1600/KrugerDunning.jpg\"/></a></div></p></p></p></div></div></div></div></div>\n(Kruger &amp; Dunning 1999, p. 1129).<p>\n\nKruger and Dunning's explanation is that poor skill at (say) logical reasoning not only impairs one's performance at logical reasoning tasks but also impairs one's ability to evaluate one's own performance at logical reasoning tasks.  You need to know that affirming the consequent is a logical error in order to realize that you've just committed a logical error in affirming the consequent.  Otherwise, you're likely to think, \"P implies Q, and Q is true, so P must be true.  Right!  Hey, I'm doing great!\"<p>\n\nAlthough popular presentations of the Kruger-Dunning effect tend to generalize it to all skill domains, it seems unlikely that it does generalize universally.  In domains where evaluating one's success doesn't depend on the skill in question, and instead depends on simpler forms of observation and feedback, one might expect more realistic self-evaluations by novices.  (I haven't noticed a clear, systematic discussion of cases where Dunning-Kruger doesn't apply, though <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19739881\">Kahneman &amp; Klein 2009</a> is related; tips welcome.)  For example: footraces.  I'd wager that people who are slow runners don't tend to think that they are above average in running speed.  They might not have perfect expectations; they might show some self-serving optimistic bias (<a href=\"http://psych.utoronto.ca/users/peterson/psy430s2001/Taylor%20S%20Illusion%20&amp;%20Well%20Being%20Psych%20Bull%201988.pdf\">Taylor &amp; Brown 1988</a>), but we probably won't see the almost flat line characteristic of Kruger-Dunning.  You don't have to be a fast runner to evaluate your running speed.  You just need to notice that others tend to run faster than you.  It's not like logic where skill at the task and skill at self-evaluation are closely related.<p>\n\nSo... what about ethics?  <b>Ought we to expect a moral Dunning-Kruger Effect?</b><p>\n<b>My guess is: yes.  Evaluating one's own ethical or unethical behavior is a skill that itself depends on one's ethical abilities.</b>  The least ethical people are typically also the least capable of recognizing what counts as an ethical violation and how serious the violation is -- especially, perhaps, when thinking about their own behavior.  I don't want to over-commit on this point.  Certainly there are exceptions.  But as a general trend, this strikes me as plausible.<p>\n\nConsider sexism.  The most sexist people tend to be the people least capable of understanding what constitutes sexist behavior and what makes sexist behavior unethical.  They will tend either to regard themselves as not sexist or to regard themselves only as \"sexist\" in a non-pejorative sense.  (\"Yeah, so what, I'm a 'sexist'.  I think men and women are different.  If you don't, you're a fool.\")  Similarly, the most habitual liars might not see anything bad in lying or just assume that everyone else who isn't just a clueless sucker also lies when convenient.<p>\n\nIt probably doesn't make sense to think that overall morality can be accurately captured in a single unidimensional scale -- just like it probably doesn't make sense to think that there's one correct unidimensional scale for skill at baseball or for skill as a philosopher or for being a good parent.  And yet, clearly some baseball players, philosophers, and parents are better than others.  There are great, good, mediocre, and crummy versions of each.  I think it's okay as a first approximation to think that there are more and less ethical people overall.  And if so, we can at least imagine a <i>rough </i>scale.<p>\n\nWith that important caveat, then, consider the following possible relationships between one's overall moral character and one's opinion about one's overall moral character:<p>\n\nDunning-Kruger (more self-enhancement for lower moral character):<p>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B6vu93jtMUQ/Wg3vy-0QtFI/AAAAAAAAAfY/TUYyo8bqhr8js73Ibs9kbYhCakSY3EyEgCLcBGAs/s1600/DK-DK2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"338\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B6vu93jtMUQ/Wg3vy-0QtFI/AAAAAAAAAfY/TUYyo8bqhr8js73Ibs9kbYhCakSY3EyEgCLcBGAs/s320/DK-DK2.jpg\" width=\"320\"/></a><p>\n\n[Note: Sorry for the cruddy-looking images.

Across nine different moral issues, we found that  ethicists reported behaving overall no morally differently than the other two groups  , though on some issues, especially vegetarianism and charitable giving, they endorsed more stringent attitudes.  (In some cases, we also had observational behavioral data that didn't depend on self-report.  Here too we found no overall difference.)  Schoenegger and Wagner  translated our questionnaire into German   and added a few new questions, then distributed it by email to professors in German-speaking countries, achieving an overall response rate of 29.5% [corrected Mar 23].  (Josh and I had a response rate of 58%.)  With a couple of exceptions, Schoenegger and Wagner report similar results. \n\nThe most interesting difference between Schoenegger and Wagner's results and Josh's and my results concerns vegetarianism. \n The Questions:  \n\nWe originally asked three questions about vegetarianism.  In the first part of the questionnaire, we asked respondents to rate \"regularly eating the meat of mammals, such as beef or pork\" on a nine-point scale from \"very morally bad\" to \"very morally good\", with \"morally neutral\" in the middle. \n\nIn the second part of the questionnaire, we asked: \n\n17.\u2003During about how many meals or snacks per week do you eat the meat of mammals such as beef or pork? \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009enter number of times per week ____ \n\n18.\u2003Think back on your last evening meal, not including snacks. Did you eat the meat of a mammal during that meal? \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003yes \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003no \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2009\u25a1\u2003don\u2019t recall \n U.S. Results in 2009   \n\nOn the attitude question,  60% of ethicist respondents rated meat-eating somewhere on the \"bad\" side   of the nine-point scale, compared to 45% of non-ethicist philosophers and only 19% of professors from other departments (ANOVA, F\u2009=\u200917.0, p\u2009<\u20090.001).  We also found substantial differences by both gender and age, with  women and younger respondents more likely to condemn meat-eating  .  For example, 81% of female philosophy respondents born 1960 or later rated eating the meat of mammals as morally bad, compared to 7% of male non-philosophers born before 1960.  That's a huge difference in attitude! \n\nEight percent of respondents rated it at 1 or 2 on the nine-point scale -- either \"very bad\" or adjacent to very bad -- including 11% of ethicists (46/564 overall, 22/193 of ethicists). \n\nOn self-report of behavior, Josh and I found much less difference.   On our \"previous evening meal\" question, we detected at best a statistically marginal difference among the three main analysis groups  : 37% of ethicists reported having eaten meat at the previous evening meal, compared to 33% of non-ethicist philosophers and 45% of non-philosophers (chi-squared\u2009=\u20095.7, p\u2009=\u20090.06, excluding two respondents who answered \"don\u2019t recall\"). \n\nThe \"meals per week\" question was actually designed in part as a test of \"socially desirable responding\" or a tendency to fudge answers: We thought it would be difficult to accurately estimate the number, thus it would be tempting for respondents to fudge a bit.  And mathematically, they did seem to be guilty of fudging: For example, 21% of respondents who reported eating meat at one meal per week also reported eating meat at the previous evening meal.  Even if we assume that meat is only consumed at evening meals, the number should be closer to 14% (1/7).  If we assume, more plausibly, that approximately half of all meat meals are evening meals, then the number should be closer to 7%.  With that caveat in mind, on the meals-per-week question we found a mean of 4.1 for ethicists, compared to 4.6 for non-ethicist philosophers and 5.3 for non-philosophers (ANOVA [square-root transformed], F\u2009=\u20095.2, p\u2009=\u20090.006). \n\nWe concluded that although a majority of U.S. ethicists, especially younger ethicists and women ethicists, thought eating meat was morally bad, they ate meat at approximately the same rate as did the non-ethicists. \n German Results in 2018:  \n\nSchoenegger and Wagner find, similarly, a majority of German ethicist respondents rating meat-eating as bad: 67%.   Evidently, a majority of U.S. and German ethicists think that eating meat is morally bad.  \n However, among the non-ethicist professors, Schoenegger and Wagner find higher rates of condemnation of meat-eating than Josh and I found  : 63% among German-speaking non-ethicist philosophers in 2018 compared to our 45% in the U.S. in 2009 (80/127 vs. 92/204, z = 3.2, p = .001), and even more strikingly 40% among German-speaking professors from departments other than philosophy in 2018 compared to only 19% in the U.S. in 2009 (52/131 vs/ 31/167, z = 4.0, p < .001; [note 1]). \n German professors were also much more likely than U.S. professors in 2009 to think that eating meat is  very   bad, with 18% rating it 1 or 2 on the scale, including 23% of ethicists   (57/408 and 35/150, excluding non-respondents; two-proportion test U.S. vs German: overall z = 2.8, p = .005, ethicists z = 2.9, p = .004). \n\n\nApparently, German-speaking professors are not as fond of their wurst as cultural stereotypes might suggest! \n\nA number of explanations are possible: One is that in general German academics are more pro-vegetarian than are U.S. academics.  Another is that attitudes toward vegetarianism are changing swiftly over time (as suggested by the age differences in Josh's and my study) and that the nine years between 2009 and 2018 saw a substantial shift in both cultures.  Still another concerns non-response bias. (For non-philosophers, Schoenegger and Wagner's response rate was 30%, while Josh's and mine was 53%.) \n\nIn Schoenegger and Wagner's data, ethicists report having eaten less meat at the previous evening meal than the other two groups: 25%, vs. 40% of non-ethicist philosophers and 39% of the non-philosophers (chi-squared = 9.3, p = .01 [note 2]).  The meals per week data are less clear.  Schoenegger report 2.1 meals per week for ethicists, compared to 2.8 and 3.0 for non-ethicist philosophers and non-philosophers respectively (ANOVA, F = 3.4, p = .03), but their data are highly right skewed, and due to skew Josh and I had used a square-root transformation for original 2009 analysis.  A similar square-root transformation on Schoenegger and Wagner's raw data eliminates any statistically detectable difference (F = 0.8, p = .45). And there is again evidence of fudging in the meals-per-week responses: Among those reporting only one meat meal per week, for example, 18% reported having had meat at their previous evening meal. \n\nIf we take the meals-per-week data at face value, the German respondents ate substantially less meat in 2018 than did the U.S. respondents in 2009: 2.6 meals for the Germans vs. 4.6 for the U.S. respondents (median 2 vs median 4, Mann-Whitney W = 287793, p < .001).  However, the difference was not statistically detectable on the previous evening meal question: 38% U.S. vs 34% German (z = 1.3, p = .21). \n\nAll of this is a bit difficult to interpret, but here's the tentative conclusion I draw: \n \nGerman professors today -- especially ethicists -- are more likely to condemn meat eating than were U.S. professors ten years ago.  They might also be a bit less likely to eat meat, again perhaps especially the ethicists, though that is not entirely clear and might reflect a bit of fudging in the self-reports.  \n\nThe other difference Schoenegger and Wagner found was in the question of whether ethicists were on the whole more likely than other professors to embrace stringent moral views -- but full analysis of this will require some detail and will have to wait for another time. \n\n\n********************************************* \n\nNote 1: In the published paper, Schoenegger and Wagner report 39% instead of the 40% I find in reanalyzing their raw data.  This might either be a rounding error [39.69%] or some small difference in our analyses. \n\nNote 2: In the published paper, Schoenegger and Wagner report 24%, which again might be a rounding error (from 24.65%) or a small analytic difference. \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n                                  \n    \n\n\nErnest Sosa gave a lovely and fascinating talk yesterday at UC Riverside on the importance of \"firsthand intuitive insight\" in philosophy.  It has me thinking about the extent to which we ought, or ought not, defer to ethical experts when we are otherwise inclined to disagree with their conclusions. \n\nTo illustrate the idea of firsthand intuitive insight, Sosa gives two examples.  One concerns mathematics.  Consider a student who learns that the Pythagorean theorem is true without learning its proof.  This student knows that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 but doesn't have any insight into  why   it's true.  Contrast this student with one who masters the proof and consequently does understand why it's true.  The second student, but not the first, has firsthand intuitive insight.  Sosa's other example is in ethics.  One child bullies another.  Her mother, seeing the act and seeing the grief in the face of the other child, tells the bullying child that she should apologize.  The child might defer to her mother's ethical judgment, sincerely concluding she really should apologize, but without understanding why what she has done is bad enough to require apology.  Alternatively, she might come to genuinely notice the other child's grief and more fully understand how her bullying was inappropriate, and thus gain firsthand intuitive insight into the need for apology.  (I worry that firsthand intuitive insight is a bit of a slippery concept, but I don't think I can do more with it here.) \n Sosa argues that a central aim of much of philosophy is firsthand intuitive insight of this sort.    In the sciences and in history, it's often enough just to know that some fact is true (that helium has two protons, that the Qin Dynasty fell in 206 BCE).  On such matters, we happily defer to experts.  In philosophy, we're less likely to accept a truth without having our own personal, firsthand intuitive insight.  Expert metaphysicians might almost universally agree that barstool-shaped-aggregates but not barstools themselves supervene on collections of particles arranged barstoolwise.  Expert ethicists might almost universally agree that a straightforward pleasure-maximizing utilitarian ethics would require radical revision of ordinary moral judgments.  But we're not inclined to just take them at their word.  We want to understand for ourselves how it is so. \n\nThis seems right.  And yet, there's a bit of a puzzle in it, if we think that it's important that our ethical opinions be  correct  .  (Yes, I'm assuming that ethics is a domain in which there are correct and incorrect opinions.)  What should we do when the majority of philosophical experts think P, but your own (apparent) firsthand intuitive insight suggests not-P?  If you care about correctness above all, maybe you should defer to the experts, despite your lack of understanding.  But Sosa appears to think, as I suspect many of us do, that often the right course instead is to stand  steadfast  , continuing to judge according to your own best independent reasoning. \n\nBorrowing an example from  Sarah McGrath's work on moral deference  , consider the case of vegetarianism.  Based on  some of my work  , I think that probably the majority of professional ethicists in the United States believe that it is normally morally wrong to eat the meat of factory-farmed animals.  This might also be true  in German-speaking countries  .  Impressionistically, most of the philosophers I know who have given the issue serious and detailed consideration come to endorse vegetarianism, including two of the most prominent ethicists currently alive,  Peter Singer   and  Christine Korsgaard  .  Now suppose that you haven't given the matter nearly as much thought as they have, but you have given it some thought.  You're inclined still to think that eating meat is okay, and you can maybe mount one or two plausible-seeming defenses of your view.  Should you defer to their ethical expertise? \n\nSosa compares philosophical reasoning with archery.  You not only want to hit the target (the truth), you want to do so by the exercise of your own skill (your own intuitive insight), rather than by having an expert guide your hand (deference to experts).  I agree that ideally this is so.  It's nice when you have have both truth and intuitive insight!  But when the aim of hitting the target conflicts with the aim of doing so by your own intuitive insight, your preference should depend on the stakes.  If it's an archery contest, you don't want the coach's help: The most important thing is the test of your own skill.  But if you're a subsistence hunter who needs dinner, then you probably ought to take any help you can get, if the target looks like it's about to escape.  And isn't ethics (outside the classroom, at least) more like subsistence hunting than like an archery contest?   What should matter most is whether you actually come to the right moral conclusion about eating meat (or whatever) not whether you get there by your own insight.    Excessive emphasis on the individual's need for intuitive insight, at the cost of truth or correctness, risks turning ethics into a kind of sport. \n\nSo maybe, then, you should defer to the majority of ethical experts, and conclude that it is normally wrong to eat factory-farmed meat, even if that conclusion doesn't accord with your own best attempts at insight? \n\nWhile I'm tempted to say this, I simultaneously feel pulled in Sosa's direction -- and perhaps I should defer to his expertise as one of the world's leading epistemologists!  There's something I like about non-deference in philosophy, and our prizing of people's standing fast in their own best judgments, even in the teeth of disagreement by better-informed experts.  So here are four brief defenses of non-deference.  I fear none of them is quite sufficient.  But maybe in combination they will take us somewhere? \n (1.) The \"experts\" might not be experts.    This is McGrath's defense of non-deference in ethics.  Despite their seeming expertise, great ethicists have often been horribly wrong in the past.  See Aristotle on slavery,  Kant on bastards, masturbation, homosexuality, wives, and servants  , the  consensus of philosophers in favor of World War I  , and ethicists'  seeming inability   to reason better even about  trolley problems   than non-ethicists. \n (2.) Firsthand intuitive insight might be highly intrinsically valuable.    I'm a big believer in the intrinsic value of knowledge (including  self-knowledge  ).  One of the most amazing and important things about life on Earth is that sometimes we bags of mostly water can stop and reflect on some of the biggest, most puzzling questions that there are.  An important component of the intrinsic value of philosophical reflection is the real understanding that comes with firsthand intuitive insight, or seeming insight, or partial insight -- our ability to reach our  own   philosophical judgments instead of simply deferring to experts.  This might be valuable enough to merit some substantial loss of ethical correctness to preserve it. \n (3.) The philosophical community might profit from diversity of moral opinion, even if individuals with unusual views are likely to be incorrect.    The philosophical community as a whole might, over time, be more likely to converge upon correct ethical views if it fosters diversity of opinion.  If we all defer to whoever seems to be most expert, we might reach consensus too fast on a wrong, or at least a narrow and partial, ethical view.  Compare  Kuhn   and  Longino   on the value of diversity in scientific opinion: Intellectual communities need stubborn defenders of unlikely views, even if those stubborn folks are probably wrong -- since sometimes they have an important piece of the truth that others are missing. \n (4.) Proper moral motivation might require acting from one's own insight rather than from moral deference.    The bully who apologizes out of deference gives, I think, a less perfect apology than the bully who has firsthand intuitive insight into the need to apologize.  Maybe in some cases, being motivated by one's own intuitive insight is so morally important that it's better to do the ethically wrong thing on the basis of your imperfect but non-deferential insight than to do the ethically right thing deferentially. \n\nAs I said, none of these defenses of non-deference seems quite enough on its own.  Even if the experts  might   be wrong (Point 1), from a bird's-eye perspective it seems like our best guess should be that they're not.  And the considerations in Points 2-4 seem plausibly to be only secondary from the perspective of the person who wants really to have ethically correct views by which to guide her behavior. \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n                \n Some academic disciplines have direct relevance to day-to-day life.  Studying these disciplines, you might think, would have an influence on one's practical behavior.  Studying nutritional health, it seems plausible to suppose, would have an influence of some sort on  your food choices.  Studying the stock market would likely have an influence on your investment strategies.  Studying parenting styles in developmental psychology would have an influence on your parenting decisions.  The effects might not be huge: A scholar of nutrition might not be able to entirely sacrifice Twinkies.  A scholar of parenting styles might sometimes lose her temper in ways she knows from her research to be counterproductive.  But it would be strange if studying such topics had  no effect whatsoever   -- if there were a perfect isolation between one's research on nutrition, investment, or parenting and one's personal food choices, investments, and approaches to parenting. \n   \n[A doctor doing what doctors  in fact don't do very much of  .] \n\nOther academic topics have tenuous connections at best to practical matters of day-to-day life: studying the first second of the Big Bang, or mereological approaches to objecthood, or tortoise-shell divination in ancient China. Of course, studying such things  could   have behavioral effects.  Maybe immersion in Big Bang cosmology inspires one to a broader, less parochial worldview.  But I don't think we should particularly expect that or think something is strange if it doesn't.  It's not strange for a cosmologist to be parochial in the same way it would be for an anti-trans-fat health researcher to not attempt to reduce her own trans-fat intake. \n\nEthics seems clearly to be in the category of academic disciplines that are directly relevant to scholars' day-to-day lives.  Not every sub-issue of every sub-specialization of ethics is so, of course.  Some ethical questions are highly abstract or concern matters irrelevant to the immediate choices of the scholars' lives; but few ethicists spend all of their energy on issues of that sort.  Issues like our obligations to the poor, the ethics of honesty and kindness, animal rights and environmentalism, prejudice, structural injustices in our society, the proper weighing of selfish concerns against the demands of others, the question of how much to abide by laws or directives with which you disagree -- all seem directly relevant to our lives.  It would be odd if devoting a substantial part of one's career to thinking about such issues had no influence of any sort on one's day-to-day behavior. \n\nAnd yet it's not clear to me that studying ethics does have any influence on day-to-day behavior.   Across a wide range of studies  , my collaborators and I have found no convincing evidence of systematic behavioral differences between ethicists and non-ethicists of similar social background.  Also, impressionistically, in my personal interactions with professional ethicists, my sense is that they behave overall similarly to non-ethicists.  Furthermore, there's  little evidence that university-level ethics classes influence students' behavior   either. \n\nMaybe studying ethics does sometimes have a practical effect.  It would, in my mind, be stunning if studying ethics never had any influence of any sort on one's behavioral choices!  But the effects, if any, are subtle and difficult to detect empirically. \n\nWhy this should be so is an underappreciated puzzle. \n\nThe easiest answers -- \"academic ethics is all abstract and impractical\", \"ethics is all post-hoc rationalization of what you were going to do anyway\", \"our immoral desires are so compelling that no amount of rational thought could lead us to act otherwise\" -- don't withstand critical scrutiny as fully adequate answers (although each may have some element of truth). \n\nFor several of my imperfect attempts to resolve this puzzle, see: \n\n\" The Moral Behavior of Ethicists and the Power of Reason  \" (with Joshua Rust),  Advances in Experimental Moral Psychology   (ed. H. Sarkissian and J. Wright, 2014). \n\n\" Rationalization in Moral and Philosophical Thought  \" (with Jon Ellis),  Moral Inferences   (ed. J.F. Bonnefon and B. Tremoliere, 2017). \n\n\" Aiming for Moral Mediocrity  \" (manuscript in draft). \n\nI'm still banging my head against it. \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n               \n by Eric Schwitzgebel and Christopher McVey  \n\n... or at least this is so for one narrative we've tried and one type of philosophical argument. \n Introduction   \n\nFrom 2009 to 2015, Eric published a series of studies that consistently found, using a wide variety of measures, that ethics professors do not behave any morally better than comparison groups of other professors (summarized  here  ).  One simple explanation (favored, for example, by Jon Haidt in  his discussion   of Eric's work) is that philosophical moral reflection has little to no influence on people's moral behavior.  However, Eric and his frequent collaborator Joshua Rust have been hesitant to draw that conclusion without more empirical evidence (see  here   and  here   for possible alternative explanations). \n\nMeanwhile, Eric's PhD student Chris was growing interested in the power of narratives to change behavior.  So we decided to collaborate on a project to compare the influence of narrative and argument on charitable giving. \n Design   \n\nFor our argument, we chose an argument constructed by philosopher Peter Singer with the aim of convincing ordinary readers to donate to charity.  The argument was originally written for a paper in draft by Luke Buckland, Matthew Lindauer, David Rodriguez-Arias, and Carissa Veliz.  (Thanks to them and to Peter Singer for sharing this argument with us.)  We supplemented Singer's argument with some additional clarificatory text.  It's a typical Singer-style argument, emphasizing that people have a duty to prevent death and suffering due to extreme poverty by donating money that they would otherwise spend on luxuries, and that our physical distance from those who are suffering does not excuse us from the obligation to help. \n\nFor our narrative, we chose a true story, about the same word-length as the argument, about a family rescued from slavery by a charitable donation, which we adapted from the website of a charitable organization. \n\nParticipants were 918 MTurk workers in the United States.  We divided them into four conditions: (1.) narrative only, (2.) argument only, (3.) narrative + argument, and (4.) control (who received a similar-length text from a middle-school physics textbook).  Participants were then asked to rate, on a 7-point scale, how much they agreed or disagreed with statements about the ethics of donation and their own motivation to donate (e.g., \"It is morally good to give money to charities that help those in extreme poverty\", \"Currently I feel motivated to give money to a charity that helps people in extreme poverty\").  In Experiment 1, we then asked them a hypothetical question about how much they would give to a charity if we offered them a bonus of $10.  In Experiment 2, we replaced the hypothetical-donation language with a lottery choice.  We'll report only on Experiment 2 here, but the results of Experiment 1 were very similar. \n\nHere is the exact language for the lottery choice:\n Upon completion of this study, 10% of participants in this study will receive an additional $10. You have the option to donate some portion of this $10 to one of six well-known charities that have been shown to effectively fight suffering due to extreme poverty. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, the portion you decide to keep will appear as a bonus credited to your Mechanical Turk worker account, and the portion you decide to donate will be given to the charity you pick from the list below. If you are one of the recipients of the additional $10, how much of your additional $10 would you like to donate?  \n\nParticipants then ticked a number on a scale from $0 to $10 in dollar intervals, indicating how much they would donate if they won the $10. \n (A big thanks to  The Life You Can Save  , especially Jon Behar, for funding this study!) \n\nFinally, we asked questions designed to measure \"narrative transportation\" (i.e., how immersive and moving they found the narrative, or argument, or physics text), adapted from  Green and Brock 2000  . \n\nWe thought we'd share some preliminary results.  We emphasize that these results are only preliminary.  Later, we'll want to double-check our numbers, confirm that we got the exclusions exactly right, etc.  (We have a preregistration at  Open Science Foundation  , but we haven't made it public yet.) \n Results   \n\nMean amount donated, by condition: \n   \n\n(Apologies for blurry image.  Click to enhance.  Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.) \n\nStatistically, the conditions are different (ANOVA [913,3], F=4.99, p = .002).  In planned, pre-registered one-tailed t-tests, we found that the narrative and narrative+argument conditions generated more donation than the control condition (p = .02, .001) but the argument condition did not (p = .48).  Similarly in a multiple regression analysis we found that being in one of the narrative conditions (narrative only or narrative+argument) predicted donation amount but being in one of the argumentative conditions was not statistically significantly predictive.   In other words, exposure to a Singer-style philosophical argument had no statistically detectable effect on charitable giving, but exposure to a narrative about a family rescued from slavery did have a detectable effect.    This was also true in Experiment 1, concerning hypothetical donation. \n\nThe results were even clearer for the measure of ethical opinion and motivation to donate, which was scored on a scale from 5 to 35, based on 5 questions:\n   \n\nIt's not a huge effect size -- about 2 points on the scale -- but it's easier to see how the results for argument and control are similar to each other and different from the results for narrative and narrative+argument, which are also similar to each other (ANOVA [913,3], F=10.8, p < .001; one-tailed t vs. control condition: argument p = .71, narrative p < .001, nar+arg p < .001). \n Similarly to the lottery donation results, a regression analysis of reported motivation and moral opinion finds being in a narrative condition predictive and being in an argument condition non-predictive. \n\nAs expected, we also found that participants reported more narrative transportation in the narrative and narrative+argument conditions than in the other conditions (ANOVA, p < .001) and that narrative transport, amount given, and motivation to give were mutually correlated (transport-amount given, r = .24; transport-motivation, r = .40, motivation-amount given, r = .50; all p's < .001). \n Conclusion   \n We regard this as preliminary evidence that exposure to at least one type of narrative influences charitable giving, motivation, and opinion, while exposure to one common type of philosophical argument has little if any influence.  \n\nIn our teaching, we also seem to find that Singer-style arguments have little effect on moral opinion or motivation to donate.  In another series of studies (collaborative with Peter Singer and Brad Cokelet), which we hope to be able to report on soon, professors and TAs at UC Riverside taught lower-division philosophy students philosophical arguments for charitable donation and for vegetarianism.  In subsequent questionnaires, students' self-reported attitudes toward charity don't appear to have been much influenced by the arguments, but their self-reported attitudes toward vegetarianism do appear to have been influenced. \n\nThis is not to deny that  some   people are influenced to donate by Singer's arguments.  Eric believes that he has been, for example.  But the effect might be weak or uncommon or not effectively produced by brief exposures. \n\nIn follow-up research, we plan to see if we find similar results with different types of arguments and narratives, and we hope to zero in on what underlying factors are at work behind these effects.\n  \n  \n                      \n Teaching Hitler  \n    \n\nAbout once a year, I teach a giant lower division class called \"Evil\", focused on the moral psychology of evil.  (This year, I have 420 students enrolled.)  We do a segment on the Holocaust, in which I assign Elie Wiesel, Hannah Arendt, Daniel Goldhagen, Ervin Staub,  Schindler's List  , and selections from  Mein Kampf  . \n I don't think we can properly understand the psychology of the Holocaust without understanding why ordinary Germans of the period found Hitler attractive.    Hitler's attraction to ordinary Germans is incomprehensible if we see him through the usual lens of his presentation in U.S. culture.  I ask my students to read  Mein Kampf   so that we can see Hitler in his own words, and to try to understand the vision of the world that he presented to his followers.  I hope and assume, as I emphasize in lecture, that none of my hundreds of students finds  Mein Kampf    too   attractive.  (Students who find the reading too repulsive to bear are permitted to choose an alternative reading.) \n One fascinating aspect of  Mein Kampf   is that Hitler makes an  ethical   case for the extermination of the Jews and the Poles.    He argues that races of people differ genetically, and that we ought to expect some races to be genetically superior to others.  The \"Aryan\" race -- basically, White people especially from northwestern Europe, but the ancient Greeks and Romans too -- he argues, can be seen to be superior to other races because of their cultural and military achievements (the Parthenon, Beethoven, the Roman Empire, the conquest of the Americas, etc.). \n This \"Aryan\" superiority partly consists in their willingness to subordinate their interests to the greater good of the state.    In  Mein Kampf   and, even more vividly in his speeches, Hitler appears to be at his most frighteningly \"inspiring\" when he praises ordinary Germans' willingness to become heroes, ready to sacrifice everything for the greater good of their nation.  (If you'll forgive the comparison, I am reminded of John F. Kennedy's remark, which many people in the U.S. have found inspiring, \"Ask not what your country can do for you \u2013 ask what you can do for your country.\"). \n\nHitler embraces a broadly  Malthusian   or  Spencerian   vision of populations of humans destined to fight each other: Each nation or race will breed too many people to share the planet.  The natural and desirable consequence of this inevitable fight, Hitler argues, is that the stronger races will defeat the weaker races.  They will thus bequeath better genes or \"blood\" to subsequent generations than would happen if weaker races were permitted to reproduce at the same rate as stronger races. \n\nFrom all of this, it follows, on Hitler's thinking, that it is the moral duty of \"Aryans\" to exterminate the Jews and other inferior races and also to invade nearby lands (esp. Poland), killing or displacing the inferior people there, so that healthy, fertile Germans will have room to expand and grow the population.   Short-term bloodshed and suffering will ensure the flourishing of future races of superior human beings!  Every good German must stand ready to sacrifice for this great goal!    One can see how such thinking might have been attractive to a certain sort of racist. \n\nHitler was quite clear about all of this in  Mein Kampf  , of which about ten million copies were distributed in Germany.  He even gives political advice for how to most effectively implement genocide.  I do not think that Germans of the era can plausibly say that they were unaware of his violent eugenic plans. \n And My Neighbor's Attitude About the Holocaust  \n\nI do not think many people today would endorse such violent eugenic thinking -- but neither do I think that Hitler's reasoning is  so   alien that we cannot still hear echoes of it. \n\nLast week, I flew to St. Louis to give a series of talks.  On the first leg of my flight, I ended up sitting next to a woman and man who lived in the neighborhood just south of mine in Riverside, California, near where my daughter attends school.  After finding out that I was a philosophy professor at U.C. Riverside, they asked me what I thought of politics in the U.S. today.  I said something about the value of listening across the political divide and respecting facts. \n\nThe woman sitting next to me then launched into political conversation with me, and it became clear that she identified with the political right.  Despite her earlier approval of the value of listening, she seemed more interested in speaking than in hearing my perspective.  At one point I mentioned that I teach a class called Evil and that we were about to start the segment on the Holocaust. \n My seatmate said, \"I do think there was a reason that Hitler chose to exterminate the Jews.  Of all the people he could have chosen, he went after the Jews.\"    She added something about Jews being rich lawyers and bankers.  \"It was all predicted two thousand years ago,\" she added. \n\nI was stunned for a moment, and then she changed the topic and our conversation moved on.  In retrospect, I imagine many things I could have said in response; but I said none of them. \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n                 \n [ cross-posted   at  Kittywumpus  ] \n    \n\nWhen  The Good Place   episode \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d   won one of science fiction\u2019s most prestigious awards, the Hugo, in the category of best dramatic presentation, short form, I celebrated. I celebrated not because I loved the episode (in fact, I had so far only seen a couple of The Good Place\u2019s earlier episodes) but because, as a philosophy professor aiming to build bridges between academic philosophy and popular science fiction, the awarding of a Hugo to a show starring a professor of philosophy discussing a famous philosophical problem seemed to confirm that science fiction fans see some of the same synergies I see between science fiction and philosophy. \n\nI do think the synergies are there and that the fans see and value them \u2013 as also revealed by the enduring popularity of The Matrix, and by West World, and Her, and Black Mirror, among others \u2013 but \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d, considered as a free-standing episode, fumbles the job. (Below, I will suggest a twist by which The Good Place could redeem itself in later episodes.) \n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to be fussy when maybe I should just cheer and praise. And I\u2019m going to take the episode more philosophically seriously than maybe I should, treating it as not just light humor. But taking good science fiction philosophically seriously is important to me \u2013 and that means engaging critically. So here we go. \n The Philosophical Trolley Problem  \n\nThe trolley problem \u2013 the classic academic philosophy version of the trolley problem \u2013 concerns a pair of scenarios. \n\nIn one scenario, the Switch case, you are standing beside a railroad track watching a runaway railcar (or \u201ctrolley\u201d) headed toward five people it will surely kill if you do nothing. You are standing by a switch, however, and you can flip the switch to divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. Unfortunately, there is one person on the side track who will be killed if you divert the trolley. Question: Should you flip the switch? \n\nIn another scenario, the Push case, you are standing on a footbridge when you see the runaway railcar headed toward the five people. In this case, there is no switch. You do, however, happen to be standing beside a hiker with a heavy backpack, who you could push off the bridge into the path of the trolley, which will then grind to a halt on his body, killing him and saving the five. (You are too light to stop the trolley with your own body.) He is leaning over the railing, heedless of you, so you could just push him over. Question: Should you push the hiker? \n\nThe interesting thing about these problems is that most people say it\u2019s okay to flip the switch in Switch but not okay to push the hiker in Push, despite the fact that in both cases you appear to be killing one person to save five. Is there really a meaningful difference between the cases? If so, what is it? Or are our ordinary intuitions about one or the other case wrong? \n\nIt\u2019s a lovely puzzle, much, much debated in academic philosophy, often with intricate variations on the cases. (Here\u2019s  one of my papers about it  .) \n The Problem with \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d  \n\n\u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d episode nicely sets up some basic trolley scenarios, adding also a medical case of killing one to save five (an involuntary organ donor). The philosophy professor character, Chidi, is teaching the material to the other characters. \n\nSpoilers coming. \n\nThe episode stumbles by trying to do two conflicting things. \n\nFirst, it seizes the trope of the philosophy professor who can\u2019t put his theories into practice. The demon Michael sets up a simulated trolley, headed toward five victims, with Chidi at the helm. Chidi is called on to make a fast decision. He hesitates, agonizing, and crashes into the five. Micheal reruns the scenario with several variations, and it\u2019s clear that Chidi, faced with a practical decision requiring swift action, can\u2019t actually figure out what\u2019s best. (However, Chidi is clear that he wouldn\u2019t cut up a healthy patient in an involuntary organ donor case.) \n\nSecond, incompatibly, the episode wants to affirm Chidi\u2019s moral expertise. Michael, the demon who enjoys torturing humans, can\u2019t seem to take Chidi\u2019s philosophy lessons seriously, despite Chidi\u2019s great knowledge of ethics. Michael tries to win Chidi\u2019s favor by giving him a previously unseen notebook of Kant\u2019s, but Chidi, with integrity that I suppose the viewer is expected to find admirable, casts the notebook aside, seeing it as a bribe. What Chidi really wants is for Michael to recognize his moral expertise. At the climax of the episode, Michael seems to do just this, saying:\n\n Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t understand human ethics, and you do. And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out. And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.  \n\nIt\u2019s unclear from within the episode whether we are supposed to regard Michael as sincere. Maybe not. Regardless, the viewer is invited to think that it\u2019s what Michael should say, what his attitude should be \u2013 and Chidi accepts the apology. \n\nBut this resolution hardly fits with Chidi\u2019s failure in actual ethical decision making in the moment (a vice he also reveals in other episodes). Chidi has abstract, theoretical knowledge about ethical quandaries such as the trolley problem, and he is in some ways the most morally admirable of the lead characters, but his failure in vividly simulated trolley cases casts his practical ethical expertise into doubt. Nothing in the episode satisfactorily resolves that practical challenge to Chidi\u2019s expertise, pro or con. \n Ethical Expertise?  \n\nNow, as it happens, I am the world\u2019s leading expert on the ethical behavior of professional ethicists. (Yes, really. Admittedly, the  competition is limited  .) \n\nThe one thing that shows most clearly from my and others\u2019 work on this topic, and which is anyway pretty evident if you spend much time around professional ethicists, is that ethicists, on average, behave more or less similarly to other people of similar social background \u2013 not especially better, not especially worse. From the fact that Chidi is a professor of ethics, nothing in particular follows about his moral behavior. Often, indeed, expertise in philosophical ethics appears to become expertise in constructing  post-hoc intellectual rationales for what you were inclined to do anyway  . \n\nI hope you will agree with me about the following, concerning the philosophy of philosophy: Real ethical understanding is not a matter of what words you speak in classroom moments. It\u2019s a matter of what you choose and what you do habitually, regardless of whether you can tell your friends a handsome story about it, grounded in your knowledge of Kant. It\u2019s not clear that Chidi does have especially good ethical understanding in this practical sense. Moreover, to the extent Chidi does have some such practical ethical understanding, as a somewhat morally admirable person, it is not in virtue of his knowledge of Kant. \n\nMichael should not be so deferential to Chidi\u2019s expertise, and especially he should not be deferential on the basis of Chidi\u2019s training as a philosopher. If, over the seasons, the characters improve morally, it is, or should be, because they learn from the practical situations they find themselves in, not because of Chidi\u2019s theoretical lessons. \n How to Partly Redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d  \n\nThus, the episode, as a stand-alone work, is flawed both in plot (the resolution at climax failing to answer the problem posed by Chidi\u2019s earlier practical indecisiveness) and in philosophy (being too deferential to the expertise of theoretical ethicists, in contrast with the episode\u2019s implicit criticism of the practical, on-the-trolley value of Chidi\u2019s theoretical ethics). \n\nWhen the whole multi-season arc of The Good Place finally resolves, here\u2019s what I hope happens, which in my judgment would partly redeem \u201cThe Trolley Problem\u201d: Michael turns out, all along, to have been the most ethically insightful character, becoming Chidi\u2019s teacher rather than the other way around. \n\n[ image source  ] \n\n----------------------------------------------- \n Update, October 21, 2018:  \n\nWisecrack has a  terrific treatment of the philosophy of  The Good Place   , revealing that the show has a more nuanced view of the role of ethics lessons than one might infer from treating \"The Trolley Problem\" as a stand-alone work.

Creating the appearance that every pro has an equally good con.    Annette Baier   is among those who have emphasized this risk.  A typical philosophical teaching style is to present both sides of every major topic discussed, in a more-or-less even-handed way.  We tell students that they are welcome to defend either the pro or the con, and we encourage contrarian students who challenge the reasoning and conclusions of the assigned authors.  This even-handed debate-like format might lead some students to think that, in ethical reasoning, there are no right or wrong answers to be found, just interminable back and forth.  Probably this attitude will have little effect on students' practical choices outside of the classroom; but if it does have an effect, it might be to weaken their sense that ethical principles that they might otherwise have acted on are as sound and indisputable as they would previously have thought. \n 2. Improving one's skill at moral rationalization.    Suppose you want to do X --  steal a library book  , for example.  Of course, you wouldn't do that.  It's wrong!  But wait.  Remember that ethics class you took?  Maybe you can construct a utilitarian defense of stealing the book.  No one would miss it that much, and you'd benefit greatly from keeping it.  The institution has much more money than you do, and can easily replace it.  Stealing the book would maximize human happiness!  (Especially yours.)  Such reasoning is  rationalization, in the pejorative sense of that term  , if your reasoning is basically just a biased search for reasons in support of the self-serving conclusion you'd like to reach.  If you're tempted to do something morally wrong, skill at philosophical reasoning, and knowledge of a diverse range of possibly relevant moral principles, might enable you to better construct superficially attractive arguments that free you to feel okay doing the bad thing that you might otherwise have unreflectively avoided. \n 3. Giving the sense that unethical behavior is pervasive.    I've argued that people mostly aim for  moral mediocrity  .  They aim, that is, not to be morally good by absolute standards but rather to be about as morally good as their peers, not especially better, not especially worse.  If so, then changes in your perception of what is typical behavior among your peers can cause you to calibrate your own behavior up or down.  If most people litter, or cheat, or selfishly screw over their co-workers, then it doesn't seem so bad if you do too, at least a little.  (Conversely, if you learn that almost everyone around you is honorable and true, that can inspire you not to want to be the one schmuck.)  Some ethics classes, perhaps especially business ethics classes, focus on case studies of grossly unethical behavior.  This company did this bad thing, this other company did this other bad thing, still another company did this other horrible thing....  Without a complementary range of inspirational examples of morally laudable behavior by other companies, students might get the sense that the world is even fuller of malfeasance than they had previously thought, leading them to calibrate their sense of mediocrity down.  If so many other people do so many bad things, then it hardly matters (perhaps even it's only fair) if I fudge a bit on my expense report. \n\nDo ethics classes actually have any of these backfire effects?  I think we really have no idea.  The issue remains almost entirely unstudied in any rigorous, empirical way. \n   \n\n[ image source  ]  \n  \n        \n [Note: Somehow two different versions of this post went up.  Slightly updated version  here  .]\n\nLast term, some grad students and I read Berys Gaut's book  Art, Emotion, and Ethics.    Gaut argues that although some morally noxious works of art have aesthetic merit, they never have aesthetic merit  in virtue of   their moral defects.  If an ethically flawed work is aesthetically good, it is good  despite   that flaw, not because of the flaw. \n\nI find myself inclined to disagree.  Sometimes art is more thought-provoking, or more challenging or horrifying, because of its moral defects -- thought-provoking, challenging, or horrifying in ways that make the work more engaging, giving the work a kind of aesthetic interest in virtue of its moral terribleness. \n\nBefore I offer examples, two caveats: \n\n(1.) In praising the aesthetic merits that morally noxious artworks sometimes have in virtue of that very noxiousness, I  don't   commit to the view that being thought-provokingly morally awful outweighs other considerations.  Some of these works should be overall condemned.  Even just appreciating them aesthetically might be overall inappropriate, despite their merits.  And the world might be better off had the works never been produced. \n\n(2.) I am (like Gaut) assuming pluralism about aesthetic value.  Aesthetic value does not reduce entirely to beauty, for example.  Being thought-provoking, challenging, or frightening can be (though it isn't always) as aesthetic merit in a work -- can be part of what makes a work aesthetically valuable. \n\nTwo examples I've given some thought to are both films: Leni Riefenstahl's  Triumph of the Will   and Woody Allen's  Crimes and Misdemeanors  . \n\nRiefenstahl and Allen are of course both morally flawed people themselves: Riefenstahl a Nazi propagandist, Allen plausibly accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with minors, including in his own family.  The moral noxiousness of their work might flow in part from their own personal ethical flaws -- but I don't want to rely on such biographical facts in evaluating the works.  I discuss their work with considerable trepidation, because of the electricity of discussions of Nazism and of sexual abuse.  Let me be clear that I will not be saying that their work is good  despite   its moral awfulness, as though we could simply bracket moral issues in aesthetic discussions.  Instead, my view is that it is the moral awfulness itself that makes these otherwise not-so-great films interestingly distressing to contemplate. \n            \n    \n\n(with  Jonathan E. Ellis  ; originally appeared at the  Imperfect Cognitions blog  ) \n\nLast week we  argued   that your intelligence, vigilance, and academic expertise very likely doesn't do much to protect you from the normal human tendency towards rationalization \u2013 that is, from the tendency to engage in biased patterns of reasoning aimed at justifying conclusions to which you are attracted for selfish or other epistemically irrelevant reasons \u2013 and that, in fact, you may be more susceptible to rationalization than the rest of the population. This week we\u2019ll argue that moral and philosophical topics are especially fertile grounds for rationalization. \n\nHere\u2019s one way of thinking about it: Rationalization, like crime, requires a motive and an opportunity. Ethics and philosophy provide plenty of both. \n\nRegarding motive: Not everyone cares about every moral and philosophical issue of course. But we all have some moral and philosophical issues that are near to our hearts \u2013 for reasons of cultural or religious identity, or personal self-conception, or for self-serving reasons, or because it\u2019s comfortable, exciting, or otherwise appealing to see the world in a certain way. \n\nOn day one of their philosophy classes, students are often already attracted to certain types of views and repulsed by others. They like the traditional and conservative, or they prefer the rebellious and exploratory; they like confirmations of certainty and order, or they prefer the chaotic and skeptical; they like moderation and common sense, or they prefer the excitement of the radical and unintuitive. Some positions fit with their pre-existing cultural and political identities better than others. Some positions are favored by their teachers and elders \u2013 and that\u2019s attractive to some, and provokes rebellious contrarianism in others. Some moral conclusions may be attractively convenient, while others might require unpleasant contrition or behavior change.  \n\nThe motive is there. So is the opportunity. Philosophical and moral questions rarely admit of straightforward proof or refutation, or a clear standard of correctness. Instead, they open into a complexity of considerations, which themselves do not admit of straightforward proof and which offer many loci for rationalization. \n\nThese loci are so plentiful and diverse! Moral and philosophical arguments, for instance, often turn crucially on a \u201csense of plausibility\u201d ( Kornblith, 1999  ); or on one\u2019s judgment of the force of a particular reason, or the significance of a consideration. Methodological judgments are likewise fundamental in philosophical and moral thinking: What argumentative tacks should you first explore? How much critical attention should you pay to your pre-theoretic beliefs, and their sources, and which ones, in which respects? How much should you trust your intuitive judgments versus more explicitly reasoned responses? Which other philosophers, and which scientists (if any), should you regard as authorities whose judgments carry weight with you, and on which topics, and how much? \n\nThese questions are usually answered only implicitly, revealed in your choices about what to believe and what to doubt, what to read, what to take seriously and what to set aside. Even where they are answered explicitly, they lack a clear set of criteria by which to answer them definitively. And so, if people\u2019s preferences can influence their perceptual judgments (including possibly of size, color, and distance: Balcetis and Dunning  2006  ,  2007  ,  2010  ) what is remembered ( Kunda 1990  ;  Mele 2001  ), what hypotheses are envisioned ( Trope and Liberman 1997  ), what one attends to and for how long ( Lord et al. 1979  ;  Nickerson 1998  ) . . . it is no leap to assume that they can influence the myriad implicit judgments, intuitions, and choices involved in moral and philosophical reasoning. \n\nFurthermore, patterns of bias can compound across several questions, so that with many loci for bias to enter, the person who is only slightly biased in each of a variety of junctures in a line of reasoning can ultimately come to a very different conclusion than would someone who was not biased in the same way. Rationalization can operate by way of a series or network of \u201cmicro-instances\u201d of motivated reasoning that together have a major amplificatory effect (synchronically, diachronically, or both), or by influencing you mightily at a crucial step (Ellis, manuscript).  \n\nWe believe that these considerations, taken together with the considerations we advanced last week about the likely inability of intelligence, vigilance, and expertise to effectively protect us against rationalization, support the following conclusion: Few if any of us should confidently maintain that our moral and philosophical reasoning is not substantially tainted by significant, epistemically troubling degrees of rationalization. This is of course one possible explanation of the seeming intractability of philosophical disagreement. \n\nOr perhaps we the authors of the post are the ones rationalizing; perhaps we are, for some reason, drawn toward a certain type of pessimism about the rationality of philosophers, and we have sought and evaluated evidence and arguments toward this conclusion in a badly biased manner? Um\u2026. No way. We have reviewed our reasoning and are sure that we were not affected by our preferences.... \n\nFor our full-length paper on this topic, see  here  .  \n  \n              \n    \n\n(with  Jonathan E. Ellis  ; originally appeared at the  Imperfect Cognitions blog  ) \n\nWe\u2019ve all been there. You\u2019re arguing with someone \u2013 about politics, or a policy at work, or about whose turn it is to do the dishes \u2013 and they keep finding all kinds of self-serving justifications for their view. When one of their arguments is defeated, rather than rethinking their position they just leap to another argument, then maybe another. They\u2019re rationalizing \u2013coming up with convenient defenses for what they want to believe, rather than responding even-handedly to the points you're making. You try to point it out, but they deny it, and dig in more. \n\nMore formally, in recent work we have defined rationalization as what occurs when a person favors a particular view as a result of some factor (such as self-interest) that is of little justificatory epistemic relevance, and then engages in a biased search for and evaluation of justifications that would seem to support that favored view. \n\nYou, of course, never rationalize in this way! Or, rather, it doesn\u2019t usually feel like you do. Stepping back, you\u2019ll probably admit you do it sometimes. But maybe less than average? After all, you\u2019re a philosopher, a psychologist, an expert in reasoning \u2013 or at least someone who reads blog posts about philosophy, psychology, and reasoning. You're especially committed to the promotion of critical thinking and fair-minded reasoning. You know about all sorts of common fallacies, and especially rationalization, and are on guard for them in your own thinking. Don't these facts about you make you less susceptible to rationalization than people with less academic intelligence, vigilance, and expertise? \n\nWe argue that no. You\u2019re probably just as susceptible to post-hoc rationalization, maybe even more, than the rest of the population, though the ways it manifests in your reasoning may be different. Vigilance, academic intelligence, and disciplinary expertise are not overall protective against rationalization. In some cases, they might even enhance one\u2019s tendency to rationalize, or make rationalizations more severe when they occur. \n\nWhile some biases are less prevalent among those who score high on standard measures of academic intelligence, others appear to be no less frequent or powerful.  Stanovich, West and Toplak (2013)  , reviewing several studies, find that the degree of myside bias is largely independent of measures of intelligence and cognitive ability. Dan Kahan finds that on several measures people who use more \u201cSystem 2\u201d type explicit reasoning show higher rates of motivated cognition rather than lower rates ( 2011  ,  2013  ,  Kahan et al 2011  ). Thinkers who are more knowledgeable have more facts to choose from when constructing a line of motivated reasoning ( Taber and Lodge 2006  ;  Braman 2009  ).  \n\n\nNor does disciplinary expertise appear to be protective. For instance, Schwitzgebel and Cushman ( 2012  ,  2015  ) presented moral dilemma scenarios to professional philosophers and comparison groups of non-philosophers, followed by the opportunity to endorse or reject various moral principles. Professional philosophers were just as prone to irrational order effects and framing effects as were the other groups, and were also at least as likely to \u201crationalize\u201d their manipulated scenario judgments by appealing to principles post-hoc in a way that would render those manipulated judgments rational.  \n\nFurthermore, since the mechanisms responsible for rationalization are largely non-conscious, vigilant introspection is not liable to reveal to the introspector that rationalization has occured. This may be one reason for the \u201cbias blind spot\u201d: People tend to regard themselves as less biased than others, sometimes even exhibiting more bias by objective measures the less biased they believe themselves to be ( Pronin, Gilovich and Ross 2004  ;  Uhlmann and Cohen 2005  ). Indeed, efforts to reduce bias and be vigilant can amplify bias. You examine your reasoning for bias, find no bias because of your bias blind spot, and then inflate your confidence that your reasoning is not biased: \u201cI really am being completely objective and reasonable!\u201d (as suggested in  Erhlinger, Gilovich and Ross 2005  ). People with high estimates of their objectivity might also be less likely to take protective measures against bias ( Scopeletti et al 2015  ). \n\nPartisan reasoning can be invisible to vigilant introspection for another reason: it need not occur in one fell swoop, at a sole moment or a particular inference. Rather, it can be the result of a series or network of \u201cmicro-instances\u201d of motivated reasoning (Ellis, manuscript). Celebrated cases of motivated reasoning typically involve a person whose evidence clearly points to one thing (that it\u2019s their turn, not yours, to do the dishes) but who believes the very opposite (that it\u2019s your turn). But motives can have much subtler consequences. \n\nMany judgments admit of degrees, and motives can have impacts of small degree. They can affect the likelihood you assign to an outcome, or the confidence you place in a belief, or the reliability you attribute to a source of information, or the threshold for cognitive action (e.g., what would trigger your pursuit of an objection). They can affect these things in large or very small ways. \n\nSuch micro-instances (you might call it motivated reasoning lite) can have significant amplificatory effects. This can happen over time, in a linear fashion. Or it can happen synchronically, spread over lots of assumptions, presuppositions, and dispositions. Or both. If introspection doesn't reveal motivated reasoning that happens in one fell swoop, micro-instances are liable to be even more elusive. \n\nThis is another reason for the sobering fact that well-meaning epistemic vigilance cannot be trusted to preempt or detect rationalization. Indeed, people who care most about reasoning, or who have a high \u201c need for cognition  \u201d, or who attend to their cognitions most responsibly, may be the most impacted of all. Their learned ability to avoid the more obvious types of reasoning errors may naturally come with cognitive tools that enable more sophisticated, but still unnoticed, rationalization.  \n\nComing tomorrow:  Why Moral and Philosophical Disagreements Are Especially Fertile Grounds for Rationalization  . \n\nFull length article on the topic  here  .  \n  \n                \n    \n\nA favorite passage of mine from Mengzi (Mencius) is this one: \n \nThat which people are capable of without learning is their genuine capability.  That which they know without pondering is their genuine knowledge.  Among babes in arms there are none that do not know to love their parents.  When they grow older, there are non that do not know to revere their elder brothers.  Treating one's parents as parents is benevolence.  Revering one's elders is righteousness.  There is nothing else to do but extend these to the world (7A15, Van Norden trans.)\n  \n\nOne thing I like about this passage is that it assumes love and reverence for one's family as a given, rather than as a special achievement, portraying moral development as a matter of extending that natural love and reverence to new targets. \n\nSimilarly, in passage 1A7, Mengzi notes the kindness that the vicious ruler King Xuan exhibits in saving a frightened ox from slaughter, and he urges King Xuan to extend similar kindness to the people of his kingdom.  Mengzi says that such extension is a matter of \"weighing\" things correctly -- a matter of treating similar things similarly and not overvaluing what merely happens to be nearby. \n\nContrast this approach with \"The Golden Rule\": \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you\".  Contrast it also with the common advice to imagine yourself in someone else's shoes.  Golden Rule / others' shoes advice assumes self-interest as the starting point.  While Mengzian extension starts by assuming that people are already concerned about nearby others, and takes the developmental or cognitive challenge to be extending your concern beyond a narrow circle, The Golden Rule / others' shoes thinking starts by assuming egoistic self-interest, and takes the developmental or cognitive challenge to be generalizing beyond one's own self-interest. \n\nMaybe we can model Golden Rule / others' shoes thinking as follows: \n\n(1.) If I were in the situation of Person X, I would want to be treated according to Principle P.          \n I've been working on this essay off and on for years, \"Aiming for Moral Mediocrity\".  I think I've finally pounded it into circulating shape and  I'm ready for feedback  . \n\nI have an empirical thesis and a normative thesis.  The empirical thesis is that  most people aim to be  morally mediocre   .  They aim to be about as morally good as their peers, not especially better, not especially worse.  This mediocrity has two aspects.  It is peer-relative rather than absolute, and it is middling rather than extreme.  We do not aim to be good, or non-bad, or to act permissibly rather than impermissibly, by fixed moral standards.  Rather, we notice the typical behavior of people we regard as our peers and we aim to behave broadly within that range.  We -- most of us -- look around, notice how others are acting, then calibrate toward so-so. \n\nThis empirical thesis is, I think, plausible on the face of it.  It also receives some support from two recent subliteratures in social psychology and behavioral economics. \n\nOne is the literature on  following the (im-)moral crowd  .  I'm thinking especially of the work of  Robert B. Cialdini   and  Cristina Bicchieri  .  Cialdini argues that \"injunctive norms\" (that is, social or moral admonitions) most effectively promote norm-compliant behavior when they align with \"descriptive norms\" (that is, facts about how people actually behave).  People are  less likely to litter   when they see others being neat,  more likely to reuse their hotel towels   when they learn that others also do so, and  more likely to reduce their household energy consumption   when they see that they are using more than their neighbors.  Bicchieri argues that people are  more likely to be selfish in \"dictator games\"   when they are led to believe that earlier participants had mostly been selfish and that  convincing communities to adopt new health practices   like family planning and indoor toilet use typically requires persuading people that their neighbors will also comply.  It appears that  people are more likely to abide by social or moral norms if they believe that others are also doing so.  \n\nThe other relevant literature concerns  moral self-licensing  .  A number of studies suggest that after having performed good acts, people are likely to behave less morally well than after performing a bad or neutral act.  For example,  after having done something good for the environment  , people might tend to make more selfish choices in a dictator game.  Even just recalling recent ethical behavior might  reduce people's intentions to donate blood, money, and time  .  The idea is that people are more motivated to behave well when their previous bad behavior is salient and less motivated to behave well when their previous good behavior is salient.  They appear to calibrate toward some middle state. \n\nOne alternative hypothesis is that people aim not for mediocrity but rather for something better than that, though short of sainthood.  Phenomenologically, that might be how it seems to people.  Most people think that they are somewhat above average in moral traits like honesty and fairness ( Tappin and McKay 2017  ); and maybe then people mostly think that they should more or less stay the course.  An eminent ethicist once told me he was aiming for a moral \"B+\".  However, I suspect that  most of us who like to think of ourselves as aiming for substantially above-average moral goodness aren't really willing to put in the work and sacrifice required  .  A close examination of how we actually calibrate our behavior will reveal us wiggling and veering toward a lower target.  (Compare the undergraduate who says they're \"aiming for B+\" in a class but who wouldn't be willing to put in more work if they received a C on the first exam.  It's probably better to say that they are  hoping   for a B+ than that they are  aiming   for one.)         \n In a  famous series of experiments   Justin Kruger and David Dunning found that people who scored in the lowest quartile of skill in grammar, logic, and (yes, they tried to measure this) humor tended to substantially overestimate their abilities, rating themselves as a bit above average in these skills.  In contrast, people in the top half of ability had more accurate estimations (even tending to underestimate a bit).  The average participant in each quartile rated themselves as above average, and the correlation between self-rated skill and measured skill was small. \n\nFor example, here's Kruger and Dunning's chart for logic ability and logic scores: \n        ", "title_html": "<h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/03/most-us-and-german-ethicists-condemn.html\">Most U.S. and German Ethicists Condemn Meat-Eating (or German Philosophers Think Meat Is the Wurst)</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/03/should-you-defer-to-ethical-experts.html\">Should You Defer to Ethical Experts?</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2019/02/studying-ethics-should-influence-your.html\">Studying Ethics Should Influence Your Behavior (But It Doesn't Seem to)</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/11/narrative-but-not-philosophical.html\">Narrative but Not Philosophical Argument Motivates Giving to Charity</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/10/teaching-hitler-and-my-neighbors.html\">Teaching Hitler, and My Neighbor's Attitude About the Holocaust</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/09/one-point-five-cheers-for-hugo-award.html\">One-Point-Five Cheers for a Hugo Award for a TV Show about Ethicists\u2019 Moral Expertise</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/04/three-ways-your-ethics-class-might.html\">Three Ways Your Ethics Class Might Backfire</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/03/engaging-with-evil-art.html\">Engaging with Evil Art</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/why-moral-and-philosophical.html\">Why Moral and Philosophical Disagreements Are Especially Fertile Grounds for Rationalization (with Jon Ellis)</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/02/rationalization-why-your-intelligence.html\">Rationalization: Why Your Intelligence, Vigilance and Expertise Probably Don't Protect You (with Jon Ellis)</a>\n</h3> <h3 class=\"post-title entry-title\">\n<a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2018/01/imagining-yourself-in-anothers-shoes-vs.html\">Imagining Yourself in Another's Shoes Vs.

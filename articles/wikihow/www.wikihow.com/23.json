The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and wikiHow agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party\u2019s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WIKIHOW ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n\n\n \n \nGeneral\n\nA. Assignment.\nThis Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by wikiHow without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.\nB. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.\nwikiHow may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by wikiHow in our sole discretion. wikiHow reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. wikiHow is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. wikiHow may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the \u2018last modified\u2019 date on this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.\nC. Entire Agreement/Severability.\nThis Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with wikiHow in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and wikiHow concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.\nD. No Waiver.\nNo waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and wikiHow\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nE.

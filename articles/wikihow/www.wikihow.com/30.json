Anyone is invited to use the tools we have on the site to review RC and decide which edits stay, and which ones don't. Most of the edits made on any given day are helpful, and any bad edits (vandalism) are usually quickly reverted by an RC patroller. Would you like to help out? Check out how it is done in this article: <a href=\"/Patrol-Recent-Changes-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Patrol Recent Changes on wikiHow\">How to Patrol Recent Changes on wikiHow</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_are_unpatrolled_edits.3F_What_does_the_little_weather_icon_mean.3F\">What are unpatrolled edits?

There are a few staff members who get paid to help engineer, manage and maintain the site. Decisions get made by the <a href=\"/Reach-a-Consensus\" title=\"Reach a Consensus\">community</a> on most matters, and ultimately it's still up to us all - the readers and users of the site - to help wikiHow grow and fulfill its <a href=\"/wikiHow:Mission\" title=\"wikiHow:Mission\">mission</a> of building the most helpful how-to manual on the planet.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_are_there_ads_on_your_site.3F\">Why are there ads on your site?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>wikiHow is a <a href=\"/wikiHow:Hybrid-Organization\" title=\"wikiHow:Hybrid Organization\">hybrid organization</a>, which means that even though it's a for-profit company, it's run as a community service first and a business second. Instead of asking for donations or charging people to view content, wikiHow uses ads as its primary source of income. However, we don't think that ads should be shoved down your throat. If you don't like advertising, you can <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/Create-Your-wikiHow-Account\" title=\"Create Your wikiHow Account\">register for an account</a> and you'll never see any ads again.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Is_this_the_same_as_the_Wikimedia_wikis.3F\">Is this the same as the Wikimedia wikis?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>No. Most wikis share the same underlying software, but our project is run by a completely separate organization with a different goal. While most of Wikimedia's goals are to provide encyclopedic articles, we are a how-to guide with a goal of helping everyone on the planet get to know how to do anything.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Is_wikiHow_the_same_as_eHow.3F\">Is wikiHow the same as eHow?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>No. wikiHow isn't the same as eHow. wikiHow's founder <a href=\"/User:JackHerrick\" title=\"User:JackHerrick\">Jack Herrick</a> used to run eHow, but later separated his focus from it and decided to form wikiHow. Unlike eHow, wikiHow is open for editing with a freely available by Creative Commons license, available on open source software, and run largely by volunteers.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_do_I_change_the_language_on_wikiHow.3F\">How do I change the language on wikiHow?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>The main wikiHow language can't be changed \"per-se\". However, wikiHow is also offered in <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://es.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spanish</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://fr.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">French</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://de.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">German</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.wikihow.it\" rel=\"nofollow\">Italian</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://nl.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dutch</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://ru.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Russian</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://zh.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chinese</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://hi.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hindi</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.wikihow.vn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vietnamese</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://th.wikihow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thai</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://pt.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Portuguese</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.wikihow.cz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Czech</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://ar.wikihow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arabic</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://id.wikiHow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indonesian</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://ko.wikihow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Korean</a> and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.wikihow.jp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japanese</a>.

If you'd like a paid spot, you'll have to either look into a <a href=\"/wikiHow:Jobs\" title=\"wikiHow:Jobs\">job</a> at wikiHow, or work elsewhere instead; you won't get paid to volunteer here or make any contributions of any kind on the site.</p>\n<div class=\"clearall\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section questionsaboutcontributing sticky\">\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Questions_about_contributing\">Questions about contributing</span></h2>\n<div class=\"section_text\" id=\"questionsaboutcontributing\">\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_can_I_write_an_article.3F\">How can I write an article?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Your first step would be to read <a href=\"/Write-a-New-Article-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Write a New Article on wikiHow\">How to Write a New Article on wikiHow</a>, and then you would go to <a href=\"/Special:CreatePage\" title=\"Special:CreatePage\">Special:CreatePage</a>.

Adding links from a neutral perspective to <i>reputable</i> sources of information for the purpose of referencing advice shared on the page is great, though. For more information, check out the <a href=\"/wikiHow:External-Links\" title=\"wikiHow:External Links\">External Links Policy</a> and <a href=\"/Reference-Sources-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Reference Sources on wikiHow\">How to Reference Sources on wikiHow</a>.</li>\n<li>Check out How to <a href=\"/Publicize-Yourself-the-Right-Way-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Publicize Yourself the Right Way on wikiHow\">Publicize Yourself the Right Way on wikiHow</a>. You can always link to your website from your own user page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_do_I_add_a_picture_to_an_article.3F\">How do I add a picture to an article?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Adding pictures to articles is great if you own the copyright to them and are willing to share them under our <a href=\"/wikiHow:Creative-Commons\" title=\"wikiHow:Creative Commons\">Creative Commons</a> license, or if you have other images you've already confirmed are licensed in a way that allows them to be shared here. To find out how, please read <a href=\"/Put-a-Photo-in-a-wikiHow-Article\" title=\"Put a Photo in a wikiHow Article\">How to Put a Photo in a wikiHow Article</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_can_I_get_images_for_articles.2C_if_I_can.27t_upload_any_.28or_have_none_that_I.27ve_created.29.3F\">How can I get images for articles, if I can't upload any (or have none that I've created)?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Ask the <a href=\"/User_talk:Wikivisual\" title=\"User_talk:Wikivisual\">Wikivisual team</a> for images for any fully promoted article by posting a message on their talk page. The team will try to get suitable pictures, screenshots or illustrations up as soon as possible, but it may take a little while. Most articles will get images eventually if you don't request them, but a specific request is always welcome and may speed the process up.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_do_I_get_my_article_featured.3F\">How do I get my article featured?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Make sure the page is detailed, comprehensive, and <i>insightful</i>. Aim to make it the \"best on the web\" for the given topic (and pick an appealing topic, too). Try to add information that might make someone say \"Wow, I didn't know that!\" If you're knowledgeable about the topic, you probably have plenty of \"insider\" tips; but even if you're not an expert, you can find them elsewhere on the Internet and add them to the article if you <a href=\"/Reference-Sources-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Reference Sources on wikiHow\">reference them properly</a>.</p>\n<br/><p>When you think your article is ready, go to the discussion page and write {{fac}} at the very top. Also, when you interact with other people on wikiHow, tell them you're trying to get your page featured and would appreciate their help.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What.27s_an_Admin.3F_How_do_I_become_one.3F\">What's an Admin? How do I become one?</span>\n</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wikiHow:Administrators\" title=\"wikiHow:Administrators\">Admins</a> are volunteers too who take on extra responsibilities in the form of being able to delete and rename articles, protect pages, and block vandals. Administrators have earned the trust of the community with their levelheadedness in tough situations and are able to calm most argumentative editors. Most Admins have a large number of edits and have shown continued dedication to this project over a long period of time.</p>\n<br/><p>Current admins nominate candidates for adminship based on the candidate's editing history on the site and that person's interactions in the community. Candidates with sufficient support from existing admins are then given a \"trial adminship\" period in which they are mentored by several existing admins. See <a href=\"/Become-a-wikiHow-Admin\" title=\"Become a wikiHow Admin\">How to Become a wikiHow Admin</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What.27s_.22NAB.22.3F_How_do_I_become_a_.22NABer.3F.22\">What's \"NAB\"? How do I become a \"NABer?\"</span>\n</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wikiHow:New-Article-Boosters\" title=\"wikiHow:New Article Boosters\">New Article Boost</a> (most often known as \"NAB\") provides an initial fix or \"boost\" of newly-submitted articles. Boosters often correct spelling and formatting errors, as well as reviewing the topic's helpfulness and accuracy. They help ensure good content is made available to the world, and they hide or \"demote\" content that is not ready for readers yet. New Article Boosters also try to encourage new authors to stick around and keep writing articles.</p>\n<br/><p>To become a New Article Booster, you need to pass a series of written tests and a trial. See <a href=\"/Become-a-New-Article-Booster-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Become a New Article Booster on wikiHow\">How to Become a New Article Booster on wikiHow</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_is_the_article_review_process.3F\">What is the article review process?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Articles on wikiHow are not fully published until they have passed a quality review process called \"New Article Boost\". Articles which haven't yet gone through this quality review remain mostly hidden from the public, since they are not indexed in search results or visible logged out. In order for an article to be fully published, it must meet the guidelines in our <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/Writer%27s-Guide\" title=\"Writer's Guide\">Writer's Guide</a> and be approved by our volunteer community.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_long_does_it_take_for_an_article_to_go_through_the_review_process.3F_How_can_I_get_it_to_be_approved_quicker.3F_How_can_I_get_that_orange_message_to_disappear.3F\">How long does it take for an article to go through the review process? How can I get it to be approved quicker? How can I get that orange message to disappear?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>It varies, but most articles get reviewed within 48 hours. If yours gets approved, the orange blurred message will be removed from the page, and you'll generally be notified on your talk page. If it doesn't, it might need some additional work.

Maybe you can add a tip, correct a fact, fix a typo, etc. Every edit helps!</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What.27s_wiki_markup_and_how_do_I_use_it.3F\">What's wiki markup and how do I use it?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Wiki markup is the code used to help format wikiHow articles. It's like a shortened form of HTML. Click <a href=\"/wikiHow:Editing-Basics\" title=\"wikiHow:Editing Basics\">here</a> for a quick reference to our editing basics, or, if you know these already, have a look at our <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wikiHow:Use-Advanced-Wiki-Syntax\" title=\"wikiHow:Use Advanced Wiki Syntax\">Advanced Wiki Syntax</a> page for additional wiki markup options.</p>\n<div class=\"clearall\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section whyisthishappening sticky\">\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_is_this_happening.3F\">Why is this happening?</span></h2>\n<div class=\"section_text\" id=\"whyisthishappening\">\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_are_my_started_article.2Fpages_getting_deleted.3F\">Why are my started article/pages getting deleted?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>As you can imagine, wikiHow receives many new articles each day. To help maintain the quality of articles on wikiHow, we do have a <a href=\"/wikiHow:Deletion-Policy\" title=\"wikiHow:Deletion Policy\">deletion policy</a> that determines what articles we keep on the site. If an article seems to violate the deletion policy, it gets nominated for deletion, which means that the community is invited to discuss whether the page should be kept or not.</p>\n<br/><p>Not all nominated articles are removed. If you don't want your article to get deleted, try following the steps in <a href=\"/Prevent-Your-wikiHow-Article-from-Getting-Deleted\" title=\"Prevent Your wikiHow Article from Getting Deleted\">How to Prevent Your wikiHow Article from Getting Deleted</a>. However, if it has already been deleted or if you have more questions about how the deletion policy works or why your article was deleted, feel free to email <a class=\"external text\" href=\"mailto:deleted@wikihow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">deleted@wikihow.com</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_is_my_page_getting_merged.3F\">Why is my page getting merged?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Since this is a collaborative project, we want people to work together to build one high-quality page on a particular topic, rather than each person making their own page. Plus, it gives our readers a single place where they can find all the advice we have on a single topic.</p>\n<br/><p>If your page got tagged for merging, it means someone thinks it's on the same topic as a page we already have on the site. If you think your page is different, however, read our <a href=\"/wikiHow:Merge-Policy\" title=\"wikiHow:Merge Policy\">merge policy</a> and explain on the discussion page why your topic is distinct.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_does_it_say_my_IP_address_is_blocked.3F\">Why does it say my IP address is blocked?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>When most people log into their Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to get internet access, the ISP assigns a random (or shared) IP address to them for that particular internet session. This means that if you edit anonymously, you may be sharing an IP address with several other people, one of whom may be vandalizing even while you are making good faith edits.</p>\n<br/><p>Since folks at wikiHow have no way to know which of those multiple people is doing the vandalizing, we may simply block the IP address they are vandalizing from. You can avoid having your edits lumped in with a bunch of other anonymous users by registering a username (it's free, and we won't spam you or sell your information to anyone) and always signing in with that username whenever you edit on the site. This will allow you to edit, even if the IP that has been assigned to you has previously been used by a vandal.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_isn.27t_anyone_talking_to_me_on_the_chat_page.3F\">Why isn't anyone talking to me on the chat page?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>wikiHow's talk pages aren't meant for this purpose. Talk pages are for collaboration on articles with other editors, not for chatting about non-wikiHow related topics. Every edit you make- even to someone's talk page - gets reviewed by another editor in our <a href=\"/Special:RCPatrol\" title=\"Special:RCPatrol\">Recent Changes Patrol tool</a>, so excessive chat messages can clog up that system.</p>\n<br/><p>As for why you may not be getting a quick response to questions or greetings on your talk page... While we have thousands of registered users, they're not all active all the time. The person you are leaving a message for may not have edited here for some time, and may not be seeing your message at all. Your best bet to get in touch with someone is to post in the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://forums.wikihow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">forums</a> or send an e-mail to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"mailto:anna@wikihow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">community support</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_can.27t_I_edit_certain_pages.3F\">Why can't I edit certain pages?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Some articles are protected because of a recent drive in high traffic to an article or <a href=\"/wikiHow:Vandalism\" title=\"wikiHow:Vandalism\">vandalism</a>.

For further questions, feel free to contact our Help Team, an Administrator, post in the forums, or send us an email. Everyone is happy to help you!\n\n \n \nQuestions about wikiHow\n\n\n\nIf anyone can edit, how do you stop people from making bad edits?\n\nOn any wiki, there's a list of Recent Changes (RC) that shows every change or addition that's been made to the site. Anyone is invited to use the tools we have on the site to review RC and decide which edits stay, and which ones don't. Most of the edits made on any given day are helpful, and any bad edits (vandalism) are usually quickly reverted by an RC patroller. Would you like to help out? Check out how it is done in this article: How to Patrol Recent Changes on wikiHow.\n\n\nWhat are unpatrolled edits? What does the little weather icon mean?\n\n\nUnpatrolled edits are changes made to the site that haven't been reviewed by someone yet. That reviewing process is called patrolling. Any registered user can patrol by following the steps in How to Patrol Recent Changes on wikiHow! The number next to the weather symbol tells you how many unpatrolled edits there are on the site right now. If the symbol is cloudy or rainy, that means we really need your help!\n\n\nWho runs wikiHow?\n\nWe all do. wikiHow is a volunteer-driven site for the most part. There are a few staff members who get paid to help engineer, manage and maintain the site. Decisions get made by the community on most matters, and ultimately it's still up to us all - the readers and users of the site - to help wikiHow grow and fulfill its mission of building the most helpful how-to manual on the planet.\n\n\nWhy are there ads on your site?\n\nwikiHow is a hybrid organization, which means that even though it's a for-profit company, it's run as a community service first and a business second. Instead of asking for donations or charging people to view content, wikiHow uses ads as its primary source of income. However, we don't think that ads should be shoved down your throat. If you don't like advertising, you can register for an account and you'll never see any ads again.\n\n\nIs this the same as the Wikimedia wikis?\n\nNo. Most wikis share the same underlying software, but our project is run by a completely separate organization with a different goal. While most of Wikimedia's goals are to provide encyclopedic articles, we are a how-to guide with a goal of helping everyone on the planet get to know how to do anything.\n\n\nIs wikiHow the same as eHow?\n\nNo. wikiHow isn't the same as eHow. wikiHow's founder Jack Herrick used to run eHow, but later separated his focus from it and decided to form wikiHow. Unlike eHow, wikiHow is open for editing with a freely available by Creative Commons license, available on open source software, and run largely by volunteers.\n\n\nHow do I change the language on wikiHow?\n\nThe main wikiHow language can't be changed \"per-se\". However, wikiHow is also offered in Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, Vietnamese, Thai, Portuguese, Czech, Arabic, Indonesian, Korean and Japanese. If your language isn't on that list yet, that doesn't mean we won't build it in the future! If you'd like to be kept up to date about any plans to launch a wikiHow site in your language in the future, email wiki@wikiHow.com to express your interest.\n\n\nI'd like to save some of the links. How can I save them?\n\nwikiHow has you covered on that issue too. Follow the directions in How to Save or Bookmark Links to wikiHow Articles to save them so you can retrieve them at some other time.\n\n\nWill I get paid to volunteer/work at wikiHow?\n\nWith the exception of a select few employees/staff of the company, we are all volunteers here and hence, will not be paid. If you'd like a paid spot, you'll have to either look into a job at wikiHow, or work elsewhere instead; you won't get paid to volunteer here or make any contributions of any kind on the site.\n\n\n \n \nQuestions about contributing\n\n\n\nHow can I write an article?\n\nYour first step would be to read How to Write a New Article on wikiHow, and then you would go to Special:CreatePage. Please see Writer's Guide for more guidelines as well.\n\n\nHow can I link to my website?\n\n\nIn general, linking for the sake of \"building backlinks\" isn't permitted, and people who make repeated self-promotional link additions often end up having their sites blacklisted. Adding links from a neutral perspective to reputable sources of information for the purpose of referencing advice shared on the page is great, though. For more information, check out the External Links Policy and How to Reference Sources on wikiHow.\nCheck out How to Publicize Yourself the Right Way on wikiHow. You can always link to your website from your own user page.\n\n\n\nHow do I add a picture to an article?\n\nAdding pictures to articles is great if you own the copyright to them and are willing to share them under our Creative Commons license, or if you have other images you've already confirmed are licensed in a way that allows them to be shared here. To find out how, please read How to Put a Photo in a wikiHow Article.\n\n\nHow can I get images for articles, if I can't upload any (or have none that I've created)?\n\nAsk the Wikivisual team for images for any fully promoted article by posting a message on their talk page. The team will try to get suitable pictures, screenshots or illustrations up as soon as possible, but it may take a little while. Most articles will get images eventually if you don't request them, but a specific request is always welcome and may speed the process up.\n\n\nHow do I get my article featured?\n\nMake sure the page is detailed, comprehensive, and insightful. Aim to make it the \"best on the web\" for the given topic (and pick an appealing topic, too). Try to add information that might make someone say \"Wow, I didn't know that!\" If you're knowledgeable about the topic, you probably have plenty of \"insider\" tips; but even if you're not an expert, you can find them elsewhere on the Internet and add them to the article if you reference them properly.\nWhen you think your article is ready, go to the discussion page and write {{fac}} at the very top. Also, when you interact with other people on wikiHow, tell them you're trying to get your page featured and would appreciate their help.\n\n\nWhat's an Admin? How do I become one?\n\nAdmins are volunteers too who take on extra responsibilities in the form of being able to delete and rename articles, protect pages, and block vandals. Administrators have earned the trust of the community with their levelheadedness in tough situations and are able to calm most argumentative editors. Most Admins have a large number of edits and have shown continued dedication to this project over a long period of time.\nCurrent admins nominate candidates for adminship based on the candidate's editing history on the site and that person's interactions in the community. Candidates with sufficient support from existing admins are then given a \"trial adminship\" period in which they are mentored by several existing admins. See How to Become a wikiHow Admin for more details.\n\n\nWhat's \"NAB\"? How do I become a \"NABer?\"\n\nNew Article Boost (most often known as \"NAB\") provides an initial fix or \"boost\" of newly-submitted articles. Boosters often correct spelling and formatting errors, as well as reviewing the topic's helpfulness and accuracy. They help ensure good content is made available to the world, and they hide or \"demote\" content that is not ready for readers yet. New Article Boosters also try to encourage new authors to stick around and keep writing articles.\nTo become a New Article Booster, you need to pass a series of written tests and a trial. See How to Become a New Article Booster on wikiHow for more information.\n\n\nWhat is the article review process?\n\nArticles on wikiHow are not fully published until they have passed a quality review process called \"New Article Boost\". Articles which haven't yet gone through this quality review remain mostly hidden from the public, since they are not indexed in search results or visible logged out. In order for an article to be fully published, it must meet the guidelines in our Writer's Guide and be approved by our volunteer community.\n\n\nHow long does it take for an article to go through the review process? How can I get it to be approved quicker? How can I get that orange message to disappear?\n\nIt varies, but most articles get reviewed within 48 hours. If yours gets approved, the orange blurred message will be removed from the page, and you'll generally be notified on your talk page. If it doesn't, it might need some additional work. Check out How to Get an Article Approved in wikiHow's Quality Review or reach out to a volunteer for more help.\n\n\nHow can I get started?\n\nAlthough you may want to begin by reading through our Tour page, you can also help out with some of the tools on our Community Dashboard or dive in and Topic Greenhouseedit articles that you can improve. Maybe you can add a tip, correct a fact, fix a typo, etc. Every edit helps!\n\n\nWhat's wiki markup and how do I use it?\n\nWiki markup is the code used to help format wikiHow articles. It's like a shortened form of HTML. Click here for a quick reference to our editing basics, or, if you know these already, have a look at our Advanced Wiki Syntax page for additional wiki markup options.\n\n\n \n \nWhy is this happening?\n\n\n\nWhy are my started article/pages getting deleted?\n\nAs you can imagine, wikiHow receives many new articles each day. To help maintain the quality of articles on wikiHow, we do have a deletion policy that determines what articles we keep on the site. If an article seems to violate the deletion policy, it gets nominated for deletion, which means that the community is invited to discuss whether the page should be kept or not.\nNot all nominated articles are removed. If you don't want your article to get deleted, try following the steps in How to Prevent Your wikiHow Article from Getting Deleted. However, if it has already been deleted or if you have more questions about how the deletion policy works or why your article was deleted, feel free to email deleted@wikihow.com.\n\n\nWhy is my page getting merged?\n\nSince this is a collaborative project, we want people to work together to build one high-quality page on a particular topic, rather than each person making their own page. Plus, it gives our readers a single place where they can find all the advice we have on a single topic.\nIf your page got tagged for merging, it means someone thinks it's on the same topic as a page we already have on the site. If you think your page is different, however, read our merge policy and explain on the discussion page why your topic is distinct.\n\n\nWhy does it say my IP address is blocked?\n\nWhen most people log into their Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to get internet access, the ISP assigns a random (or shared) IP address to them for that particular internet session. This means that if you edit anonymously, you may be sharing an IP address with several other people, one of whom may be vandalizing even while you are making good faith edits.\nSince folks at wikiHow have no way to know which of those multiple people is doing the vandalizing, we may simply block the IP address they are vandalizing from. You can avoid having your edits lumped in with a bunch of other anonymous users by registering a username (it's free, and we won't spam you or sell your information to anyone) and always signing in with that username whenever you edit on the site. This will allow you to edit, even if the IP that has been assigned to you has previously been used by a vandal.\n\n\nWhy isn't anyone talking to me on the chat page?\n\nwikiHow's talk pages aren't meant for this purpose. Talk pages are for collaboration on articles with other editors, not for chatting about non-wikiHow related topics. Every edit you make- even to someone's talk page - gets reviewed by another editor in our Recent Changes Patrol tool, so excessive chat messages can clog up that system.\nAs for why you may not be getting a quick response to questions or greetings on your talk page... While we have thousands of registered users, they're not all active all the time. The person you are leaving a message for may not have edited here for some time, and may not be seeing your message at all. Your best bet to get in touch with someone is to post in the forums or send an e-mail to community support.\n\n\nWhy can't I edit certain pages?\n\nSome articles are protected because of a recent drive in high traffic to an article or vandalism. But don't feel discouraged; this is rather rare! Those who sign-up for their own registered account can edit a semi-protected page, but if you need to make changes to a fully-protected page, you can always contact an Admin who can and will help.\n\n\nWhy are the date and time inaccurate?\n\nIf you're not in the default time zone, you can use the preferences page for dates and times to adjust for your time zone. Pick your closest big city in the list and click the Save button.\n\n\nHow can I get the article to print with the pictures included?\n\nThe default print preview used here doesn't show images; however, if you scroll to the bottom of an article in desktop mode, you can find a \"Print\" link that gives you the option to include images or not. Check out How to Print a wikiHow Article for more details.\n\n\n \n \nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\nHow do I report a bug?\n\nPost a message in the Bug Reports section of the forums. Please be sure to read this informative page on reporting a bug and make sure to also post the customized link you receive from the AboutMyBrowser webpage to provide some information about your browser and device.\n\n\nHow do I report an error or a bad edit on an article?\n\nwikiHow is a wiki, which means anyone can edit any page. If an article has an error, misleading statement, or vandalism, feel free to simply edit the page; you don't even have to register. You can also e-mail us.\n\n\nI keep seeing abbreviations. What do they mean?\n\nJust click here for help in understanding all of our abbreviations. You can also check out our Glossary of terms.\n\n\nWho do I talk to about possible vandalism?\n\nLeave a message on the Administrator Notice Board or on an Admin's talk page. They should be able to help if intervention is needed to prevent disruption on the wiki.\n\n\nHow can I let the team know that I have feedback for them?\n\nDepending on the type of feedback you have, there are several ways to give the team feedback. We'd love to have your input. Please see How to Give Feedback to the wikiHow Team for advice on how you can share your ideas with the team.\n\n\nHow do I report something that needs immediate attention?\n\nFeel free to leave a note on the Administrator Notice Board. It is monitored by many admins, so critical issues are often handled quickly from there.\n\n\nHow do I delete my account?\n\nIf you do not wish to use your account, the simplest thing to do is to log out and never log back in. If you wish to remove your name and username from wikiHow, email wiki@wikiHow.com. Make sure to provide details when you ask for assistance. How to Close Your wikiHow Account offers additional options.\n\n\nHow do I change my username?\n\nOur username guidelines page outlines the various cases in which you can change your username. If one of those reasons matches yours, you can fill out a form to request a new name. More information on this can be found in How to Change Your Name on wikiHow.\n\n\n \n  \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.024 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.032 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node

Anyone is invited to use the tools we have on the site to review RC and decide which edits stay, and which ones don't. Most of the edits made on any given day are helpful, and any bad edits (vandalism) are usually quickly reverted by an RC patroller. Would you like to help out? Check out how it is done in this article: <a href=\"/Patrol-Recent-Changes-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Patrol Recent Changes on wikiHow\">How to Patrol Recent Changes on wikiHow</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_are_unpatrolled_edits.3F_What_does_the_little_weather_icon_mean.3F\">What are unpatrolled edits?

There are a few staff members who get paid to help engineer, manage and maintain the site. Decisions get made by the <a href=\"/Reach-a-Consensus\" title=\"Reach a Consensus\">community</a> on most matters, and ultimately it's still up to us all - the readers and users of the site - to help wikiHow grow and fulfill its <a href=\"/wikiHow:Mission\" title=\"wikiHow:Mission\">mission</a> of building the most helpful how-to manual on the planet.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_are_there_ads_on_your_site.3F\">Why are there ads on your site?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>wikiHow is a <a href=\"/wikiHow:Hybrid-Organization\" title=\"wikiHow:Hybrid Organization\">hybrid organization</a>, which means that even though it's a for-profit company, it's run as a community service first and a business second. Instead of asking for donations or charging people to view content, wikiHow uses ads as its primary source of income. However, we don't think that ads should be shoved down your throat. If you don't like advertising, you can <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/Create-Your-wikiHow-Account\" title=\"Create Your wikiHow Account\">register for an account</a> and you'll never see any ads again.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Is_this_the_same_as_the_Wikimedia_wikis.3F\">Is this the same as the Wikimedia wikis?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>No. Most wikis share the same underlying software, but our project is run by a completely separate organization with a different goal. While most of Wikimedia's goals are to provide encyclopedic articles, we are a how-to guide with a goal of helping everyone on the planet get to know how to do anything.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Is_wikiHow_the_same_as_eHow.3F\">Is wikiHow the same as eHow?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>No. wikiHow isn't the same as eHow. wikiHow's founder <a href=\"/User:JackHerrick\" title=\"User:JackHerrick\">Jack Herrick</a> used to run eHow, but later separated his focus from it and decided to form wikiHow. Unlike eHow, wikiHow is open for editing with a freely available by Creative Commons license, available on open source software, and run largely by volunteers.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_do_I_change_the_language_on_wikiHow.3F\">How do I change the language on wikiHow?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>The main wikiHow language can't be changed \"per-se\".

If you'd like a paid spot, you'll have to either look into a <a href=\"/wikiHow:Jobs\" title=\"wikiHow:Jobs\">job</a> at wikiHow, or work elsewhere instead; you won't get paid to volunteer here or make any contributions of any kind on the site.</p>\n<div class=\"clearall\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section questionsaboutcontributing sticky\">\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Questions_about_contributing\">Questions about contributing</span></h2>\n<div class=\"section_text\" id=\"questionsaboutcontributing\">\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_can_I_write_an_article.3F\">How can I write an article?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Your first step would be to read <a href=\"/Write-a-New-Article-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Write a New Article on wikiHow\">How to Write a New Article on wikiHow</a>, and then you would go to <a href=\"/Special:CreatePage\" title=\"Special:CreatePage\">Special:CreatePage</a>.

Adding links from a neutral perspective to <i>reputable</i> sources of information for the purpose of referencing advice shared on the page is great, though. For more information, check out the <a href=\"/wikiHow:External-Links\" title=\"wikiHow:External Links\">External Links Policy</a> and <a href=\"/Reference-Sources-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Reference Sources on wikiHow\">How to Reference Sources on wikiHow</a>.</li>\n<li>Check out How to <a href=\"/Publicize-Yourself-the-Right-Way-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Publicize Yourself the Right Way on wikiHow\">Publicize Yourself the Right Way on wikiHow</a>.

The team will try to get suitable pictures, screenshots or illustrations up as soon as possible, but it may take a little while. Most articles will get images eventually if you don't request them, but a specific request is always welcome and may speed the process up.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_do_I_get_my_article_featured.3F\">How do I get my article featured?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Make sure the page is detailed, comprehensive, and <i>insightful</i>. Aim to make it the \"best on the web\" for the given topic (and pick an appealing topic, too). Try to add information that might make someone say \"Wow, I didn't know that!\" If you're knowledgeable about the topic, you probably have plenty of \"insider\" tips; but even if you're not an expert, you can find them elsewhere on the Internet and add them to the article if you <a href=\"/Reference-Sources-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Reference Sources on wikiHow\">reference them properly</a>.</p>\n<br/><p>When you think your article is ready, go to the discussion page and write {{fac}} at the very top. Also, when you interact with other people on wikiHow, tell them you're trying to get your page featured and would appreciate their help.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What.27s_an_Admin.3F_How_do_I_become_one.3F\">What's an Admin? How do I become one?</span>\n</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wikiHow:Administrators\" title=\"wikiHow:Administrators\">Admins</a> are volunteers too who take on extra responsibilities in the form of being able to delete and rename articles, protect pages, and block vandals. Administrators have earned the trust of the community with their levelheadedness in tough situations and are able to calm most argumentative editors. Most Admins have a large number of edits and have shown continued dedication to this project over a long period of time.</p>\n<br/><p>Current admins nominate candidates for adminship based on the candidate's editing history on the site and that person's interactions in the community. Candidates with sufficient support from existing admins are then given a \"trial adminship\" period in which they are mentored by several existing admins. See <a href=\"/Become-a-wikiHow-Admin\" title=\"Become a wikiHow Admin\">How to Become a wikiHow Admin</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What.27s_.22NAB.22.3F_How_do_I_become_a_.22NABer.3F.22\">What's \"NAB\"? How do I become a \"NABer?\"</span>\n</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/wikiHow:New-Article-Boosters\" title=\"wikiHow:New Article Boosters\">New Article Boost</a> (most often known as \"NAB\") provides an initial fix or \"boost\" of newly-submitted articles. Boosters often correct spelling and formatting errors, as well as reviewing the topic's helpfulness and accuracy. They help ensure good content is made available to the world, and they hide or \"demote\" content that is not ready for readers yet. New Article Boosters also try to encourage new authors to stick around and keep writing articles.</p>\n<br/><p>To become a New Article Booster, you need to pass a series of written tests and a trial. See <a href=\"/Become-a-New-Article-Booster-on-wikiHow\" title=\"Become a New Article Booster on wikiHow\">How to Become a New Article Booster on wikiHow</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_is_the_article_review_process.3F\">What is the article review process?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Articles on wikiHow are not fully published until they have passed a quality review process called \"New Article Boost\". Articles which haven't yet gone through this quality review remain mostly hidden from the public, since they are not indexed in search results or visible logged out. In order for an article to be fully published, it must meet the guidelines in our <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/Writer%27s-Guide\" title=\"Writer's Guide\">Writer's Guide</a> and be approved by our volunteer community.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_long_does_it_take_for_an_article_to_go_through_the_review_process.3F_How_can_I_get_it_to_be_approved_quicker.3F_How_can_I_get_that_orange_message_to_disappear.3F\">How long does it take for an article to go through the review process? How can I get it to be approved quicker? How can I get that orange message to disappear?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>It varies, but most articles get reviewed within 48 hours. If yours gets approved, the orange blurred message will be removed from the page, and you'll generally be notified on your talk page. If it doesn't, it might need some additional work.

It's like a shortened form of HTML. Click <a href=\"/wikiHow:Editing-Basics\" title=\"wikiHow:Editing Basics\">here</a> for a quick reference to our editing basics, or, if you know these already, have a look at our <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wikiHow:Use-Advanced-Wiki-Syntax\" title=\"wikiHow:Use Advanced Wiki Syntax\">Advanced Wiki Syntax</a> page for additional wiki markup options.</p>\n<div class=\"clearall\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section whyisthishappening sticky\">\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_is_this_happening.3F\">Why is this happening?</span></h2>\n<div class=\"section_text\" id=\"whyisthishappening\">\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_are_my_started_article.2Fpages_getting_deleted.3F\">Why are my started article/pages getting deleted?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>As you can imagine, wikiHow receives many new articles each day. To help maintain the quality of articles on wikiHow, we do have a <a href=\"/wikiHow:Deletion-Policy\" title=\"wikiHow:Deletion Policy\">deletion policy</a> that determines what articles we keep on the site. If an article seems to violate the deletion policy, it gets nominated for deletion, which means that the community is invited to discuss whether the page should be kept or not.</p>\n<br/><p>Not all nominated articles are removed. If you don't want your article to get deleted, try following the steps in <a href=\"/Prevent-Your-wikiHow-Article-from-Getting-Deleted\" title=\"Prevent Your wikiHow Article from Getting Deleted\">How to Prevent Your wikiHow Article from Getting Deleted</a>. However, if it has already been deleted or if you have more questions about how the deletion policy works or why your article was deleted, feel free to email <a class=\"external text\" href=\"mailto:deleted@wikihow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">deleted@wikihow.com</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_is_my_page_getting_merged.3F\">Why is my page getting merged?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Since this is a collaborative project, we want people to work together to build one high-quality page on a particular topic, rather than each person making their own page. Plus, it gives our readers a single place where they can find all the advice we have on a single topic.</p>\n<br/><p>If your page got tagged for merging, it means someone thinks it's on the same topic as a page we already have on the site. If you think your page is different, however, read our <a href=\"/wikiHow:Merge-Policy\" title=\"wikiHow:Merge Policy\">merge policy</a> and explain on the discussion page why your topic is distinct.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_does_it_say_my_IP_address_is_blocked.3F\">Why does it say my IP address is blocked?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>When most people log into their Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to get internet access, the ISP assigns a random (or shared) IP address to them for that particular internet session. This means that if you edit anonymously, you may be sharing an IP address with several other people, one of whom may be vandalizing even while you are making good faith edits.</p>\n<br/><p>Since folks at wikiHow have no way to know which of those multiple people is doing the vandalizing, we may simply block the IP address they are vandalizing from. You can avoid having your edits lumped in with a bunch of other anonymous users by registering a username (it's free, and we won't spam you or sell your information to anyone) and always signing in with that username whenever you edit on the site. This will allow you to edit, even if the IP that has been assigned to you has previously been used by a vandal.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_isn.27t_anyone_talking_to_me_on_the_chat_page.3F\">Why isn't anyone talking to me on the chat page?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>wikiHow's talk pages aren't meant for this purpose. Talk pages are for collaboration on articles with other editors, not for chatting about non-wikiHow related topics. Every edit you make- even to someone's talk page - gets reviewed by another editor in our <a href=\"/Special:RCPatrol\" title=\"Special:RCPatrol\">Recent Changes Patrol tool</a>, so excessive chat messages can clog up that system.</p>\n<br/><p>As for why you may not be getting a quick response to questions or greetings on your talk page... While we have thousands of registered users, they're not all active all the time. The person you are leaving a message for may not have edited here for some time, and may not be seeing your message at all. Your best bet to get in touch with someone is to post in the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://forums.wikihow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">forums</a> or send an e-mail to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"mailto:anna@wikihow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">community support</a>.</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"altblock\"></div>\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_can.27t_I_edit_certain_pages.3F\">Why can't I edit certain pages?</span>\n</h3>\n<p>Some articles are protected because of a recent drive in high traffic to an article or <a href=\"/wikiHow:Vandalism\" title=\"wikiHow:Vandalism\">vandalism</a>.

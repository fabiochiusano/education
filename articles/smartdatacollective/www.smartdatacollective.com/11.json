href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Florence Nightingale</a>, who was \u2013 according to The Font \u2013 <em>\u201ca celebrated English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing\u201d</em>.\n It is gratifying to see her less high-profile role as a number-cruncher\n acknowledged up-front and central; particularly as she died in 1910, \neight years before women in the UK were first allowed to vote and \neighteen before universal suffrage. This diagram is one of two which are\n generally cited in any article on Data Visualisation. The other is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Minard\u2019s</a> exhibit detailing the advance on, and retreat from, Moscow of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Arm%C3%A9e\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Grande Arm\u00e9e</a> in 1812 (Data Visualisation had a military genesis in common with \u2013 \namongst many other things \u2013 the internet). I\u2019ll leave the reader to look\n at this second famous diagram if they want to; it\u2019s just a click away.</p><div class=\"quads-location quads-ad1\" id=\"quads-ad1\" style=\"float:none;margin:5px;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5846770866792663\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-slot=\"4409634097\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script> </div><p>While there are more elements of numeric information in Minard\u2019s work (what we would now call measures), there is a differentiating point to be made about Nightingale\u2019s diagram. This is that it was specifically produced to aid members of the British parliament in their understanding of conditions during <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Crimean War</a> (1853-56); particularly given that such non-specialists had struggled to understand traditional (and technical) statistical reports. Again, rather remarkably, we have here a scenario where the great and the good were listening to the opinions of someone who was barred from voting on the basis of lacking a Y chromosome. Perhaps more pertinently to this blog, this scenario relates to one of the objectives of modern-day Data Visualisation in business; namely explaining complex issues, which don\u2019t leap off of a page of figures, to busy decision makers, some of whom may not be experts in the specific subject area (another is of course allowing the expert to discern less than obvious patterns in large or complex sets of data). Fortunately most business decision makers don\u2019t have to grapple with the progression in number of <em>\u201cdeaths from Preventible or Mitigable Zymotic diseases\u201d</em> versus <em>\u201ddeaths from wounds\u201d</em> over time, but the point remains.</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Data Visualisation in one branch of Science</strong></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img alt=\"von Laue, Bragg Senior &amp; Junior, Crowfoot Hodgkin, Kendrew, Perutz, Crick, Franklin, Watson &amp; Wilkins\" class=\"wp-image-7317\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pioneers.png?resize=600%2C293&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure><p>Coming much more up to date, I wanted to consider a modern example of\n Data Visualisation. As with Nightingale\u2019s work, this is not \nbusiness-focused, but contains some elements which should be pertinent \nto the professional considering the creation of diagrams in a business \ncontext. The specific area I will now consider is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Structural Biology</a>.\n For the incognoscenti (no advert for IBM intended!), this area of \nscience is focussed on determining the three-dimensional shape of \nbiologically relevant macro-molecules, most frequently proteins or \nprotein complexes. The history of Structural Biology is intertwined with\n the development of X-ray crystallography by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_von_Laue\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Max von Laue</a> and father and son team <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Bragg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">William Henry</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawrence_Bragg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">William Lawrence</a> Bragg; its subsequent application to organic molecules by a host of pioneers including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hodgkin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrew\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John Kendrew</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Perutz\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Max Perutz</a>; and \u2013 of greatest resonance to the general population \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Francis Crick</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rosalind Franklin</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">James Watson</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkins\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Maurice Wilkins</a>\u2019s joint determination of the structure of DNA in 1953.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www-project.slac.stanford.edu/wis/images/photo_51.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo-51\" class=\"wp-image-7306\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo-51.jpg?resize=400%2C406&amp;ssl=1\"/></a></figure><p><em>X-ray diffraction image of the double helix \nstructure of the DNA molecule, taken 1952 by Raymond Gosling, commonly \nreferred to as \u201cPhoto 51\u201d, during work by Rosalind Franklin on the \nstructure of DNA</em></p><p>While the masses of data gathered in modern X-ray crystallography \nneeds computer software to extrapolate them to physical structures, \nthings were more accessible in 1953.

In this\n case, the production of Photo 51 led directly to the creation of the \neven more iconic image below (which was drawn by Francis Crick\u2019s wife \nOdile and appeared in his and Watson\u2019s seminal Nature paper<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#1\">[1]</a></sup>):</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img alt=\"Odile and Francis Crick - structure of DNA\" class=\"wp-image-7422\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/odile-and-francis-crick-structure-of-dna.png?resize=170%2C600&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure><p><em>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/13997975/Watson_171737a0.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nature (1953)</a><br/> Posted on this site under the non-commercial clause of the right-holder\u2019s licence</em></p><p>It is probably fair to say that the visualisation of data which is displayed above has had something of an impact on humankind in the fifty years since it was first drawn.</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Modern Structural Biology</strong></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img alt=\"The X-ray Free Electron Laser at Stanford\" class=\"wp-image-7320\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slac-linac-coherent-light-source.jpg?resize=600%2C410&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure><p>Today, X-ray crystallography is one of many tools available to the \nstructural biologist with other approaches including Nuclear Magnetic \nResonance Spectroscopy, Electron Microscopy and a range of biophysical \ntechniques which I will not detain the reader by listing. The cutting \nedge is probably represented by the X-ray Free Electron Laser, a device \noriginally created by repurposing the linear accelerators of the \nprevious generation\u2019s particle physicists. In general Structural Biology\n has historically sat at an intersection of Physics and Biology.</p><p>However, before trips to synchrotrons can be planned, the Structural Biologist often faces the prospect of stabilising their protein of interest, ensuring that they can generate sufficient quantities of it, successfully isolating the protein and finally generating crystals of appropriate quality. This process often consumes years, in some cases decades. As with most forms of human endeavour, there are few short-cuts and the outcome is at least loosely correlated to the amount of time and effort applied (though sadly with no guarantee that hard work will always be rewarded).</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><br/><strong>From the general to the specific</strong></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00222836\"><img alt=\"The Journal of Molecular Biology (October 2014)\" class=\"wp-image-7330\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jmb-october-2014-h400.png?resize=298%2C400&amp;ssl=1\"/></a></figure><p>At this point I should declare a personal interest, the example of \nData Visualisation which I am going to consider is taken from a paper \nrecently accepted by <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00222836\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Journal of Molecular Biology</a> (JMB) and of which my wife is the first author<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#2\">[2]</a></sup>. Before looking at this exhibit, it\u2019s worth a brief detour to provide some context.</p><p>In recent decades, the exponential growth in the breadth and depth of\n scientific knowledge (plus of course the velocity with which this can \nbe disseminated), coupled with the increase in the range and complexity \nof techniques and equipment employed, has led to the emergence of \nspecialists. In turn this means that, in a manner analogous to the early\n production lines, science has become a very collaborative activity; \nexpert in stage one hands over the fruits of their labour to expert in \nstage two and so on. For this reason the typical scientific paper (and \ncertainly those in Structural Biology) will have several authors, often \nspread across multiple laboratory groups and frequently in different \ncountries. By way of example the previous paper my wife worked on had 16\n authors (including a Nobel Laureate<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#3\">[3]</a></sup>). In this context, the fact the paper I will now reference was authored by just my wife and her group leader is noteworthy.</p><p>The reader may at this point be relieved to learn that I am not going\n to endeavour to explain the subject matter of my wife\u2019s paper, nor the \ngeneral area of biology to which it pertains (the interested are \nrecommended to Google \u201c<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=membrane+proteins&amp;oq=membrane+proteins\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">membrane proteins</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=G+Protein+Coupled+Receptors&amp;oq=G+Protein+Coupled+Receptors\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">G Protein Coupled Receptors</a>\u201d as a starting point). Instead let\u2019s take a look at one of the exhibits.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jmb-exhibit-h1000.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Click to view a larger version in a new tab\" class=\"wp-image-7340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jmb-exhibit-w400.png?resize=400%2C530&amp;ssl=1\"/></a></figure><p><em>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283614005452\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Journal of Molecular Biology (2014)</a><br/> Posted on this site under a Creative Commons <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">licence</a></em></p><p>The above diagram (in common with Nightingale\u2019s much earlier one) \nattempts to show a connection between sets of data, rather than just the\n data itself. I\u2019ll elide the scientific specifics here and focus on more\n general issues.</p><p>First the grey upper section with the darker blots on it \u2013 which is labelled <strong>(a)</strong> \u2013 is an image of a biological assay called a Western Blot (for the interested, details can be viewed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>);\n each vertical column (labelled at the top of the diagram) represents a \nsub-experiment on protein drawn from a specific sample of cells. The \nvertical position of a blot indicates the size of the molecules found \nwithin it (in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">kilodaltons</a>);\n the intensity of a given blot indicates how much of the substance is \npresent. Aside from the headings and labels, the upper part of the \nfigure is a photographic image and so essentially analogue data<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#4\">[4]</a></sup>. So, in summary, this upper section represents the findings from one set of experiments.</p><p>At the bottom \u2013 and labelled <strong>(b)</strong> \u2013 appears an \nartefact familiar to anyone in business, a bar-graph. This presents \nresults from a parallel experiment on samples of protein from the same \ncells (for the interested, this set of data relates to degree to which \nproteins in the samples bind to a specific radiolabelled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ligand</a>).\n The second set of data is taken from what I might refer to as a \n\u201ccounting machine\u201d and is thus essentially digital. To be 100% clear, \nthe bar chart is not a representation of the data in the upper part of \nthe diagram, it pertains to results from a second experiment on the same\n samples. As indicated by the labelling, for a given sample, the column \nin the bar chart <strong>(b)</strong> is aligned with the column in the Western Blot above <strong>(a)</strong>, connecting the two different sets of results.</p><div style=\"clear:both; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:1em;\"><a class=\"IRPP_ruby\" href=\"https://www.smartdatacollective.com/predictive-analytics-addresses-pressing-web-hosting-challenges-in-2019/\" target=\"_self\"><div class=\"postImageUrl\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.smartdatacollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/predictive-analytics-300x200.jpg);\"></div><div class=\"centered-text-area\"><div class=\"centered-text\"><div class=\"IRPP_ruby-content\"><div class=\"ctaText\" style=\"float:left;\">READ</div><div style=\"clear:both\"></div><div class=\"postTitle\" style=\"float:left;\">Predictive Analytics Addresses Pressing Web Hosting Challenges in 2019</div></div></div><div class=\"ctaButton\"></div></div></a></div><p>Taken together the upper and lower sections<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#5\">[5]</a></sup> establish a relationship between the two sets of data. Again I\u2019ll skip on the specifics, but the general point is that while the Western Blot <strong>(a)</strong> and the binding assay <strong>(b)</strong> tell us the same story, the Western Blot is a much more straightforward and speedy procedure. The relationship that the paper establishes means that just the Western Blot can be used to perform a simple new assay which will save significant time and effort for people engaged in the determination of the structures of membrane proteins; a valuable new insight. Clearly the relationships that have been inferred could equally have been presented in a tabular form instead and be just as relevant. It is however testament to the more atavistic side of humans that \u2013 in common with many relationships between data \u2013 a picture says it more surely and (to mix a metaphor) more viscerally. This is the essence of Data Visualisation.</p><p><strong>What learnings can Scientific Data Visualisation provide to Business?</strong></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img alt=\"Scientific presentation (c/o Nature, but looks a lot like PhD Comics IMO)\" class=\"wp-image-7376\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/scientific-presentation.jpg?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure><p>Using the JMB exhibit above, I wanted to now make some more general observations and consider a few questions which arise out of comparing scientific and business approaches to Data Visualisation. I think that many of these points are pertinent to analysis in general.</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Normalisation</strong></p><p>Broadly, normalisation<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#6\">[6]</a></sup> consists of defining results in relation to some established yardstick \n(or set of yardsticks); displaying relative, as opposed to absolute, \nnumbers. In the JMB exhibit above, the amount of protein solubilised in \nvarious detergents is shown with reference to the un-solubilised amount \nfound in native membranes; these reference figures appear as 100% \ncolumns to the right and left extremes of the diagram.</p><p>The most common usage of normalisation in business is growth \npercentages. Here the fact that London business has grown by 5% can be \ncompared to Copenhagen having grown by 10% despite total London business\n being 20-times the volume of Copenhagen\u2019s. A related business example, \ndepending on implementation details, could be comparing foreign currency\n amounts at a fixed exchange rate to remove the impact of currency \nfluctuation.</p><p>Normalised figures are very typical in science, but, aside from the growth example mentioned above, considerably less prevalent in business. In both avenues of human endeavour, the approach should be used with caution; something that increases 200% from a very small starting point may not be relevant, be that the result of an experiment or weekly sales figures. Bearing this in mind, normalisation is often essential when looking to present data of different orders on the same graph<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#7\">[7]</a></sup>; the alternative often being that smaller data is swamped by larger, not always what is desirable.</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll use an anecdote to illustrate this area from a business \nperspective. Imagine an organisation which (as you would expect) tracks \nthe volume of sales of a product or service it provides via a number of \noutlets. Imagine further that it launches some sort of promotion, \nperhaps valid only for a week, and notices an uptick in these sales. It \nis extremely tempting to state that the promotion has resulted in \nincreased sales<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#8\">[8]</a></sup>.</p><p>However this cannot always be stated with certainty. Sales may have \nincreased for some totally unrelated reason such as (depending on what \nis being sold) good or bad weather, a competitor increasing prices or \nclosing one or more of their comparable outlets and so on. Equally \nperniciously, the promotion maybe have simply moved sales in time \u2013 \npeople may have been going to buy the organisation\u2019s product or service \nin the weeks following a promotion, but have brought the expenditure \nforward to take advantage of it. If this is indeed the case, an uptick \nin sales may well be due to the impact of a promotion, but will be \noffset by a subsequent decrease.</p><p>In science, it is this type of problem that the concept of control \ntests is designed to combat. As well as testing a result in the <em>presence </em>of substance or condition X, a well-designed scientific experiment will also be carried out in the <em>absence </em>of\n substance or condition X, the latter being the control. In the JMB \nexhibit above, the controls appear in the columns with white labels.</p><p>There are ways to make the business \u201cexperiment\u201d I refer to above \nmore scientific of course. In retail business, the current focus on \nloyalty cards can help, assuming that these can be associated with the \nrelevant transactions. If the business is on-line then historical \nrecords of purchasing behaviour can be similarly referenced. In the \nabove example, the organisation could decide to offer the promotion at \nonly a subset of the its outlets, allowing a comparison to those where \nno promotion applied. This approach may improve rigour somewhat, but of \ncourse it does not cater for purchases transferred from a non-promotion \noutlet to a promotion one (unless a whole raft of assumptions are made).\n There are entire industries devoted to helping businesses deal with \nthese rather messy scenarios, but it is probably fair to say that it is \nnormally easier to devise and carry out control tests in science.</p><p>The general take away here is that a graph which shows some change in a business output (say sales or profit) correlated to some change in a business input (e.g. a promotion, a new product launch, or a price cut) would carry a lot more weight if it also provided some measure of what would have happened without the change in input (not that this is always easy to measure).</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Rigour and Scrutiny</p><p>I mention in the footnotes that the JMB paper in question includes \nversions of the exhibit presented above for four other membrane \nproteins, this being in order to firmly establish a connection. Looking \nat just the figure I have included here, each element of the data \npresented in the lower bar-graph area is based on duplicated or \ntriplicated tests, with average results (and error bars \u2013 see the next \nsection) being shown. When you consider that upwards of three months\u2019 \npreparatory work could have gone into any of these elements and that a \nmistake at any stage during this time would have rendered the work \nuseless, some impression of the level of rigour involved emerges. The \nresult of this assiduous work is that the authors can be confident that \nthe exhibits they have developed are accurate and will stand up to \nexternal scrutiny. Of course such external scrutiny is a key part of the\n scientific process and the manuscript of the paper was reviewed \nextensively by independent experts before being accepted for \npublication.</p><p>In the business world, such external scrutiny tends to apply most \nfrequently to publicly published figures (such as audited Financial \nAccounts); of course external financial analysts also will look to dig \ninto figures. There may be some internal scrutiny around both the \nadditional numbers used to run the business and the graphical \nrepresentations of these (and indeed some companies take this area very \nseriously), but not every internal KPI is vetted the way that the report\n and accounts are. Particularly in the area of Data Visualisation, there\n is a tension here. Graphical exhibits can have a lot of impact if they \nrelate to the current situation or present trends; contrawise if they \nare substantially out-of-date, people may question their relevance. \nThere is sometimes the expectation that a dashboard is just like its \naeronautical counterpart, showing real-time information about what is \ngoing on now<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#9\">[9]</a></sup>.\n However a lot of the value of Data Visualisation is not about the here \nand now so much as trends and explanations of the factors behind the \nhere and now. A well-thought out graph can tell a very powerful story, \nmore powerful for most people than a table of figures. However a \nstriking graph based on poor quality data, data which has been combined \nin the wrong way, or even \u2013 as sometimes happens \u2013 the wrong datasets \nentirely, can tell a very misleading story and lead to the wrong \ndecisions being taken.</p><p>I am not for a moment suggesting here that every exhibit produced using Data Visualisation tools must be subject to months of scrutiny. As referenced above, in the hands of an expert such tools have the value of sometimes quickly uncovering hidden themes or factors. However, I would argue that \u2013 as in science \u2013 if the analyst involved finds something truly striking, an association which he or she feels will really resonate with senior business people, then double- or even triple-checking the data would be advisable. Asking a colleague to run their eye over the findings and to then probe for any obvious mistakes or weaknesses sounds like an appropriate next step. Internal Data Visualisations are never going to be subject to peer-review, however their value in taking sound business decisions will be increased substantially if their production reflects at least some of the rigour and scrutiny which are staples of the scientific method.</p><div style=\"clear:both; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:1em;\"><a class=\"IRPP_ruby\" href=\"https://www.smartdatacollective.com/is-predictive-analytics-changing-future-of-mobile-phone-monitoring/\" target=\"_self\"><div class=\"postImageUrl\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.smartdatacollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mobile-tracking-data-300x200.jpg);\"></div><div class=\"centered-text-area\"><div class=\"centered-text\"><div class=\"IRPP_ruby-content\"><div class=\"ctaText\" style=\"float:left;\">READ</div><div style=\"clear:both\"></div><div class=\"postTitle\" style=\"float:left;\">Is Predictive Analytics Changing The Future Of Mobile Phone Monitoring?</div></div></div><div class=\"ctaButton\"></div></div></a></div><p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Dealing with Uncertainty</p><p>In the previous section I referred to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_bar\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">error bars</a> appearing on the JMB figure above. Error bars are acknowledgements that\n what is being represented is variable and they indicate the extent of \nsuch variability. When dealing with a physical system (be that \nmechanical or \u2013 as in the case above \u2013 biological), behaviour is subject\n to many factors, not all of which can be eliminated or adjusted for and\n not all of which are predictable. This means that repeating an \nexperiment under ostensibly identical conditions can lead to different \nresults<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#10\">[10]</a></sup>.\n If the experiment is well-designed and if the experimenter is diligent,\n then such variability is minimised, but never eliminated. Error bars \nare a recognition of this fundamental aspect of the universe as we \nunderstand it.</p><p>While de rigueur in science, error bars seldom make an appearance in \nbusiness, even \u2013 in my experience \u2013 in estimates of business measures \nwhich emerge from statistical analyses<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#11\">[11]</a></sup>.\n Even outside the realm of statistically generated figures, more \nbusiness measures are subject to uncertainty than might initially be \nthought. An example here might be a comparison (perhaps as part of the \nexternally scrutinised report and accounts) of the current quarter\u2019s \nsales to the previous one (or the same one last year). In companies \nwhere sales may be tied to \u2013 for example \u2013 the number of outlets, care \nis paid to making these figures like-for-like. This might include only \nshowing numbers for outlets which were in operation in the prior period \nand remain in operation now (i.e. excluding sales from both closed \noutlets or newly opened ones). However, outside the area of high-volume \nlow-value sales where the Law of Large Numbers<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#12\">[12]</a></sup> rules, other factors could substantially skew a given quarter\u2019s results\n for many organisations. Something as simple as a key customer delaying a\n purchase (so that it fell in Q3 this year instead of Q2 last) could \nhave a large impact on quarterly comparisons. Again companies will \nsometimes look to include adjustments to cater for such timing or \nrelated issues, but this cannot be a precise process.</p><p>The main point I am making here is that many aspects of the \ninformation produced in companies is uncertain. The cash transactions in\n a quarter are of course the cash transactions in a quarter, but the \nabove scenario suggests that they may not always 100% reflect actual \nbusiness conditions (and you cannot adjust for everything). Equally \nwhere you get in to figures that would be part of most companies\u2019 \nfinancial results, outstanding receivables and allowance for bad debts, \nthe spectre of uncertainty arises again without a statistical model in \nsight. In many industries, regulators are pushing for companies to \ninclude more forward-looking estimates of future assets and liabilities \nin their Financials. While this may be a sensible reaction to recent \neconomic crises, the approach inevitably leads to more figures being \nproduced from models. Even when these models are subject to external \nreview, as is the case with most regulatory-focussed ones, they are \nstill models and there will be uncertainty around the numbers that they \ngenerate. While companies will often provide a range of estimates for \nthings like guidance on future earnings per share, providing a range of \nestimates for historical financial exhibits is not really a mainstream \nactivity.</p><p>Which perhaps gets me back to the subject of error bars on graphs. In\n general I think that their presence in Data Visualisations can only add\n value, not subtract it. In my article entitled <a href=\"http://peterjamesthomas.com/2010/03/28/limitations-of-bi/\">Limitations of Business Intelligence</a> I include the following passage which contains an exhibit showing how \nthe Bank of England approaches communicating the uncertainty inevitably \nassociated with its inflation estimates:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Business Intelligence is not a crystal ball, Predictive \nAnalytics is not a crystal ball either. They are extremely useful tools \n[\u2026] but they are not universal panaceas.</p><p> [\u2026] Statistical models will never give you precise answers to what will \nhappen in the future \u2013 a range of outcomes, together with probabilities \nassociated with each is the best you can hope for (see above). \nPredictive Analytics will not make you prescient, instead it can provide\n you with useful guidance, so long as you remember it is a prediction, \nnot fact.</p></blockquote><p>While I can\u2019t see them figuring in formal financial statements any time soon, perhaps there is a case for more business Data Visualisations to include error bars.</p><p style=\"font-size:25px\"><strong>In Summary</strong></p><p>So, as is often the case, I have embarked on a journey. I started \nwith an early example of Data Visualisation, diverted in to a particular\n branch of science with which I have some familiarity and hopefully \nreturned, again as is often the case, to make some points which I think \nare pertinent to both the Business Intelligence practitioner and the \nconsumers (and indeed commissioners) of Data Visualisations. Back in <a href=\"http://peterjamesthomas.com/2009/02/25/all-that-glisters-is-not-gold-some-thoughts-on-dashboards/\">\u201cAll that glisters is not gold\u201d \u2013 some thoughts on dashboards</a> I made some more general comments about the best Data Visualisations \nhaving strong informational foundations underpinning them. While this \nobservation remains true, I do see a lot of value in numerically able \nand intellectually curious people using Data Visualisation tools to \nquickly make connections which had not been made before and to tease out\n patterns from large data sets. In addition there can be great value in \nusing Data Visualisation to present more quotidian information in a more\n easily digestible manner. However I also think that some of the \nlearnings from science which I have presented in this article suggest \nthat \u2013 as with all powerful tools \u2013 appropriate discretion on the part \nof the people generating Data Visualisation exhibits and on the part of \nthe people consuming such content would be prudent. In particular the \nbusiness equivalents of establishing controls, applying suitable rigour \nto data generation / combination and including information about \nuncertainty on exhibits where appropriate are all things which can help \nmake Data Visualisation more honest and thus \u2013 at least in my opinion \u2013 \nmore valuable.<br/> \u00a0</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/><p><em></em></p><p><em></em><div class=\"quads-location quads-ad2\" id=\"quads-ad2\" style=\"float:none;margin:5px 0 5px 0;text-align:center;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5846770866792663\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-slot=\"4409634097\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script> </div></p><table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td><sup>\u00a0<br/> [1]</sup></td><td>\u00a0<br/> <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/13997975/Watson_171737a0.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Watson, J.D., Crick, F.H.C.

This diagram is one of two which are\n generally cited in any article on Data Visualisation. The other is Charles Minard\u2019s exhibit detailing the advance on, and retreat from, Moscow of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s Grande Arm\u00e9e in 1812 (Data Visualisation had a military genesis in common with \u2013 \namongst many other things \u2013 the internet). I\u2019ll leave the reader to look\n at this second famous diagram if they want to; it\u2019s just a click away.   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); While there are more elements of numeric information in Minard\u2019s work (what we would now call measures), there is a differentiating point to be made about Nightingale\u2019s diagram. This is that it was specifically produced to aid members of the British parliament in their understanding of conditions during the Crimean War (1853-56); particularly given that such non-specialists had struggled to understand traditional (and technical) statistical reports. Again, rather remarkably, we have here a scenario where the great and the good were listening to the opinions of someone who was barred from voting on the basis of lacking a Y chromosome. Perhaps more pertinently to this blog, this scenario relates to one of the objectives of modern-day Data Visualisation in business; namely explaining complex issues, which don\u2019t leap off of a page of figures, to busy decision makers, some of whom may not be experts in the specific subject area (another is of course allowing the expert to discern less than obvious patterns in large or complex sets of data). Fortunately most business decision makers don\u2019t have to grapple with the progression in number of \u201cdeaths from Preventible or Mitigable Zymotic diseases\u201d versus \u201ddeaths from wounds\u201d over time, but the point remains.Data Visualisation in one branch of ScienceComing much more up to date, I wanted to consider a modern example of\n Data Visualisation. As with Nightingale\u2019s work, this is not \nbusiness-focused, but contains some elements which should be pertinent \nto the professional considering the creation of diagrams in a business \ncontext. The specific area I will now consider is Structural Biology.\n For the incognoscenti (no advert for IBM intended!), this area of \nscience is focussed on determining the three-dimensional shape of \nbiologically relevant macro-molecules, most frequently proteins or \nprotein complexes. The history of Structural Biology is intertwined with\n the development of X-ray crystallography by Max von Laue and father and son team William Henry and William Lawrence Bragg; its subsequent application to organic molecules by a host of pioneers including Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, John Kendrew and Max Perutz; and \u2013 of greatest resonance to the general population \u2013 Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, James Watson and Maurice Wilkins\u2019s joint determination of the structure of DNA in 1953.X-ray diffraction image of the double helix \nstructure of the DNA molecule, taken 1952 by Raymond Gosling, commonly \nreferred to as \u201cPhoto 51\u201d, during work by Rosalind Franklin on the \nstructure of DNAWhile the masses of data gathered in modern X-ray crystallography \nneeds computer software to extrapolate them to physical structures, \nthings were more accessible in 1953. Indeed, it could be argued that \nGosling and Franklin\u2019s famous image, its characteristic \u201cX\u201d suggestive \nof two helices and thus driving Crick and Watson\u2019s model building, is \nanother notable example of Data Visualisation; at least in the sense of a\n picture (rather than numbers) suggesting some underlying truth. In this\n case, the production of Photo 51 led directly to the creation of the \neven more iconic image below (which was drawn by Francis Crick\u2019s wife \nOdile and appeared in his and Watson\u2019s seminal Nature paper[1]):\u00a9 Nature (1953) Posted on this site under the non-commercial clause of the right-holder\u2019s licenceIt is probably fair to say that the visualisation of data which is displayed above has had something of an impact on humankind in the fifty years since it was first drawn.Modern Structural BiologyToday, X-ray crystallography is one of many tools available to the \nstructural biologist with other approaches including Nuclear Magnetic \nResonance Spectroscopy, Electron Microscopy and a range of biophysical \ntechniques which I will not detain the reader by listing. The cutting \nedge is probably represented by the X-ray Free Electron Laser, a device \noriginally created by repurposing the linear accelerators of the \nprevious generation\u2019s particle physicists. In general Structural Biology\n has historically sat at an intersection of Physics and Biology.However, before trips to synchrotrons can be planned, the Structural Biologist often faces the prospect of stabilising their protein of interest, ensuring that they can generate sufficient quantities of it, successfully isolating the protein and finally generating crystals of appropriate quality. This process often consumes years, in some cases decades. As with most forms of human endeavour, there are few short-cuts and the outcome is at least loosely correlated to the amount of time and effort applied (though sadly with no guarantee that hard work will always be rewarded).From the general to the specificAt this point I should declare a personal interest, the example of \nData Visualisation which I am going to consider is taken from a paper \nrecently accepted by the Journal of Molecular Biology (JMB) and of which my wife is the first author[2]. Before looking at this exhibit, it\u2019s worth a brief detour to provide some context.In recent decades, the exponential growth in the breadth and depth of\n scientific knowledge (plus of course the velocity with which this can \nbe disseminated), coupled with the increase in the range and complexity \nof techniques and equipment employed, has led to the emergence of \nspecialists. In turn this means that, in a manner analogous to the early\n production lines, science has become a very collaborative activity; \nexpert in stage one hands over the fruits of their labour to expert in \nstage two and so on. For this reason the typical scientific paper (and \ncertainly those in Structural Biology) will have several authors, often \nspread across multiple laboratory groups and frequently in different \ncountries. By way of example the previous paper my wife worked on had 16\n authors (including a Nobel Laureate[3]). In this context, the fact the paper I will now reference was authored by just my wife and her group leader is noteworthy.The reader may at this point be relieved to learn that I am not going\n to endeavour to explain the subject matter of my wife\u2019s paper, nor the \ngeneral area of biology to which it pertains (the interested are \nrecommended to Google \u201cmembrane proteins\u201d or \u201cG Protein Coupled Receptors\u201d as a starting point). Instead let\u2019s take a look at one of the exhibits.\u00a9 The Journal of Molecular Biology (2014) Posted on this site under a Creative Commons licenceThe above diagram (in common with Nightingale\u2019s much earlier one) \nattempts to show a connection between sets of data, rather than just the\n data itself. I\u2019ll elide the scientific specifics here and focus on more\n general issues.First the grey upper section with the darker blots on it \u2013 which is labelled (a) \u2013 is an image of a biological assay called a Western Blot (for the interested, details can be viewed here);\n each vertical column (labelled at the top of the diagram) represents a \nsub-experiment on protein drawn from a specific sample of cells. The \nvertical position of a blot indicates the size of the molecules found \nwithin it (in kilodaltons);\n the intensity of a given blot indicates how much of the substance is \npresent. Aside from the headings and labels, the upper part of the \nfigure is a photographic image and so essentially analogue data[4]. So, in summary, this upper section represents the findings from one set of experiments.At the bottom \u2013 and labelled (b) \u2013 appears an \nartefact familiar to anyone in business, a bar-graph. This presents \nresults from a parallel experiment on samples of protein from the same \ncells (for the interested, this set of data relates to degree to which \nproteins in the samples bind to a specific radiolabelled ligand).\n The second set of data is taken from what I might refer to as a \n\u201ccounting machine\u201d and is thus essentially digital. To be 100% clear, \nthe bar chart is not a representation of the data in the upper part of \nthe diagram, it pertains to results from a second experiment on the same\n samples. As indicated by the labelling, for a given sample, the column \nin the bar chart (b) is aligned with the column in the Western Blot above (a), connecting the two different sets of results.READPredictive Analytics Addresses Pressing Web Hosting Challenges in 2019Taken together the upper and lower sections[5] establish a relationship between the two sets of data. Again I\u2019ll skip on the specifics, but the general point is that while the Western Blot (a) and the binding assay (b) tell us the same story, the Western Blot is a much more straightforward and speedy procedure. The relationship that the paper establishes means that just the Western Blot can be used to perform a simple new assay which will save significant time and effort for people engaged in the determination of the structures of membrane proteins; a valuable new insight. Clearly the relationships that have been inferred could equally have been presented in a tabular form instead and be just as relevant. It is however testament to the more atavistic side of humans that \u2013 in common with many relationships between data \u2013 a picture says it more surely and (to mix a metaphor) more viscerally. This is the essence of Data Visualisation.What learnings can Scientific Data Visualisation provide to Business?Using the JMB exhibit above, I wanted to now make some more general observations and consider a few questions which arise out of comparing scientific and business approaches to Data Visualisation. I think that many of these points are pertinent to analysis in general.NormalisationBroadly, normalisation[6] consists of defining results in relation to some established yardstick \n(or set of yardsticks); displaying relative, as opposed to absolute, \nnumbers. In the JMB exhibit above, the amount of protein solubilised in \nvarious detergents is shown with reference to the un-solubilised amount \nfound in native membranes; these reference figures appear as 100% \ncolumns to the right and left extremes of the diagram.The most common usage of normalisation in business is growth \npercentages. Here the fact that London business has grown by 5% can be \ncompared to Copenhagen having grown by 10% despite total London business\n being 20-times the volume of Copenhagen\u2019s. A related business example, \ndepending on implementation details, could be comparing foreign currency\n amounts at a fixed exchange rate to remove the impact of currency \nfluctuation.Normalised figures are very typical in science, but, aside from the growth example mentioned above, considerably less prevalent in business. In both avenues of human endeavour, the approach should be used with caution; something that increases 200% from a very small starting point may not be relevant, be that the result of an experiment or weekly sales figures. Bearing this in mind, normalisation is often essential when looking to present data of different orders on the same graph[7]; the alternative often being that smaller data is swamped by larger, not always what is desirable.ControlsI\u2019ll use an anecdote to illustrate this area from a business \nperspective. Imagine an organisation which (as you would expect) tracks \nthe volume of sales of a product or service it provides via a number of \noutlets. Imagine further that it launches some sort of promotion, \nperhaps valid only for a week, and notices an uptick in these sales. It \nis extremely tempting to state that the promotion has resulted in \nincreased sales[8].However this cannot always be stated with certainty. Sales may have \nincreased for some totally unrelated reason such as (depending on what \nis being sold) good or bad weather, a competitor increasing prices or \nclosing one or more of their comparable outlets and so on. Equally \nperniciously, the promotion maybe have simply moved sales in time \u2013 \npeople may have been going to buy the organisation\u2019s product or service \nin the weeks following a promotion, but have brought the expenditure \nforward to take advantage of it. If this is indeed the case, an uptick \nin sales may well be due to the impact of a promotion, but will be \noffset by a subsequent decrease.In science, it is this type of problem that the concept of control \ntests is designed to combat. As well as testing a result in the presence of substance or condition X, a well-designed scientific experiment will also be carried out in the absence of\n substance or condition X, the latter being the control. In the JMB \nexhibit above, the controls appear in the columns with white labels.There are ways to make the business \u201cexperiment\u201d I refer to above \nmore scientific of course. In retail business, the current focus on \nloyalty cards can help, assuming that these can be associated with the \nrelevant transactions. If the business is on-line then historical \nrecords of purchasing behaviour can be similarly referenced. In the \nabove example, the organisation could decide to offer the promotion at \nonly a subset of the its outlets, allowing a comparison to those where \nno promotion applied. This approach may improve rigour somewhat, but of \ncourse it does not cater for purchases transferred from a non-promotion \noutlet to a promotion one (unless a whole raft of assumptions are made).\n There are entire industries devoted to helping businesses deal with \nthese rather messy scenarios, but it is probably fair to say that it is \nnormally easier to devise and carry out control tests in science.The general take away here is that a graph which shows some change in a business output (say sales or profit) correlated to some change in a business input (e.g. a promotion, a new product launch, or a price cut) would carry a lot more weight if it also provided some measure of what would have happened without the change in input (not that this is always easy to measure).Rigour and ScrutinyI mention in the footnotes that the JMB paper in question includes \nversions of the exhibit presented above for four other membrane \nproteins, this being in order to firmly establish a connection. Looking \nat just the figure I have included here, each element of the data \npresented in the lower bar-graph area is based on duplicated or \ntriplicated tests, with average results (and error bars \u2013 see the next \nsection) being shown. When you consider that upwards of three months\u2019 \npreparatory work could have gone into any of these elements and that a \nmistake at any stage during this time would have rendered the work \nuseless, some impression of the level of rigour involved emerges. The \nresult of this assiduous work is that the authors can be confident that \nthe exhibits they have developed are accurate and will stand up to \nexternal scrutiny. Of course such external scrutiny is a key part of the\n scientific process and the manuscript of the paper was reviewed \nextensively by independent experts before being accepted for \npublication.In the business world, such external scrutiny tends to apply most \nfrequently to publicly published figures (such as audited Financial \nAccounts); of course external financial analysts also will look to dig \ninto figures. There may be some internal scrutiny around both the \nadditional numbers used to run the business and the graphical \nrepresentations of these (and indeed some companies take this area very \nseriously), but not every internal KPI is vetted the way that the report\n and accounts are. Particularly in the area of Data Visualisation, there\n is a tension here. Graphical exhibits can have a lot of impact if they \nrelate to the current situation or present trends; contrawise if they \nare substantially out-of-date, people may question their relevance. \nThere is sometimes the expectation that a dashboard is just like its \naeronautical counterpart, showing real-time information about what is \ngoing on now[9].\n However a lot of the value of Data Visualisation is not about the here \nand now so much as trends and explanations of the factors behind the \nhere and now. A well-thought out graph can tell a very powerful story, \nmore powerful for most people than a table of figures. However a \nstriking graph based on poor quality data, data which has been combined \nin the wrong way, or even \u2013 as sometimes happens \u2013 the wrong datasets \nentirely, can tell a very misleading story and lead to the wrong \ndecisions being taken.I am not for a moment suggesting here that every exhibit produced using Data Visualisation tools must be subject to months of scrutiny. As referenced above, in the hands of an expert such tools have the value of sometimes quickly uncovering hidden themes or factors. However, I would argue that \u2013 as in science \u2013 if the analyst involved finds something truly striking, an association which he or she feels will really resonate with senior business people, then double- or even triple-checking the data would be advisable. Asking a colleague to run their eye over the findings and to then probe for any obvious mistakes or weaknesses sounds like an appropriate next step. Internal Data Visualisations are never going to be subject to peer-review, however their value in taking sound business decisions will be increased substantially if their production reflects at least some of the rigour and scrutiny which are staples of the scientific method.READIs Predictive Analytics Changing The Future Of Mobile Phone Monitoring?Dealing with UncertaintyIn the previous section I referred to the error bars appearing on the JMB figure above. Error bars are acknowledgements that\n what is being represented is variable and they indicate the extent of \nsuch variability. When dealing with a physical system (be that \nmechanical or \u2013 as in the case above \u2013 biological), behaviour is subject\n to many factors, not all of which can be eliminated or adjusted for and\n not all of which are predictable. This means that repeating an \nexperiment under ostensibly identical conditions can lead to different \nresults[10].\n If the experiment is well-designed and if the experimenter is diligent,\n then such variability is minimised, but never eliminated. Error bars \nare a recognition of this fundamental aspect of the universe as we \nunderstand it.While de rigueur in science, error bars seldom make an appearance in \nbusiness, even \u2013 in my experience \u2013 in estimates of business measures \nwhich emerge from statistical analyses[11].\n Even outside the realm of statistically generated figures, more \nbusiness measures are subject to uncertainty than might initially be \nthought. An example here might be a comparison (perhaps as part of the \nexternally scrutinised report and accounts) of the current quarter\u2019s \nsales to the previous one (or the same one last year). In companies \nwhere sales may be tied to \u2013 for example \u2013 the number of outlets, care \nis paid to making these figures like-for-like. This might include only \nshowing numbers for outlets which were in operation in the prior period \nand remain in operation now (i.e. excluding sales from both closed \noutlets or newly opened ones). However, outside the area of high-volume \nlow-value sales where the Law of Large Numbers[12] rules, other factors could substantially skew a given quarter\u2019s results\n for many organisations. Something as simple as a key customer delaying a\n purchase (so that it fell in Q3 this year instead of Q2 last) could \nhave a large impact on quarterly comparisons. Again companies will \nsometimes look to include adjustments to cater for such timing or \nrelated issues, but this cannot be a precise process.The main point I am making here is that many aspects of the \ninformation produced in companies is uncertain. The cash transactions in\n a quarter are of course the cash transactions in a quarter, but the \nabove scenario suggests that they may not always 100% reflect actual \nbusiness conditions (and you cannot adjust for everything). Equally \nwhere you get in to figures that would be part of most companies\u2019 \nfinancial results, outstanding receivables and allowance for bad debts, \nthe spectre of uncertainty arises again without a statistical model in \nsight. In many industries, regulators are pushing for companies to \ninclude more forward-looking estimates of future assets and liabilities \nin their Financials. While this may be a sensible reaction to recent \neconomic crises, the approach inevitably leads to more figures being \nproduced from models. Even when these models are subject to external \nreview, as is the case with most regulatory-focussed ones, they are \nstill models and there will be uncertainty around the numbers that they \ngenerate. While companies will often provide a range of estimates for \nthings like guidance on future earnings per share, providing a range of \nestimates for historical financial exhibits is not really a mainstream \nactivity.Which perhaps gets me back to the subject of error bars on graphs. In\n general I think that their presence in Data Visualisations can only add\n value, not subtract it. In my article entitled Limitations of Business Intelligence I include the following passage which contains an exhibit showing how \nthe Bank of England approaches communicating the uncertainty inevitably \nassociated with its inflation estimates:Business Intelligence is not a crystal ball, Predictive \nAnalytics is not a crystal ball either. They are extremely useful tools \n[\u2026] but they are not universal panaceas. [\u2026] Statistical models will never give you precise answers to what will \nhappen in the future \u2013 a range of outcomes, together with probabilities \nassociated with each is the best you can hope for (see above). \nPredictive Analytics will not make you prescient, instead it can provide\n you with useful guidance, so long as you remember it is a prediction, \nnot fact.While I can\u2019t see them figuring in formal financial statements any time soon, perhaps there is a case for more business Data Visualisations to include error bars.In SummarySo, as is often the case, I have embarked on a journey. I started \nwith an early example of Data Visualisation, diverted in to a particular\n branch of science with which I have some familiarity and hopefully \nreturned, again as is often the case, to make some points which I think \nare pertinent to both the Business Intelligence practitioner and the \nconsumers (and indeed commissioners) of Data Visualisations. Back in \u201cAll that glisters is not gold\u201d \u2013 some thoughts on dashboards I made some more general comments about the best Data Visualisations \nhaving strong informational foundations underpinning them. While this \nobservation remains true, I do see a lot of value in numerically able \nand intellectually curious people using Data Visualisation tools to \nquickly make connections which had not been made before and to tease out\n patterns from large data sets. In addition there can be great value in \nusing Data Visualisation to present more quotidian information in a more\n easily digestible manner. However I also think that some of the \nlearnings from science which I have presented in this article suggest \nthat \u2013 as with all powerful tools \u2013 appropriate discretion on the part \nof the people generating Data Visualisation exhibits and on the part of \nthe people consuming such content would be prudent. In particular the \nbusiness equivalents of establishing controls, applying suitable rigour \nto data generation / combination and including information about \nuncertainty on exhibits where appropriate are all things which can help \nmake Data Visualisation more honest and thus \u2013 at least in my opinion \u2013 \nmore valuable. \u00a0   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \u00a0 [1]\u00a0  Watson, J.D., Crick, F.H.C.

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Florence Nightingale</a>, who was \u2013 according to The Font \u2013 <em>\u201ca celebrated English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing\u201d</em>.\n It is gratifying to see her less high-profile role as a number-cruncher\n acknowledged up-front and central; particularly as she died in 1910, \neight years before women in the UK were first allowed to vote and \neighteen before universal suffrage. This diagram is one of two which are\n generally cited in any article on Data Visualisation. The other is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Minard\u2019s</a> exhibit detailing the advance on, and retreat from, Moscow of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Arm%C3%A9e\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Grande Arm\u00e9e</a> in 1812 (Data Visualisation had a military genesis in common with \u2013 \namongst many other things \u2013 the internet). I\u2019ll leave the reader to look\n at this second famous diagram if they want to; it\u2019s just a click away.</p><div class=\"quads-location quads-ad1\" id=\"quads-ad1\" style=\"float:none;margin:5px;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5846770866792663\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-slot=\"4409634097\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script> </div><p>While there are more elements of numeric information in Minard\u2019s work (what we would now call measures), there is a differentiating point to be made about Nightingale\u2019s diagram. This is that it was specifically produced to aid members of the British parliament in their understanding of conditions during <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Crimean War</a> (1853-56); particularly given that such non-specialists had struggled to understand traditional (and technical) statistical reports. Again, rather remarkably, we have here a scenario where the great and the good were listening to the opinions of someone who was barred from voting on the basis of lacking a Y chromosome. Perhaps more pertinently to this blog, this scenario relates to one of the objectives of modern-day Data Visualisation in business; namely explaining complex issues, which don\u2019t leap off of a page of figures, to busy decision makers, some of whom may not be experts in the specific subject area (another is of course allowing the expert to discern less than obvious patterns in large or complex sets of data). Fortunately most business decision makers don\u2019t have to grapple with the progression in number of <em>\u201cdeaths from Preventible or Mitigable Zymotic diseases\u201d</em> versus <em>\u201ddeaths from wounds\u201d</em> over time, but the point remains.</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Data Visualisation in one branch of Science</strong></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img alt=\"von Laue, Bragg Senior &amp; Junior, Crowfoot Hodgkin, Kendrew, Perutz, Crick, Franklin, Watson &amp; Wilkins\" class=\"wp-image-7317\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pioneers.png?resize=600%2C293&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure><p>Coming much more up to date, I wanted to consider a modern example of\n Data Visualisation. As with Nightingale\u2019s work, this is not \nbusiness-focused, but contains some elements which should be pertinent \nto the professional considering the creation of diagrams in a business \ncontext. The specific area I will now consider is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Structural Biology</a>.\n For the incognoscenti (no advert for IBM intended!), this area of \nscience is focussed on determining the three-dimensional shape of \nbiologically relevant macro-molecules, most frequently proteins or \nprotein complexes. The history of Structural Biology is intertwined with\n the development of X-ray crystallography by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_von_Laue\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Max von Laue</a> and father and son team <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Bragg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">William Henry</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawrence_Bragg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">William Lawrence</a> Bragg; its subsequent application to organic molecules by a host of pioneers including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hodgkin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrew\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John Kendrew</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Perutz\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Max Perutz</a>; and \u2013 of greatest resonance to the general population \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Francis Crick</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rosalind Franklin</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">James Watson</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkins\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Maurice Wilkins</a>\u2019s joint determination of the structure of DNA in 1953.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www-project.slac.stanford.edu/wis/images/photo_51.jpg\"><img alt=\"photo-51\" class=\"wp-image-7306\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo-51.jpg?resize=400%2C406&amp;ssl=1\"/></a></figure><p><em>X-ray diffraction image of the double helix \nstructure of the DNA molecule, taken 1952 by Raymond Gosling, commonly \nreferred to as \u201cPhoto 51\u201d, during work by Rosalind Franklin on the \nstructure of DNA</em></p><p>While the masses of data gathered in modern X-ray crystallography \nneeds computer software to extrapolate them to physical structures, \nthings were more accessible in 1953.

In this\n case, the production of Photo 51 led directly to the creation of the \neven more iconic image below (which was drawn by Francis Crick\u2019s wife \nOdile and appeared in his and Watson\u2019s seminal Nature paper<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#1\">[1]</a></sup>):</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img alt=\"Odile and Francis Crick - structure of DNA\" class=\"wp-image-7422\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/odile-and-francis-crick-structure-of-dna.png?resize=170%2C600&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure><p><em>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/13997975/Watson_171737a0.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nature (1953)</a><br/> Posted on this site under the non-commercial clause of the right-holder\u2019s licence</em></p><p>It is probably fair to say that the visualisation of data which is displayed above has had something of an impact on humankind in the fifty years since it was first drawn.</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Modern Structural Biology</strong></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img alt=\"The X-ray Free Electron Laser at Stanford\" class=\"wp-image-7320\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slac-linac-coherent-light-source.jpg?resize=600%2C410&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure><p>Today, X-ray crystallography is one of many tools available to the \nstructural biologist with other approaches including Nuclear Magnetic \nResonance Spectroscopy, Electron Microscopy and a range of biophysical \ntechniques which I will not detain the reader by listing. The cutting \nedge is probably represented by the X-ray Free Electron Laser, a device \noriginally created by repurposing the linear accelerators of the \nprevious generation\u2019s particle physicists. In general Structural Biology\n has historically sat at an intersection of Physics and Biology.</p><p>However, before trips to synchrotrons can be planned, the Structural Biologist often faces the prospect of stabilising their protein of interest, ensuring that they can generate sufficient quantities of it, successfully isolating the protein and finally generating crystals of appropriate quality. This process often consumes years, in some cases decades. As with most forms of human endeavour, there are few short-cuts and the outcome is at least loosely correlated to the amount of time and effort applied (though sadly with no guarantee that hard work will always be rewarded).</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><br/><strong>From the general to the specific</strong></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00222836\"><img alt=\"The Journal of Molecular Biology (October 2014)\" class=\"wp-image-7330\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jmb-october-2014-h400.png?resize=298%2C400&amp;ssl=1\"/></a></figure><p>At this point I should declare a personal interest, the example of \nData Visualisation which I am going to consider is taken from a paper \nrecently accepted by <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00222836\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Journal of Molecular Biology</a> (JMB) and of which my wife is the first author<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#2\">[2]</a></sup>. Before looking at this exhibit, it\u2019s worth a brief detour to provide some context.</p><p>In recent decades, the exponential growth in the breadth and depth of\n scientific knowledge (plus of course the velocity with which this can \nbe disseminated), coupled with the increase in the range and complexity \nof techniques and equipment employed, has led to the emergence of \nspecialists. In turn this means that, in a manner analogous to the early\n production lines, science has become a very collaborative activity; \nexpert in stage one hands over the fruits of their labour to expert in \nstage two and so on. For this reason the typical scientific paper (and \ncertainly those in Structural Biology) will have several authors, often \nspread across multiple laboratory groups and frequently in different \ncountries. By way of example the previous paper my wife worked on had 16\n authors (including a Nobel Laureate<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#3\">[3]</a></sup>). In this context, the fact the paper I will now reference was authored by just my wife and her group leader is noteworthy.</p><p>The reader may at this point be relieved to learn that I am not going\n to endeavour to explain the subject matter of my wife\u2019s paper, nor the \ngeneral area of biology to which it pertains (the interested are \nrecommended to Google \u201c<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=membrane+proteins&amp;oq=membrane+proteins\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">membrane proteins</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=G+Protein+Coupled+Receptors&amp;oq=G+Protein+Coupled+Receptors\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">G Protein Coupled Receptors</a>\u201d as a starting point). Instead let\u2019s take a look at one of the exhibits.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jmb-exhibit-h1000.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Click to view a larger version in a new tab\" class=\"wp-image-7340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jmb-exhibit-w400.png?resize=400%2C530&amp;ssl=1\"/></a></figure><p><em>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283614005452\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Journal of Molecular Biology (2014)</a><br/> Posted on this site under a Creative Commons <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">licence</a></em></p><p>The above diagram (in common with Nightingale\u2019s much earlier one) \nattempts to show a connection between sets of data, rather than just the\n data itself. I\u2019ll elide the scientific specifics here and focus on more\n general issues.</p><p>First the grey upper section with the darker blots on it \u2013 which is labelled <strong>(a)</strong> \u2013 is an image of a biological assay called a Western Blot (for the interested, details can be viewed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>);\n each vertical column (labelled at the top of the diagram) represents a \nsub-experiment on protein drawn from a specific sample of cells. The \nvertical position of a blot indicates the size of the molecules found \nwithin it (in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">kilodaltons</a>);\n the intensity of a given blot indicates how much of the substance is \npresent. Aside from the headings and labels, the upper part of the \nfigure is a photographic image and so essentially analogue data<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#4\">[4]</a></sup>. So, in summary, this upper section represents the findings from one set of experiments.</p><p>At the bottom \u2013 and labelled <strong>(b)</strong> \u2013 appears an \nartefact familiar to anyone in business, a bar-graph. This presents \nresults from a parallel experiment on samples of protein from the same \ncells (for the interested, this set of data relates to degree to which \nproteins in the samples bind to a specific radiolabelled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ligand</a>).\n The second set of data is taken from what I might refer to as a \n\u201ccounting machine\u201d and is thus essentially digital. To be 100% clear, \nthe bar chart is not a representation of the data in the upper part of \nthe diagram, it pertains to results from a second experiment on the same\n samples. As indicated by the labelling, for a given sample, the column \nin the bar chart <strong>(b)</strong> is aligned with the column in the Western Blot above <strong>(a)</strong>, connecting the two different sets of results.</p><div style=\"clear:both; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:1em;\"><a class=\"IRPP_ruby\" href=\"https://www.smartdatacollective.com/predictive-analytics-addresses-pressing-web-hosting-challenges-in-2019/\" target=\"_self\"><div class=\"postImageUrl\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.smartdatacollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/predictive-analytics-300x200.jpg);\"></div><div class=\"centered-text-area\"><div class=\"centered-text\"><div class=\"IRPP_ruby-content\"><div class=\"ctaText\" style=\"float:left;\">READ</div><div style=\"clear:both\"></div><div class=\"postTitle\" style=\"float:left;\">Predictive Analytics Addresses Pressing Web Hosting Challenges in 2019</div></div></div><div class=\"ctaButton\"></div></div></a></div><p>Taken together the upper and lower sections<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#5\">[5]</a></sup> establish a relationship between the two sets of data. Again I\u2019ll skip on the specifics, but the general point is that while the Western Blot <strong>(a)</strong> and the binding assay <strong>(b)</strong> tell us the same story, the Western Blot is a much more straightforward and speedy procedure. The relationship that the paper establishes means that just the Western Blot can be used to perform a simple new assay which will save significant time and effort for people engaged in the determination of the structures of membrane proteins; a valuable new insight. Clearly the relationships that have been inferred could equally have been presented in a tabular form instead and be just as relevant. It is however testament to the more atavistic side of humans that \u2013 in common with many relationships between data \u2013 a picture says it more surely and (to mix a metaphor) more viscerally. This is the essence of Data Visualisation.</p><p><strong>What learnings can Scientific Data Visualisation provide to Business?</strong></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img alt=\"Scientific presentation (c/o Nature, but looks a lot like PhD Comics IMO)\" class=\"wp-image-7376\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/peterjamesthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/scientific-presentation.jpg?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1\"/></figure><p>Using the JMB exhibit above, I wanted to now make some more general observations and consider a few questions which arise out of comparing scientific and business approaches to Data Visualisation. I think that many of these points are pertinent to analysis in general.</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Normalisation</strong></p><p>Broadly, normalisation<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#6\">[6]</a></sup> consists of defining results in relation to some established yardstick \n(or set of yardsticks); displaying relative, as opposed to absolute, \nnumbers. In the JMB exhibit above, the amount of protein solubilised in \nvarious detergents is shown with reference to the un-solubilised amount \nfound in native membranes; these reference figures appear as 100% \ncolumns to the right and left extremes of the diagram.</p><p>The most common usage of normalisation in business is growth \npercentages. Here the fact that London business has grown by 5% can be \ncompared to Copenhagen having grown by 10% despite total London business\n being 20-times the volume of Copenhagen\u2019s. A related business example, \ndepending on implementation details, could be comparing foreign currency\n amounts at a fixed exchange rate to remove the impact of currency \nfluctuation.</p><p>Normalised figures are very typical in science, but, aside from the growth example mentioned above, considerably less prevalent in business. In both avenues of human endeavour, the approach should be used with caution; something that increases 200% from a very small starting point may not be relevant, be that the result of an experiment or weekly sales figures. Bearing this in mind, normalisation is often essential when looking to present data of different orders on the same graph<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#7\">[7]</a></sup>; the alternative often being that smaller data is swamped by larger, not always what is desirable.</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll use an anecdote to illustrate this area from a business \nperspective. Imagine an organisation which (as you would expect) tracks \nthe volume of sales of a product or service it provides via a number of \noutlets. Imagine further that it launches some sort of promotion, \nperhaps valid only for a week, and notices an uptick in these sales. It \nis extremely tempting to state that the promotion has resulted in \nincreased sales<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#8\">[8]</a></sup>.</p><p>However this cannot always be stated with certainty. Sales may have \nincreased for some totally unrelated reason such as (depending on what \nis being sold) good or bad weather, a competitor increasing prices or \nclosing one or more of their comparable outlets and so on. Equally \nperniciously, the promotion maybe have simply moved sales in time \u2013 \npeople may have been going to buy the organisation\u2019s product or service \nin the weeks following a promotion, but have brought the expenditure \nforward to take advantage of it. If this is indeed the case, an uptick \nin sales may well be due to the impact of a promotion, but will be \noffset by a subsequent decrease.</p><p>In science, it is this type of problem that the concept of control \ntests is designed to combat. As well as testing a result in the <em>presence </em>of substance or condition X, a well-designed scientific experiment will also be carried out in the <em>absence </em>of\n substance or condition X, the latter being the control. In the JMB \nexhibit above, the controls appear in the columns with white labels.</p><p>There are ways to make the business \u201cexperiment\u201d I refer to above \nmore scientific of course. In retail business, the current focus on \nloyalty cards can help, assuming that these can be associated with the \nrelevant transactions. If the business is on-line then historical \nrecords of purchasing behaviour can be similarly referenced. In the \nabove example, the organisation could decide to offer the promotion at \nonly a subset of the its outlets, allowing a comparison to those where \nno promotion applied. This approach may improve rigour somewhat, but of \ncourse it does not cater for purchases transferred from a non-promotion \noutlet to a promotion one (unless a whole raft of assumptions are made).\n There are entire industries devoted to helping businesses deal with \nthese rather messy scenarios, but it is probably fair to say that it is \nnormally easier to devise and carry out control tests in science.</p><p>The general take away here is that a graph which shows some change in a business output (say sales or profit) correlated to some change in a business input (e.g. a promotion, a new product launch, or a price cut) would carry a lot more weight if it also provided some measure of what would have happened without the change in input (not that this is always easy to measure).</p><p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Rigour and Scrutiny</p><p>I mention in the footnotes that the JMB paper in question includes \nversions of the exhibit presented above for four other membrane \nproteins, this being in order to firmly establish a connection. Looking \nat just the figure I have included here, each element of the data \npresented in the lower bar-graph area is based on duplicated or \ntriplicated tests, with average results (and error bars \u2013 see the next \nsection) being shown. When you consider that upwards of three months\u2019 \npreparatory work could have gone into any of these elements and that a \nmistake at any stage during this time would have rendered the work \nuseless, some impression of the level of rigour involved emerges. The \nresult of this assiduous work is that the authors can be confident that \nthe exhibits they have developed are accurate and will stand up to \nexternal scrutiny. Of course such external scrutiny is a key part of the\n scientific process and the manuscript of the paper was reviewed \nextensively by independent experts before being accepted for \npublication.</p><p>In the business world, such external scrutiny tends to apply most \nfrequently to publicly published figures (such as audited Financial \nAccounts); of course external financial analysts also will look to dig \ninto figures. There may be some internal scrutiny around both the \nadditional numbers used to run the business and the graphical \nrepresentations of these (and indeed some companies take this area very \nseriously), but not every internal KPI is vetted the way that the report\n and accounts are. Particularly in the area of Data Visualisation, there\n is a tension here. Graphical exhibits can have a lot of impact if they \nrelate to the current situation or present trends; contrawise if they \nare substantially out-of-date, people may question their relevance. \nThere is sometimes the expectation that a dashboard is just like its \naeronautical counterpart, showing real-time information about what is \ngoing on now<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#9\">[9]</a></sup>.\n However a lot of the value of Data Visualisation is not about the here \nand now so much as trends and explanations of the factors behind the \nhere and now. A well-thought out graph can tell a very powerful story, \nmore powerful for most people than a table of figures. However a \nstriking graph based on poor quality data, data which has been combined \nin the wrong way, or even \u2013 as sometimes happens \u2013 the wrong datasets \nentirely, can tell a very misleading story and lead to the wrong \ndecisions being taken.</p><p>I am not for a moment suggesting here that every exhibit produced using Data Visualisation tools must be subject to months of scrutiny. As referenced above, in the hands of an expert such tools have the value of sometimes quickly uncovering hidden themes or factors. However, I would argue that \u2013 as in science \u2013 if the analyst involved finds something truly striking, an association which he or she feels will really resonate with senior business people, then double- or even triple-checking the data would be advisable. Asking a colleague to run their eye over the findings and to then probe for any obvious mistakes or weaknesses sounds like an appropriate next step. Internal Data Visualisations are never going to be subject to peer-review, however their value in taking sound business decisions will be increased substantially if their production reflects at least some of the rigour and scrutiny which are staples of the scientific method.</p><div style=\"clear:both; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:1em;\"><a class=\"IRPP_ruby\" href=\"https://www.smartdatacollective.com/is-predictive-analytics-changing-future-of-mobile-phone-monitoring/\" target=\"_self\"><div class=\"postImageUrl\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.smartdatacollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mobile-tracking-data-300x200.jpg);\"></div><div class=\"centered-text-area\"><div class=\"centered-text\"><div class=\"IRPP_ruby-content\"><div class=\"ctaText\" style=\"float:left;\">READ</div><div style=\"clear:both\"></div><div class=\"postTitle\" style=\"float:left;\">Is Predictive Analytics Changing The Future Of Mobile Phone Monitoring?</div></div></div><div class=\"ctaButton\"></div></div></a></div><p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Dealing with Uncertainty</p><p>In the previous section I referred to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_bar\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">error bars</a> appearing on the JMB figure above. Error bars are acknowledgements that\n what is being represented is variable and they indicate the extent of \nsuch variability. When dealing with a physical system (be that \nmechanical or \u2013 as in the case above \u2013 biological), behaviour is subject\n to many factors, not all of which can be eliminated or adjusted for and\n not all of which are predictable. This means that repeating an \nexperiment under ostensibly identical conditions can lead to different \nresults<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#10\">[10]</a></sup>.\n If the experiment is well-designed and if the experimenter is diligent,\n then such variability is minimised, but never eliminated. Error bars \nare a recognition of this fundamental aspect of the universe as we \nunderstand it.</p><p>While de rigueur in science, error bars seldom make an appearance in \nbusiness, even \u2013 in my experience \u2013 in estimates of business measures \nwhich emerge from statistical analyses<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#11\">[11]</a></sup>.\n Even outside the realm of statistically generated figures, more \nbusiness measures are subject to uncertainty than might initially be \nthought. An example here might be a comparison (perhaps as part of the \nexternally scrutinised report and accounts) of the current quarter\u2019s \nsales to the previous one (or the same one last year). In companies \nwhere sales may be tied to \u2013 for example \u2013 the number of outlets, care \nis paid to making these figures like-for-like. This might include only \nshowing numbers for outlets which were in operation in the prior period \nand remain in operation now (i.e. excluding sales from both closed \noutlets or newly opened ones). However, outside the area of high-volume \nlow-value sales where the Law of Large Numbers<sup><a href=\"https://peterjamesthomas.com/2014/11/06/data-visualisation-a-scientific-treatment/#12\">[12]</a></sup> rules, other factors could substantially skew a given quarter\u2019s results\n for many organisations. Something as simple as a key customer delaying a\n purchase (so that it fell in Q3 this year instead of Q2 last) could \nhave a large impact on quarterly comparisons. Again companies will \nsometimes look to include adjustments to cater for such timing or \nrelated issues, but this cannot be a precise process.</p><p>The main point I am making here is that many aspects of the \ninformation produced in companies is uncertain. The cash transactions in\n a quarter are of course the cash transactions in a quarter, but the \nabove scenario suggests that they may not always 100% reflect actual \nbusiness conditions (and you cannot adjust for everything). Equally \nwhere you get in to figures that would be part of most companies\u2019 \nfinancial results, outstanding receivables and allowance for bad debts, \nthe spectre of uncertainty arises again without a statistical model in \nsight. In many industries, regulators are pushing for companies to \ninclude more forward-looking estimates of future assets and liabilities \nin their Financials. While this may be a sensible reaction to recent \neconomic crises, the approach inevitably leads to more figures being \nproduced from models. Even when these models are subject to external \nreview, as is the case with most regulatory-focussed ones, they are \nstill models and there will be uncertainty around the numbers that they \ngenerate. While companies will often provide a range of estimates for \nthings like guidance on future earnings per share, providing a range of \nestimates for historical financial exhibits is not really a mainstream \nactivity.</p><p>Which perhaps gets me back to the subject of error bars on graphs. In\n general I think that their presence in Data Visualisations can only add\n value, not subtract it. In my article entitled <a href=\"http://peterjamesthomas.com/2010/03/28/limitations-of-bi/\">Limitations of Business Intelligence</a> I include the following passage which contains an exhibit showing how \nthe Bank of England approaches communicating the uncertainty inevitably \nassociated with its inflation estimates:</p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Business Intelligence is not a crystal ball, Predictive \nAnalytics is not a crystal ball either. They are extremely useful tools \n[\u2026] but they are not universal panaceas.</p><p> [\u2026] Statistical models will never give you precise answers to what will \nhappen in the future \u2013 a range of outcomes, together with probabilities \nassociated with each is the best you can hope for (see above). \nPredictive Analytics will not make you prescient, instead it can provide\n you with useful guidance, so long as you remember it is a prediction, \nnot fact.</p></blockquote><p>While I can\u2019t see them figuring in formal financial statements any time soon, perhaps there is a case for more business Data Visualisations to include error bars.</p><p style=\"font-size:25px\"><strong>In Summary</strong></p><p>So, as is often the case, I have embarked on a journey. I started \nwith an early example of Data Visualisation, diverted in to a particular\n branch of science with which I have some familiarity and hopefully \nreturned, again as is often the case, to make some points which I think \nare pertinent to both the Business Intelligence practitioner and the \nconsumers (and indeed commissioners) of Data Visualisations. Back in <a href=\"http://peterjamesthomas.com/2009/02/25/all-that-glisters-is-not-gold-some-thoughts-on-dashboards/\">\u201cAll that glisters is not gold\u201d \u2013 some thoughts on dashboards</a> I made some more general comments about the best Data Visualisations \nhaving strong informational foundations underpinning them. While this \nobservation remains true, I do see a lot of value in numerically able \nand intellectually curious people using Data Visualisation tools to \nquickly make connections which had not been made before and to tease out\n patterns from large data sets. In addition there can be great value in \nusing Data Visualisation to present more quotidian information in a more\n easily digestible manner. However I also think that some of the \nlearnings from science which I have presented in this article suggest \nthat \u2013 as with all powerful tools \u2013 appropriate discretion on the part \nof the people generating Data Visualisation exhibits and on the part of \nthe people consuming such content would be prudent. In particular the \nbusiness equivalents of establishing controls, applying suitable rigour \nto data generation / combination and including information about \nuncertainty on exhibits where appropriate are all things which can help \nmake Data Visualisation more honest and thus \u2013 at least in my opinion \u2013 \nmore valuable.<br/> \u00a0</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/><p><em></em></p><p><em></em><div class=\"quads-location quads-ad2\" id=\"quads-ad2\" style=\"float:none;margin:5px 0 5px 0;text-align:center;\"> <script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-5846770866792663\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-slot=\"4409634097\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script> </div></p><table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td><sup>\u00a0<br/> [1]</sup></td><td>\u00a0<br/> <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/13997975/Watson_171737a0.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Watson, J.D., Crick, F.H.C.

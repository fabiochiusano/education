I think I\u2019m out of practice. I take one week off\u00a0\u2026 You know when you go, when you\u2019ve been working out and then you take a couple weeks off-Jay Kang: No. Never had that. It seemed like you had become a YouTube blogger or something like that.Aaron Lammer: Well, I will say I was hoping that you would come by for this taping \u2019cause I did buy a green screen.Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. You have been talking about this green screen. How big is a green screen?Aaron Lammer: This is a pretty big green screen.Jay Kang: I know they roll up, but\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: This one rolls up. I\u2019d say it\u2019s eight feet across.Jay Kang: Oh, wow. Wow. We could take Coin Talk to the next level, then we could\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m going to confess something here. It\u2019s not a flattering confession, but I\u2019ll tell you about why I ordered this green screen in the first place. After we taped our episode where we briefly touched on Quadriga\u00a0\u2026 Do you remember the Quadriga, the founder died lost $190 million?Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Okay. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole of reading everything on Reddit about this, made an extremely elaborate document with a timeline. Somehow I was like, \u201cMaybe I should talk about this on Coin Talk.\u201d But, I was like, \u201cBut, the images are important and these documents that I\u2019ve compiled.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll make a video where I explain all my thoughts about it.\u201d I bought the green screen for that. Then, when it came, I had a flash of clarity and I imagined myself on YouTube, spinning conspiracy theories and I was like, \u201cOh, man. This is the first step down a super dark corridor of your life.\u201dJay Kang: You\u2019ve created basically audio/visual Reddit, which I actually think might be a good idea, but also probably is 90% of YouTube at this point.Aaron Lammer: Well, I just thought it was funny how so much news is breaking about YouTube\u2019s role in spreading conspiracy theory. I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve got a conspiracy theory. I know just where to take it. All I need is this eight-foot-long green screen.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, then I\u2019ll record in my actual basement surrounded by antiquated audio equipment. I think that your channel would be pretty good though, Aaron.Aaron Lammer: Okay. Well, let\u2019s let the people weigh in. If you\u2019re listening and you\u2019d like an AV episode of Coin Talk and would you like to see what Jay and actually look like, Jay who has never taken two weeks off of working out ever, what we actually look like-Jay Kang: No, I just never actually worked out enough where that two weeks would be cheating.Aaron Lammer: Oh, okay. Okay. You were taking the under not the over. I gotcha. I gotcha.Jay Kang: I wasn\u2019t like, \u201cAaron, what are you talking about?\u201d I\u2019m almost the fattest I\u2019ve ever been.Aaron Lammer: Wait, speaking of the over and under, before we get into it, I feel like occasionally I want a little sidebar gambler, Jay, like non-crypto gambler Jay. I feel like this is the first year I was hearing a lot of action on the Oscars.Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s not a mistake by the way. I think it was because the New Jersey sportsbooks opened up and that a lot of people could bet on the Oscars on an app for the first time because you could do it on a FanDuel app or whatever New Jersey betting app. I think that that plus the fact that there\u2019s a lot more places where you can get gambling content because everybody is prepping for the day in which anybody in the United States can bet on sports. I think that\u2019s why there is so much talk about that.Aaron Lammer: Did you hear in last week\u2019s episode when I talked to Ledger about Hero and how much FOMO did you experience while listening to it?Jay Kang: It was too complicated for me.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, yeah, I was like-Jay Kang: It\u2019s just like that\u2019s way too complicated. I think I would rather just play video games.Aaron Lammer: While I was talking to him about it, I was like, \u201cJay is just laying a bed on division two for beer league at this point.\u201d Too much work for him. It is interesting how as this stuff becomes more legal, all these things like how the movement of the lines, it becomes a lot more real. Previously, you\u2019d hear about odds on something like the Oscars and it was like, \u201cOh, yeah. This is 40:1.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cIs it really or is that just what it was listed as in some sort of blog post?\u201dJay Kang: You mean is the actual bet the thing that people are reporting when they are talking about it? Is that what you\u2019re asking?Aaron Lammer: As I understand it, this year in the Oscar betting, a bunch of these lines moved a bunch after they opened, particularly, and I\u2019m interested in your take on this as an expert in these fields, I think it was the best director race. What\u2019s the guy who directed \u2018Dogtooth\u2019? He\u2019s Greek, I believe.Jay Kang: Yorgos something.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Yorgos.Jay Kang: Yeah, he does a lot of stuff. He did \u2018The Favorite\u2019 this time.Aaron Lammer: \u2018The Favorite\u2019, yeah. He started off as super long odds, and then-Jay Kang: Yeah, I think he was 40:1 or something, maybe 250:1, something crazy like that.Aaron Lammer: Looking at it, me and you as filmgoers, he\u2019s a pretty long shot I\u2019d say there. You\u2019ve got several people who seem like they\u2019re much, much better picks, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, I think Spike Lee was in the mix. At some point, the odds started getting much and much better for him to win. Up to the point where I think it peaked at 15:1 or 10:1 and then they just froze betting on it.Jay Kang: I think it got to 5:2 almost.Aaron Lammer: Five, okay.Jay Kang: It was insane. It was the biggest swing. It would be like if the Warriors were playing Bowdoin College or something like that where I went to school, and so the odds are like 7000:1. Then, Bowdoin College announces that Kevin Durant and Giannis and all\u00a0\u2026 Basically, the Monstars from \u2018Space Jam\u2019 are all going to be paying in the game. That was the type of odds swing it was. It\u2019s not something that can be explained away by any natural betting pattern. It has to be that a bunch of money that thinks it\u2019s sharp money comes in and completely influences a line. Usually, when that happens, a line only moves a couple spots.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I think I heard your old boss, Bill Simmons, once say that Brady playing or not playing would be like the biggest swing possible in a football game and even that would only be seven points.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is basically if everyone on the Patriots ended up being arrested in some sort of sex slavery type of thing.Aaron Lammer: Murdered their close friend in a parking lot kind of situation.Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.Aaron Lammer: Purely hypothetical.Jay Kang: And, have all been arrested and couldn\u2019t play in the game. Basically, they were trotting out the cheerleaders and the equipment staff to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers. That\u2019s what this type of swing of odds would be.Aaron Lammer: Okay, when you heard about this swing, what did you make of it? What I initially thought was, \u201cHoly shit! He\u2019s going to win. Someone knows and that\u2019s a pretty crazy upset. There\u2019s going to be a major scandal and it\u2019s going to end betting on the Academy Awards because it\u2019s too soft. It\u2019s too easy to know.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s was I thought, but I guess I had a few thoughts. The first was that even if the lines were affected not by the number of bets really but by the amount of money that is bet on it. If you have two other bets for $20 and then you have one bet for $50,000, the $50,000 bet is going to move the line.Aaron Lammer: Wait a minute. May I pause you briefly and ask a question? \u2019Cause I think this pertains actually to crypto. When you say that it\u2019s volume not the number of people that moves the line, is there data broken out? When all that action that was on Argo-Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It tells you. Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Do we know how many people that was spread around? Could that potentially be one mega whale coming in?Jay Kang: No, that\u2019s the problem, right? Which is that on the book that I use, allegedly, I guess I should say\u00a0\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s legal, but let\u2019s say the book that I sometimes use for an online sportsbook, the most money I could put into one bet was $430. That was for best picture. It wasn\u2019t for best director, which I imagine was lower. There\u2019s no way that any of these companies are going to let you bet $10,000 on these, on best director.Jay Kang: I just think well, there\u2019s no way this is a mega whale because the bet caps are so low. It has to be a flood of hundreds of people betting this thing in a short period of time, which is why then it\u2019s taken off the books because essentially these New Jersey\u00a0\u2026 I think it was the FanDuel app that ended up taking it off the books first. They must have just gotten a flood of action on him and they didn\u2019t know what was up so they took him off the books.Aaron Lammer: If I\u2019m in Macau, I\u2019m a high-rolling poker player turned Bitcoin whale and I want to put down a million bucks on \u2018Green Book\u2019, I can\u2019t make that bet?Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think so. I think you could make a lot of $10,000 bets, but probably not enough to add up to a million dollars. Actually, that would be insane. You would have to find 100 bet takers to get to a million. Yeah, I can\u2019t see that that was possible. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. That\u2019s way out of my price range in general.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s a private broker on the private market who will try to pair you with some super secret Triad book, but-Jay Kang: Sure, but that wouldn\u2019t move the line at the New Jersey sportsbook.Aaron Lammer: Not only would that move the line, it\u2019s crazy for an event that is as big as the Oscars. This is one of the world\u2019s biggest nights behind, let\u2019s say, the Super Bowl and a few sporting events. Considering how far into gambling legalization we are, it\u2019s crazy how little liquidity there is in a lot of these markets. Much like there\u2019s zero liquidity in Augur right now.Jay Kang: I\u2019m glad that you brought that full circle and not just talking about gambling.Aaron Lammer: Well wait, we didn\u2019t finish the story. Cuar\u00f3n won and he was wrong. What do you think happened? Where was all that money coming from?Jay Kang: Well, the story came out. It was allegedly a guy at Penn State who\u2019s in a fraternity who said that his dad was in the Academy and that his dad had told him that Yorgos was going to win. He posted it somewhere where a bunch of people saw it and then all the money started coming in.Aaron Lammer: Basically, a Tron getting listed to Coinbase rumor kind of thing.Jay Kang: Yeah, but there was one other level where it was the\u00a0\u2026 Have you seen the frat aliens episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force?Aaron Lammer: I have. I have.Jay Kang: Where the guy keeps going, \u201cMy dad owns a dealership.\u201d It\u2019s like that, but it\u2019s like, \u201cMy dad is in the Academy and he\u2019s saying it\u2019s Yorgos.\u201d Then, suddenly, thousands and thousands of dollars are coming in on Yorgos. It\u2019s hilarious. I do think that it probably makes these sportsbooks uncomfortable, though. Because there are all sorts of pain points that would make this harder to do when there aren\u2019t tens of thousands of people on an app where they can just get to the bet really quickly like before. For example, if you actually have to go to the sportsbook to put down a bet, you\u2019re probably going to do that a lot less than just pull out your phone.Jay Kang: If you have to sign up for a semi-legal sports betting site, that\u2019s only a certain type of person who does that. In a world where every sucker has this app or every sucker is into sports has this app, then the possibilities for misinformation go up pretty high. I imagine at every sportsbook right now there\u2019s probably a lot of talk about how they can avoid this happening again.Aaron Lammer: Well, what it makes me think is that the age of the open sportsbook and the age of the Reddit rumor/hoax is going to be pretty wild. This is just one frat guy.Jay Kang: It\u2019s going to be amazing.Aaron Lammer: What is that website called? Total Frat Move. Remember that website?Jay Kang: That was a total frat move.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve manipulated the Oscar\u2019s market. Total frat move.Jay Kang: It\u2019s a really good troll, honestly. I find it all funny. I only put that one bet for the Oscars.Aaron Lammer: What did you bet?Jay Kang: I bet \u2018Green Book\u2019 best picture.Aaron Lammer: Well done.Jay Kang: Thank you, thank you.Aaron Lammer: You are, in the same way that in Augur we generally try to fade Libertarianism, you were fading woke internet takes?Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s exactly what my thought process was.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019d like to think that on the show if we can\u2019t share in the crypto moderate movement, we can at least share the babe-like, cheap blonde post sentiment wherever you can be it in the entertainment media or the crypto media.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think that the criticisms for the \u2018Green Book\u2019 are cheap or unwarranted.Aaron Lammer: Oh, no, no, but the idea that it won\u2019t wind because of this-Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s the thing that I don\u2019t get.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. When we fade Libertarianism it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t believe in Libertarianism.Jay Kang: Yeah, we don\u2019t also believe in Libertarianism.Aaron Lammer: But, wearing our betting hats, it\u2019s just a good bet. You\u2019re just getting value on it.Jay Kang: For Augur, remember we bet the price of Ethereum wouldn\u2019t be over $500 on December 31st, 2018 and that was just a fade of maximalism basically. It didn\u2019t feel like maximalism reflected anything. I think it\u2019s the same thing you can do for these Oscar things where the discussion around it, if you read the internet, is so one-way. In the end, you realize that what it is, it\u2019s like a couple thousand old people watching screeners or not watching screeners and voting for the Oscars. They either don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening on Twitter or they don\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s happening on Twitter. It seemed like they were just going to pick \u2018Green Book\u2019 because that\u2019s the exact type of movie that they always pick, so wouldn\u2019t they pick it?Aaron Lammer: Couldn\u2019t we make a similar argument about Bitcoin being mostly controlled by a few mega whales and-Jay Kang: I like these redirects you\u2019re doing today.Aaron Lammer: Keeping it on topic.Jay Kang: Let\u2019s go.Aaron Lammer: We think Bitcoin is defined by how many people want to go and put $100 in their Coinbase account, but when we really look at the distribution of coins, the people who own full percentage points worth of Bitcoin are probably influencing price a lot more than me and you.Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. For sure. That one guy who is one of the trustees of Mt. Gox, he was moving the market by himself.Aaron Lammer: That guy was awesome. I wish he would reappear in a different plot line.Jay Kang: He is just market selling. [crosstalk 00:16:45].Aaron Lammer: He was honestly just like, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I know you guys care, but I don\u2019t.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, yeah. You guys are really mad at me, but honestly, I just want this to be out of my hair and I\u2019m going to do the easiest way possible. I don\u2019t care how much money I lose in the process. That\u2019s actually an admirable thing. I don\u2019t know.Jay Kang: This actually is relevant with crypto. I think it\u2019s probably, at this point, a smart move where there\u2019s a consensus of really loud and well-followed and intense people on Twitter about anything whether it be crypto maximalism or politics and pop culture, you should just fade that. You should just auto-fade that if you\u2019re going to make any sort of bet on anything. You should just be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to take the opposite route.\u201dJay Kang: That goes to things like Amazon even. This idea that Amazon is in trouble because it didn\u2019t come to New York and AOC and some of the new Democrats are going to have them on the run. I\u2019m just like, \u201cLook, outside of whether or not that\u2019s a good or bad thing, I would tend to say that\u2019s probably a good thing-Aaron Lammer: You\u2019d probably be buying Facebook right now on the same grounds basically, right?Jay Kang: Yeah, I tried that.Aaron Lammer: [crosstalk 00:18:02] got wrecked.Jay Kang: I got a few months on [crosstalk 00:18:07] wrecked.Aaron Lammer: Jay, I feel like we\u2019re just trying to derive strategies to get wrecked into crypto and something else right now. What else could we bring our unique blend of failure and hubris to?Jay Kang: Exactly, and misanthropy. Like, \u201cOkay, if I hate everybody and everybody\u2019s wrong except me, what should I bet on?\u201dAaron Lammer: Well, look, you won with the \u2018Green Book\u2019 so you\u2019re on a hot streak of one. Let\u2019s keep it going. You want to run through a little news?Jay Kang: Yeah. Let\u2019s do it.Aaron Lammer: Okay, this is hot, breaking, won\u2019t be breaking anymore when this comes out, but we can still enjoy it in the moment, Ripple going to Coinbase. This is like NBA trade deadline we\u2019re in.Jay Kang: It\u2019s not Ripple, right? I believe you mean XRP is going to Coinbase.Aaron Lammer: Sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. Jay, I think we got off on the wrong foot. Can we start that again?Jay Kang: You of all people with our XRP hat.Aaron Lammer: XRP is going to Coinbase.Jay Kang: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised. Are you surprised?Aaron Lammer: I am surprised. Well, this reminds me of\u00a0\u2026 Today\u2019s going to be all me doing comparisons.Jay Kang: Sure.Aaron Lammer: It reminds me of the way now in the NBA someone will say something as if it\u2019s totally absolute and then it\u2019s a total lie. Like when Kyrie was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m planning to stay in Boston,\u201d and then two months later he was like, \u201cWe\u2019re considering all the other options.\u201d Coinbase literally wrote a document that in all but name said we will never add XRP.Jay Kang: Yep. No, they really did and now they added XRP.Aaron Lammer: Look, this show\u2019s only been on for a little over a year and we talked about it on the show it can\u2019t have been more than a year ago.Jay Kang: Yeah, and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the same thing as the NBA players just giving out misinformation to make their lives easier. I think that Coinbase just didn\u2019t know back then.Aaron Lammer: Don\u2019t you think Kyrie just changed his mind? That\u2019s what I think Brian Armstrong did.Jay Kang: Yeah. No, no, that\u2019s what I meant. I think they were talking about\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s two things. The first is that you have to give much more statements now than you ever had to and they\u2019re disseminated. Kyrie said that thing at a dinner for season ticket holders or something like that. There\u2019s no way that that would have been reported on at any other point.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Same thing with Coinbase and Ripple, all the attention on Coinbase I\u2019m sure they have said a lot of things that they now wish that they could take back. The nice thing about our current landscape in media and relative to truth is that you can just go the other way. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself. You\u2019re just like, \u201cLook, that was back then. This is now. Who cares?\u201dAaron Lammer: If we\u2019re going to take anything away from it, I think we\u2019re going to take that Coinbase is just going to keep doing whatever is best for Coinbase. I feel like our initial take on Coinbase circa episode one was probably right, which is it\u2019s always going to be better for Coinbase than that anything other than Bitcoin wins. Anything Coinbase can do to at least balance the seesaw of the entire bundle other than Bitcoin versus Bitcoin, they\u2019re going to do. They thought they would not have to dirty themselves with the Ripple sauce, but now-Jay Kang: Okay, I do have a question for you, which is that you, as the owner of an XRP hat, right?Aaron Lammer: Yes. I\u2019m taking it down and putting it on.Jay Kang: Because of the generous interview that you gave to a Ripple stand where you were like, \u201cLet\u2019s try and understand these people\u201dAaron Lammer: I\u2019m still beloved in the Ripple community.Jay Kang: You\u2019re like a celebrity in the Ripple community.Aaron Lammer: Beloved.Jay Kang: Yeah. I think you understand the Ripple stand better than I do, but the thing that I don\u2019t quite understand is why is it dirty for Coinbase to introduce this extremely well-known and extremely centralized, but still much, much-discussed cryptocurrency? Why is it bad?Aaron Lammer: I think you said it. It\u2019s extremely centralized.Jay Kang: But, we\u2019ve crossed that Rubicon already. Coinbase-Aaron Lammer: Did we cross that Rubicon and decide that Ripple was basically not a crypto?Jay Kang: But, Coinbase does offer other coins that are highly centralized, right? BAT and other things.Aaron Lammer: I agree.Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s not like Coinbase can be like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re pure.\u201d They\u2019ve muddied themselves with a lot of centralized coins. At this point, why not just add Ripple? That\u2019s my thought.Aaron Lammer: I think that\u2019s probably what the meeting where they decided to greenlight Ripple was. I wonder if they might have wanted to do Ripple before and had been waiting on some sort of a nod from the authorities that Ripple was not going to be trouble if they added it. Yeah, I think that if what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019re already a sellout, why not really sell out. Yeah, I think that\u2019s accurate.Aaron Lammer: My question is why they felt they had to get in this business? I guess you could say that they\u2019re just giving the customer what they want, that they\u2019re probably getting a gazillion emails that are like, \u201cI want to buy Ripple at Coinbase.\u201d Who are they to not sell it? On the other hand, in terms of the Bitcoin narrative to have a company that was at one point, I feel like, the most powerful company in Bitcoin so clearly just bagging on Bitcoin, it kind of sucks.Jay Kang: Well, I think this is an example of the gap in context between how much people on Twitter hate Ripple and how much the Twitter Ripple fans are psychotic, and the reality of their business, which is that if you ignore all that then what Coinbase still a large part of their business is through transaction fees on buys and sells, right?Aaron Lammer: Yep.Jay Kang: Why would they not try and offer every single cryptocurrency that is bought and sold a lot? I would say that Ripple is probably still bought and sold quite a bit. If they can tune out the screaming hoards on both sides, then for them, it\u2019s a pretty clear business decision. I don\u2019t know. Again, as we said, their purity is gone. It\u2019s been gone. I would say that the final blow to it was the way that they introduced Bitcoin Cash. That\u2019s when we started to think of them as a purely capitalistic\u00a0\u2026 Capitalistic is not the right word, but their much-Aaron Lammer: Opportunistic.Jay Kang: Yeah, they\u2019re much more opportunistic\u00a0\u2026 They were much less interested in the theory and philosophy of decentralization than we had thought. Why not just put on Ripple? I don\u2019t know. This doesn\u2019t make me mad at all. Coinbase, sponsor our show.Aaron Lammer: Wow, Jay. Jay\u2019s come full circle on Coinbase.Jay Kang: Toshi\u2019s great.Aaron Lammer: Here\u2019s my counter take on why I think it\u2019s a bad decision for Coinbase. I\u2019m not mad about it. I have not placed a lot of faith in Coinbase other than the fact that I use them as a business. Here\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a bad business decision, though. I feel like Coinbase and Ripple, the company, not the currency, are on some deep, deep level competitors. I know that sounds crazy, but remember when we didn\u2019t think of Apple and Google and Facebook as competitors. We\u2019re like, \u201cOh, they\u2019re all completely in their own lane.\u201d Then, once they get big enough, everything is competitive.Aaron Lammer: Ripple is a company. It\u2019s a startup. It\u2019s a for-profit startup that has a shit ton of money for not doing very much. I think that ultimately the ambitions of that company are going to run contrary to Coinbase\u2019s. I think they\u2019re both going to try to become IPOed, biggest crypto companies in the world, taking different paths. That\u2019s not really a risk you run with Bitcoin or even to a lesser extent, Ethereum in so far as Ethereum is designed more as a nonprofit foundation.Jay Kang: Yeah, but at that point-Aaron Lammer: I just think it\u2019s a little like when Apple allows Amazon Prime videos on Apple TV.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I was thinking about that as an example, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite the same way because what you\u2019re trying to do is you\u2019re trying to monopolize the on-ramp space if you\u2019re Coinbase, right? If Ripple, if they can establish enough with the Ripple community that the best way to buy and sell XRP is through Coinbase, then Ripple, as the company, has a harder time trying to dissuade people from using the easy on-ramp that they are used to. Does that make sense? You then have to deal with a paid in point where people now have to go to\u00a0\u2026Jay Kang: It\u2019s like Spotify with podcasts right now. They bought Gimlet for $230 million and the question that\u2019s out there is, okay, now if all of Gimlet\u2019s podcasts are on Spotify instead of the Apple podcast app, are people still going to listen to them or is it just like, \u201cIt\u2019s another click and I don\u2019t feel like doing that.\u201d Those are real questions I think that\u00a0\u2026 I think that Coinbase by getting all this information and all this on-ramp stuff for Ripple is probably in a good position there. I don\u2019t quite see what the problem would be there for them.Aaron Lammer: I like your Spotify metaphor because the way I read that acquisition is basically as I understand it, Spotify has a ton of paying customers. They\u2019ve signed up 10 million people. They\u2019re doing well in terms of converting people, but based on the cost basis of streaming music, they operate at a loss by streaming music because of the amount of money they have to pay out to artists for that streaming. I know artists feel like Spotify gives them pennies on the dollar of what they should get and I\u2019m sympathetic to that, but even so, Spotify is actually not a good growth business model for streaming music.Aaron Lammer: However, if they own a bunch of podcasts, which are a fixed one-time cost, and that\u2019s what people were doing on Spotify and they were converting new users who were basically just there to listen to those podcasts, it\u2019s a much better business to be in. That\u2019s more or less where I feel like Coinbase has ended up. They\u2019re just not satisfied with the Bitcoin business.Jay Kang: Yeah, and they\u2019re also future-proofing themselves in case Ripple does become the dominant company and-Aaron Lammer: I think it\u2019s a bad call.Jay Kang: What do you mean?Aaron Lammer: I just think that-Jay Kang: Wait, it doesn\u2019t really-Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 Ripple becomes as big as Bitcoin, there\u2019s going to be no role for Coinbase anyway. I feel like Coinbase is being a little na\u00efve letting these snakes rise up out of the grass.Jay Kang: I know, but Coinbase didn\u2019t pay anything for this. They didn\u2019t pay $230 million to buy Ripple or $6 billion or whatever Ripple would cost.Aaron Lammer: Let me play game theory with you.Jay Kang: Okay.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m coming to Coinbase, I have a million dollars cash from my personal wealth that I want to invest in crypto. All I know is I want it to be in crypto.Jay Kang: Don\u2019t do it!Aaron Lammer: Okay. First, don\u2019t do it. Nothing on this show is investment advice. That\u2019s a terrible idea. No, I demand to do it. I\u2019m a cranky man. I\u2019ve always had Libertarian sympathies. I want to get my money out of the banks and into crypto. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. Well, what do you want to buy?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I want to buy one of the ones that Coinbase has because obviously, that\u2019s all I know, the only method I had for buying it. Okay.\u201d I have pick of everything on Coinbase.Aaron Lammer: Now, I think the thing Coinbase would most like you to do is buy that Coinbase bundle that\u2019s just equally weighted all of the things they sell based on their market share. Remember that?Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: They still have yet. That\u2019s spreading out all of the risk and upside completely equally so you\u2019re keeping everyone from getting too big. But, if I demand to get a specific currency, would you rather that I have Bitcoin or Ripple if you\u2019re Coinbase?Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think I would care at all. I would just want the one that you moved around the most so I could get transaction fees off of you, right?Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s a pretty fair point. That\u2019s how banks look at it too. It\u2019s not Fidelity cares what stock I buy. They\u2019re just like, \u201cBuy stocks on Fidelity.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, we get our-Aaron Lammer: Keep your retirement account here.Jay Kang: We get our $5.99 or whatever per trade. Okay, you want to move on?Aaron Lammer: Yeah, let\u2019s move on. Did you hear about this thing about Gladius, this ICO which basically reported itself to the FTC?Jay Kang: No. No, they self-owned?Aaron Lammer: Yeah. There\u2019s not that much more to the story. Basically, the FTC was like, \u201cYes, you are in the wrong. If you return all the money to investors you won\u2019t face criminal charges or fines.\u201d So, they just returned all the money. This might be the new ICO model is to go right up to the lip and be like, \u201cDo we really want to face jail time?\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, but also maybe it\u2019s a business strategy where you snitch on yourself and therefore when you start your next project you can be like, \u201cListen, we\u2019re totally above board now. We\u2019re the ones that snitched on yourself.\u201d Plus, you get a bunch of free press for an obscure coin like Gladius, which I had no idea what it was and I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t either until this happened.Aaron Lammer: Still don\u2019t.Jay Kang: Now, we\u2019re discussing it.Aaron Lammer: Still don\u2019t. Didn\u2019t even get as far as looking up what the thing was.Jay Kang: If we were better at the podcast and researched it better, we could actually do that, but a more prepared host would at least now know what Gladius is. Maybe it\u2019s good.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t want to use up any more brain space for any ICOs that have already closed down, but I like your exit scam, snitching on yourself. A good way to do that would be to just build the company heavily before you snitch on yourself, like do a lot of consulting services, drain a lot of the money out, and then snitch on yourself, return the money to investors, but you don\u2019t return money that\u2019s already been spent.Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Self-snitching is generally a good idea, I think. Amy Klobuchar, the woman who\u2019s running for president from Minnesota. She has all those stories about how she was an abusive boss and would throw binders at people, I feel like she should have just self-snitched on all of that when the story started coming out. She should have just been, \u201cI did all of this and it\u2019s because I\u2019m tough and I\u2019m the person who can take on Donald Trump.\u201dJay Kang: Now, in general, I actually think that it probably is helping her that all these stories are coming out \u2019cause everybody\u2019s discussing her and also most people don\u2019t care if you abuse a 23-year-old aid.Aaron Lammer: Whoa, Jay. Whoa, whoa.Jay Kang: No, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t care. I do care, but I think that most people, especially older people, are just like, \u201cThat Millennial deserved it.\u201dAaron Lammer: Beat that intern\u2019s ass.Jay Kang: I\u2019m just saying, if she had self-snitched, I think she would have gotten in front of all of this. Then, any other news story, people would have been like, \u201cYeah, but she already admitted it, so who cares?\u201d Anyway, that was my politics take of the last week.Aaron Lammer: I was talking to a friend of mine who is an attorney, a criminal defense attorney, and saying something about that Tekashi69 case.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Tekashi69.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: It was like, really, I know people are making fun of him online for snitching, but that was totally the right decision.Jay Kang: Yes, except now he might end up dead.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, but he was like, \u201cIf you\u2019re facing life in jail anyway, you should just take whatever deal is offered you.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, I guess his recording career is going to be a little difficult now, but maybe like Gladius, you can rebrand and be somebody else. I do enjoy his music.Aaron Lammer: I do too. I\u2019m not going to go around trying to defend it or get into some sort of argument with someone about it, but in a purely aesthetic level, I think he\u2019s talented. I am sad that he will spend the rest of his life in witness protection or whatever.Jay Kang: His songs are good.Aaron Lammer: He\u2019s also a person who is a little too early for the ICO era. You know who has been saying positive things about Bitcoin in the week since we last spoke is Elon Musk.Jay Kang: Oh, the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi. That\u2019s my favorite-Aaron Lammer: Of course, he\u2019s praising.Jay Kang: That\u2019s my favorite Satoshi theory. I used to bother him on Twitter about it. I\u2019d be like, \u201cAre you Satoshi?\u201d every time he would tweet and he never responded. Yeah, I thought-Aaron Lammer: Wow, actually based on your theory, what he tweeted this week on February 21st fits your theory, which is he tweeted, \u201cHowever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel Prize in delayed gratification.\u201d You could read that as a self-boast.Jay Kang: Yeah, he might have Satoshi\u2019s wallet keys. I know that we\u2019ve discussed this several times on this show, but I do think that Elon Musk cracks the top 10 on betting odds for who Satoshi is.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think that and I will take that bet.Jay Kang: I still think the odds are very long, but his odds have to be better than Craig\u00a0\u2026 Maybe they\u2019re not better than Craig Wright, but they\u2019re better than some of the other people who are rumored as to be Satoshi.Aaron Lammer: Okay, let me ask you a question. There was also the whole thing with Jack Dorsey was in a big Twitter interview about Bitcoin. I think he tweeted out his tippin.me lightning wallet. Oh, hey, Jay, did you know that we have a tippin.me lightning wallet?Jay Kang: Did [inaudible 00:36:18] make us one?Aaron Lammer: No, I just made it for us today.Jay Kang: Nice. Nice.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s tippin.me/@cointalkshow. Send us a tip. If we get one tip, we\u2019ll talk about the tip on air. If you send us a tip, and I don\u2019t know if you can put a notes field or something on it, we will say something on the air. That\u2019s a promise.Aaron Lammer: What does it mean that the Elon Musks and Jack Dorseys in the world are talking about Bitcoin?Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. It probably means a little bit more than when Jamie Diamond and\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: Warren Buffet.Jay Kang: Warren Buffet. I almost said Wayne Buffet and then I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d Then I was like, \u201cWalter Buffet.\u201dAaron Lammer: Warren Buffet was talking about Bitcoin also this week. He was like, \u201cIt has no value, and it attracts charlatans.\u201dJay Kang: [inaudible 00:37:08]. Look, fair. It\u2019s a fair take.Aaron Lammer: A, true. B, totally period.Jay Kang: Do you remember when Warren Buffet was talking anyone Bitcoin earlier, maybe nine months ago or something like that?Aaron Lammer: When he called it rat poison squared or something?Jay Kang: His take was essentially, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know about all that, but we\u2019ve looked at it and it seems cool, but I don\u2019t know. The only way I would invest in it is it I could buy a put on it.\u201d This is when Bitcoin was $16,000 or something like that. I bet he did actually figure out a way to buy a put on it given that it\u2019s Warren Buffet, but I think about that quite a bit being like, \u201cI wish I had listened to him and just shorted Bitcoin or at least sold my Bitcoin at that point.\u201dAaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think any of these guys\u00a0\u2026 Musk said he had like 0.25 Bitcoin to his name. It doesn\u2019t seem like that many celebrities are mega whales.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think it really matters. Elon Mush talks about everything at this point. Does it matter that Azealia Banks\u2019 career had a revitalization because of her interactions with Elon Musk? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s relevant.Aaron Lammer: That seems legitimately irrelevant.Jay Kang: No, just saying the celebrity-Aaron Lammer: My counter take is I don\u2019t think that Azealia Banks reference makes any sense.Jay Kang: I was just saying if the proximity of something to Elon Musk outside of news about Tesla doesn\u2019t seem to be that important.Aaron Lammer: Okay. What top five\u00a0\u2026 Who coming out as being a pro-Bitcoin/holder-of-Bitcoin, who would be the biggest market movers? I thought Elon Musk would move the market. Did not move the market. No one gave a shit.Jay Kang: In the U.S?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Number one would be Obama, I think.Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what I was going to say. If Obama was like, \u201cI think Bitcoin\u2019s a good idea and I\u2019m adding some to my portfolio,\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat?!\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, I think Obama\u2019s probably number one. I don\u2019t know. Number two probably would be Warren Buffet. If Warren Buffet made a big change of heart.Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: There are just a lot of people who just do everything that Warren Buffet says.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s weird, though because when I think of the modern financial guruish dudes, not guruish, but Marc Cuban types, those people have already come out as being interested in Bitcoin and are probably-Jay Kang: Yeah, but they don\u2019t have the same following as Warren Buffet.Aaron Lammer: Either than Warren Buffet, who is the most respected financial thinker in America? What if Alan Greenspan said he was holding Bitcoin?Jay Kang: I think that they would more check out Greenspan\u2019s medication.Aaron Lammer: They would be like, \u201cWho\u2019s been feeding lines?\u201dJay Kang: Exactly. We think that your levels of something are very off. I would be more concerned about Alan Greenspan than I would think take that very seriously. I don\u2019t know. I think the list is very short. It might just be Barack Obama and Warren Buffet. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other celebrity or famous person that would have any effect on the market at all.Aaron Lammer: Oprah?Jay Kang: No, not Oprah.Aaron Lammer: You don\u2019t think if Oprah started shilling Bitcoin it would move the market.Jay Kang: You know what? She does-Aaron Lammer: You\u2019re all, \u201cMaybe I would get in on that.\u201dJay Kang: Instead of \u2018The Secret\u2019\u00a0\u2026 Remember when she was puffing that book \u2018The Secret\u2019?Aaron Lammer: Yeah.Jay Kang: Instead of \u2018The Secret\u2019 she was just talking about Bitcoin like that. Instead of being make a vision board and picture the success that you have in the world and it will come true, she was just like, \u201cBuy cryptocurrency and enjoy the decentralized utopia,\u201d yeah, that would have some effect, I think.Aaron Lammer: Yeah. I think that the next stage of Bitcoin is going to have a lot of celebrity stuff.Jay Kang: That\u2019s the three. I don\u2019t think anyone other than those three, though. And, Oprah is a distant third there I think.Aaron Lammer: Lebron?Jay Kang: No way. It would have on effect.Aaron Lammer: Really?Jay Kang: No.Aaron Lammer: If Lebron starts talking about crypto?Jay Kang: Nobody trusts Lebron with financial advice or their lives. They\u2019re just like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a really good basketball player,\u201d then half the country hates him. There\u2019s nobody else who would move the needle, I don\u2019t think, in any of this.Aaron Lammer: Okay, we\u2019ll come back to that. I have a feeling we\u2019ll think of some more possible influencers. You want to talk main course here? We\u2019ve not really gotten to talk about JP Morgan coin yet.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: I thought it was going to go away and it kind of did go away, but I feel like, we\u2019re going to have to talk about it.Jay Kang: Yeah, our friend Joe Weisenthal who wrote about it, he was on vacation when JPM hit. He withheld his thoughts and he wrote about it in his morning newsletter, or his section of the morning newsletter, which Bloomberg puts out.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like a Bloomberg market newsletter.Jay Kang: Yeah, I read it. I actually get it every day and I\u2019m always interested in Joe\u2019s thoughts. It\u2019s short and it\u2019s cogent and I think one of Joe\u2019s talents as a writer is to crystallize something down into two interesting points that you can think about, which I think is a great talent.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve generally been enjoying newsletters recently particularly as a way to get crypto news. I needed to get off Twitter and Reddit. Tony Sheng, Marty\u2019s Bent from Marty Bent, it\u2019s a good way to keep up to date. I plan most of our show based on newsletters I feel like.Jay Kang: I haven\u2019t joined that yet because you can\u2019t get in newsletter fights and\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: Oh, right. It\u2019s true. Newsletters won\u2019t fight with you, which to me is a plus, to Jay is a minus.Jay Kang: Huge minus.Aaron Lammer: We try to come in with different takes. My take is that fighting is bad. Jay\u2019s take is that fighting is good.Jay Kang: Yeah.Aaron Lammer: Okay.Jay Kang: I would object if you don\u2019t paint me in a corner, but that is actually a very coherent and accurate assessment of our general thoughts on this.Aaron Lammer: For what JP Morgan Coin is it\u2019s another stable coin backed to the dollar similar to Tether I guess you could say.Jay Kang: Yeah. Well, yeah, it\u2019s a stable coin and JP Morgan is basically saying, \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be worth a dollar.\u201d What Joe says is, \u201cLook, this might sound silly,\u201d but he does come up with an interesting thought which is that with something like JP Morgan\u00a0\u2026 This is me quoting him now. \u201cWith something like JPM Coin, money could have rules attached to it. Parents of college-aged students could give them money that is only able to be spent on book or food at the cafeteria. A charity might specify in code that their dollars only go to a certain cause and not be used for administrative expenses. Investors in a startup could theoretically put it in dollars that only go to buy Facebook ads. It can\u2019t be used for fancy offices or the CEO\u2019s salaries.\u201dJay Kang: \u201cThere are ways of arranging all these things now, of course, but they require human oversight or other kludgy systems.\u201d I don\u2019t know what that word is, but it\u2019s a good word, kludgy.Aaron Lammer: Kludgy. Kludgy means hacky, duck-taped together.Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s a good word. Lot of countenance.Aaron Lammer: Jerry-rigged and kludgy are synonymous.Jay Kang: \u201cMoney in which the rules of how they\u2019re spent have a lot of potential in the future. It\u2019s nothing like what Bitcoin\u2019s all about, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not interesting.\u201d What do you think of that, Aaron?Aaron Lammer: Well, first another thing I wanted to note in there, he says, \u201cJP Morgan\u00a0\u2026 \u201c This is a quote again, \u201cJPM makes clear only permission clients will have access to the coin.\u201d That\u2019s a big important thing to know up front, which is like, \u201cThis is for people who are like logged into the JPM system. This is not open market at all.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s basically going to be like here is Aaron\u2019s allowance. No buying weed. No buying your legal weed-Jay Kang: I feel like-Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 teenage Aaron in the 2030s.Jay Kang: That seems like a good argument for JPM Coin honestly.Aaron Lammer: You try and swipe my hologram eye thing and it will set off an alarm in the store and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo weed. You cannot buy weed with these JPM.\u201dJay Kang: Yeah, you can buy these bottles of water and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know. I tend to agree with Joe what I for you take out the implications of all of this that there is a use for it. Outside of allowance, I don\u2019t quite know what those would be. The problems that he\u2019s citing here, outside of teenage Aaron, aren\u2019t not real problems. When you give money to a charity, you have no idea how that\u2019s spent. There are all sorts of examples like the breast cancer awareness groups and stuff like that where a lot of people who have given them money come to regret it because there are journalists who go in and look at all of it and say, \u201cLook all of this money is going to things that have nothing to do with breast cancer research.\u201d If you could specify things like that then I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a bad thing.Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve come to the point on this show where I feel like we can\u2019t only cover the things that we think are cool or a good thing. At a certain point, I\u2019m sort of interested in all of this stuff. When I actually think of this, this feels more realistic to me than the Ethereum amusement park. The programmable JP Morgan buck\u00a0\u2026Aaron Lammer: Let me propose an even simpler programming, which is say I want to put five percent of my earnings into a retirement account every year and you buy some sort of a coin that automates that process or something or knows not to be taxed because it\u2019s a pre-taxed buck rather than a post-tax [crosstalk 00:47:44].Jay Kang: Sure.Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know, somehow the fact that you\u2019re already in a financial infrastructure, it makes that kind of a thing realistic and I could almost see it operating as a budgeting tool also that it basically manages the flow of your income and holds money for taxes, pays money for expenses, and gives you a living allowance or something. I know it\u2019s a dystopian vision, but what are people really going to do with programmable money other than program it to move around in an automated way?Jay Kang: Why is that a dystopian vision?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t like someone being able to tell me I can\u2019t buy weed at the 7\u201311. It\u2019s legal, God dammit!Jay Kang: You\u2019re entire take on this is you putting yourself in a time machine and going back to when you were 16-years-old in a world where you can buy weed and then imagining that your parents would be like, \u201cHere\u2019s your allowance. You can\u2019t spend it on this.\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cThis is dystopian.\u201dAaron Lammer: Jay, what if these were programmed so they were like no gambling bucks.Jay Kang: Yeah, it would probably help me.Aaron Lammer: You try to bring them in a casino and it\u2019s like\u00a0\u2026Jay Kang: God, I wish every single one\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m being totally serious here. If I could go to my employer and say, \u201cCan you give me the money that you can\u2019t use at a casino?\u201d I would do it in a heartbeat.Aaron Lammer: This would create another level in this de-platforming financial wars that are happening now. If you to say the JP Morgan buck can\u2019t be sent to these political groups or it can\u2019t be used for these various purposes\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to be paranoid here. I actually think some of this is positive, but we\u2019re putting more and more extrajudicial rules upon how money [crosstalk 00:49:42].Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. Sure. In a world where every dollar is JP Morgan bucks, I think that they\u2019re probably a lot of privacy and potential for state control and all this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. In a world where it\u2019s just an opt-in thing, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really see that big of a problem with it. It\u2019s interesting to me. I would say that my general politics would be JP Morgan shouldn\u2019t have all this power over things and they shouldn\u2019t have power over how people spend their money.Jay Kang: From a purely conceptual point, is there a use for this, not whether I like it? Yeah, there\u2019s a use for that vision that Joe\u2019s putting out there. I think that\u2019s what Joe is saying too by the way. I don\u2019t think he is saying this would be cool. I think he\u2019s just being yeah, there\u2019s something you could do with it. It\u2019s not totally vaporware.Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I appreciate people like Joe for taking in our same fade prevailing sentiment way. We probably should be taking the Facebook crypto project and the JP Morgan Coin seriously. I realize that they get zero respect on the internet, but Ripple gets almost zero respect and lots of things that succeed are generally doubted by the entire technology press. I don\u2019t take the fact that JP Morgan Coin is a joke as any sort of an indication that it won\u2019t work.Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s like North Carolina Tar Heel basketball team. Disrespected and put out for dead and then come back to beat Duke. Yeah, I don\u2019t know, I think that generally, you should not listen to the internet. If at all, you should just fade the internet at all points possible which means should we be buying JP Morgan Coin then?Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think we have permission to.Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. Sure. I don\u2019t have a JP Morgan account \u2019cause I don\u2019t have that much money.Jay Kang: All right, let\u2019s go to the last one. I got to go pick up my kid soon.Aaron Lammer: Okay, there was an op-ed, I think it was today, in the New York Times. It was basically an economics professor in Venezuela talking about how Bitcoin had allowed him to survive more or less during the crisis in Venezuela. It goes into pretty deep detail describing in a step by step practical way basically how he has shifted his financial life into Bitcoin and, as such, been able to survive slightly better than the average person.Jay Kang: Can I ask you a question? I know that we try not to get into so many meta-journalism discussions on this show because our listenership doesn\u2019t care so much, but were you surprised to see this in the New York Times?Aaron Lammer: Not really. I think that the Venezuela case for Bitcoin has been brewing for a pretty long time. There\u2019s a pretty concerted effort. It\u2019s probably the most optimistic universally good story happening in crypto right now. It\u2019s not surprising to me that this would land in the Times. Were you surprised?Jay Kang: No, I wasn\u2019t really surprised, but if we do go and think about things from a\u00a0\u2026 Obviously, every piece that\u2019s printed in New York Times font has a conspiracy theory attached to it. I would say that some people would say that this was only published so that people get a sense of how bad economic conditions were in Venezuela, therefore, opening more public sentiment for some sort of coup there or something like that or intervention in what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s try, but then, at the same time, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s not true because editors are just people who have to fill space and they\u2019re just trying to find something interesting.\u201dJay Kang: There was a way that this thing was written that it did feel a lot more advocate like than your general op-ed. That did make me pause a little bit. I\u2019m not accusing the New York Times op-ed page of any wrongdoing or even any\u00a0\u2026 I really do think that they thought it was interesting. They published it, but I could see an argument in what you would say, the way this is written is a little bit too, hey, this is\u00a0\u2026 It felt like an ad for Bitcoin, honestly.Aaron Lammer: Well, okay, I disagree with that on a few levels. One, the New York Times publishes a lot of op-eds.Jay Kang: Defend the New York Times!Aaron Lammer: The New York Times publishes a lot of op-eds so it\u2019s not like crazy that this-Jay Kang: Yeah, sure and some of them are much more, let\u2019s say, problematic like when they publish the head of Blackwater writing an op-ed. That\u2019s [crosstalk 00:54:35].Aaron Lammer: Sure, sure, sure. I actually don\u2019t think this is a particularly controversial op-ed insofar as I do think whether you support a U.S. intervention in Venezuela or not, I would say that Maduro has been more or less verified internationally as the villain in this story. For the New York Times to publish an op-ed that contains anti-Maduro sentiments isn\u2019t hugely surprising to me.Aaron Lammer: The entire story of Bitcoin in Venezuela wouldn\u2019t be a positive story if you\u2019re pro-Maduro. Bitcoin is being used as a hedge against Maduro and basically as a way to undermine his economic rule. It shows how Bitcoin can spontaneously intervene in a situation like this and operate at a level in which\u00a0\u2026 And, he talks about how people are actually buying Bitcoin there, which is\u00a0\u2026 Have we ever talked about local Bitcoins on this show?Jay Kang: No. Yeah, I think we have, but not by name. The concept of it, I think, is something we discussed quite a bit.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like a Craigslist X website that pairs buyers with sellers to either make in-person, or if you direct bag transfer, Bitcoin transactions. The author\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019ve heard of a lot of people buying Bitcoin in coffee shops and so forth in Venezuela from just private dealers, but he\u2019s doing it through bank transfers. He says that under a $50 transfer doesn\u2019t get flagged by the administration. He sends it to someone and they send back Bitcoin. He was able to get his brother smuggled out to Columbia and secure some of his savings by buying Bitcoin in that way.Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s an incredible confluence of modern trust technologies that you can basically have someone in a place that has rapidly inflating money doing anonymous Bitcoin transactions on the fly.Jay Kang: Yeah, the way that it was framed in the piece I thought was very good, which was just like, \u201cHey, let me tell you what it\u2019s like to buy a carton of milk in Venezuela right now. You can work all you want, but\u00a0\u2026 \u201c I think his dad works some job and he gets paid basically $6 a month. Obviously, the problems with trying to buy food in Venezuela have been very well documented. He tells you how he does it and how it\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s possible and that this is the only safeguard he has against the idea that all of his labor and his family\u2019s wealth, which is not that much, but his family\u2019s small amount of savings won\u2019t be evaporated by political instability or political things that happen with Maduro and the economy in Venezuela.Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. The thing that I find interesting and this is that, for me, that this is by far the most compelling case for Bitcoin. It\u2019s interesting to see the generational gap, I think, when I was trying to figure out who was talking about this article. People who are a little bit smarter, I think, and a little bit more worldly who really did think that this article was important and then the more into crypto or inside crypto people who more or less ignored it and continued to scream about whatever their [inaudible 00:58:10].Aaron Lammer: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s totally fair. I think part of the way this story\u00a0\u2026 If you\u2019re asking how it ended up at the New York Times, I saw Anthony P show last week had on a Venezuelan person. The crypto media has been pretty heavily promoting the voices of Venezuelans who are using Bitcoin to control their financial lives. I think that story gets told a million times then it flows to various news outlets and then eventually it\u2019s in the New York Times. It\u2019s like a conservative route to-Jay Kang: That\u2019s fair. Yeah.Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 push the story. What\u2019s interesting to me going forward with this story is we\u2019ve seen that it basically works. There\u2019s enough volume that you\u2019re able to see on the local Bitcoin volume a huge amount of Bitcoin flowing to Venezuela. After Venezuela happens and there\u2019s going to be more of these kinds of incidents because states fail all the time in the world, will Venezuela ever go back to a Bolivar-style system or will Bitcoin eventually become the defacto currency of Venezuela and will these countries that use Bitcoin for stability end up just using them for their economy in the future?Jay Kang: I think there\u2019s zero chance that they switch to Bitcoin as their currency. It\u2019s not just Venezuela obviously that\u2019s interested in this. There are a lot of much more powerful countries including our own that have a lot of incentive to not make that happen. I think that they will apply any sort of military or political pressure possible to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen.Aaron Lammer: Maybe going Bitcoin economy will be the new going Marxist for our country.Jay Kang: The new Cold War between companies on the-Aaron Lammer: Yeah, it will be [crosstalk 01:00:09] maximalism. If we let maximalism spread to Columbia, we\u2019re going to lose all of Central America.Jay Kang: Yeah, [inaudible 01:00:18] is the new-Aaron Lammer: Becomes the new Cheng.Jay Kang: He becomes a freedom fighter.Aaron Lammer: Again, I would see that movie.Jay Kang: I would see that movie, but I would not want to live in that country.Aaron Lammer: All right, well, good talking. I have a feeling we\u2019ll probably be talking about the Venezuela stuff again because it seems like it\u2019s a story that\u2019s only growing.", "url": "https://medium.com/s/cointalk/episode-67-would-oprah-move-the-needle-5b20d9a7910d", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\"><head prefix=\"og: http://ogp.me/ns# fb: http://ogp.me/ns/fb# medium-com: http://ogp.me/ns/fb/medium-com#\"><meta content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=contain\" name=\"viewport\"/><title>CoinTalk\u2122\ufe0f #67: \ud83d\udee2 Would Oprah Move the Needle? \u2013 CoinTalk \u2013 Medium</title><link href=\"https://medium.com/s/cointalk/episode-67-would-oprah-move-the-needle-5b20d9a7910d\" rel=\"canonical\"/><meta content=\"CoinTalk\u2122\ufe0f #67: \ud83d\udee2 Would Oprah Move the Needle? \u2013 CoinTalk \u2013 Medium\" name=\"title\"/><meta content=\"unsafe-url\" name=\"referrer\"/><meta content=\"COIN TALK is produced in partnership with Medium and hosted by Aaron Lammer and Jay Caspian Kang.

After we taped our episode where we briefly touched on Quadriga\u00a0\u2026 Do you remember the Quadriga, the founder died lost $190 million?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2672\" name=\"2672\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"74fe\" name=\"74fe\">Aaron Lammer: Okay. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole of reading everything on Reddit about this, made an extremely elaborate document with a timeline. Somehow I was like, \u201cMaybe I should talk about this on Coin Talk.\u201d But, I was like, \u201cBut, the images are important and these documents that I\u2019ve compiled.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll make a video where I explain all my thoughts about it.\u201d I bought the green screen for that. Then, when it came, I had a flash of clarity and I imagined myself on YouTube, spinning conspiracy theories and I was like, \u201cOh, man. This is the first step down a super dark corridor of your life.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6c3e\" name=\"6c3e\">Jay Kang: You\u2019ve created basically audio/visual Reddit, which I actually think might be a good idea, but also probably is 90% of YouTube at this point.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4f2b\" name=\"4f2b\">Aaron Lammer: Well, I just thought it was funny how so much news is breaking about YouTube\u2019s role in spreading conspiracy theory. I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve got a conspiracy theory. I know just where to take it. All I need is this eight-foot-long green screen.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0efa\" name=\"0efa\">Jay Kang: Yeah, then I\u2019ll record in my actual basement surrounded by antiquated audio equipment. I think that your channel would be pretty good though, Aaron.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5eff\" name=\"5eff\">Aaron Lammer: Okay. Well, let\u2019s let the people weigh in. If you\u2019re listening and you\u2019d like an AV episode of Coin Talk and would you like to see what Jay and actually look like, Jay who has never taken two weeks off of working out ever, what we actually look like-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"464d\" name=\"464d\">Jay Kang: No, I just never actually worked out enough where that two weeks would be cheating.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1be5\" name=\"1be5\">Aaron Lammer: Oh, okay. Okay. You were taking the under not the over. I gotcha. I gotcha.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c891\" name=\"c891\">Jay Kang: I wasn\u2019t like, \u201cAaron, what are you talking about?\u201d I\u2019m almost the fattest I\u2019ve ever been.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3fb0\" name=\"3fb0\">Aaron Lammer: Wait, speaking of the over and under, before we get into it, I feel like occasionally I want a little sidebar gambler, Jay, like non-crypto gambler Jay. I feel like this is the first year I was hearing a lot of action on the Oscars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f540\" name=\"f540\">Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s not a mistake by the way. I think it was because the New Jersey sportsbooks opened up and that a lot of people could bet on the Oscars on an app for the first time because you could do it on a FanDuel app or whatever New Jersey betting app. I think that that plus the fact that there\u2019s a lot more places where you can get gambling content because everybody is prepping for the day in which anybody in the United States can bet on sports. I think that\u2019s why there is so much talk about that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d936\" name=\"d936\">Aaron Lammer: Did you hear in last week\u2019s episode when I talked to Ledger about Hero and how much FOMO did you experience while listening to it?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3bd4\" name=\"3bd4\">Jay Kang: It was too complicated for me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80cd\" name=\"80cd\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, yeah, I was like-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93b1\" name=\"93b1\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s just like that\u2019s way too complicated. I think I would rather just play video games.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1509\" name=\"1509\">Aaron Lammer: While I was talking to him about it, I was like, \u201cJay is just laying a bed on division two for beer league at this point.\u201d Too much work for him. It is interesting how as this stuff becomes more legal, all these things like how the movement of the lines, it becomes a lot more real. Previously, you\u2019d hear about odds on something like the Oscars and it was like, \u201cOh, yeah. This is 40:1.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cIs it really or is that just what it was listed as in some sort of blog post?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0775\" name=\"0775\">Jay Kang: You mean is the actual bet the thing that people are reporting when they are talking about it? Is that what you\u2019re asking?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5250\" name=\"5250\">Aaron Lammer: As I understand it, this year in the Oscar betting, a bunch of these lines moved a bunch after they opened, particularly, and I\u2019m interested in your take on this as an expert in these fields, I think it was the best director race. What\u2019s the guy who directed \u2018Dogtooth\u2019? He\u2019s Greek, I believe.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"029b\" name=\"029b\">Jay Kang: Yorgos something.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4600\" name=\"4600\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Yorgos.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ff2f\" name=\"ff2f\">Jay Kang: Yeah, he does a lot of stuff. He did \u2018The Favorite\u2019 this time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"513c\" name=\"513c\">Aaron Lammer: \u2018The Favorite\u2019, yeah. He started off as super long odds, and then-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08ca\" name=\"08ca\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I think he was 40:1 or something, maybe 250:1, something crazy like that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ddcd\" name=\"ddcd\">Aaron Lammer: Looking at it, me and you as filmgoers, he\u2019s a pretty long shot I\u2019d say there. You\u2019ve got several people who seem like they\u2019re much, much better picks, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, I think Spike Lee was in the mix. At some point, the odds started getting much and much better for him to win. Up to the point where I think it peaked at 15:1 or 10:1 and then they just froze betting on it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f96d\" name=\"f96d\">Jay Kang: I think it got to 5:2 almost.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e013\" name=\"e013\">Aaron Lammer: Five, okay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f3a\" name=\"8f3a\">Jay Kang: It was insane. It was the biggest swing. It would be like if the Warriors were playing Bowdoin College or something like that where I went to school, and so the odds are like 7000:1. Then, Bowdoin College announces that Kevin Durant and Giannis and all\u00a0\u2026 Basically, the Monstars from \u2018Space Jam\u2019 are all going to be paying in the game. That was the type of odds swing it was. It\u2019s not something that can be explained away by any natural betting pattern. It has to be that a bunch of money that thinks it\u2019s sharp money comes in and completely influences a line. Usually, when that happens, a line only moves a couple spots.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8588\" name=\"8588\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I think I heard your old boss, Bill Simmons, once say that Brady playing or not playing would be like the biggest swing possible in a football game and even that would only be seven points.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b23\" name=\"5b23\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is basically if everyone on the Patriots ended up being arrested in some sort of sex slavery type of thing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f2d8\" name=\"f2d8\">Aaron Lammer: Murdered their close friend in a parking lot kind of situation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"79f0\" name=\"79f0\">Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b9a8\" name=\"b9a8\">Aaron Lammer: Purely hypothetical.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93af\" name=\"93af\">Jay Kang: And, have all been arrested and couldn\u2019t play in the game. Basically, they were trotting out the cheerleaders and the equipment staff to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers. That\u2019s what this type of swing of odds would be.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4bd7\" name=\"4bd7\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, when you heard about this swing, what did you make of it? What I initially thought was, \u201cHoly shit! He\u2019s going to win. Someone knows and that\u2019s a pretty crazy upset. There\u2019s going to be a major scandal and it\u2019s going to end betting on the Academy Awards because it\u2019s too soft. It\u2019s too easy to know.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8a67\" name=\"8a67\">Jay Kang: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s was I thought, but I guess I had a few thoughts. The first was that even if the lines were affected not by the number of bets really but by the amount of money that is bet on it. If you have two other bets for $20 and then you have one bet for $50,000, the $50,000 bet is going to move the line.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e49\" name=\"4e49\">Aaron Lammer: Wait a minute. May I pause you briefly and ask a question? \u2019Cause I think this pertains actually to crypto. When you say that it\u2019s volume not the number of people that moves the line, is there data broken out? When all that action that was on Argo-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0f62\" name=\"0f62\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It tells you. Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9cb7\" name=\"9cb7\">Aaron Lammer: Do we know how many people that was spread around? Could that potentially be one mega whale coming in?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ef84\" name=\"ef84\">Jay Kang: No, that\u2019s the problem, right? Which is that on the book that I use, allegedly, I guess I should say\u00a0\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s legal, but let\u2019s say the book that I sometimes use for an online sportsbook, the most money I could put into one bet was $430. That was for best picture. It wasn\u2019t for best director, which I imagine was lower. There\u2019s no way that any of these companies are going to let you bet $10,000 on these, on best director.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f031\" name=\"f031\">Jay Kang: I just think well, there\u2019s no way this is a mega whale because the bet caps are so low. It has to be a flood of hundreds of people betting this thing in a short period of time, which is why then it\u2019s taken off the books because essentially these New Jersey\u00a0\u2026 I think it was the FanDuel app that ended up taking it off the books first. They must have just gotten a flood of action on him and they didn\u2019t know what was up so they took him off the books.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb2a\" name=\"fb2a\">Aaron Lammer: If I\u2019m in Macau, I\u2019m a high-rolling poker player turned Bitcoin whale and I want to put down a million bucks on \u2018Green Book\u2019, I can\u2019t make that bet?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ba7\" name=\"9ba7\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think so. I think you could make a lot of $10,000 bets, but probably not enough to add up to a million dollars. Actually, that would be insane. You would have to find 100 bet takers to get to a million. Yeah, I can\u2019t see that that was possible. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. That\u2019s way out of my price range in general.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f71\" name=\"5f71\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s a private broker on the private market who will try to pair you with some super secret Triad book, but-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6340\" name=\"6340\">Jay Kang: Sure, but that wouldn\u2019t move the line at the New Jersey sportsbook.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6606\" name=\"6606\">Aaron Lammer: Not only would that move the line, it\u2019s crazy for an event that is as big as the Oscars. This is one of the world\u2019s biggest nights behind, let\u2019s say, the Super Bowl and a few sporting events. Considering how far into gambling legalization we are, it\u2019s crazy how little liquidity there is in a lot of these markets. Much like there\u2019s zero liquidity in Augur right now.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee6e\" name=\"ee6e\">Jay Kang: I\u2019m glad that you brought that full circle and not just talking about gambling.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5e50\" name=\"5e50\">Aaron Lammer: Well wait, we didn\u2019t finish the story. Cuar\u00f3n won and he was wrong. What do you think happened? Where was all that money coming from?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6854\" name=\"6854\">Jay Kang: Well, the story came out. It was allegedly a guy at Penn State who\u2019s in a fraternity who said that his dad was in the Academy and that his dad had told him that Yorgos was going to win. He posted it somewhere where a bunch of people saw it and then all the money started coming in.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"331d\" name=\"331d\">Aaron Lammer: Basically, a Tron getting listed to Coinbase rumor kind of thing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"20e9\" name=\"20e9\">Jay Kang: Yeah, but there was one other level where it was the\u00a0\u2026 Have you seen the frat aliens episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9940\" name=\"9940\">Aaron Lammer: I have. I have.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f602\" name=\"f602\">Jay Kang: Where the guy keeps going, \u201cMy dad owns a dealership.\u201d It\u2019s like that, but it\u2019s like, \u201cMy dad is in the Academy and he\u2019s saying it\u2019s Yorgos.\u201d Then, suddenly, thousands and thousands of dollars are coming in on Yorgos. It\u2019s hilarious. I do think that it probably makes these sportsbooks uncomfortable, though. Because there are all sorts of pain points that would make this harder to do when there aren\u2019t tens of thousands of people on an app where they can just get to the bet really quickly like before. For example, if you actually have to go to the sportsbook to put down a bet, you\u2019re probably going to do that a lot less than just pull out your phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f7b6\" name=\"f7b6\">Jay Kang: If you have to sign up for a semi-legal sports betting site, that\u2019s only a certain type of person who does that. In a world where every sucker has this app or every sucker is into sports has this app, then the possibilities for misinformation go up pretty high. I imagine at every sportsbook right now there\u2019s probably a lot of talk about how they can avoid this happening again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1053\" name=\"1053\">Aaron Lammer: Well, what it makes me think is that the age of the open sportsbook and the age of the Reddit rumor/hoax is going to be pretty wild. This is just one frat guy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"748d\" name=\"748d\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s going to be amazing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"16e8\" name=\"16e8\">Aaron Lammer: What is that website called? Total Frat Move. Remember that website?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"de0a\" name=\"de0a\">Jay Kang: That was a total frat move.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b22\" name=\"2b22\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve manipulated the Oscar\u2019s market. Total frat move.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eccd\" name=\"eccd\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s a really good troll, honestly. I find it all funny. I only put that one bet for the Oscars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"610a\" name=\"610a\">Aaron Lammer: What did you bet?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ec47\" name=\"ec47\">Jay Kang: I bet \u2018Green Book\u2019 best picture.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4eb8\" name=\"4eb8\">Aaron Lammer: Well done.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bfa9\" name=\"bfa9\">Jay Kang: Thank you, thank you.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"047d\" name=\"047d\">Aaron Lammer: You are, in the same way that in Augur we generally try to fade Libertarianism, you were fading woke internet takes?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"769e\" name=\"769e\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s exactly what my thought process was.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c6f4\" name=\"c6f4\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019d like to think that on the show if we can\u2019t share in the crypto moderate movement, we can at least share the babe-like, cheap blonde post sentiment wherever you can be it in the entertainment media or the crypto media.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"18ac\" name=\"18ac\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think that the criticisms for the \u2018Green Book\u2019 are cheap or unwarranted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eb31\" name=\"eb31\">Aaron Lammer: Oh, no, no, but the idea that it won\u2019t wind because of this-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1713\" name=\"1713\">Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s the thing that I don\u2019t get.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"50e6\" name=\"50e6\">Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. When we fade Libertarianism it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t believe in Libertarianism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e90\" name=\"7e90\">Jay Kang: Yeah, we don\u2019t also believe in Libertarianism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"242a\" name=\"242a\">Aaron Lammer: But, wearing our betting hats, it\u2019s just a good bet. You\u2019re just getting value on it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5d09\" name=\"5d09\">Jay Kang: For Augur, remember we bet the price of Ethereum wouldn\u2019t be over $500 on December 31st, 2018 and that was just a fade of maximalism basically. It didn\u2019t feel like maximalism reflected anything. I think it\u2019s the same thing you can do for these Oscar things where the discussion around it, if you read the internet, is so one-way. In the end, you realize that what it is, it\u2019s like a couple thousand old people watching screeners or not watching screeners and voting for the Oscars. They either don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening on Twitter or they don\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s happening on Twitter. It seemed like they were just going to pick \u2018Green Book\u2019 because that\u2019s the exact type of movie that they always pick, so wouldn\u2019t they pick it?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1440\" name=\"1440\">Aaron Lammer: Couldn\u2019t we make a similar argument about Bitcoin being mostly controlled by a few mega whales and-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"16c2\" name=\"16c2\">Jay Kang: I like these redirects you\u2019re doing today.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71ce\" name=\"71ce\">Aaron Lammer: Keeping it on topic.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2779\" name=\"2779\">Jay Kang: Let\u2019s go.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"23af\" name=\"23af\">Aaron Lammer: We think Bitcoin is defined by how many people want to go and put $100 in their Coinbase account, but when we really look at the distribution of coins, the people who own full percentage points worth of Bitcoin are probably influencing price a lot more than me and you.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0833\" name=\"0833\">Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. For sure. That one guy who is one of the trustees of Mt. Gox, he was moving the market by himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d00b\" name=\"d00b\">Aaron Lammer: That guy was awesome. I wish he would reappear in a different plot line.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8152\" name=\"8152\">Jay Kang: He is just market selling. [crosstalk 00:16:45].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e177\" name=\"e177\">Aaron Lammer: He was honestly just like, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I know you guys care, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a865\" name=\"a865\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. You guys are really mad at me, but honestly, I just want this to be out of my hair and I\u2019m going to do the easiest way possible. I don\u2019t care how much money I lose in the process. That\u2019s actually an admirable thing. I don\u2019t know.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"244a\" name=\"244a\">Jay Kang: This actually is relevant with crypto. I think it\u2019s probably, at this point, a smart move where there\u2019s a consensus of really loud and well-followed and intense people on Twitter about anything whether it be crypto maximalism or politics and pop culture, you should just fade that. You should just auto-fade that if you\u2019re going to make any sort of bet on anything. You should just be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to take the opposite route.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7bec\" name=\"7bec\">Jay Kang: That goes to things like Amazon even. This idea that Amazon is in trouble because it didn\u2019t come to New York and AOC and some of the new Democrats are going to have them on the run. I\u2019m just like, \u201cLook, outside of whether or not that\u2019s a good or bad thing, I would tend to say that\u2019s probably a good thing-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4c92\" name=\"4c92\">Aaron Lammer: You\u2019d probably be buying Facebook right now on the same grounds basically, right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"494a\" name=\"494a\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I tried that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3886\" name=\"3886\">Aaron Lammer: [crosstalk 00:18:02] got wrecked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5fa0\" name=\"5fa0\">Jay Kang: I got a few months on [crosstalk 00:18:07] wrecked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b1ba\" name=\"b1ba\">Aaron Lammer: Jay, I feel like we\u2019re just trying to derive strategies to get wrecked into crypto and something else right now. What else could we bring our unique blend of failure and hubris to?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3927\" name=\"3927\">Jay Kang: Exactly, and misanthropy. Like, \u201cOkay, if I hate everybody and everybody\u2019s wrong except me, what should I bet on?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e97\" name=\"7e97\">Aaron Lammer: Well, look, you won with the \u2018Green Book\u2019 so you\u2019re on a hot streak of one. Let\u2019s keep it going. You want to run through a little news?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a0d\" name=\"2a0d\">Jay Kang: Yeah. Let\u2019s do it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cafb\" name=\"cafb\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, this is hot, breaking, won\u2019t be breaking anymore when this comes out, but we can still enjoy it in the moment, Ripple going to Coinbase. This is like NBA trade deadline we\u2019re in.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"028f\" name=\"028f\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s not Ripple, right? I believe you mean XRP is going to Coinbase.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"239e\" name=\"239e\">Aaron Lammer: Sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. Jay, I think we got off on the wrong foot. Can we start that again?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e295\" name=\"e295\">Jay Kang: You of all people with our XRP hat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0779\" name=\"0779\">Aaron Lammer: XRP is going to Coinbase.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55a9\" name=\"55a9\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised. Are you surprised?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d8f6\" name=\"d8f6\">Aaron Lammer: I am surprised. Well, this reminds me of\u00a0\u2026 Today\u2019s going to be all me doing comparisons.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0e97\" name=\"0e97\">Jay Kang: Sure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e8ea\" name=\"e8ea\">Aaron Lammer: It reminds me of the way now in the NBA someone will say something as if it\u2019s totally absolute and then it\u2019s a total lie. Like when Kyrie was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m planning to stay in Boston,\u201d and then two months later he was like, \u201cWe\u2019re considering all the other options.\u201d Coinbase literally wrote a document that in all but name said we will never add XRP.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71bc\" name=\"71bc\">Jay Kang: Yep. No, they really did and now they added XRP.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0431\" name=\"0431\">Aaron Lammer: Look, this show\u2019s only been on for a little over a year and we talked about it on the show it can\u2019t have been more than a year ago.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6281\" name=\"6281\">Jay Kang: Yeah, and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the same thing as the NBA players just giving out misinformation to make their lives easier. I think that Coinbase just didn\u2019t know back then.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ebbe\" name=\"ebbe\">Aaron Lammer: Don\u2019t you think Kyrie just changed his mind? That\u2019s what I think Brian Armstrong did.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b462\" name=\"b462\">Jay Kang: Yeah. No, no, that\u2019s what I meant. I think they were talking about\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s two things. The first is that you have to give much more statements now than you ever had to and they\u2019re disseminated. Kyrie said that thing at a dinner for season ticket holders or something like that. There\u2019s no way that that would have been reported on at any other point.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1460\" name=\"1460\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e389\" name=\"e389\">Jay Kang: Same thing with Coinbase and Ripple, all the attention on Coinbase I\u2019m sure they have said a lot of things that they now wish that they could take back. The nice thing about our current landscape in media and relative to truth is that you can just go the other way. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself. You\u2019re just like, \u201cLook, that was back then. This is now. Who cares?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6fab\" name=\"6fab\">Aaron Lammer: If we\u2019re going to take anything away from it, I think we\u2019re going to take that Coinbase is just going to keep doing whatever is best for Coinbase. I feel like our initial take on Coinbase circa episode one was probably right, which is it\u2019s always going to be better for Coinbase than that anything other than Bitcoin wins. Anything Coinbase can do to at least balance the seesaw of the entire bundle other than Bitcoin versus Bitcoin, they\u2019re going to do. They thought they would not have to dirty themselves with the Ripple sauce, but now-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ba6\" name=\"1ba6\">Jay Kang: Okay, I do have a question for you, which is that you, as the owner of an XRP hat, right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0f4d\" name=\"0f4d\">Aaron Lammer: Yes. I\u2019m taking it down and putting it on.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f779\" name=\"f779\">Jay Kang: Because of the generous interview that you gave to a Ripple stand where you were like, \u201cLet\u2019s try and understand these people\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5074\" name=\"5074\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m still beloved in the Ripple community.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a71b\" name=\"a71b\">Jay Kang: You\u2019re like a celebrity in the Ripple community.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2ae3\" name=\"2ae3\">Aaron Lammer: Beloved.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b8c4\" name=\"b8c4\">Jay Kang: Yeah. I think you understand the Ripple stand better than I do, but the thing that I don\u2019t quite understand is why is it dirty for Coinbase to introduce this extremely well-known and extremely centralized, but still much, much-discussed cryptocurrency? Why is it bad?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f2f0\" name=\"f2f0\">Aaron Lammer: I think you said it. It\u2019s extremely centralized.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9044\" name=\"9044\">Jay Kang: But, we\u2019ve crossed that Rubicon already. Coinbase-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"47a6\" name=\"47a6\">Aaron Lammer: Did we cross that Rubicon and decide that Ripple was basically not a crypto?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5239\" name=\"5239\">Jay Kang: But, Coinbase does offer other coins that are highly centralized, right? BAT and other things.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cbaa\" name=\"cbaa\">Aaron Lammer: I agree.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d9f\" name=\"4d9f\">Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s not like Coinbase can be like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re pure.\u201d They\u2019ve muddied themselves with a lot of centralized coins. At this point, why not just add Ripple? That\u2019s my thought.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80ea\" name=\"80ea\">Aaron Lammer: I think that\u2019s probably what the meeting where they decided to greenlight Ripple was. I wonder if they might have wanted to do Ripple before and had been waiting on some sort of a nod from the authorities that Ripple was not going to be trouble if they added it. Yeah, I think that if what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019re already a sellout, why not really sell out. Yeah, I think that\u2019s accurate.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"43dd\" name=\"43dd\">Aaron Lammer: My question is why they felt they had to get in this business? I guess you could say that they\u2019re just giving the customer what they want, that they\u2019re probably getting a gazillion emails that are like, \u201cI want to buy Ripple at Coinbase.\u201d Who are they to not sell it? On the other hand, in terms of the Bitcoin narrative to have a company that was at one point, I feel like, the most powerful company in Bitcoin so clearly just bagging on Bitcoin, it kind of sucks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c108\" name=\"c108\">Jay Kang: Well, I think this is an example of the gap in context between how much people on Twitter hate Ripple and how much the Twitter Ripple fans are psychotic, and the reality of their business, which is that if you ignore all that then what Coinbase still a large part of their business is through transaction fees on buys and sells, right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5443\" name=\"5443\">Aaron Lammer: Yep.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0f54\" name=\"0f54\">Jay Kang: Why would they not try and offer every single cryptocurrency that is bought and sold a lot? I would say that Ripple is probably still bought and sold quite a bit. If they can tune out the screaming hoards on both sides, then for them, it\u2019s a pretty clear business decision. I don\u2019t know. Again, as we said, their purity is gone. It\u2019s been gone. I would say that the final blow to it was the way that they introduced Bitcoin Cash. That\u2019s when we started to think of them as a purely capitalistic\u00a0\u2026 Capitalistic is not the right word, but their much-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71eb\" name=\"71eb\">Aaron Lammer: Opportunistic.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2df0\" name=\"2df0\">Jay Kang: Yeah, they\u2019re much more opportunistic\u00a0\u2026 They were much less interested in the theory and philosophy of decentralization than we had thought. Why not just put on Ripple? I don\u2019t know. This doesn\u2019t make me mad at all. Coinbase, sponsor our show.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"68d2\" name=\"68d2\">Aaron Lammer: Wow, Jay. Jay\u2019s come full circle on Coinbase.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f6ce\" name=\"f6ce\">Jay Kang: Toshi\u2019s great.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"40f8\" name=\"40f8\">Aaron Lammer: Here\u2019s my counter take on why I think it\u2019s a bad decision for Coinbase. I\u2019m not mad about it. I have not placed a lot of faith in Coinbase other than the fact that I use them as a business. Here\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a bad business decision, though. I feel like Coinbase and Ripple, the company, not the currency, are on some deep, deep level competitors. I know that sounds crazy, but remember when we didn\u2019t think of Apple and Google and Facebook as competitors. We\u2019re like, \u201cOh, they\u2019re all completely in their own lane.\u201d Then, once they get big enough, everything is competitive.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c1bb\" name=\"c1bb\">Aaron Lammer: Ripple is a company. It\u2019s a startup. It\u2019s a for-profit startup that has a shit ton of money for not doing very much. I think that ultimately the ambitions of that company are going to run contrary to Coinbase\u2019s. I think they\u2019re both going to try to become IPOed, biggest crypto companies in the world, taking different paths. That\u2019s not really a risk you run with Bitcoin or even to a lesser extent, Ethereum in so far as Ethereum is designed more as a nonprofit foundation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9386\" name=\"9386\">Jay Kang: Yeah, but at that point-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f1fa\" name=\"f1fa\">Aaron Lammer: I just think it\u2019s a little like when Apple allows Amazon Prime videos on Apple TV.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a566\" name=\"a566\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I was thinking about that as an example, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite the same way because what you\u2019re trying to do is you\u2019re trying to monopolize the on-ramp space if you\u2019re Coinbase, right? If Ripple, if they can establish enough with the Ripple community that the best way to buy and sell XRP is through Coinbase, then Ripple, as the company, has a harder time trying to dissuade people from using the easy on-ramp that they are used to. Does that make sense? You then have to deal with a paid in point where people now have to go to\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"910d\" name=\"910d\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s like Spotify with podcasts right now. They bought Gimlet for $230 million and the question that\u2019s out there is, okay, now if all of Gimlet\u2019s podcasts are on Spotify instead of the Apple podcast app, are people still going to listen to them or is it just like, \u201cIt\u2019s another click and I don\u2019t feel like doing that.\u201d Those are real questions I think that\u00a0\u2026 I think that Coinbase by getting all this information and all this on-ramp stuff for Ripple is probably in a good position there. I don\u2019t quite see what the problem would be there for them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2afe\" name=\"2afe\">Aaron Lammer: I like your Spotify metaphor because the way I read that acquisition is basically as I understand it, Spotify has a ton of paying customers. They\u2019ve signed up 10 million people. They\u2019re doing well in terms of converting people, but based on the cost basis of streaming music, they operate at a loss by streaming music because of the amount of money they have to pay out to artists for that streaming. I know artists feel like Spotify gives them pennies on the dollar of what they should get and I\u2019m sympathetic to that, but even so, Spotify is actually not a good growth business model for streaming music.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b83a\" name=\"b83a\">Aaron Lammer: However, if they own a bunch of podcasts, which are a fixed one-time cost, and that\u2019s what people were doing on Spotify and they were converting new users who were basically just there to listen to those podcasts, it\u2019s a much better business to be in. That\u2019s more or less where I feel like Coinbase has ended up. They\u2019re just not satisfied with the Bitcoin business.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d04a\" name=\"d04a\">Jay Kang: Yeah, and they\u2019re also future-proofing themselves in case Ripple does become the dominant company and-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39b7\" name=\"39b7\">Aaron Lammer: I think it\u2019s a bad call.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55ec\" name=\"55ec\">Jay Kang: What do you mean?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"36fc\" name=\"36fc\">Aaron Lammer: I just think that-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c42\" name=\"1c42\">Jay Kang: Wait, it doesn\u2019t really-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"14c2\" name=\"14c2\">Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 Ripple becomes as big as Bitcoin, there\u2019s going to be no role for Coinbase anyway. I feel like Coinbase is being a little na\u00efve letting these snakes rise up out of the grass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0be1\" name=\"0be1\">Jay Kang: I know, but Coinbase didn\u2019t pay anything for this. They didn\u2019t pay $230 million to buy Ripple or $6 billion or whatever Ripple would cost.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2e69\" name=\"2e69\">Aaron Lammer: Let me play game theory with you.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee9b\" name=\"ee9b\">Jay Kang: Okay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"30f8\" name=\"30f8\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m coming to Coinbase, I have a million dollars cash from my personal wealth that I want to invest in crypto. All I know is I want it to be in crypto.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"af9e\" name=\"af9e\">Jay Kang: Don\u2019t do it!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f4c\" name=\"2f4c\">Aaron Lammer: Okay. First, don\u2019t do it. Nothing on this show is investment advice. That\u2019s a terrible idea. No, I demand to do it. I\u2019m a cranky man. I\u2019ve always had Libertarian sympathies. I want to get my money out of the banks and into crypto. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. Well, what do you want to buy?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I want to buy one of the ones that Coinbase has because obviously, that\u2019s all I know, the only method I had for buying it. Okay.\u201d I have pick of everything on Coinbase.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"322b\" name=\"322b\">Aaron Lammer: Now, I think the thing Coinbase would most like you to do is buy that Coinbase bundle that\u2019s just equally weighted all of the things they sell based on their market share. Remember that?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"595b\" name=\"595b\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dac2\" name=\"dac2\">Aaron Lammer: They still have yet. That\u2019s spreading out all of the risk and upside completely equally so you\u2019re keeping everyone from getting too big. But, if I demand to get a specific currency, would you rather that I have Bitcoin or Ripple if you\u2019re Coinbase?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"726c\" name=\"726c\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think I would care at all. I would just want the one that you moved around the most so I could get transaction fees off of you, right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"531f\" name=\"531f\">Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s a pretty fair point. That\u2019s how banks look at it too. It\u2019s not Fidelity cares what stock I buy. They\u2019re just like, \u201cBuy stocks on Fidelity.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc0e\" name=\"fc0e\">Jay Kang: Yeah, we get our-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8840\" name=\"8840\">Aaron Lammer: Keep your retirement account here.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aab6\" name=\"aab6\">Jay Kang: We get our $5.99 or whatever per trade. Okay, you want to move on?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a08d\" name=\"a08d\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, let\u2019s move on. Did you hear about this thing about Gladius, this ICO which basically reported itself to the FTC?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f0b\" name=\"5f0b\">Jay Kang: No. No, they self-owned?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"90a3\" name=\"90a3\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah. There\u2019s not that much more to the story. Basically, the FTC was like, \u201cYes, you are in the wrong. If you return all the money to investors you won\u2019t face criminal charges or fines.\u201d So, they just returned all the money. This might be the new ICO model is to go right up to the lip and be like, \u201cDo we really want to face jail time?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"737e\" name=\"737e\">Jay Kang: Yeah, but also maybe it\u2019s a business strategy where you snitch on yourself and therefore when you start your next project you can be like, \u201cListen, we\u2019re totally above board now. We\u2019re the ones that snitched on yourself.\u201d Plus, you get a bunch of free press for an obscure coin like Gladius, which I had no idea what it was and I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t either until this happened.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d7f7\" name=\"d7f7\">Aaron Lammer: Still don\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bdb7\" name=\"bdb7\">Jay Kang: Now, we\u2019re discussing it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"50c8\" name=\"50c8\">Aaron Lammer: Still don\u2019t. Didn\u2019t even get as far as looking up what the thing was.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9787\" name=\"9787\">Jay Kang: If we were better at the podcast and researched it better, we could actually do that, but a more prepared host would at least now know what Gladius is. Maybe it\u2019s good.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"845f\" name=\"845f\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t want to use up any more brain space for any ICOs that have already closed down, but I like your exit scam, snitching on yourself. A good way to do that would be to just build the company heavily before you snitch on yourself, like do a lot of consulting services, drain a lot of the money out, and then snitch on yourself, return the money to investors, but you don\u2019t return money that\u2019s already been spent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f857\" name=\"f857\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Self-snitching is generally a good idea, I think. Amy Klobuchar, the woman who\u2019s running for president from Minnesota. She has all those stories about how she was an abusive boss and would throw binders at people, I feel like she should have just self-snitched on all of that when the story started coming out. She should have just been, \u201cI did all of this and it\u2019s because I\u2019m tough and I\u2019m the person who can take on Donald Trump.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3804\" name=\"3804\">Jay Kang: Now, in general, I actually think that it probably is helping her that all these stories are coming out \u2019cause everybody\u2019s discussing her and also most people don\u2019t care if you abuse a 23-year-old aid.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9749\" name=\"9749\">Aaron Lammer: Whoa, Jay. Whoa, whoa.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6018\" name=\"6018\">Jay Kang: No, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t care. I do care, but I think that most people, especially older people, are just like, \u201cThat Millennial deserved it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f2b4\" name=\"f2b4\">Aaron Lammer: Beat that intern\u2019s ass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c04\" name=\"2c04\">Jay Kang: I\u2019m just saying, if she had self-snitched, I think she would have gotten in front of all of this. Then, any other news story, people would have been like, \u201cYeah, but she already admitted it, so who cares?\u201d Anyway, that was my politics take of the last week.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f00\" name=\"5f00\">Aaron Lammer: I was talking to a friend of mine who is an attorney, a criminal defense attorney, and saying something about that Tekashi69 case.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e488\" name=\"e488\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad58\" name=\"ad58\">Aaron Lammer: Tekashi69.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d284\" name=\"d284\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6272\" name=\"6272\">Aaron Lammer: It was like, really, I know people are making fun of him online for snitching, but that was totally the right decision.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d6fd\" name=\"d6fd\">Jay Kang: Yes, except now he might end up dead.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"92c4\" name=\"92c4\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, but he was like, \u201cIf you\u2019re facing life in jail anyway, you should just take whatever deal is offered you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5ce7\" name=\"5ce7\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I guess his recording career is going to be a little difficult now, but maybe like Gladius, you can rebrand and be somebody else. I do enjoy his music.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a5f2\" name=\"a5f2\">Aaron Lammer: I do too. I\u2019m not going to go around trying to defend it or get into some sort of argument with someone about it, but in a purely aesthetic level, I think he\u2019s talented. I am sad that he will spend the rest of his life in witness protection or whatever.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc08\" name=\"fc08\">Jay Kang: His songs are good.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b80f\" name=\"b80f\">Aaron Lammer: He\u2019s also a person who is a little too early for the ICO era. You know who has been saying positive things about Bitcoin in the week since we last spoke is Elon Musk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"49ce\" name=\"49ce\">Jay Kang: Oh, the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi. That\u2019s my favorite-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e878\" name=\"e878\">Aaron Lammer: Of course, he\u2019s praising.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa59\" name=\"aa59\">Jay Kang: That\u2019s my favorite Satoshi theory. I used to bother him on Twitter about it. I\u2019d be like, \u201cAre you Satoshi?\u201d every time he would tweet and he never responded. Yeah, I thought-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b2db\" name=\"b2db\">Aaron Lammer: Wow, actually based on your theory, what he tweeted this week on February 21st fits your theory, which is he tweeted, \u201cHowever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel Prize in delayed gratification.\u201d You could read that as a self-boast.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2365\" name=\"2365\">Jay Kang: Yeah, he might have Satoshi\u2019s wallet keys. I know that we\u2019ve discussed this several times on this show, but I do think that Elon Musk cracks the top 10 on betting odds for who Satoshi is.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"397f\" name=\"397f\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think that and I will take that bet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f22e\" name=\"f22e\">Jay Kang: I still think the odds are very long, but his odds have to be better than Craig\u00a0\u2026 Maybe they\u2019re not better than Craig Wright, but they\u2019re better than some of the other people who are rumored as to be Satoshi.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf3b\" name=\"cf3b\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, let me ask you a question. There was also the whole thing with Jack Dorsey was in a big Twitter interview about Bitcoin. I think he tweeted out his tippin.me lightning wallet. Oh, hey, Jay, did you know that we have a tippin.me lightning wallet?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f10c\" name=\"f10c\">Jay Kang: Did [inaudible 00:36:18] make us one?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a1b\" name=\"5a1b\">Aaron Lammer: No, I just made it for us today.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bc1b\" name=\"bc1b\">Jay Kang: Nice. Nice.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"adf8\" name=\"adf8\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s tippin.me/@cointalkshow. Send us a tip. If we get one tip, we\u2019ll talk about the tip on air. If you send us a tip, and I don\u2019t know if you can put a notes field or something on it, we will say something on the air. That\u2019s a promise.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4bba\" name=\"4bba\">Aaron Lammer: What does it mean that the Elon Musks and Jack Dorseys in the world are talking about Bitcoin?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"84b1\" name=\"84b1\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. It probably means a little bit more than when Jamie Diamond and\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a32\" name=\"7a32\">Aaron Lammer: Warren Buffet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6d1d\" name=\"6d1d\">Jay Kang: Warren Buffet. I almost said Wayne Buffet and then I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d Then I was like, \u201cWalter Buffet.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"81e4\" name=\"81e4\">Aaron Lammer: Warren Buffet was talking about Bitcoin also this week. He was like, \u201cIt has no value, and it attracts charlatans.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bfa8\" name=\"bfa8\">Jay Kang: [inaudible 00:37:08]. Look, fair. It\u2019s a fair take.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"629f\" name=\"629f\">Aaron Lammer: A, true. B, totally period.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"54f1\" name=\"54f1\">Jay Kang: Do you remember when Warren Buffet was talking anyone Bitcoin earlier, maybe nine months ago or something like that?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dc0f\" name=\"dc0f\">Aaron Lammer: When he called it rat poison squared or something?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e28d\" name=\"e28d\">Jay Kang: His take was essentially, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know about all that, but we\u2019ve looked at it and it seems cool, but I don\u2019t know. The only way I would invest in it is it I could buy a put on it.\u201d This is when Bitcoin was $16,000 or something like that. I bet he did actually figure out a way to buy a put on it given that it\u2019s Warren Buffet, but I think about that quite a bit being like, \u201cI wish I had listened to him and just shorted Bitcoin or at least sold my Bitcoin at that point.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"853d\" name=\"853d\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think any of these guys\u00a0\u2026 Musk said he had like 0.25 Bitcoin to his name. It doesn\u2019t seem like that many celebrities are mega whales.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b220\" name=\"b220\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think it really matters. Elon Mush talks about everything at this point. Does it matter that Azealia Banks\u2019 career had a revitalization because of her interactions with Elon Musk? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s relevant.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5d17\" name=\"5d17\">Aaron Lammer: That seems legitimately irrelevant.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4fc8\" name=\"4fc8\">Jay Kang: No, just saying the celebrity-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7889\" name=\"7889\">Aaron Lammer: My counter take is I don\u2019t think that Azealia Banks reference makes any sense.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e881\" name=\"e881\">Jay Kang: I was just saying if the proximity of something to Elon Musk outside of news about Tesla doesn\u2019t seem to be that important.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c11\" name=\"1c11\">Aaron Lammer: Okay. What top five\u00a0\u2026 Who coming out as being a pro-Bitcoin/holder-of-Bitcoin, who would be the biggest market movers? I thought Elon Musk would move the market. Did not move the market. No one gave a shit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2097\" name=\"2097\">Jay Kang: In the U.S?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3652\" name=\"3652\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1553\" name=\"1553\">Jay Kang: Number one would be Obama, I think.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3c89\" name=\"3c89\">Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what I was going to say. If Obama was like, \u201cI think Bitcoin\u2019s a good idea and I\u2019m adding some to my portfolio,\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"18cb\" name=\"18cb\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I think Obama\u2019s probably number one. I don\u2019t know. Number two probably would be Warren Buffet. If Warren Buffet made a big change of heart.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"888a\" name=\"888a\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8331\" name=\"8331\">Jay Kang: There are just a lot of people who just do everything that Warren Buffet says.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5be\" name=\"f5be\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s weird, though because when I think of the modern financial guruish dudes, not guruish, but Marc Cuban types, those people have already come out as being interested in Bitcoin and are probably-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3570\" name=\"3570\">Jay Kang: Yeah, but they don\u2019t have the same following as Warren Buffet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"620f\" name=\"620f\">Aaron Lammer: Either than Warren Buffet, who is the most respected financial thinker in America? What if Alan Greenspan said he was holding Bitcoin?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"502a\" name=\"502a\">Jay Kang: I think that they would more check out Greenspan\u2019s medication.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"88b7\" name=\"88b7\">Aaron Lammer: They would be like, \u201cWho\u2019s been feeding lines?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a7c5\" name=\"a7c5\">Jay Kang: Exactly. We think that your levels of something are very off. I would be more concerned about Alan Greenspan than I would think take that very seriously. I don\u2019t know. I think the list is very short. It might just be Barack Obama and Warren Buffet. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other celebrity or famous person that would have any effect on the market at all.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"25cb\" name=\"25cb\">Aaron Lammer: Oprah?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e797\" name=\"e797\">Jay Kang: No, not Oprah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"031d\" name=\"031d\">Aaron Lammer: You don\u2019t think if Oprah started shilling Bitcoin it would move the market.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"97cd\" name=\"97cd\">Jay Kang: You know what? She does-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"406e\" name=\"406e\">Aaron Lammer: You\u2019re all, \u201cMaybe I would get in on that.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55bf\" name=\"55bf\">Jay Kang: Instead of \u2018The Secret\u2019\u00a0\u2026 Remember when she was puffing that book \u2018The Secret\u2019?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3f5f\" name=\"3f5f\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"07e1\" name=\"07e1\">Jay Kang: Instead of \u2018The Secret\u2019 she was just talking about Bitcoin like that. Instead of being make a vision board and picture the success that you have in the world and it will come true, she was just like, \u201cBuy cryptocurrency and enjoy the decentralized utopia,\u201d yeah, that would have some effect, I think.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7d4c\" name=\"7d4c\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah. I think that the next stage of Bitcoin is going to have a lot of celebrity stuff.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0ccf\" name=\"0ccf\">Jay Kang: That\u2019s the three. I don\u2019t think anyone other than those three, though. And, Oprah is a distant third there I think.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"926e\" name=\"926e\">Aaron Lammer: Lebron?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f865\" name=\"f865\">Jay Kang: No way. It would have on effect.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b395\" name=\"b395\">Aaron Lammer: Really?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed9f\" name=\"ed9f\">Jay Kang: No.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a251\" name=\"a251\">Aaron Lammer: If Lebron starts talking about crypto?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d730\" name=\"d730\">Jay Kang: Nobody trusts Lebron with financial advice or their lives. They\u2019re just like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a really good basketball player,\u201d then half the country hates him. There\u2019s nobody else who would move the needle, I don\u2019t think, in any of this.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5388\" name=\"5388\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, we\u2019ll come back to that. I have a feeling we\u2019ll think of some more possible influencers. You want to talk main course here? We\u2019ve not really gotten to talk about JP Morgan coin yet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"88c9\" name=\"88c9\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e39\" name=\"3e39\">Aaron Lammer: I thought it was going to go away and it kind of did go away, but I feel like, we\u2019re going to have to talk about it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"54ee\" name=\"54ee\">Jay Kang: Yeah, our friend Joe Weisenthal who wrote about it, he was on vacation when JPM hit. He withheld his thoughts and he wrote about it in his morning newsletter, or his section of the morning newsletter, which Bloomberg puts out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ca9\" name=\"3ca9\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like a Bloomberg market newsletter.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3a5a\" name=\"3a5a\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I read it. I actually get it every day and I\u2019m always interested in Joe\u2019s thoughts. It\u2019s short and it\u2019s cogent and I think one of Joe\u2019s talents as a writer is to crystallize something down into two interesting points that you can think about, which I think is a great talent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cb8e\" name=\"cb8e\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve generally been enjoying newsletters recently particularly as a way to get crypto news. I needed to get off Twitter and Reddit. Tony Sheng, Marty\u2019s Bent from Marty Bent, it\u2019s a good way to keep up to date. I plan most of our show based on newsletters I feel like.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b64e\" name=\"b64e\">Jay Kang: I haven\u2019t joined that yet because you can\u2019t get in newsletter fights and\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed27\" name=\"ed27\">Aaron Lammer: Oh, right. It\u2019s true. Newsletters won\u2019t fight with you, which to me is a plus, to Jay is a minus.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"141b\" name=\"141b\">Jay Kang: Huge minus.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ae73\" name=\"ae73\">Aaron Lammer: We try to come in with different takes. My take is that fighting is bad. Jay\u2019s take is that fighting is good.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a85a\" name=\"a85a\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d34d\" name=\"d34d\">Aaron Lammer: Okay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"30ea\" name=\"30ea\">Jay Kang: I would object if you don\u2019t paint me in a corner, but that is actually a very coherent and accurate assessment of our general thoughts on this.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6fcb\" name=\"6fcb\">Aaron Lammer: For what JP Morgan Coin is it\u2019s another stable coin backed to the dollar similar to Tether I guess you could say.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6d98\" name=\"6d98\">Jay Kang: Yeah. Well, yeah, it\u2019s a stable coin and JP Morgan is basically saying, \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be worth a dollar.\u201d What Joe says is, \u201cLook, this might sound silly,\u201d but he does come up with an interesting thought which is that with something like JP Morgan\u00a0\u2026 This is me quoting him now. \u201cWith something like JPM Coin, money could have rules attached to it. Parents of college-aged students could give them money that is only able to be spent on book or food at the cafeteria. A charity might specify in code that their dollars only go to a certain cause and not be used for administrative expenses. Investors in a startup could theoretically put it in dollars that only go to buy Facebook ads. It can\u2019t be used for fancy offices or the CEO\u2019s salaries.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8a1f\" name=\"8a1f\">Jay Kang: \u201cThere are ways of arranging all these things now, of course, but they require human oversight or other kludgy systems.\u201d I don\u2019t know what that word is, but it\u2019s a good word, kludgy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b88d\" name=\"b88d\">Aaron Lammer: Kludgy. Kludgy means hacky, duck-taped together.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"35b1\" name=\"35b1\">Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s a good word. Lot of countenance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a09\" name=\"5a09\">Aaron Lammer: Jerry-rigged and kludgy are synonymous.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39d3\" name=\"39d3\">Jay Kang: \u201cMoney in which the rules of how they\u2019re spent have a lot of potential in the future. It\u2019s nothing like what Bitcoin\u2019s all about, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not interesting.\u201d What do you think of that, Aaron?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fccc\" name=\"fccc\">Aaron Lammer: Well, first another thing I wanted to note in there, he says, \u201cJP Morgan\u00a0\u2026 \u201c This is a quote again, \u201cJPM makes clear only permission clients will have access to the coin.\u201d That\u2019s a big important thing to know up front, which is like, \u201cThis is for people who are like logged into the JPM system. This is not open market at all.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"56ad\" name=\"56ad\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s basically going to be like here is Aaron\u2019s allowance. No buying weed. No buying your legal weed-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0dd4\" name=\"0dd4\">Jay Kang: I feel like-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7ac7\" name=\"7ac7\">Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 teenage Aaron in the 2030s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"190b\" name=\"190b\">Jay Kang: That seems like a good argument for JPM Coin honestly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f566\" name=\"f566\">Aaron Lammer: You try and swipe my hologram eye thing and it will set off an alarm in the store and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo weed. You cannot buy weed with these JPM.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f014\" name=\"f014\">Jay Kang: Yeah, you can buy these bottles of water and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know. I tend to agree with Joe what I for you take out the implications of all of this that there is a use for it. Outside of allowance, I don\u2019t quite know what those would be. The problems that he\u2019s citing here, outside of teenage Aaron, aren\u2019t not real problems. When you give money to a charity, you have no idea how that\u2019s spent. There are all sorts of examples like the breast cancer awareness groups and stuff like that where a lot of people who have given them money come to regret it because there are journalists who go in and look at all of it and say, \u201cLook all of this money is going to things that have nothing to do with breast cancer research.\u201d If you could specify things like that then I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a bad thing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"145c\" name=\"145c\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve come to the point on this show where I feel like we can\u2019t only cover the things that we think are cool or a good thing. At a certain point, I\u2019m sort of interested in all of this stuff. When I actually think of this, this feels more realistic to me than the Ethereum amusement park. The programmable JP Morgan buck\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fbb0\" name=\"fbb0\">Aaron Lammer: Let me propose an even simpler programming, which is say I want to put five percent of my earnings into a retirement account every year and you buy some sort of a coin that automates that process or something or knows not to be taxed because it\u2019s a pre-taxed buck rather than a post-tax [crosstalk 00:47:44].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e441\" name=\"e441\">Jay Kang: Sure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a3f\" name=\"2a3f\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know, somehow the fact that you\u2019re already in a financial infrastructure, it makes that kind of a thing realistic and I could almost see it operating as a budgeting tool also that it basically manages the flow of your income and holds money for taxes, pays money for expenses, and gives you a living allowance or something. I know it\u2019s a dystopian vision, but what are people really going to do with programmable money other than program it to move around in an automated way?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b5ab\" name=\"b5ab\">Jay Kang: Why is that a dystopian vision?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55fb\" name=\"55fb\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t like someone being able to tell me I can\u2019t buy weed at the 7\u201311. It\u2019s legal, God dammit!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5699\" name=\"5699\">Jay Kang: You\u2019re entire take on this is you putting yourself in a time machine and going back to when you were 16-years-old in a world where you can buy weed and then imagining that your parents would be like, \u201cHere\u2019s your allowance. You can\u2019t spend it on this.\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cThis is dystopian.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e3f7\" name=\"e3f7\">Aaron Lammer: Jay, what if these were programmed so they were like no gambling bucks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"59ac\" name=\"59ac\">Jay Kang: Yeah, it would probably help me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"85fc\" name=\"85fc\">Aaron Lammer: You try to bring them in a casino and it\u2019s like\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93f4\" name=\"93f4\">Jay Kang: God, I wish every single one\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m being totally serious here. If I could go to my employer and say, \u201cCan you give me the money that you can\u2019t use at a casino?\u201d I would do it in a heartbeat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f340\" name=\"f340\">Aaron Lammer: This would create another level in this de-platforming financial wars that are happening now. If you to say the JP Morgan buck can\u2019t be sent to these political groups or it can\u2019t be used for these various purposes\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to be paranoid here. I actually think some of this is positive, but we\u2019re putting more and more extrajudicial rules upon how money [crosstalk 00:49:42].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"35c6\" name=\"35c6\">Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. Sure. In a world where every dollar is JP Morgan bucks, I think that they\u2019re probably a lot of privacy and potential for state control and all this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. In a world where it\u2019s just an opt-in thing, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really see that big of a problem with it. It\u2019s interesting to me. I would say that my general politics would be JP Morgan shouldn\u2019t have all this power over things and they shouldn\u2019t have power over how people spend their money.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b42f\" name=\"b42f\">Jay Kang: From a purely conceptual point, is there a use for this, not whether I like it? Yeah, there\u2019s a use for that vision that Joe\u2019s putting out there. I think that\u2019s what Joe is saying too by the way. I don\u2019t think he is saying this would be cool. I think he\u2019s just being yeah, there\u2019s something you could do with it. It\u2019s not totally vaporware.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd5c\" name=\"cd5c\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I appreciate people like Joe for taking in our same fade prevailing sentiment way. We probably should be taking the Facebook crypto project and the JP Morgan Coin seriously. I realize that they get zero respect on the internet, but Ripple gets almost zero respect and lots of things that succeed are generally doubted by the entire technology press. I don\u2019t take the fact that JP Morgan Coin is a joke as any sort of an indication that it won\u2019t work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d6b7\" name=\"d6b7\">Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s like North Carolina Tar Heel basketball team. Disrespected and put out for dead and then come back to beat Duke. Yeah, I don\u2019t know, I think that generally, you should not listen to the internet. If at all, you should just fade the internet at all points possible which means should we be buying JP Morgan Coin then?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0032\" name=\"0032\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think we have permission to.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee5b\" name=\"ee5b\">Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. Sure. I don\u2019t have a JP Morgan account \u2019cause I don\u2019t have that much money.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6a9\" name=\"b6a9\">Jay Kang: All right, let\u2019s go to the last one. I got to go pick up my kid soon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6586\" name=\"6586\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, there was an op-ed, I think it was today, in the New York Times. It was basically an economics professor in Venezuela talking about how Bitcoin had allowed him to survive more or less during the crisis in Venezuela. It goes into pretty deep detail describing in a step by step practical way basically how he has shifted his financial life into Bitcoin and, as such, been able to survive slightly better than the average person.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd13\" name=\"bd13\">Jay Kang: Can I ask you a question? I know that we try not to get into so many meta-journalism discussions on this show because our listenership doesn\u2019t care so much, but were you surprised to see this in the New York Times?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7796\" name=\"7796\">Aaron Lammer: Not really. I think that the Venezuela case for Bitcoin has been brewing for a pretty long time. There\u2019s a pretty concerted effort. It\u2019s probably the most optimistic universally good story happening in crypto right now. It\u2019s not surprising to me that this would land in the Times. Were you surprised?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bc1a\" name=\"bc1a\">Jay Kang: No, I wasn\u2019t really surprised, but if we do go and think about things from a\u00a0\u2026 Obviously, every piece that\u2019s printed in New York Times font has a conspiracy theory attached to it. I would say that some people would say that this was only published so that people get a sense of how bad economic conditions were in Venezuela, therefore, opening more public sentiment for some sort of coup there or something like that or intervention in what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s try, but then, at the same time, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s not true because editors are just people who have to fill space and they\u2019re just trying to find something interesting.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71d7\" name=\"71d7\">Jay Kang: There was a way that this thing was written that it did feel a lot more advocate like than your general op-ed. That did make me pause a little bit. I\u2019m not accusing the New York Times op-ed page of any wrongdoing or even any\u00a0\u2026 I really do think that they thought it was interesting. They published it, but I could see an argument in what you would say, the way this is written is a little bit too, hey, this is\u00a0\u2026 It felt like an ad for Bitcoin, honestly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"87b8\" name=\"87b8\">Aaron Lammer: Well, okay, I disagree with that on a few levels. One, the New York Times publishes a lot of op-eds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6003\" name=\"6003\">Jay Kang: Defend the New York Times!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2072\" name=\"2072\">Aaron Lammer: The New York Times publishes a lot of op-eds so it\u2019s not like crazy that this-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ef6\" name=\"1ef6\">Jay Kang: Yeah, sure and some of them are much more, let\u2019s say, problematic like when they publish the head of Blackwater writing an op-ed. That\u2019s [crosstalk 00:54:35].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c6c8\" name=\"c6c8\">Aaron Lammer: Sure, sure, sure. I actually don\u2019t think this is a particularly controversial op-ed insofar as I do think whether you support a U.S. intervention in Venezuela or not, I would say that Maduro has been more or less verified internationally as the villain in this story. For the New York Times to publish an op-ed that contains anti-Maduro sentiments isn\u2019t hugely surprising to me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf9f\" name=\"cf9f\">Aaron Lammer: The entire story of Bitcoin in Venezuela wouldn\u2019t be a positive story if you\u2019re pro-Maduro. Bitcoin is being used as a hedge against Maduro and basically as a way to undermine his economic rule. It shows how Bitcoin can spontaneously intervene in a situation like this and operate at a level in which\u00a0\u2026 And, he talks about how people are actually buying Bitcoin there, which is\u00a0\u2026 Have we ever talked about local Bitcoins on this show?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d19c\" name=\"d19c\">Jay Kang: No. Yeah, I think we have, but not by name. The concept of it, I think, is something we discussed quite a bit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a68\" name=\"5a68\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like a Craigslist X website that pairs buyers with sellers to either make in-person, or if you direct bag transfer, Bitcoin transactions. The author\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019ve heard of a lot of people buying Bitcoin in coffee shops and so forth in Venezuela from just private dealers, but he\u2019s doing it through bank transfers. He says that under a $50 transfer doesn\u2019t get flagged by the administration. He sends it to someone and they send back Bitcoin. He was able to get his brother smuggled out to Columbia and secure some of his savings by buying Bitcoin in that way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6df\" name=\"b6df\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s an incredible confluence of modern trust technologies that you can basically have someone in a place that has rapidly inflating money doing anonymous Bitcoin transactions on the fly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a55\" name=\"4a55\">Jay Kang: Yeah, the way that it was framed in the piece I thought was very good, which was just like, \u201cHey, let me tell you what it\u2019s like to buy a carton of milk in Venezuela right now. You can work all you want, but\u00a0\u2026 \u201c I think his dad works some job and he gets paid basically $6 a month. Obviously, the problems with trying to buy food in Venezuela have been very well documented. He tells you how he does it and how it\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s possible and that this is the only safeguard he has against the idea that all of his labor and his family\u2019s wealth, which is not that much, but his family\u2019s small amount of savings won\u2019t be evaporated by political instability or political things that happen with Maduro and the economy in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fbeb\" name=\"fbeb\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. The thing that I find interesting and this is that, for me, that this is by far the most compelling case for Bitcoin. It\u2019s interesting to see the generational gap, I think, when I was trying to figure out who was talking about this article. People who are a little bit smarter, I think, and a little bit more worldly who really did think that this article was important and then the more into crypto or inside crypto people who more or less ignored it and continued to scream about whatever their [inaudible 00:58:10].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe66\" name=\"fe66\">Aaron Lammer: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s totally fair. I think part of the way this story\u00a0\u2026 If you\u2019re asking how it ended up at the New York Times, I saw Anthony P show last week had on a Venezuelan person. The crypto media has been pretty heavily promoting the voices of Venezuelans who are using Bitcoin to control their financial lives. I think that story gets told a million times then it flows to various news outlets and then eventually it\u2019s in the New York Times. It\u2019s like a conservative route to-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a1f4\" name=\"a1f4\">Jay Kang: That\u2019s fair. Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9562\" name=\"9562\">Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 push the story. What\u2019s interesting to me going forward with this story is we\u2019ve seen that it basically works. There\u2019s enough volume that you\u2019re able to see on the local Bitcoin volume a huge amount of Bitcoin flowing to Venezuela. After Venezuela happens and there\u2019s going to be more of these kinds of incidents because states fail all the time in the world, will Venezuela ever go back to a Bolivar-style system or will Bitcoin eventually become the defacto currency of Venezuela and will these countries that use Bitcoin for stability end up just using them for their economy in the future?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"74fb\" name=\"74fb\">Jay Kang: I think there\u2019s zero chance that they switch to Bitcoin as their currency. It\u2019s not just Venezuela obviously that\u2019s interested in this. There are a lot of much more powerful countries including our own that have a lot of incentive to not make that happen. I think that they will apply any sort of military or political pressure possible to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e62a\" name=\"e62a\">Aaron Lammer: Maybe going Bitcoin economy will be the new going Marxist for our country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a4e\" name=\"2a4e\">Jay Kang: The new Cold War between companies on the-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d70\" name=\"2d70\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, it will be [crosstalk 01:00:09] maximalism. If we let maximalism spread to Columbia, we\u2019re going to lose all of Central America.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7ae1\" name=\"7ae1\">Jay Kang: Yeah, [inaudible 01:00:18] is the new-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"de5c\" name=\"de5c\">Aaron Lammer: Becomes the new Cheng.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d5a\" name=\"9d5a\">Jay Kang: He becomes a freedom fighter.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1168\" name=\"1168\">Aaron Lammer: Again, I would see that movie.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a754\" name=\"a754\">Jay Kang: I would see that movie, but I would not want to live in that country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"04dd\" name=\"04dd\">Aaron Lammer: All right, well, good talking. I have a feeling we\u2019ll probably be talking about the Venezuela stuff again because it seems like it\u2019s a story that\u2019s only growing.</p></div></div></section></div></main></div><section

I went down a bit of a rabbit hole of reading everything on Reddit about this, made an extremely elaborate document with a timeline. Somehow I was like, \u201cMaybe I should talk about this on Coin Talk.\u201d But, I was like, \u201cBut, the images are important and these documents that I\u2019ve compiled.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll make a video where I explain all my thoughts about it.\u201d I bought the green screen for that. Then, when it came, I had a flash of clarity and I imagined myself on YouTube, spinning conspiracy theories and I was like, \u201cOh, man. This is the first step down a super dark corridor of your life.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6c3e\\\" id=\\\"6c3e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: You\u2019ve created basically audio/visual Reddit, which I actually think might be a good idea, but also probably is 90% of YouTube at this point.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4f2b\\\" id=\\\"4f2b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Well, I just thought it was funny how so much news is breaking about YouTube\u2019s role in spreading conspiracy theory.

Well, let\u2019s let the people weigh in. If you\u2019re listening and you\u2019d like an AV episode of Coin Talk and would you like to see what Jay and actually look like, Jay who has never taken two weeks off of working out ever, what we actually look like-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"464d\\\" id=\\\"464d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: No, I just never actually worked out enough where that two weeks would be cheating.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1be5\\\" id=\\\"1be5\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Oh, okay. Okay. You were taking the under not the over. I gotcha.

I feel like this is the first year I was hearing a lot of action on the Oscars.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f540\\\" id=\\\"f540\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s not a mistake by the way. I think it was because the New Jersey sportsbooks opened up and that a lot of people could bet on the Oscars on an app for the first time because you could do it on a FanDuel app or whatever New Jersey betting app. I think that that plus the fact that there\u2019s a lot more places where you can get gambling content because everybody is prepping for the day in which anybody in the United States can bet on sports. I think that\u2019s why there is so much talk about that.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d936\\\" id=\\\"d936\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Did you hear in last week\u2019s episode when I talked to Ledger about Hero and how much FOMO did you experience while listening to it?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3bd4\\\" id=\\\"3bd4\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: It was too complicated for me.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"80cd\\\" id=\\\"80cd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Yeah, yeah, I was like-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"93b1\\\" id=\\\"93b1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: It\u2019s just like that\u2019s way too complicated. I think I would rather just play video games.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1509\\\" id=\\\"1509\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: While I was talking to him about it, I was like, \u201cJay is just laying a bed on division two for beer league at this point.\u201d Too much work for him. It is interesting how as this stuff becomes more legal, all these things like how the movement of the lines, it becomes a lot more real. Previously, you\u2019d hear about odds on something like the Oscars and it was like, \u201cOh, yeah. This is 40:1.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cIs it really or is that just what it was listed as in some sort of blog post?\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0775\\\" id=\\\"0775\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: You mean is the actual bet the thing that people are reporting when they are talking about it?

What\u2019s the guy who directed \u2018Dogtooth\u2019? He\u2019s Greek, I believe.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"029b\\\" id=\\\"029b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yorgos something.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4600\\\" id=\\\"4600\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Yeah.

He started off as super long odds, and then-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"08ca\\\" id=\\\"08ca\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, I think he was 40:1 or something, maybe 250:1, something crazy like that.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ddcd\\\" id=\\\"ddcd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Looking at it, me and you as filmgoers, he\u2019s a pretty long shot I\u2019d say there. You\u2019ve got several people who seem like they\u2019re much, much better picks, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, I think Spike Lee was in the mix. At some point, the odds started getting much and much better for him to win. Up to the point where I think it peaked at 15:1 or 10:1 and then they just froze betting on it.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f96d\\\" id=\\\"f96d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: I think it got to 5:2 almost.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"e013\\\" id=\\\"e013\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Five, okay.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8f3a\\\" id=\\\"8f3a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: It was insane. It was the biggest swing. It would be like if the Warriors were playing Bowdoin College or something like that where I went to school, and so the odds are like 7000:1. Then, Bowdoin College announces that Kevin Durant and Giannis and all\u00a0\u2026 Basically, the Monstars from \u2018Space Jam\u2019 are all going to be paying in the game. That was the type of odds swing it was. It\u2019s not something that can be explained away by any natural betting pattern. It has to be that a bunch of money that thinks it\u2019s sharp money comes in and completely influences a line. Usually, when that happens, a line only moves a couple spots.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8588\\\" id=\\\"8588\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Yeah, I think I heard your old boss, Bill Simmons, once say that Brady playing or not playing would be like the biggest swing possible in a football game and even that would only be seven points.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5b23\\\" id=\\\"5b23\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Basically, they were trotting out the cheerleaders and the equipment staff to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

What I initially thought was, \u201cHoly shit! He\u2019s going to win. Someone knows and that\u2019s a pretty crazy upset. There\u2019s going to be a major scandal and it\u2019s going to end betting on the Academy Awards because it\u2019s too soft. It\u2019s too easy to know.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8a67\\\" id=\\\"8a67\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s was I thought, but I guess I had a few thoughts. The first was that even if the lines were affected not by the number of bets really but by the amount of money that is bet on it. If you have two other bets for $20 and then you have one bet for $50,000, the $50,000 bet is going to move the line.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"4e49\\\" id=\\\"4e49\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Wait a minute. May I pause you briefly and ask a question? \u2019Cause I think this pertains actually to crypto. When you say that it\u2019s volume not the number of people that moves the line, is there data broken out? When all that action that was on Argo-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0f62\\\" id=\\\"0f62\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It tells you.

Could that potentially be one mega whale coming in?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ef84\\\" id=\\\"ef84\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: No, that\u2019s the problem, right? Which is that on the book that I use, allegedly, I guess I should say\u00a0\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s legal, but let\u2019s say the book that I sometimes use for an online sportsbook, the most money I could put into one bet was $430. That was for best picture. It wasn\u2019t for best director, which I imagine was lower. There\u2019s no way that any of these companies are going to let you bet $10,000 on these, on best director.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f031\\\" id=\\\"f031\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: I just think well, there\u2019s no way this is a mega whale because the bet caps are so low. It has to be a flood of hundreds of people betting this thing in a short period of time, which is why then it\u2019s taken off the books because essentially these New Jersey\u00a0\u2026 I think it was the FanDuel app that ended up taking it off the books first. They must have just gotten a flood of action on him and they didn\u2019t know what was up so they took him off the books.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fb2a\\\" id=\\\"fb2a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: If I\u2019m in Macau, I\u2019m a high-rolling poker player turned Bitcoin whale and I want to put down a million bucks on \u2018Green Book\u2019, I can\u2019t make that bet?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9ba7\\\" id=\\\"9ba7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: I don\u2019t think so. I think you could make a lot of $10,000 bets, but probably not enough to add up to a million dollars. Actually, that would be insane. You would have to find 100 bet takers to get to a million. Yeah, I can\u2019t see that that was possible. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. That\u2019s way out of my price range in general.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5f71\\\" id=\\\"5f71\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s a private broker on the private market who will try to pair you with some super secret Triad book, but-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6340\\\" id=\\\"6340\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Sure, but that wouldn\u2019t move the line at the New Jersey sportsbook.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6606\\\" id=\\\"6606\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Not only would that move the line, it\u2019s crazy for an event that is as big as the Oscars. This is one of the world\u2019s biggest nights behind, let\u2019s say, the Super Bowl and a few sporting events. Considering how far into gambling legalization we are, it\u2019s crazy how little liquidity there is in a lot of these markets.

It was allegedly a guy at Penn State who\u2019s in a fraternity who said that his dad was in the Academy and that his dad had told him that Yorgos was going to win. He posted it somewhere where a bunch of people saw it and then all the money started coming in.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"331d\\\" id=\\\"331d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Basically, a Tron getting listed to Coinbase rumor kind of thing.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"20e9\\\" id=\\\"20e9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, but there was one other level where it was the\u00a0\u2026 Have you seen the frat aliens episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9940\\\" id=\\\"9940\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: I have.

It\u2019s hilarious. I do think that it probably makes these sportsbooks uncomfortable, though. Because there are all sorts of pain points that would make this harder to do when there aren\u2019t tens of thousands of people on an app where they can just get to the bet really quickly like before. For example, if you actually have to go to the sportsbook to put down a bet, you\u2019re probably going to do that a lot less than just pull out your phone.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f7b6\\\" id=\\\"f7b6\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: If you have to sign up for a semi-legal sports betting site, that\u2019s only a certain type of person who does that. In a world where every sucker has this app or every sucker is into sports has this app, then the possibilities for misinformation go up pretty high. I imagine at every sportsbook right now there\u2019s probably a lot of talk about how they can avoid this happening again.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1053\\\" id=\\\"1053\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Well, what it makes me think is that the age of the open sportsbook and the age of the Reddit rumor/hoax is going to be pretty wild.

I think they were talking about\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s two things. The first is that you have to give much more statements now than you ever had to and they\u2019re disseminated.

The nice thing about our current landscape in media and relative to truth is that you can just go the other way. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself.

I feel like our initial take on Coinbase circa episode one was probably right, which is it\u2019s always going to be better for Coinbase than that anything other than Bitcoin wins. Anything Coinbase can do to at least balance the seesaw of the entire bundle other than Bitcoin versus Bitcoin, they\u2019re going to do.

I think you understand the Ripple stand better than I do, but the thing that I don\u2019t quite understand is why is it dirty for Coinbase to introduce this extremely well-known and extremely centralized, but still much, much-discussed cryptocurrency?

At this point, why not just add Ripple?

I wonder if they might have wanted to do Ripple before and had been waiting on some sort of a nod from the authorities that Ripple was not going to be trouble if they added it. Yeah, I think that if what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019re already a sellout, why not really sell out. Yeah, I think that\u2019s accurate.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"43dd\\\" id=\\\"43dd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: My question is why they felt they had to get in this business? I guess you could say that they\u2019re just giving the customer what they want, that they\u2019re probably getting a gazillion emails that are like, \u201cI want to buy Ripple at Coinbase.\u201d Who are they to not sell it? On the other hand, in terms of the Bitcoin narrative to have a company that was at one point, I feel like, the most powerful company in Bitcoin so clearly just bagging on Bitcoin, it kind of sucks.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c108\\\" id=\\\"c108\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Well, I think this is an example of the gap in context between how much people on Twitter hate Ripple and how much the Twitter Ripple fans are psychotic, and the reality of their business, which is that if you ignore all that then what Coinbase still a large part of their business is through transaction fees on buys and sells, right?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5443\\\" id=\\\"5443\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Yep.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"0f54\\\" id=\\\"0f54\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Why would they not try and offer every single cryptocurrency that is bought and sold a lot? I would say that Ripple is probably still bought and sold quite a bit. If they can tune out the screaming hoards on both sides, then for them, it\u2019s a pretty clear business decision. I don\u2019t know. Again, as we said, their purity is gone. It\u2019s been gone. I would say that the final blow to it was the way that they introduced Bitcoin Cash. That\u2019s when we started to think of them as a purely capitalistic\u00a0\u2026 Capitalistic is not the right word, but their much-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"71eb\\\" id=\\\"71eb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Opportunistic.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2df0\\\" id=\\\"2df0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, they\u2019re much more opportunistic\u00a0\u2026 They were much less interested in the theory and philosophy of decentralization than we had thought.

I\u2019m not mad about it. I have not placed a lot of faith in Coinbase other than the fact that I use them as a business. Here\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a bad business decision, though. I feel like Coinbase and Ripple, the company, not the currency, are on some deep, deep level competitors. I know that sounds crazy, but remember when we didn\u2019t think of Apple and Google and Facebook as competitors. We\u2019re like, \u201cOh, they\u2019re all completely in their own lane.\u201d Then, once they get big enough, everything is competitive.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c1bb\\\" id=\\\"c1bb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Ripple is a company. It\u2019s a startup. It\u2019s a for-profit startup that has a shit ton of money for not doing very much. I think that ultimately the ambitions of that company are going to run contrary to Coinbase\u2019s. I think they\u2019re both going to try to become IPOed, biggest crypto companies in the world, taking different paths. That\u2019s not really a risk you run with Bitcoin or even to a lesser extent, Ethereum in so far as Ethereum is designed more as a nonprofit foundation.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9386\\\" id=\\\"9386\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, but at that point-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f1fa\\\" id=\\\"f1fa\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: I just think it\u2019s a little like when Apple allows Amazon Prime videos on Apple TV.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"a566\\\" id=\\\"a566\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I was thinking about that as an example, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite the same way because what you\u2019re trying to do is you\u2019re trying to monopolize the on-ramp space if you\u2019re Coinbase, right? If Ripple, if they can establish enough with the Ripple community that the best way to buy and sell XRP is through Coinbase, then Ripple, as the company, has a harder time trying to dissuade people from using the easy on-ramp that they are used to. Does that make sense? You then have to deal with a paid in point where people now have to go to\u00a0\u2026\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"910d\\\" id=\\\"910d\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: It\u2019s like Spotify with podcasts right now. They bought Gimlet for $230 million and the question that\u2019s out there is, okay, now if all of Gimlet\u2019s podcasts are on Spotify instead of the Apple podcast app, are people still going to listen to them or is it just like, \u201cIt\u2019s another click and I don\u2019t feel like doing that.\u201d Those are real questions I think that\u00a0\u2026 I think that Coinbase by getting all this information and all this on-ramp stuff for Ripple is probably in a good position there. I don\u2019t quite see what the problem would be there for them.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2afe\\\" id=\\\"2afe\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: I like your Spotify metaphor because the way I read that acquisition is basically as I understand it, Spotify has a ton of paying customers. They\u2019ve signed up 10 million people. They\u2019re doing well in terms of converting people, but based on the cost basis of streaming music, they operate at a loss by streaming music because of the amount of money they have to pay out to artists for that streaming. I know artists feel like Spotify gives them pennies on the dollar of what they should get and I\u2019m sympathetic to that, but even so, Spotify is actually not a good growth business model for streaming music.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"b83a\\\" id=\\\"b83a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: However, if they own a bunch of podcasts, which are a fixed one-time cost, and that\u2019s what people were doing on Spotify and they were converting new users who were basically just there to listen to those podcasts, it\u2019s a much better business to be in. That\u2019s more or less where I feel like Coinbase has ended up. They\u2019re just not satisfied with the Bitcoin business.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d04a\\\" id=\\\"d04a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, and they\u2019re also future-proofing themselves in case Ripple does become the dominant company and-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"39b7\\\" id=\\\"39b7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: I think it\u2019s a bad call.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"55ec\\\" id=\\\"55ec\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: What do you mean?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"36fc\\\" id=\\\"36fc\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: I just think that-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1c42\\\" id=\\\"1c42\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Wait, it doesn\u2019t really-\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"14c2\\\" id=\\\"14c2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 Ripple becomes as big as Bitcoin, there\u2019s going to be no role for Coinbase anyway.

First, don\u2019t do it. Nothing on this show is investment advice. That\u2019s a terrible idea. No, I demand to do it. I\u2019m a cranky man. I\u2019ve always had Libertarian sympathies. I want to get my money out of the banks and into crypto. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. Well, what do you want to buy?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I want to buy one of the ones that Coinbase has because obviously, that\u2019s all I know, the only method I had for buying it.

Remember that?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"595b\\\" id=\\\"595b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"dac2\\\" id=\\\"dac2\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: They still have yet. That\u2019s spreading out all of the risk and upside completely equally so you\u2019re keeping everyone from getting too big.

Did you hear about this thing about Gladius, this ICO which basically reported itself to the FTC?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"5f0b\\\" id=\\\"5f0b\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: No. No, they self-owned?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"90a3\\\" id=\\\"90a3\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Yeah. There\u2019s not that much more to the story. Basically, the FTC was like, \u201cYes, you are in the wrong. If you return all the money to investors you won\u2019t face criminal charges or fines.\u201d So, they just returned all the money. This might be the new ICO model is to go right up to the lip and be like, \u201cDo we really want to face jail time?\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"737e\\\" id=\\\"737e\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, but also maybe it\u2019s a business strategy where you snitch on yourself and therefore when you start your next project you can be like, \u201cListen, we\u2019re totally above board now. We\u2019re the ones that snitched on yourself.\u201d Plus, you get a bunch of free press for an obscure coin like Gladius, which I had no idea what it was and I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t either until this happened.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"d7f7\\\" id=\\\"d7f7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Still don\u2019t.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bdb7\\\" id=\\\"bdb7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Now, we\u2019re discussing it.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"50c8\\\" id=\\\"50c8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Still don\u2019t.

A good way to do that would be to just build the company heavily before you snitch on yourself, like do a lot of consulting services, drain a lot of the money out, and then snitch on yourself, return the money to investors, but you don\u2019t return money that\u2019s already been spent.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"f857\\\" id=\\\"f857\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Self-snitching is generally a good idea, I think. Amy Klobuchar, the woman who\u2019s running for president from Minnesota. She has all those stories about how she was an abusive boss and would throw binders at people, I feel like she should have just self-snitched on all of that when the story started coming out. She should have just been, \u201cI did all of this and it\u2019s because I\u2019m tough and I\u2019m the person who can take on Donald Trump.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3804\\\" id=\\\"3804\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: Now, in general, I actually think that it probably is helping her that all these stories are coming out \u2019cause everybody\u2019s discussing her and also most people don\u2019t care if you abuse a 23-year-old aid.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"9749\\\" id=\\\"9749\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: Whoa, Jay.

Well, yeah, it\u2019s a stable coin and JP Morgan is basically saying, \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be worth a dollar.\u201d What Joe says is, \u201cLook, this might sound silly,\u201d but he does come up with an interesting thought which is that with something like JP Morgan\u00a0\u2026 This is me quoting him now. \u201cWith something like JPM Coin, money could have rules attached to it. Parents of college-aged students could give them money that is only able to be spent on book or food at the cafeteria.

We probably should be taking the Facebook crypto project and the JP Morgan Coin seriously.

I would say that some people would say that this was only published so that people get a sense of how bad economic conditions were in Venezuela, therefore, opening more public sentiment for some sort of coup there or something like that or intervention in what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s try, but then, at the same time, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s not true because editors are just people who have to fill space and they\u2019re just trying to find something interesting.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"71d7\\\" id=\\\"71d7\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: There was a way that this thing was written that it did feel a lot more advocate like than your general op-ed.

I actually don\u2019t think this is a particularly controversial op-ed insofar as I do think whether you support a U.S. intervention in Venezuela or not, I would say that Maduro has been more or less verified internationally as the villain in this story. For the New York Times to publish an op-ed that contains anti-Maduro sentiments isn\u2019t hugely surprising to me.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"cf9f\\\" id=\\\"cf9f\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAaron Lammer: The entire story of Bitcoin in Venezuela wouldn\u2019t be a positive story if you\u2019re pro-Maduro.

What\u2019s interesting to me going forward with this story is we\u2019ve seen that it basically works. There\u2019s enough volume that you\u2019re able to see on the local Bitcoin volume a huge amount of Bitcoin flowing to Venezuela. After Venezuela happens and there\u2019s going to be more of these kinds of incidents because states fail all the time in the world, will Venezuela ever go back to a Bolivar-style system or will Bitcoin eventually become the defacto currency of Venezuela and will these countries that use Bitcoin for stability end up just using them for their economy in the future?\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"74fb\\\" id=\\\"74fb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eJay Kang: I think there\u2019s zero chance that they switch to Bitcoin as their currency.

I think I\u2019m out of practice. I take one week off\u00a0\u2026 You know when you go, when you\u2019ve been working out and then you take a couple weeks off-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0993\" name=\"0993\">Jay Kang: No. Never had that. It seemed like you had become a YouTube blogger or something like that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e835\" name=\"e835\">Aaron Lammer: Well, I will say I was hoping that you would come by for this taping \u2019cause I did buy a green screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d0db\" name=\"d0db\">Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. You have been talking about this green screen. How big is a green screen?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4038\" name=\"4038\">Aaron Lammer: This is a pretty big green screen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2019\" name=\"2019\">Jay Kang: I know they roll up, but\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c45c\" name=\"c45c\">Aaron Lammer: This one rolls up. I\u2019d say it\u2019s eight feet across.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a736\" name=\"a736\">Jay Kang: Oh, wow. Wow. We could take Coin Talk to the next level, then we could\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bf50\" name=\"bf50\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m going to confess something here. It\u2019s not a flattering confession, but I\u2019ll tell you about why I ordered this green screen in the first place. After we taped our episode where we briefly touched on Quadriga\u00a0\u2026 Do you remember the Quadriga, the founder died lost $190 million?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2672\" name=\"2672\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"74fe\" name=\"74fe\">Aaron Lammer: Okay. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole of reading everything on Reddit about this, made an extremely elaborate document with a timeline. Somehow I was like, \u201cMaybe I should talk about this on Coin Talk.\u201d But, I was like, \u201cBut, the images are important and these documents that I\u2019ve compiled.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll make a video where I explain all my thoughts about it.\u201d I bought the green screen for that. Then, when it came, I had a flash of clarity and I imagined myself on YouTube, spinning conspiracy theories and I was like, \u201cOh, man. This is the first step down a super dark corridor of your life.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6c3e\" name=\"6c3e\">Jay Kang: You\u2019ve created basically audio/visual Reddit, which I actually think might be a good idea, but also probably is 90% of YouTube at this point.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4f2b\" name=\"4f2b\">Aaron Lammer: Well, I just thought it was funny how so much news is breaking about YouTube\u2019s role in spreading conspiracy theory. I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve got a conspiracy theory. I know just where to take it. All I need is this eight-foot-long green screen.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0efa\" name=\"0efa\">Jay Kang: Yeah, then I\u2019ll record in my actual basement surrounded by antiquated audio equipment. I think that your channel would be pretty good though, Aaron.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5eff\" name=\"5eff\">Aaron Lammer: Okay. Well, let\u2019s let the people weigh in. If you\u2019re listening and you\u2019d like an AV episode of Coin Talk and would you like to see what Jay and actually look like, Jay who has never taken two weeks off of working out ever, what we actually look like-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"464d\" name=\"464d\">Jay Kang: No, I just never actually worked out enough where that two weeks would be cheating.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1be5\" name=\"1be5\">Aaron Lammer: Oh, okay. Okay. You were taking the under not the over. I gotcha. I gotcha.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c891\" name=\"c891\">Jay Kang: I wasn\u2019t like, \u201cAaron, what are you talking about?\u201d I\u2019m almost the fattest I\u2019ve ever been.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3fb0\" name=\"3fb0\">Aaron Lammer: Wait, speaking of the over and under, before we get into it, I feel like occasionally I want a little sidebar gambler, Jay, like non-crypto gambler Jay. I feel like this is the first year I was hearing a lot of action on the Oscars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f540\" name=\"f540\">Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s not a mistake by the way. I think it was because the New Jersey sportsbooks opened up and that a lot of people could bet on the Oscars on an app for the first time because you could do it on a FanDuel app or whatever New Jersey betting app. I think that that plus the fact that there\u2019s a lot more places where you can get gambling content because everybody is prepping for the day in which anybody in the United States can bet on sports. I think that\u2019s why there is so much talk about that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d936\" name=\"d936\">Aaron Lammer: Did you hear in last week\u2019s episode when I talked to Ledger about Hero and how much FOMO did you experience while listening to it?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3bd4\" name=\"3bd4\">Jay Kang: It was too complicated for me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80cd\" name=\"80cd\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, yeah, I was like-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93b1\" name=\"93b1\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s just like that\u2019s way too complicated. I think I would rather just play video games.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1509\" name=\"1509\">Aaron Lammer: While I was talking to him about it, I was like, \u201cJay is just laying a bed on division two for beer league at this point.\u201d Too much work for him. It is interesting how as this stuff becomes more legal, all these things like how the movement of the lines, it becomes a lot more real. Previously, you\u2019d hear about odds on something like the Oscars and it was like, \u201cOh, yeah. This is 40:1.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cIs it really or is that just what it was listed as in some sort of blog post?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0775\" name=\"0775\">Jay Kang: You mean is the actual bet the thing that people are reporting when they are talking about it? Is that what you\u2019re asking?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5250\" name=\"5250\">Aaron Lammer: As I understand it, this year in the Oscar betting, a bunch of these lines moved a bunch after they opened, particularly, and I\u2019m interested in your take on this as an expert in these fields, I think it was the best director race. What\u2019s the guy who directed \u2018Dogtooth\u2019? He\u2019s Greek, I believe.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"029b\" name=\"029b\">Jay Kang: Yorgos something.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4600\" name=\"4600\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah. Yorgos.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ff2f\" name=\"ff2f\">Jay Kang: Yeah, he does a lot of stuff. He did \u2018The Favorite\u2019 this time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"513c\" name=\"513c\">Aaron Lammer: \u2018The Favorite\u2019, yeah. He started off as super long odds, and then-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"08ca\" name=\"08ca\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I think he was 40:1 or something, maybe 250:1, something crazy like that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ddcd\" name=\"ddcd\">Aaron Lammer: Looking at it, me and you as filmgoers, he\u2019s a pretty long shot I\u2019d say there. You\u2019ve got several people who seem like they\u2019re much, much better picks, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, I think Spike Lee was in the mix. At some point, the odds started getting much and much better for him to win. Up to the point where I think it peaked at 15:1 or 10:1 and then they just froze betting on it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f96d\" name=\"f96d\">Jay Kang: I think it got to 5:2 almost.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e013\" name=\"e013\">Aaron Lammer: Five, okay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8f3a\" name=\"8f3a\">Jay Kang: It was insane. It was the biggest swing. It would be like if the Warriors were playing Bowdoin College or something like that where I went to school, and so the odds are like 7000:1. Then, Bowdoin College announces that Kevin Durant and Giannis and all\u00a0\u2026 Basically, the Monstars from \u2018Space Jam\u2019 are all going to be paying in the game. That was the type of odds swing it was. It\u2019s not something that can be explained away by any natural betting pattern. It has to be that a bunch of money that thinks it\u2019s sharp money comes in and completely influences a line. Usually, when that happens, a line only moves a couple spots.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8588\" name=\"8588\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I think I heard your old boss, Bill Simmons, once say that Brady playing or not playing would be like the biggest swing possible in a football game and even that would only be seven points.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5b23\" name=\"5b23\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is basically if everyone on the Patriots ended up being arrested in some sort of sex slavery type of thing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f2d8\" name=\"f2d8\">Aaron Lammer: Murdered their close friend in a parking lot kind of situation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"79f0\" name=\"79f0\">Jay Kang: Yeah, exactly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b9a8\" name=\"b9a8\">Aaron Lammer: Purely hypothetical.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93af\" name=\"93af\">Jay Kang: And, have all been arrested and couldn\u2019t play in the game. Basically, they were trotting out the cheerleaders and the equipment staff to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers. That\u2019s what this type of swing of odds would be.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4bd7\" name=\"4bd7\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, when you heard about this swing, what did you make of it? What I initially thought was, \u201cHoly shit! He\u2019s going to win. Someone knows and that\u2019s a pretty crazy upset. There\u2019s going to be a major scandal and it\u2019s going to end betting on the Academy Awards because it\u2019s too soft. It\u2019s too easy to know.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8a67\" name=\"8a67\">Jay Kang: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s was I thought, but I guess I had a few thoughts. The first was that even if the lines were affected not by the number of bets really but by the amount of money that is bet on it. If you have two other bets for $20 and then you have one bet for $50,000, the $50,000 bet is going to move the line.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4e49\" name=\"4e49\">Aaron Lammer: Wait a minute. May I pause you briefly and ask a question? \u2019Cause I think this pertains actually to crypto. When you say that it\u2019s volume not the number of people that moves the line, is there data broken out? When all that action that was on Argo-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0f62\" name=\"0f62\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It tells you. Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9cb7\" name=\"9cb7\">Aaron Lammer: Do we know how many people that was spread around? Could that potentially be one mega whale coming in?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ef84\" name=\"ef84\">Jay Kang: No, that\u2019s the problem, right? Which is that on the book that I use, allegedly, I guess I should say\u00a0\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s legal, but let\u2019s say the book that I sometimes use for an online sportsbook, the most money I could put into one bet was $430. That was for best picture. It wasn\u2019t for best director, which I imagine was lower. There\u2019s no way that any of these companies are going to let you bet $10,000 on these, on best director.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f031\" name=\"f031\">Jay Kang: I just think well, there\u2019s no way this is a mega whale because the bet caps are so low. It has to be a flood of hundreds of people betting this thing in a short period of time, which is why then it\u2019s taken off the books because essentially these New Jersey\u00a0\u2026 I think it was the FanDuel app that ended up taking it off the books first. They must have just gotten a flood of action on him and they didn\u2019t know what was up so they took him off the books.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fb2a\" name=\"fb2a\">Aaron Lammer: If I\u2019m in Macau, I\u2019m a high-rolling poker player turned Bitcoin whale and I want to put down a million bucks on \u2018Green Book\u2019, I can\u2019t make that bet?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9ba7\" name=\"9ba7\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think so. I think you could make a lot of $10,000 bets, but probably not enough to add up to a million dollars. Actually, that would be insane. You would have to find 100 bet takers to get to a million. Yeah, I can\u2019t see that that was possible. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. That\u2019s way out of my price range in general.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f71\" name=\"5f71\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s a private broker on the private market who will try to pair you with some super secret Triad book, but-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6340\" name=\"6340\">Jay Kang: Sure, but that wouldn\u2019t move the line at the New Jersey sportsbook.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6606\" name=\"6606\">Aaron Lammer: Not only would that move the line, it\u2019s crazy for an event that is as big as the Oscars. This is one of the world\u2019s biggest nights behind, let\u2019s say, the Super Bowl and a few sporting events. Considering how far into gambling legalization we are, it\u2019s crazy how little liquidity there is in a lot of these markets. Much like there\u2019s zero liquidity in Augur right now.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee6e\" name=\"ee6e\">Jay Kang: I\u2019m glad that you brought that full circle and not just talking about gambling.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5e50\" name=\"5e50\">Aaron Lammer: Well wait, we didn\u2019t finish the story. Cuar\u00f3n won and he was wrong. What do you think happened? Where was all that money coming from?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6854\" name=\"6854\">Jay Kang: Well, the story came out. It was allegedly a guy at Penn State who\u2019s in a fraternity who said that his dad was in the Academy and that his dad had told him that Yorgos was going to win. He posted it somewhere where a bunch of people saw it and then all the money started coming in.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"331d\" name=\"331d\">Aaron Lammer: Basically, a Tron getting listed to Coinbase rumor kind of thing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"20e9\" name=\"20e9\">Jay Kang: Yeah, but there was one other level where it was the\u00a0\u2026 Have you seen the frat aliens episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9940\" name=\"9940\">Aaron Lammer: I have. I have.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f602\" name=\"f602\">Jay Kang: Where the guy keeps going, \u201cMy dad owns a dealership.\u201d It\u2019s like that, but it\u2019s like, \u201cMy dad is in the Academy and he\u2019s saying it\u2019s Yorgos.\u201d Then, suddenly, thousands and thousands of dollars are coming in on Yorgos. It\u2019s hilarious. I do think that it probably makes these sportsbooks uncomfortable, though. Because there are all sorts of pain points that would make this harder to do when there aren\u2019t tens of thousands of people on an app where they can just get to the bet really quickly like before. For example, if you actually have to go to the sportsbook to put down a bet, you\u2019re probably going to do that a lot less than just pull out your phone.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f7b6\" name=\"f7b6\">Jay Kang: If you have to sign up for a semi-legal sports betting site, that\u2019s only a certain type of person who does that. In a world where every sucker has this app or every sucker is into sports has this app, then the possibilities for misinformation go up pretty high. I imagine at every sportsbook right now there\u2019s probably a lot of talk about how they can avoid this happening again.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1053\" name=\"1053\">Aaron Lammer: Well, what it makes me think is that the age of the open sportsbook and the age of the Reddit rumor/hoax is going to be pretty wild. This is just one frat guy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"748d\" name=\"748d\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s going to be amazing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"16e8\" name=\"16e8\">Aaron Lammer: What is that website called? Total Frat Move. Remember that website?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"de0a\" name=\"de0a\">Jay Kang: That was a total frat move.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2b22\" name=\"2b22\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve manipulated the Oscar\u2019s market. Total frat move.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eccd\" name=\"eccd\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s a really good troll, honestly. I find it all funny. I only put that one bet for the Oscars.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"610a\" name=\"610a\">Aaron Lammer: What did you bet?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ec47\" name=\"ec47\">Jay Kang: I bet \u2018Green Book\u2019 best picture.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4eb8\" name=\"4eb8\">Aaron Lammer: Well done.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bfa9\" name=\"bfa9\">Jay Kang: Thank you, thank you.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"047d\" name=\"047d\">Aaron Lammer: You are, in the same way that in Augur we generally try to fade Libertarianism, you were fading woke internet takes?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"769e\" name=\"769e\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s exactly what my thought process was.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c6f4\" name=\"c6f4\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019d like to think that on the show if we can\u2019t share in the crypto moderate movement, we can at least share the babe-like, cheap blonde post sentiment wherever you can be it in the entertainment media or the crypto media.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"18ac\" name=\"18ac\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think that the criticisms for the \u2018Green Book\u2019 are cheap or unwarranted.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eb31\" name=\"eb31\">Aaron Lammer: Oh, no, no, but the idea that it won\u2019t wind because of this-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1713\" name=\"1713\">Jay Kang: Yeah, that\u2019s the thing that I don\u2019t get.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"50e6\" name=\"50e6\">Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. When we fade Libertarianism it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t believe in Libertarianism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e90\" name=\"7e90\">Jay Kang: Yeah, we don\u2019t also believe in Libertarianism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"242a\" name=\"242a\">Aaron Lammer: But, wearing our betting hats, it\u2019s just a good bet. You\u2019re just getting value on it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5d09\" name=\"5d09\">Jay Kang: For Augur, remember we bet the price of Ethereum wouldn\u2019t be over $500 on December 31st, 2018 and that was just a fade of maximalism basically. It didn\u2019t feel like maximalism reflected anything. I think it\u2019s the same thing you can do for these Oscar things where the discussion around it, if you read the internet, is so one-way. In the end, you realize that what it is, it\u2019s like a couple thousand old people watching screeners or not watching screeners and voting for the Oscars. They either don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening on Twitter or they don\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s happening on Twitter. It seemed like they were just going to pick \u2018Green Book\u2019 because that\u2019s the exact type of movie that they always pick, so wouldn\u2019t they pick it?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1440\" name=\"1440\">Aaron Lammer: Couldn\u2019t we make a similar argument about Bitcoin being mostly controlled by a few mega whales and-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"16c2\" name=\"16c2\">Jay Kang: I like these redirects you\u2019re doing today.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71ce\" name=\"71ce\">Aaron Lammer: Keeping it on topic.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2779\" name=\"2779\">Jay Kang: Let\u2019s go.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"23af\" name=\"23af\">Aaron Lammer: We think Bitcoin is defined by how many people want to go and put $100 in their Coinbase account, but when we really look at the distribution of coins, the people who own full percentage points worth of Bitcoin are probably influencing price a lot more than me and you.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0833\" name=\"0833\">Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. For sure. That one guy who is one of the trustees of Mt. Gox, he was moving the market by himself.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d00b\" name=\"d00b\">Aaron Lammer: That guy was awesome. I wish he would reappear in a different plot line.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8152\" name=\"8152\">Jay Kang: He is just market selling. [crosstalk 00:16:45].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e177\" name=\"e177\">Aaron Lammer: He was honestly just like, \u201cI don\u2019t care. I know you guys care, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a865\" name=\"a865\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah. You guys are really mad at me, but honestly, I just want this to be out of my hair and I\u2019m going to do the easiest way possible. I don\u2019t care how much money I lose in the process. That\u2019s actually an admirable thing. I don\u2019t know.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"244a\" name=\"244a\">Jay Kang: This actually is relevant with crypto. I think it\u2019s probably, at this point, a smart move where there\u2019s a consensus of really loud and well-followed and intense people on Twitter about anything whether it be crypto maximalism or politics and pop culture, you should just fade that. You should just auto-fade that if you\u2019re going to make any sort of bet on anything. You should just be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to take the opposite route.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7bec\" name=\"7bec\">Jay Kang: That goes to things like Amazon even. This idea that Amazon is in trouble because it didn\u2019t come to New York and AOC and some of the new Democrats are going to have them on the run. I\u2019m just like, \u201cLook, outside of whether or not that\u2019s a good or bad thing, I would tend to say that\u2019s probably a good thing-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4c92\" name=\"4c92\">Aaron Lammer: You\u2019d probably be buying Facebook right now on the same grounds basically, right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"494a\" name=\"494a\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I tried that.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3886\" name=\"3886\">Aaron Lammer: [crosstalk 00:18:02] got wrecked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5fa0\" name=\"5fa0\">Jay Kang: I got a few months on [crosstalk 00:18:07] wrecked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b1ba\" name=\"b1ba\">Aaron Lammer: Jay, I feel like we\u2019re just trying to derive strategies to get wrecked into crypto and something else right now. What else could we bring our unique blend of failure and hubris to?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3927\" name=\"3927\">Jay Kang: Exactly, and misanthropy. Like, \u201cOkay, if I hate everybody and everybody\u2019s wrong except me, what should I bet on?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e97\" name=\"7e97\">Aaron Lammer: Well, look, you won with the \u2018Green Book\u2019 so you\u2019re on a hot streak of one. Let\u2019s keep it going. You want to run through a little news?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a0d\" name=\"2a0d\">Jay Kang: Yeah. Let\u2019s do it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cafb\" name=\"cafb\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, this is hot, breaking, won\u2019t be breaking anymore when this comes out, but we can still enjoy it in the moment, Ripple going to Coinbase. This is like NBA trade deadline we\u2019re in.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"028f\" name=\"028f\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s not Ripple, right? I believe you mean XRP is going to Coinbase.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"239e\" name=\"239e\">Aaron Lammer: Sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. Jay, I think we got off on the wrong foot. Can we start that again?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e295\" name=\"e295\">Jay Kang: You of all people with our XRP hat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0779\" name=\"0779\">Aaron Lammer: XRP is going to Coinbase.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55a9\" name=\"55a9\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I\u2019m surprised. Are you surprised?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d8f6\" name=\"d8f6\">Aaron Lammer: I am surprised. Well, this reminds me of\u00a0\u2026 Today\u2019s going to be all me doing comparisons.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0e97\" name=\"0e97\">Jay Kang: Sure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e8ea\" name=\"e8ea\">Aaron Lammer: It reminds me of the way now in the NBA someone will say something as if it\u2019s totally absolute and then it\u2019s a total lie. Like when Kyrie was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m planning to stay in Boston,\u201d and then two months later he was like, \u201cWe\u2019re considering all the other options.\u201d Coinbase literally wrote a document that in all but name said we will never add XRP.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71bc\" name=\"71bc\">Jay Kang: Yep. No, they really did and now they added XRP.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0431\" name=\"0431\">Aaron Lammer: Look, this show\u2019s only been on for a little over a year and we talked about it on the show it can\u2019t have been more than a year ago.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6281\" name=\"6281\">Jay Kang: Yeah, and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the same thing as the NBA players just giving out misinformation to make their lives easier. I think that Coinbase just didn\u2019t know back then.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ebbe\" name=\"ebbe\">Aaron Lammer: Don\u2019t you think Kyrie just changed his mind? That\u2019s what I think Brian Armstrong did.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b462\" name=\"b462\">Jay Kang: Yeah. No, no, that\u2019s what I meant. I think they were talking about\u00a0\u2026 It\u2019s two things. The first is that you have to give much more statements now than you ever had to and they\u2019re disseminated. Kyrie said that thing at a dinner for season ticket holders or something like that. There\u2019s no way that that would have been reported on at any other point.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1460\" name=\"1460\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e389\" name=\"e389\">Jay Kang: Same thing with Coinbase and Ripple, all the attention on Coinbase I\u2019m sure they have said a lot of things that they now wish that they could take back. The nice thing about our current landscape in media and relative to truth is that you can just go the other way. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself. You\u2019re just like, \u201cLook, that was back then. This is now. Who cares?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6fab\" name=\"6fab\">Aaron Lammer: If we\u2019re going to take anything away from it, I think we\u2019re going to take that Coinbase is just going to keep doing whatever is best for Coinbase. I feel like our initial take on Coinbase circa episode one was probably right, which is it\u2019s always going to be better for Coinbase than that anything other than Bitcoin wins. Anything Coinbase can do to at least balance the seesaw of the entire bundle other than Bitcoin versus Bitcoin, they\u2019re going to do. They thought they would not have to dirty themselves with the Ripple sauce, but now-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ba6\" name=\"1ba6\">Jay Kang: Okay, I do have a question for you, which is that you, as the owner of an XRP hat, right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0f4d\" name=\"0f4d\">Aaron Lammer: Yes. I\u2019m taking it down and putting it on.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f779\" name=\"f779\">Jay Kang: Because of the generous interview that you gave to a Ripple stand where you were like, \u201cLet\u2019s try and understand these people\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5074\" name=\"5074\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m still beloved in the Ripple community.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a71b\" name=\"a71b\">Jay Kang: You\u2019re like a celebrity in the Ripple community.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2ae3\" name=\"2ae3\">Aaron Lammer: Beloved.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b8c4\" name=\"b8c4\">Jay Kang: Yeah. I think you understand the Ripple stand better than I do, but the thing that I don\u2019t quite understand is why is it dirty for Coinbase to introduce this extremely well-known and extremely centralized, but still much, much-discussed cryptocurrency? Why is it bad?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f2f0\" name=\"f2f0\">Aaron Lammer: I think you said it. It\u2019s extremely centralized.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9044\" name=\"9044\">Jay Kang: But, we\u2019ve crossed that Rubicon already. Coinbase-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"47a6\" name=\"47a6\">Aaron Lammer: Did we cross that Rubicon and decide that Ripple was basically not a crypto?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5239\" name=\"5239\">Jay Kang: But, Coinbase does offer other coins that are highly centralized, right? BAT and other things.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cbaa\" name=\"cbaa\">Aaron Lammer: I agree.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4d9f\" name=\"4d9f\">Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s not like Coinbase can be like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re pure.\u201d They\u2019ve muddied themselves with a lot of centralized coins. At this point, why not just add Ripple? That\u2019s my thought.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80ea\" name=\"80ea\">Aaron Lammer: I think that\u2019s probably what the meeting where they decided to greenlight Ripple was. I wonder if they might have wanted to do Ripple before and had been waiting on some sort of a nod from the authorities that Ripple was not going to be trouble if they added it. Yeah, I think that if what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019re already a sellout, why not really sell out. Yeah, I think that\u2019s accurate.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"43dd\" name=\"43dd\">Aaron Lammer: My question is why they felt they had to get in this business? I guess you could say that they\u2019re just giving the customer what they want, that they\u2019re probably getting a gazillion emails that are like, \u201cI want to buy Ripple at Coinbase.\u201d Who are they to not sell it? On the other hand, in terms of the Bitcoin narrative to have a company that was at one point, I feel like, the most powerful company in Bitcoin so clearly just bagging on Bitcoin, it kind of sucks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c108\" name=\"c108\">Jay Kang: Well, I think this is an example of the gap in context between how much people on Twitter hate Ripple and how much the Twitter Ripple fans are psychotic, and the reality of their business, which is that if you ignore all that then what Coinbase still a large part of their business is through transaction fees on buys and sells, right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5443\" name=\"5443\">Aaron Lammer: Yep.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0f54\" name=\"0f54\">Jay Kang: Why would they not try and offer every single cryptocurrency that is bought and sold a lot? I would say that Ripple is probably still bought and sold quite a bit. If they can tune out the screaming hoards on both sides, then for them, it\u2019s a pretty clear business decision. I don\u2019t know. Again, as we said, their purity is gone. It\u2019s been gone. I would say that the final blow to it was the way that they introduced Bitcoin Cash. That\u2019s when we started to think of them as a purely capitalistic\u00a0\u2026 Capitalistic is not the right word, but their much-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71eb\" name=\"71eb\">Aaron Lammer: Opportunistic.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2df0\" name=\"2df0\">Jay Kang: Yeah, they\u2019re much more opportunistic\u00a0\u2026 They were much less interested in the theory and philosophy of decentralization than we had thought. Why not just put on Ripple? I don\u2019t know. This doesn\u2019t make me mad at all. Coinbase, sponsor our show.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"68d2\" name=\"68d2\">Aaron Lammer: Wow, Jay. Jay\u2019s come full circle on Coinbase.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f6ce\" name=\"f6ce\">Jay Kang: Toshi\u2019s great.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"40f8\" name=\"40f8\">Aaron Lammer: Here\u2019s my counter take on why I think it\u2019s a bad decision for Coinbase. I\u2019m not mad about it. I have not placed a lot of faith in Coinbase other than the fact that I use them as a business. Here\u2019s why I think it\u2019s a bad business decision, though. I feel like Coinbase and Ripple, the company, not the currency, are on some deep, deep level competitors. I know that sounds crazy, but remember when we didn\u2019t think of Apple and Google and Facebook as competitors. We\u2019re like, \u201cOh, they\u2019re all completely in their own lane.\u201d Then, once they get big enough, everything is competitive.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c1bb\" name=\"c1bb\">Aaron Lammer: Ripple is a company. It\u2019s a startup. It\u2019s a for-profit startup that has a shit ton of money for not doing very much. I think that ultimately the ambitions of that company are going to run contrary to Coinbase\u2019s. I think they\u2019re both going to try to become IPOed, biggest crypto companies in the world, taking different paths. That\u2019s not really a risk you run with Bitcoin or even to a lesser extent, Ethereum in so far as Ethereum is designed more as a nonprofit foundation.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9386\" name=\"9386\">Jay Kang: Yeah, but at that point-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f1fa\" name=\"f1fa\">Aaron Lammer: I just think it\u2019s a little like when Apple allows Amazon Prime videos on Apple TV.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a566\" name=\"a566\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I was thinking about that as an example, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite the same way because what you\u2019re trying to do is you\u2019re trying to monopolize the on-ramp space if you\u2019re Coinbase, right? If Ripple, if they can establish enough with the Ripple community that the best way to buy and sell XRP is through Coinbase, then Ripple, as the company, has a harder time trying to dissuade people from using the easy on-ramp that they are used to. Does that make sense? You then have to deal with a paid in point where people now have to go to\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"910d\" name=\"910d\">Jay Kang: It\u2019s like Spotify with podcasts right now. They bought Gimlet for $230 million and the question that\u2019s out there is, okay, now if all of Gimlet\u2019s podcasts are on Spotify instead of the Apple podcast app, are people still going to listen to them or is it just like, \u201cIt\u2019s another click and I don\u2019t feel like doing that.\u201d Those are real questions I think that\u00a0\u2026 I think that Coinbase by getting all this information and all this on-ramp stuff for Ripple is probably in a good position there. I don\u2019t quite see what the problem would be there for them.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2afe\" name=\"2afe\">Aaron Lammer: I like your Spotify metaphor because the way I read that acquisition is basically as I understand it, Spotify has a ton of paying customers. They\u2019ve signed up 10 million people. They\u2019re doing well in terms of converting people, but based on the cost basis of streaming music, they operate at a loss by streaming music because of the amount of money they have to pay out to artists for that streaming. I know artists feel like Spotify gives them pennies on the dollar of what they should get and I\u2019m sympathetic to that, but even so, Spotify is actually not a good growth business model for streaming music.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b83a\" name=\"b83a\">Aaron Lammer: However, if they own a bunch of podcasts, which are a fixed one-time cost, and that\u2019s what people were doing on Spotify and they were converting new users who were basically just there to listen to those podcasts, it\u2019s a much better business to be in. That\u2019s more or less where I feel like Coinbase has ended up. They\u2019re just not satisfied with the Bitcoin business.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d04a\" name=\"d04a\">Jay Kang: Yeah, and they\u2019re also future-proofing themselves in case Ripple does become the dominant company and-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39b7\" name=\"39b7\">Aaron Lammer: I think it\u2019s a bad call.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55ec\" name=\"55ec\">Jay Kang: What do you mean?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"36fc\" name=\"36fc\">Aaron Lammer: I just think that-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c42\" name=\"1c42\">Jay Kang: Wait, it doesn\u2019t really-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"14c2\" name=\"14c2\">Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 Ripple becomes as big as Bitcoin, there\u2019s going to be no role for Coinbase anyway. I feel like Coinbase is being a little na\u00efve letting these snakes rise up out of the grass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0be1\" name=\"0be1\">Jay Kang: I know, but Coinbase didn\u2019t pay anything for this. They didn\u2019t pay $230 million to buy Ripple or $6 billion or whatever Ripple would cost.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2e69\" name=\"2e69\">Aaron Lammer: Let me play game theory with you.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee9b\" name=\"ee9b\">Jay Kang: Okay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"30f8\" name=\"30f8\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019m coming to Coinbase, I have a million dollars cash from my personal wealth that I want to invest in crypto. All I know is I want it to be in crypto.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"af9e\" name=\"af9e\">Jay Kang: Don\u2019t do it!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2f4c\" name=\"2f4c\">Aaron Lammer: Okay. First, don\u2019t do it. Nothing on this show is investment advice. That\u2019s a terrible idea. No, I demand to do it. I\u2019m a cranky man. I\u2019ve always had Libertarian sympathies. I want to get my money out of the banks and into crypto. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay. Well, what do you want to buy?\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I want to buy one of the ones that Coinbase has because obviously, that\u2019s all I know, the only method I had for buying it. Okay.\u201d I have pick of everything on Coinbase.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"322b\" name=\"322b\">Aaron Lammer: Now, I think the thing Coinbase would most like you to do is buy that Coinbase bundle that\u2019s just equally weighted all of the things they sell based on their market share. Remember that?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"595b\" name=\"595b\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dac2\" name=\"dac2\">Aaron Lammer: They still have yet. That\u2019s spreading out all of the risk and upside completely equally so you\u2019re keeping everyone from getting too big. But, if I demand to get a specific currency, would you rather that I have Bitcoin or Ripple if you\u2019re Coinbase?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"726c\" name=\"726c\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think I would care at all. I would just want the one that you moved around the most so I could get transaction fees off of you, right?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"531f\" name=\"531f\">Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s a pretty fair point. That\u2019s how banks look at it too. It\u2019s not Fidelity cares what stock I buy. They\u2019re just like, \u201cBuy stocks on Fidelity.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc0e\" name=\"fc0e\">Jay Kang: Yeah, we get our-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8840\" name=\"8840\">Aaron Lammer: Keep your retirement account here.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aab6\" name=\"aab6\">Jay Kang: We get our $5.99 or whatever per trade. Okay, you want to move on?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a08d\" name=\"a08d\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, let\u2019s move on. Did you hear about this thing about Gladius, this ICO which basically reported itself to the FTC?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f0b\" name=\"5f0b\">Jay Kang: No. No, they self-owned?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"90a3\" name=\"90a3\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah. There\u2019s not that much more to the story. Basically, the FTC was like, \u201cYes, you are in the wrong. If you return all the money to investors you won\u2019t face criminal charges or fines.\u201d So, they just returned all the money. This might be the new ICO model is to go right up to the lip and be like, \u201cDo we really want to face jail time?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"737e\" name=\"737e\">Jay Kang: Yeah, but also maybe it\u2019s a business strategy where you snitch on yourself and therefore when you start your next project you can be like, \u201cListen, we\u2019re totally above board now. We\u2019re the ones that snitched on yourself.\u201d Plus, you get a bunch of free press for an obscure coin like Gladius, which I had no idea what it was and I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t either until this happened.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d7f7\" name=\"d7f7\">Aaron Lammer: Still don\u2019t.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bdb7\" name=\"bdb7\">Jay Kang: Now, we\u2019re discussing it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"50c8\" name=\"50c8\">Aaron Lammer: Still don\u2019t. Didn\u2019t even get as far as looking up what the thing was.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9787\" name=\"9787\">Jay Kang: If we were better at the podcast and researched it better, we could actually do that, but a more prepared host would at least now know what Gladius is. Maybe it\u2019s good.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"845f\" name=\"845f\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t want to use up any more brain space for any ICOs that have already closed down, but I like your exit scam, snitching on yourself. A good way to do that would be to just build the company heavily before you snitch on yourself, like do a lot of consulting services, drain a lot of the money out, and then snitch on yourself, return the money to investors, but you don\u2019t return money that\u2019s already been spent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f857\" name=\"f857\">Jay Kang: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Self-snitching is generally a good idea, I think. Amy Klobuchar, the woman who\u2019s running for president from Minnesota. She has all those stories about how she was an abusive boss and would throw binders at people, I feel like she should have just self-snitched on all of that when the story started coming out. She should have just been, \u201cI did all of this and it\u2019s because I\u2019m tough and I\u2019m the person who can take on Donald Trump.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3804\" name=\"3804\">Jay Kang: Now, in general, I actually think that it probably is helping her that all these stories are coming out \u2019cause everybody\u2019s discussing her and also most people don\u2019t care if you abuse a 23-year-old aid.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9749\" name=\"9749\">Aaron Lammer: Whoa, Jay. Whoa, whoa.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6018\" name=\"6018\">Jay Kang: No, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t care. I do care, but I think that most people, especially older people, are just like, \u201cThat Millennial deserved it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f2b4\" name=\"f2b4\">Aaron Lammer: Beat that intern\u2019s ass.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2c04\" name=\"2c04\">Jay Kang: I\u2019m just saying, if she had self-snitched, I think she would have gotten in front of all of this. Then, any other news story, people would have been like, \u201cYeah, but she already admitted it, so who cares?\u201d Anyway, that was my politics take of the last week.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5f00\" name=\"5f00\">Aaron Lammer: I was talking to a friend of mine who is an attorney, a criminal defense attorney, and saying something about that Tekashi69 case.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e488\" name=\"e488\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad58\" name=\"ad58\">Aaron Lammer: Tekashi69.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d284\" name=\"d284\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6272\" name=\"6272\">Aaron Lammer: It was like, really, I know people are making fun of him online for snitching, but that was totally the right decision.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d6fd\" name=\"d6fd\">Jay Kang: Yes, except now he might end up dead.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"92c4\" name=\"92c4\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, but he was like, \u201cIf you\u2019re facing life in jail anyway, you should just take whatever deal is offered you.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5ce7\" name=\"5ce7\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I guess his recording career is going to be a little difficult now, but maybe like Gladius, you can rebrand and be somebody else. I do enjoy his music.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a5f2\" name=\"a5f2\">Aaron Lammer: I do too. I\u2019m not going to go around trying to defend it or get into some sort of argument with someone about it, but in a purely aesthetic level, I think he\u2019s talented. I am sad that he will spend the rest of his life in witness protection or whatever.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc08\" name=\"fc08\">Jay Kang: His songs are good.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b80f\" name=\"b80f\">Aaron Lammer: He\u2019s also a person who is a little too early for the ICO era. You know who has been saying positive things about Bitcoin in the week since we last spoke is Elon Musk.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"49ce\" name=\"49ce\">Jay Kang: Oh, the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi. That\u2019s my favorite-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e878\" name=\"e878\">Aaron Lammer: Of course, he\u2019s praising.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa59\" name=\"aa59\">Jay Kang: That\u2019s my favorite Satoshi theory. I used to bother him on Twitter about it. I\u2019d be like, \u201cAre you Satoshi?\u201d every time he would tweet and he never responded. Yeah, I thought-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b2db\" name=\"b2db\">Aaron Lammer: Wow, actually based on your theory, what he tweeted this week on February 21st fits your theory, which is he tweeted, \u201cHowever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel Prize in delayed gratification.\u201d You could read that as a self-boast.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2365\" name=\"2365\">Jay Kang: Yeah, he might have Satoshi\u2019s wallet keys. I know that we\u2019ve discussed this several times on this show, but I do think that Elon Musk cracks the top 10 on betting odds for who Satoshi is.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"397f\" name=\"397f\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think that and I will take that bet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f22e\" name=\"f22e\">Jay Kang: I still think the odds are very long, but his odds have to be better than Craig\u00a0\u2026 Maybe they\u2019re not better than Craig Wright, but they\u2019re better than some of the other people who are rumored as to be Satoshi.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf3b\" name=\"cf3b\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, let me ask you a question. There was also the whole thing with Jack Dorsey was in a big Twitter interview about Bitcoin. I think he tweeted out his tippin.me lightning wallet. Oh, hey, Jay, did you know that we have a tippin.me lightning wallet?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f10c\" name=\"f10c\">Jay Kang: Did [inaudible 00:36:18] make us one?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a1b\" name=\"5a1b\">Aaron Lammer: No, I just made it for us today.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bc1b\" name=\"bc1b\">Jay Kang: Nice. Nice.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"adf8\" name=\"adf8\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s tippin.me/@cointalkshow. Send us a tip. If we get one tip, we\u2019ll talk about the tip on air. If you send us a tip, and I don\u2019t know if you can put a notes field or something on it, we will say something on the air. That\u2019s a promise.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4bba\" name=\"4bba\">Aaron Lammer: What does it mean that the Elon Musks and Jack Dorseys in the world are talking about Bitcoin?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"84b1\" name=\"84b1\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. It probably means a little bit more than when Jamie Diamond and\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a32\" name=\"7a32\">Aaron Lammer: Warren Buffet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6d1d\" name=\"6d1d\">Jay Kang: Warren Buffet. I almost said Wayne Buffet and then I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d Then I was like, \u201cWalter Buffet.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"81e4\" name=\"81e4\">Aaron Lammer: Warren Buffet was talking about Bitcoin also this week. He was like, \u201cIt has no value, and it attracts charlatans.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bfa8\" name=\"bfa8\">Jay Kang: [inaudible 00:37:08]. Look, fair. It\u2019s a fair take.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"629f\" name=\"629f\">Aaron Lammer: A, true. B, totally period.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"54f1\" name=\"54f1\">Jay Kang: Do you remember when Warren Buffet was talking anyone Bitcoin earlier, maybe nine months ago or something like that?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dc0f\" name=\"dc0f\">Aaron Lammer: When he called it rat poison squared or something?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e28d\" name=\"e28d\">Jay Kang: His take was essentially, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know about all that, but we\u2019ve looked at it and it seems cool, but I don\u2019t know. The only way I would invest in it is it I could buy a put on it.\u201d This is when Bitcoin was $16,000 or something like that. I bet he did actually figure out a way to buy a put on it given that it\u2019s Warren Buffet, but I think about that quite a bit being like, \u201cI wish I had listened to him and just shorted Bitcoin or at least sold my Bitcoin at that point.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"853d\" name=\"853d\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think any of these guys\u00a0\u2026 Musk said he had like 0.25 Bitcoin to his name. It doesn\u2019t seem like that many celebrities are mega whales.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b220\" name=\"b220\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t think it really matters. Elon Mush talks about everything at this point. Does it matter that Azealia Banks\u2019 career had a revitalization because of her interactions with Elon Musk? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s relevant.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5d17\" name=\"5d17\">Aaron Lammer: That seems legitimately irrelevant.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4fc8\" name=\"4fc8\">Jay Kang: No, just saying the celebrity-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7889\" name=\"7889\">Aaron Lammer: My counter take is I don\u2019t think that Azealia Banks reference makes any sense.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e881\" name=\"e881\">Jay Kang: I was just saying if the proximity of something to Elon Musk outside of news about Tesla doesn\u2019t seem to be that important.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1c11\" name=\"1c11\">Aaron Lammer: Okay. What top five\u00a0\u2026 Who coming out as being a pro-Bitcoin/holder-of-Bitcoin, who would be the biggest market movers? I thought Elon Musk would move the market. Did not move the market. No one gave a shit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2097\" name=\"2097\">Jay Kang: In the U.S?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3652\" name=\"3652\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1553\" name=\"1553\">Jay Kang: Number one would be Obama, I think.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3c89\" name=\"3c89\">Aaron Lammer: That\u2019s what I was going to say. If Obama was like, \u201cI think Bitcoin\u2019s a good idea and I\u2019m adding some to my portfolio,\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"18cb\" name=\"18cb\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I think Obama\u2019s probably number one. I don\u2019t know. Number two probably would be Warren Buffet. If Warren Buffet made a big change of heart.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"888a\" name=\"888a\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8331\" name=\"8331\">Jay Kang: There are just a lot of people who just do everything that Warren Buffet says.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f5be\" name=\"f5be\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s weird, though because when I think of the modern financial guruish dudes, not guruish, but Marc Cuban types, those people have already come out as being interested in Bitcoin and are probably-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3570\" name=\"3570\">Jay Kang: Yeah, but they don\u2019t have the same following as Warren Buffet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"620f\" name=\"620f\">Aaron Lammer: Either than Warren Buffet, who is the most respected financial thinker in America? What if Alan Greenspan said he was holding Bitcoin?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"502a\" name=\"502a\">Jay Kang: I think that they would more check out Greenspan\u2019s medication.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"88b7\" name=\"88b7\">Aaron Lammer: They would be like, \u201cWho\u2019s been feeding lines?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a7c5\" name=\"a7c5\">Jay Kang: Exactly. We think that your levels of something are very off. I would be more concerned about Alan Greenspan than I would think take that very seriously. I don\u2019t know. I think the list is very short. It might just be Barack Obama and Warren Buffet. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other celebrity or famous person that would have any effect on the market at all.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"25cb\" name=\"25cb\">Aaron Lammer: Oprah?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e797\" name=\"e797\">Jay Kang: No, not Oprah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"031d\" name=\"031d\">Aaron Lammer: You don\u2019t think if Oprah started shilling Bitcoin it would move the market.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"97cd\" name=\"97cd\">Jay Kang: You know what? She does-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"406e\" name=\"406e\">Aaron Lammer: You\u2019re all, \u201cMaybe I would get in on that.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55bf\" name=\"55bf\">Jay Kang: Instead of \u2018The Secret\u2019\u00a0\u2026 Remember when she was puffing that book \u2018The Secret\u2019?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3f5f\" name=\"3f5f\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"07e1\" name=\"07e1\">Jay Kang: Instead of \u2018The Secret\u2019 she was just talking about Bitcoin like that. Instead of being make a vision board and picture the success that you have in the world and it will come true, she was just like, \u201cBuy cryptocurrency and enjoy the decentralized utopia,\u201d yeah, that would have some effect, I think.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7d4c\" name=\"7d4c\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah. I think that the next stage of Bitcoin is going to have a lot of celebrity stuff.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0ccf\" name=\"0ccf\">Jay Kang: That\u2019s the three. I don\u2019t think anyone other than those three, though. And, Oprah is a distant third there I think.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"926e\" name=\"926e\">Aaron Lammer: Lebron?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f865\" name=\"f865\">Jay Kang: No way. It would have on effect.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b395\" name=\"b395\">Aaron Lammer: Really?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed9f\" name=\"ed9f\">Jay Kang: No.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a251\" name=\"a251\">Aaron Lammer: If Lebron starts talking about crypto?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d730\" name=\"d730\">Jay Kang: Nobody trusts Lebron with financial advice or their lives. They\u2019re just like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a really good basketball player,\u201d then half the country hates him. There\u2019s nobody else who would move the needle, I don\u2019t think, in any of this.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5388\" name=\"5388\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, we\u2019ll come back to that. I have a feeling we\u2019ll think of some more possible influencers. You want to talk main course here? We\u2019ve not really gotten to talk about JP Morgan coin yet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"88c9\" name=\"88c9\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3e39\" name=\"3e39\">Aaron Lammer: I thought it was going to go away and it kind of did go away, but I feel like, we\u2019re going to have to talk about it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"54ee\" name=\"54ee\">Jay Kang: Yeah, our friend Joe Weisenthal who wrote about it, he was on vacation when JPM hit. He withheld his thoughts and he wrote about it in his morning newsletter, or his section of the morning newsletter, which Bloomberg puts out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ca9\" name=\"3ca9\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like a Bloomberg market newsletter.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3a5a\" name=\"3a5a\">Jay Kang: Yeah, I read it. I actually get it every day and I\u2019m always interested in Joe\u2019s thoughts. It\u2019s short and it\u2019s cogent and I think one of Joe\u2019s talents as a writer is to crystallize something down into two interesting points that you can think about, which I think is a great talent.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cb8e\" name=\"cb8e\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve generally been enjoying newsletters recently particularly as a way to get crypto news. I needed to get off Twitter and Reddit. Tony Sheng, Marty\u2019s Bent from Marty Bent, it\u2019s a good way to keep up to date. I plan most of our show based on newsletters I feel like.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b64e\" name=\"b64e\">Jay Kang: I haven\u2019t joined that yet because you can\u2019t get in newsletter fights and\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ed27\" name=\"ed27\">Aaron Lammer: Oh, right. It\u2019s true. Newsletters won\u2019t fight with you, which to me is a plus, to Jay is a minus.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"141b\" name=\"141b\">Jay Kang: Huge minus.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ae73\" name=\"ae73\">Aaron Lammer: We try to come in with different takes. My take is that fighting is bad. Jay\u2019s take is that fighting is good.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a85a\" name=\"a85a\">Jay Kang: Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d34d\" name=\"d34d\">Aaron Lammer: Okay.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"30ea\" name=\"30ea\">Jay Kang: I would object if you don\u2019t paint me in a corner, but that is actually a very coherent and accurate assessment of our general thoughts on this.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6fcb\" name=\"6fcb\">Aaron Lammer: For what JP Morgan Coin is it\u2019s another stable coin backed to the dollar similar to Tether I guess you could say.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6d98\" name=\"6d98\">Jay Kang: Yeah. Well, yeah, it\u2019s a stable coin and JP Morgan is basically saying, \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be worth a dollar.\u201d What Joe says is, \u201cLook, this might sound silly,\u201d but he does come up with an interesting thought which is that with something like JP Morgan\u00a0\u2026 This is me quoting him now. \u201cWith something like JPM Coin, money could have rules attached to it. Parents of college-aged students could give them money that is only able to be spent on book or food at the cafeteria. A charity might specify in code that their dollars only go to a certain cause and not be used for administrative expenses. Investors in a startup could theoretically put it in dollars that only go to buy Facebook ads. It can\u2019t be used for fancy offices or the CEO\u2019s salaries.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8a1f\" name=\"8a1f\">Jay Kang: \u201cThere are ways of arranging all these things now, of course, but they require human oversight or other kludgy systems.\u201d I don\u2019t know what that word is, but it\u2019s a good word, kludgy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b88d\" name=\"b88d\">Aaron Lammer: Kludgy. Kludgy means hacky, duck-taped together.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"35b1\" name=\"35b1\">Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s a good word. Lot of countenance.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a09\" name=\"5a09\">Aaron Lammer: Jerry-rigged and kludgy are synonymous.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39d3\" name=\"39d3\">Jay Kang: \u201cMoney in which the rules of how they\u2019re spent have a lot of potential in the future. It\u2019s nothing like what Bitcoin\u2019s all about, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not interesting.\u201d What do you think of that, Aaron?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fccc\" name=\"fccc\">Aaron Lammer: Well, first another thing I wanted to note in there, he says, \u201cJP Morgan\u00a0\u2026 \u201c This is a quote again, \u201cJPM makes clear only permission clients will have access to the coin.\u201d That\u2019s a big important thing to know up front, which is like, \u201cThis is for people who are like logged into the JPM system. This is not open market at all.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"56ad\" name=\"56ad\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s basically going to be like here is Aaron\u2019s allowance. No buying weed. No buying your legal weed-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0dd4\" name=\"0dd4\">Jay Kang: I feel like-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7ac7\" name=\"7ac7\">Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 teenage Aaron in the 2030s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"190b\" name=\"190b\">Jay Kang: That seems like a good argument for JPM Coin honestly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f566\" name=\"f566\">Aaron Lammer: You try and swipe my hologram eye thing and it will set off an alarm in the store and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo weed. You cannot buy weed with these JPM.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f014\" name=\"f014\">Jay Kang: Yeah, you can buy these bottles of water and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know. I tend to agree with Joe what I for you take out the implications of all of this that there is a use for it. Outside of allowance, I don\u2019t quite know what those would be. The problems that he\u2019s citing here, outside of teenage Aaron, aren\u2019t not real problems. When you give money to a charity, you have no idea how that\u2019s spent. There are all sorts of examples like the breast cancer awareness groups and stuff like that where a lot of people who have given them money come to regret it because there are journalists who go in and look at all of it and say, \u201cLook all of this money is going to things that have nothing to do with breast cancer research.\u201d If you could specify things like that then I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a bad thing.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"145c\" name=\"145c\">Aaron Lammer: I\u2019ve come to the point on this show where I feel like we can\u2019t only cover the things that we think are cool or a good thing. At a certain point, I\u2019m sort of interested in all of this stuff. When I actually think of this, this feels more realistic to me than the Ethereum amusement park. The programmable JP Morgan buck\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fbb0\" name=\"fbb0\">Aaron Lammer: Let me propose an even simpler programming, which is say I want to put five percent of my earnings into a retirement account every year and you buy some sort of a coin that automates that process or something or knows not to be taxed because it\u2019s a pre-taxed buck rather than a post-tax [crosstalk 00:47:44].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e441\" name=\"e441\">Jay Kang: Sure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a3f\" name=\"2a3f\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know, somehow the fact that you\u2019re already in a financial infrastructure, it makes that kind of a thing realistic and I could almost see it operating as a budgeting tool also that it basically manages the flow of your income and holds money for taxes, pays money for expenses, and gives you a living allowance or something. I know it\u2019s a dystopian vision, but what are people really going to do with programmable money other than program it to move around in an automated way?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b5ab\" name=\"b5ab\">Jay Kang: Why is that a dystopian vision?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"55fb\" name=\"55fb\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t like someone being able to tell me I can\u2019t buy weed at the 7\u201311. It\u2019s legal, God dammit!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5699\" name=\"5699\">Jay Kang: You\u2019re entire take on this is you putting yourself in a time machine and going back to when you were 16-years-old in a world where you can buy weed and then imagining that your parents would be like, \u201cHere\u2019s your allowance. You can\u2019t spend it on this.\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cThis is dystopian.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e3f7\" name=\"e3f7\">Aaron Lammer: Jay, what if these were programmed so they were like no gambling bucks.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"59ac\" name=\"59ac\">Jay Kang: Yeah, it would probably help me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"85fc\" name=\"85fc\">Aaron Lammer: You try to bring them in a casino and it\u2019s like\u00a0\u2026</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"93f4\" name=\"93f4\">Jay Kang: God, I wish every single one\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m being totally serious here. If I could go to my employer and say, \u201cCan you give me the money that you can\u2019t use at a casino?\u201d I would do it in a heartbeat.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f340\" name=\"f340\">Aaron Lammer: This would create another level in this de-platforming financial wars that are happening now. If you to say the JP Morgan buck can\u2019t be sent to these political groups or it can\u2019t be used for these various purposes\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to be paranoid here. I actually think some of this is positive, but we\u2019re putting more and more extrajudicial rules upon how money [crosstalk 00:49:42].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"35c6\" name=\"35c6\">Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. Sure. In a world where every dollar is JP Morgan bucks, I think that they\u2019re probably a lot of privacy and potential for state control and all this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. In a world where it\u2019s just an opt-in thing, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really see that big of a problem with it. It\u2019s interesting to me. I would say that my general politics would be JP Morgan shouldn\u2019t have all this power over things and they shouldn\u2019t have power over how people spend their money.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b42f\" name=\"b42f\">Jay Kang: From a purely conceptual point, is there a use for this, not whether I like it? Yeah, there\u2019s a use for that vision that Joe\u2019s putting out there. I think that\u2019s what Joe is saying too by the way. I don\u2019t think he is saying this would be cool. I think he\u2019s just being yeah, there\u2019s something you could do with it. It\u2019s not totally vaporware.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cd5c\" name=\"cd5c\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, I appreciate people like Joe for taking in our same fade prevailing sentiment way. We probably should be taking the Facebook crypto project and the JP Morgan Coin seriously. I realize that they get zero respect on the internet, but Ripple gets almost zero respect and lots of things that succeed are generally doubted by the entire technology press. I don\u2019t take the fact that JP Morgan Coin is a joke as any sort of an indication that it won\u2019t work.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d6b7\" name=\"d6b7\">Jay Kang: Yeah, it\u2019s like North Carolina Tar Heel basketball team. Disrespected and put out for dead and then come back to beat Duke. Yeah, I don\u2019t know, I think that generally, you should not listen to the internet. If at all, you should just fade the internet at all points possible which means should we be buying JP Morgan Coin then?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0032\" name=\"0032\">Aaron Lammer: I don\u2019t think we have permission to.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee5b\" name=\"ee5b\">Jay Kang: Oh, yeah. Sure. I don\u2019t have a JP Morgan account \u2019cause I don\u2019t have that much money.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6a9\" name=\"b6a9\">Jay Kang: All right, let\u2019s go to the last one. I got to go pick up my kid soon.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6586\" name=\"6586\">Aaron Lammer: Okay, there was an op-ed, I think it was today, in the New York Times. It was basically an economics professor in Venezuela talking about how Bitcoin had allowed him to survive more or less during the crisis in Venezuela. It goes into pretty deep detail describing in a step by step practical way basically how he has shifted his financial life into Bitcoin and, as such, been able to survive slightly better than the average person.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bd13\" name=\"bd13\">Jay Kang: Can I ask you a question? I know that we try not to get into so many meta-journalism discussions on this show because our listenership doesn\u2019t care so much, but were you surprised to see this in the New York Times?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7796\" name=\"7796\">Aaron Lammer: Not really. I think that the Venezuela case for Bitcoin has been brewing for a pretty long time. There\u2019s a pretty concerted effort. It\u2019s probably the most optimistic universally good story happening in crypto right now. It\u2019s not surprising to me that this would land in the Times. Were you surprised?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bc1a\" name=\"bc1a\">Jay Kang: No, I wasn\u2019t really surprised, but if we do go and think about things from a\u00a0\u2026 Obviously, every piece that\u2019s printed in New York Times font has a conspiracy theory attached to it. I would say that some people would say that this was only published so that people get a sense of how bad economic conditions were in Venezuela, therefore, opening more public sentiment for some sort of coup there or something like that or intervention in what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s try, but then, at the same time, I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s not true because editors are just people who have to fill space and they\u2019re just trying to find something interesting.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"71d7\" name=\"71d7\">Jay Kang: There was a way that this thing was written that it did feel a lot more advocate like than your general op-ed. That did make me pause a little bit. I\u2019m not accusing the New York Times op-ed page of any wrongdoing or even any\u00a0\u2026 I really do think that they thought it was interesting. They published it, but I could see an argument in what you would say, the way this is written is a little bit too, hey, this is\u00a0\u2026 It felt like an ad for Bitcoin, honestly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"87b8\" name=\"87b8\">Aaron Lammer: Well, okay, I disagree with that on a few levels. One, the New York Times publishes a lot of op-eds.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6003\" name=\"6003\">Jay Kang: Defend the New York Times!</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2072\" name=\"2072\">Aaron Lammer: The New York Times publishes a lot of op-eds so it\u2019s not like crazy that this-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ef6\" name=\"1ef6\">Jay Kang: Yeah, sure and some of them are much more, let\u2019s say, problematic like when they publish the head of Blackwater writing an op-ed. That\u2019s [crosstalk 00:54:35].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c6c8\" name=\"c6c8\">Aaron Lammer: Sure, sure, sure. I actually don\u2019t think this is a particularly controversial op-ed insofar as I do think whether you support a U.S. intervention in Venezuela or not, I would say that Maduro has been more or less verified internationally as the villain in this story. For the New York Times to publish an op-ed that contains anti-Maduro sentiments isn\u2019t hugely surprising to me.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cf9f\" name=\"cf9f\">Aaron Lammer: The entire story of Bitcoin in Venezuela wouldn\u2019t be a positive story if you\u2019re pro-Maduro. Bitcoin is being used as a hedge against Maduro and basically as a way to undermine his economic rule. It shows how Bitcoin can spontaneously intervene in a situation like this and operate at a level in which\u00a0\u2026 And, he talks about how people are actually buying Bitcoin there, which is\u00a0\u2026 Have we ever talked about local Bitcoins on this show?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d19c\" name=\"d19c\">Jay Kang: No. Yeah, I think we have, but not by name. The concept of it, I think, is something we discussed quite a bit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5a68\" name=\"5a68\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s like a Craigslist X website that pairs buyers with sellers to either make in-person, or if you direct bag transfer, Bitcoin transactions. The author\u00a0\u2026 I\u2019ve heard of a lot of people buying Bitcoin in coffee shops and so forth in Venezuela from just private dealers, but he\u2019s doing it through bank transfers. He says that under a $50 transfer doesn\u2019t get flagged by the administration. He sends it to someone and they send back Bitcoin. He was able to get his brother smuggled out to Columbia and secure some of his savings by buying Bitcoin in that way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b6df\" name=\"b6df\">Aaron Lammer: It\u2019s an incredible confluence of modern trust technologies that you can basically have someone in a place that has rapidly inflating money doing anonymous Bitcoin transactions on the fly.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4a55\" name=\"4a55\">Jay Kang: Yeah, the way that it was framed in the piece I thought was very good, which was just like, \u201cHey, let me tell you what it\u2019s like to buy a carton of milk in Venezuela right now. You can work all you want, but\u00a0\u2026 \u201c I think his dad works some job and he gets paid basically $6 a month. Obviously, the problems with trying to buy food in Venezuela have been very well documented. He tells you how he does it and how it\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s possible and that this is the only safeguard he has against the idea that all of his labor and his family\u2019s wealth, which is not that much, but his family\u2019s small amount of savings won\u2019t be evaporated by political instability or political things that happen with Maduro and the economy in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fbeb\" name=\"fbeb\">Jay Kang: I don\u2019t know. The thing that I find interesting and this is that, for me, that this is by far the most compelling case for Bitcoin. It\u2019s interesting to see the generational gap, I think, when I was trying to figure out who was talking about this article. People who are a little bit smarter, I think, and a little bit more worldly who really did think that this article was important and then the more into crypto or inside crypto people who more or less ignored it and continued to scream about whatever their [inaudible 00:58:10].</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fe66\" name=\"fe66\">Aaron Lammer: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s totally fair. I think part of the way this story\u00a0\u2026 If you\u2019re asking how it ended up at the New York Times, I saw Anthony P show last week had on a Venezuelan person. The crypto media has been pretty heavily promoting the voices of Venezuelans who are using Bitcoin to control their financial lives. I think that story gets told a million times then it flows to various news outlets and then eventually it\u2019s in the New York Times. It\u2019s like a conservative route to-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a1f4\" name=\"a1f4\">Jay Kang: That\u2019s fair. Yeah.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9562\" name=\"9562\">Aaron Lammer:\u00a0\u2026 push the story. What\u2019s interesting to me going forward with this story is we\u2019ve seen that it basically works. There\u2019s enough volume that you\u2019re able to see on the local Bitcoin volume a huge amount of Bitcoin flowing to Venezuela. After Venezuela happens and there\u2019s going to be more of these kinds of incidents because states fail all the time in the world, will Venezuela ever go back to a Bolivar-style system or will Bitcoin eventually become the defacto currency of Venezuela and will these countries that use Bitcoin for stability end up just using them for their economy in the future?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"74fb\" name=\"74fb\">Jay Kang: I think there\u2019s zero chance that they switch to Bitcoin as their currency. It\u2019s not just Venezuela obviously that\u2019s interested in this. There are a lot of much more powerful countries including our own that have a lot of incentive to not make that happen. I think that they will apply any sort of military or political pressure possible to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e62a\" name=\"e62a\">Aaron Lammer: Maybe going Bitcoin economy will be the new going Marxist for our country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a4e\" name=\"2a4e\">Jay Kang: The new Cold War between companies on the-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2d70\" name=\"2d70\">Aaron Lammer: Yeah, it will be [crosstalk 01:00:09] maximalism. If we let maximalism spread to Columbia, we\u2019re going to lose all of Central America.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7ae1\" name=\"7ae1\">Jay Kang: Yeah, [inaudible 01:00:18] is the new-</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"de5c\" name=\"de5c\">Aaron Lammer: Becomes the new Cheng.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9d5a\" name=\"9d5a\">Jay Kang: He becomes a freedom fighter.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1168\" name=\"1168\">Aaron Lammer: Again, I would see that movie.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a754\" name=\"a754\">Jay Kang: I would see that movie, but I would not want to live in that country.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"04dd\" name=\"04dd\">Aaron Lammer: All right, well, good talking. I have a feeling we\u2019ll probably be talking about the Venezuela stuff again because it seems like it\u2019s a story that\u2019s only growing.</p></div></div>"}

{"content": " They\u2019ve always done my sonograms in tiny windowless rooms\u2014warm and humid rooms with overhead lights they can dim so I don\u2019t have to close my eyes when lying back. I think they save the bigger rooms for women who have someone with them. Technicians always speak in soothing tones, their practiced expressionless faces turned slightly away, focused on my insides rather than my external presentation. Not that I cry or anything\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe a little sharp intake of breath as they push down on the bladder they make me keep full\u200a\u2014\u200abecause I\u2019ve practiced my own expressionlessness, too.It\u2019s easier to wear dresses when you go, but no one tells you that before your first one. With a dress, there\u2019s no wriggling my pants down and my shirt up while trying not to rip the paper on the table, no tucking the zipper of my jeans under the folds of my burgeoning belly without it scratching. With a dress, I can just pull it up over my waist (like that last time we had sex, when we couldn\u2019t wait to undress, mutually desperate for that moment of ecstatic physical connection) and pull my stockings or underwear down, and, when it\u2019s done (again, like that last time we fucked), wipe away the goo that\u2019s left over and get on my way.My last one was different, of course. Hung over after two days of post-breakup binge drinking, exhaling mezcal fumes with every breath that the technician must\u2019ve smelled, it took three attempts to get my dehydrated husk of a 40-year-old body to have a full enough bladder for the machine to look inside my uterus. I was glad there wasn\u2019t an empty chair next to the table for a once-loved one to sit in, and when she pressed down and I inhaled sharply as my insides appeared in black-and-white on the just-visible screen, it was less because of how badly I had to pee and more because I heard his voice in my head, telling me how he hadn\u2019t wanted more children but that he thought he should have one with me.I closed my eyes and counted to 10 as she clicked and typed, and clicked and typed, forcing the muscles under my eyes to relax and the ones under my throat to contract, not crying.\u201cThis one is the most important one,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI know it\u2019s uncomfortable, but because it\u2019s at the base of your uterus, we can\u2019t really see farther up once we do the transvaginal.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cDo what you need to do.\u201dShe clicked and typed, and clicked and typed, and I half-stared at the screen, hands resting just under my breasts, trying not to imagine what it would be like to look at it with happy anticipation instead of dread.Her clicking slowed, and her movements became more tentative. \u201cHow many did you say there were?\u201d she said, looking over at her computer for my last sonogram as reference.\u201cTwo,\u201d I said, \u201cOne at the bottom and one nearer to the top.\u201dShe looked, and moved the wand, and looked and moved the wand, and pursed her lips.\u201cI think I see a third,\u201d she said.My body, you see, has never produced a baby, but sometime in the past few years, it became a producer of prodigious uterine fibroid tumors. And two days after my latest breakup, in January, I found out that it had produced a third.\u201cThey feed on your blood,\u201d the technician said, half to herself, pressing down and looking at the screen again. \u201cLittle bloodsuckers.\u201dElizabeth Stewart, MD, of Mayo Clinic, literally wrote the book on uterine fibroids and sees and treats patients in addition to her research. \u201cAlmost 70 percent of white women and over 80 percent of black women will be diagnosed with fibroids within their lifetime,\u201d she said to me over the phone in February 2018 with just the slightest hint of a comforting Minnesota accent. And yet, Stewart notes that the research on them, let alone funding for such research, is still pretty thin.\u201cIf you look at cancer therapy,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of research that\u2019s been done to say if I have breast cancer that\u2019s this stage, and this grade, and that these molecules expressed on the tumor, then I\u2019m better off doing a lumpectomy and radiation. Whereas if I have something else, I may be better off doing a mastectomy or a lumpectomy and chemotherapy. We don\u2019t have that kind of research to tell us what to do for fibroids, so it\u2019s a hard field to navigate.\u201dThere are, however, a variety of treatments: hormones to mitigate the major symptoms of fibroids, which include pain and prolonged bleeding (though only treatments that block the production of estrogen and progesterone and thus simulate menopause actually shrink the growths), and a variety of surgical and nonsurgical interventions to remove them, like myomectomy (in which individual fibroids are removed), uterine artery embolization (which cuts off some of the blood flow to the uterus and causes the fibroids to shrink), endometrial ablation (in which the uterine lining is eliminated), or MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (in which the fibroids are destroyed with sound waves).But the most common surgical treatment, even in 2018, is hysterectomy: 75 percent of women who opt for or require some sort treatment for fibroids end up having their uteruses\u200a\u2014\u200aand, in some cases, their ovaries and cervixes\u200a\u2014\u200aremoved.Stewart doesn\u2019t believe that all of these hysterectomies are completely necessary. \u201cMany more women could have alternatives to hysterectomy,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes their doctor tells them about it, but says, \u2018Well, but you know, if you have a hysterectomy, then you\u2019re over and done with,\u2019 or says, \u2018I haven\u2019t seen good results with these.\u2019\u201dShe added, \u201cEducating yourself about the options is a critical step before you seek treatment.\u201dFibroids, physicians like Stewart say, run in families, but hysterectomies already ran in mine, so it\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s true in my case. Though we can talk about explosive diarrhea at the dinner table in my family, we don\u2019t tend to wax nostalgic about which reproductive system disorder caused the surgeons to cut us open and take our organs out.Stewart sees variations on that silence a lot. \u201cThis is one of the issues, since fibroids can run in families,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf your mother\u2019s periods last 10 days a month, or your sisters all have eight to 10 days of bleeding, when you say, \u2018Gee, you know, am I supposed to be living like this?\u2019 They go, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s all you can do.\u2019\u201dThe bleeding is, in Stewart\u2019s experience, what finally drives many of her patients to see doctors, whether because of anemia or sheer, embarrassing, life-disrupting volume. Others go because the pain gets so bad from the size or number of fibroids, or from the way they press on the patient\u2019s bladder and bowels, or from how they intensify period cramps that it convinces them something\u2019s just not right.Still others go to the doctor because their fibroids sat quietly, maybe even relatively painlessly, until the women carrying and feeding them wanted to get pregnant or tried and failed to carry a pregnancy to term. Infertility isn\u2019t just the result of the most common treatment for fibroids; it can also be one of the symptoms\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is ironic, because any pregnancy carried to term reduces your risk of future fibroids.It\u2019s almost as if, having never gestated a baby, your uterus just wants to produce something.At least for now, a hysterectomy isn\u2019t on the table for me; doctors tend to be loath to sterilize white women who have yet to fulfill their biological destiny. Not that it would matter, though, because the surgeon I saw last year said that even on the off chance any sperm could swim up and around the large fibroid at the base of my uterus and worm its way to the center of a healthy, 40-year-old egg in one of my Fallopian tubes, the likelihood that a zygote could find any spare plot of uterine wall to call its own amid the masses was small. And even if life really did win out, the surge in hormones would cause the fibroids grow even more rapidly, suffocating the zygote and probably causing a miscarriage.Little bloodsuckers.I was diagnosed in 2012, not because I was bleeding that much (I told myself) or my periods hurt that much (I told myself), but because my doctor felt something amiss during a pelvic exam just before my 35th birthday. The first question she asked when we had the first set of sonogram results in hand, and then kept asking me every year, is whether I was planning on having children.What she was really asking (what she never said she was really asking) is how long I\u2019d be willing to put up with it\u200a\u2014\u200athe searing pain of my intensifying period cramps, the way I\u2019d start spurting blood while changing a tampon, the ruined sheets and sofa cushions and jeans and underwear like I was 12 all over again, the potential anemia, and, of course, the gentle swelling of my lower belly that no sit-ups can tame as my uterus swelled with growths\u200a\u2014\u200aon the off chance that, after some sort of probably surgical intervention, I might be able to conceive and carry to term a baby that\u2019s more than a faceless uterine vampire.She didn\u2019t really believe me when I said no.Or maybe I didn\u2019t believe myself.I was 31 before I\u2019d ever really considered even the idea of having children. I\u2019d been in long-term relationships. I had a friend who swore her biological clock was literally, audibly ticking, and I suggested, because I\u2019m an asshole, that she wasn\u2019t Captain Hook. I\u2019d held babies and smelled their little baby heads and felt that moment of biologically induced peace wash over me. But there was never any ovarian twinge or gripping need or rushing urge to incubate one of my own in my then-pristine uterus.Every time somebody asked if I wanted to have children\u200a\u2014\u200aand in my twenties, it wasn\u2019t the sort of question anyone asked until we were already fairly involved\u200a\u2014\u200aI just said that I didn\u2019t, not really.Dave, however, made it clear early in our relationship, the first of my thirties, that kids were something he desperately wanted to have. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an old father, Megan,\u201d he\u2019d say as we curled up in bed, and I\u2019d look at the creases at the corners his eyes and the couple of gray hairs he hadn\u2019t mentioned noticing, and I\u2019d smile. And as we tumbled around each other that summer and into the fall of 2009 in a haze of oxytocin and affection and certainty about our future together, I thought about what it would be like to look into his dark-brown eyes over the head of a curly-haired, giggling mini-him and thought, \u201cOh, maybe I do want that, with him.\u201dFive months later\u200a\u2014\u200afour months after our breakup\u200a\u2014\u200ahe dropped me an email to let me know his new girlfriend was pregnant. It was over Christmas; my younger sister was halfway through her first pregnancy and bitching about her sciatica, lumbering around uncomfortably and keeping anyone from giving her soon-to-be firstborn a nickname that might stick.I buried that moment of desire for children with all the rest of the hope I\u2019d felt for us, focusing my attention instead on the stoner man-child with whom I\u2019d taken to sharing a never-made bed. He swore he didn\u2019t want children; I generally think teenagers, emotional or otherwise, don\u2019t really make the best parents, so we were on the same page. He and his now-wife had a baby within a year of their wedding, several years after we broke up.The question of whether I wanted kids kept coming up throughout my thirties, however, on every second date, in every longer-term relationship. There\u2019s something about dating at that age, maybe, when everyone feels like they\u2019re running out of time or really wants to make sure that you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re running out of time. But like Nancy Reagan taught us to, I just said no.In a way, dating and having my semiannual fibroid assessment weren\u2019t that different: a near-stranger, having had their face and hands buried in my crotch, asks with a concerned face if I\u2019m thinking about having kids in the near future, and I reassure whomever that I\u2019m not.When I was diagnosed, saying I did not want kids was easy: I was about to embark on my first-ever cohabitation adventure with a man who also did not want kids, and I was happy with what we were building. Plus, the fibroid\u200a\u2014\u200aI named it Frank\u200a\u2014\u200awasn\u2019t that big or that bad, and my doctor suggested we just monitor it and see what happened.And so we monitored. I\u2019d maneuver myself onto an exam table every six months, make a little small talk, reassure the technician I knew she was looking for a fibroid so she didn\u2019t have to practice her blank face. My periods got heavier and heavier. I started buying giant bottles of hydrogen peroxide to get stains out of the sheets, my jeans, my nice underwear, the cushions of the cerulean sofa that my mom bought us as a housewarming gift. I woke up in the middle of the night once, my uterus contracting around something that felt hard and immobile, that felt like it stayed still while I twisted my insides around it, moaning in pain, and, as he snored next to me, spent half an hour agony-panting with the nurse on my health insurance\u2019s doctor line trying to figure out if I should go to the ER. She sent me a keychain afterward; my doctor gave me a prescription pain medication.I bought black underwear, changed the kind of tampons I used, scrubbed blood spots off the bathroom floor, refilled my prescription pain pills. My friend and former boss Anna Holmes, who was diagnosed around the same time as me with a much more serious case (African American women, already more likely to have fibroids than white women, are also more likely to have more and/or larger fibroids at younger ages) had hers removed and sent me a picture, taken by the surgeon, of a plastic Tupperware bin full of veiny Silly Putty\u2013colored masses resting on a surgical drape. It was gross and amazing and, it turns out, is still in the archives of my phone.Then, in 2016, I found out that Frank had grown bigger than my doctor was comfortable with.\u201cI think we should talk about your options,\u201d she said in our meeting after my first sonogram that year.\u201cIt had been a long journey with this uterus of mine,\u201d author and professor Melissa Harris-Perry told me on the phone, laughing a little. \u201cWe\u2019d done all kinds of things together, and ultimately parted ways.\u201dIn 2008, Harris-Perry wrote an essay about having fibroids and choosing to have a hysterectomy at 34; when Anna told me about her diagnosis, I emailed it to her. It has stuck with me in part because Harris-Perry described being at work\u200a\u2014\u200aon air, as a political analyst for CNN\u200a\u2014\u200aand having to deal with the bleeding. \u201cI was losing so much blood that I sat on set and sent a text to my best friend: \u2018If u dont c me after commercial call 911. I might pass out in ladies room.\u2019\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure what I feared more: death by menstruation (the whole point is that men are supposed to mistrust something that bleeds three to five days a month but doesn\u2019t die, after all) or the idea that you could be a grown woman and still not have your goddamn period under control, bleeding all over yourself and everything else in a public place like it was seventh grade all over again. Of course, it had already happened to me, even before I read her piece: I was at a magazine party when blood started seeping down my legs, trapped by my pantyhose, and I tried to wind my way through the crowd to the bathroom when I was waylaid by someone important. I smiled politely in interminable conversation as I felt the wet, warm blood work itself lower and lower on my thighs toward the hem of my skirt, my panic rising.For Harris-Perry, though, the embarrassment was less keen than the real fear that she might die of the related anemia. She got the call while at Disney World with her then six-year-old daughter: \u201cMy doctor said to me, \u2018You need to find your way to an emergency room or a physician. You need to get iron on board.\u2019 And I remember saying to her, \u2018Listen lady, I\u2019m fat. You ever seen a fat girl die of anemia?\u2019\u201d she said, with another laugh.\u201cBut,\u201d Harris-Perry continued, \u201cI remember her using the words \u2018life-threatening.\u2019 Now, I\u2019m standing alone as single parent, and in that moment\u200a\u2014\u200alike, when I think about fear, that is the thing that makes it not like the 13-year-old\u2019s moment of just general embarrassment\u200a\u2014\u200aI really thought about the fact that my life was in danger. And, as a single parent, that was just not\u2026,\u201d she trailed off, voice starting to break. \u201cI mean, it was devastating.\u201dLike mine, Harris-Perry\u2019s doctor wanted to figure out if she was planning on having more children soon. \u201cIt was one of those really irritating things,\u201d she said about the focus on her future fertility. \u201cI\u2019m a person, standing over here bleeding to death all of the time, and so whether or not I\u2019m gonna have a child might be less important than this. Because, actually, I\u2019m never gonna be able to go on another date if I\u2019m bleeding all the time. So then I won\u2019t be having any fucking kids,\u201d she added.Her fibroid took a toll beyond the unmanageable periods and anemia, too. \u201cI felt older then than I do now, 10 years later,\u201d Harris-Perry said, \u201cbecause I carried weight, because I was again really unable to exercise in the ways that I wanted, and so my body felt creaky and painful all the time. I wanted it to be over. I just couldn\u2019t imagine continuing to manage it. It was so depressing.\u201dAnd so Harris-Perry, who already had a daughter, opted for a hysterectomy\u200a\u2014\u200aalbeit one that would preserve her cervix and ovaries, which she says helped make her decision easier. \u201cWe talk a lot about keeping your ovaries for the hormonal purposes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even though I wasn\u2019t dating, I did expect to have penetrative sex again with a man at some point again in my life, hopefully not that far off. And I didn\u2019t want to lose my cervix in part because it was part of my sexual pleasure, and often that of my partner\u2019s.\u201d\u201cWhat did matter to me was less the question of fertility, but that I had a lot of my womanhood, identity, and sexual pleasure tied up in the surgery,\u201d Harris-Perry continued. \u201cAnd the fact that there were options that preserved those things while allowing me to know I didn\u2019t have to deal with the fibroids anymore and all the side effects of that was important to me.\u201dStill, she told me, even though a hysterectomy was the right decision for her, she couldn\u2019t stop the what-ifs. \u201cYou regret any choice you make about fertility,\u201d Harris-Perry told me. \u201cYou regret your children, you know. You regret your abortions. Any choice you make, you will have moments when you regret it.\u201dBut there was another level of emotion for Harris-Perry in choosing a hysterectomy that I won\u2019t experience, if and when my time comes. \u201cI did feel some guilt about making the choice, because I read, and knew, and maybe even reported that black women are so much more likely to get hysterectomies and that it also happens because they are pressured,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think it took me a minute to make the decision because I almost felt like I shouldn\u2019t do it, because so many other people didn\u2019t have a choice or had experienced involuntary sterilization in our history.\u201d\u201cIt was a specific angst about how Fannie Loe Hamer didn\u2019t get to make this choice, and my grandmamas didn\u2019t get to make this choice,\u201d Harris-Perry added. \u201cAnd here I could preserve my uterus and I\u2019m not, and is it like not voting? Is it this terrible thing I\u2019m doing to my foremothers?\u201dHaving an African American woman gynecologist helped, she told me: Harris-Perry was able to talk through her concerns, her options, and her potential outcomes and feel comfortable about the decision she made\u200a\u2014\u200ain part because any option that might have preserved her fertility came with a risk that the fibroids would recur.\u201cIt\u2019s the oddest thing,\u201d Harris-Perry explained, \u201cbut that hysterectomy is probably the reason I ended up ultimately with a second child.\u201d She and her now-husband, James Perry, added a daughter to their family in 2014, after using IVF and surrogacy. \u201cI really was in such a state, physically and emotionally, that I probably wasn\u2019t able to date just because I was constantly managing this physical thing\u200a\u2014\u200aat work, in my mind, recreationally.\u201d\u201cIt was always the thing I was thinking about,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd so there wouldn\u2019t have been any space for relationship-making with someone new.\u201dFibroid Frank had grown to the size of a fetus at the end of its first trimester by the time my gynecologist wanted to talk through my realistic options\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding whether 38-year-old me was in the market to aim for a now-geriatric pregnancy.\u201cAre you and your partner planning on having children?\u201d my gynecologist asked me in her cozy file-and-uterus-model-filled office. Something about the way I set my mouth must\u2019ve betrayed me. The cohabitation thing we\u2019d started together, filled with hope nearly four years before, was on the skids, and the first thought that popped into my head was that it\u2019d be hard to get pregnant, even if we wanted to, if we weren\u2019t really having sex.She leaned over and said, kindly, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to make that decision today, but you\u2019re going to have to make it soon, because it\u2019s only going to get harder from here.\u201d My eyes started to get watery, not because (as she thought) I was contemplating a life without children, but because I knew he and I would have to make a decision soon, and that it would get harder, and that it wouldn\u2019t be about my uterus.My gynecologist sent me out for a round of different tests\u200a\u2014\u200afor anemia, of course, as well as an anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) test, which is an indicator of egg health and, some studies have shown, time to menopause. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll have early menopause,\u201d she said, almost cheerfully. \u201cI went through menopause very young. There\u2019s no point in worrying about this if you\u2019re close to menopause.\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure as I left her office with an order in hand what would be worse: possibly ending a long-term relationship with a vicious, biting fibroid lodged in my uterus that might require major surgery or ending it and immediately getting to enjoy menopause.\u201cDeciding which alternative to hysterectomy is right for which woman is a relatively complex process,\u201d Dr. Stewart explained to me on the phone this February. \u201cYou have to take into account her age, and the size of her fibroids, and what symptoms she\u2019s having, and where the fibroids are.\u201d\u201cI think that the most interesting fact about hysterectomy is the fact that only 10 percent of hysterectomies are done for any kind of cancer,\u201d she added. \u201cFibroids, abnormal bleeding, endometriosis, pelvic prolapse, those kinds of conditions where there are other alternatives that can be tried, account for 90 percent of the surgeries.\u201dStewart continued, \u201cMost hysterectomies do have alternatives. They may not all be the optimal treatment, but I think women who are presented with choices of hysterectomy or nothing when the problem is fibroids should be a little bit suspicious.\u201dI saw my doctor for a follow-up appointment a few weeks after my blood tests: The AMH test strongly suggested that, like the rest of the women to whom I bear more than a passing physical resemblance, I had a solid decade to go before my body would cut off either Frank\u2019s or my supply of sweet, sweet estrogen. She said we needed to have a more serious discussion after my next sonogram, depending on how much larger my fibroid had gotten.I skipped my next sonogram.I didn\u2019t skip it skip it, I told myself: My job ended, my relationship ended, my health insurance for my new job hadn\u2019t started, my insurance started but then my new job ended in layoffs, my grandfather died, and finally the order for the sonogram got stolen with the rest of my wallet at a wine bar when a girlfriend was trying to cheer me up.I started dating again, the merry-go-round of telling the same stories about myself and asking the same questions about various dudes until we\u2019d gotten tipsy enough to see if it was worth kissing one another. I got a new job and sat at my desk the second week, jaw clenched as Frank roared, trying to assert his independence from my otherwise functional uterus; I was fully prepared to vomit from the pain into my desk trash can. I finally went home in the middle of the day as the nausea eased, shuffling toward the subway like an elderly woman, trying to stay upright, and curled up in bed alone with a heating pad to comfort Frank.I called my doctor, asked to replace the order that had been in my stolen wallet, and made the sonogram appointment. Then I had dinner with Dave.The truth is that, after Dave, I never really said no when someone asked me if I wanted kids\u200a\u2014\u200athe second time someone asked, anyway. I\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted children in a vacuum. It seems like something I either want or don\u2019t want in the context of a relationship,\u201d and I just didn\u2019t mention that I\u2019d only ever found the one context in which I wanted them. (That\u2019s something you tell your therapist, not your gynecologist.) It felt\u200a\u2014\u200ait feels\u200a\u2014\u200alike something I would need to do with someone I loved more than I had ever loved anyone, someone I trusted wouldn\u2019t leave, someone who could, with me, give a child of mine what I had growing up and maybe more: a two-parent, happy family\u2026or else something I\u2019m not really keen to do at all.But I knew the ultrasound would show Frank had gotten larger; I knew that whatever decision we made about surgery would ultimately depend on whether I wanted to remain fertile; I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to just tell myself children just hadn\u2019t worked out for me if I paid a doctor to render me infertile before my time. And I guess a little part of me thought Dave would have part of the answer to the question no one believed my answer to.He didn\u2019t, but he did have the money to pay for his half of two bottles of wine and the kindness to watch me drunkenly sob my way through telling him I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to be infertile, even if it was ultimately less bloody and painful, when I had wanted kids for that brief period with him, before he went and had them with somebody else. And he looked at me with some sort of sadness and what I tell myself wasn\u2019t pity, hugged me, and then he went home to his two curly-haired, brown-eyed kids.I slept off the hangover.Two days later, I lay back in another windowless room, pulled my sundress up to display my belly for another expressionless technician, and went to work late with the sneaking suspicion I\u2019d missed a spot of goo.In August, I met with a surgeon to review my results. Where there had been one fibroid, he told me, there were two and there would likely be more. He asked me if I wanted to have children.And he told me that in all likelihood, without surgery, I was probably functionally infertile now.I started seeing my most recent ex a couple weeks later: We swiped right, exchanged messages, switched to text, met for dinner. It clicked right away: He changed his work schedule to accommodate our seeing one another. We exchanged text messages from morning until night on the days we didn\u2019t. The conversation about whether we wanted children happened early, as they always do when you\u2019re a woman near 40, and I said I\u2019d never really had the urge to have kids, and he said he didn\u2019t want more than the one he already had.We were making plans to go to Italy for my 40th birthday, and he was daydreaming about where we\u2019d be in six months, given as close as we\u2019d gotten in two, when in the middle of our rapid-fire morning text exchange, he suddenly asked me again if I wanted kids.So I told him the whole truth: I had fibroids, and without major surgery, I was unlikely to be able to conceive. And with major surgery, I\u2019d probably be resigning myself to a C-section if I did choose to have them.Then I texted: \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want any more, though. Still true?\u201d\u201cYep,\u201d he replied. \u201cUnless we decide otherwise.\u201d\u201cYour brain deserves replicating.\u201dI don\u2019t know why I took it so seriously, except that I don\u2019t say shit like that if I don\u2019t really, really mean it. Plus, he\u2019d bring up having kids every so often, out of the blue, like it had been on his mind\u200a\u2014\u200athat he hadn\u2019t really thought about having another kid until being with me, how different parenting would be with me than it had been with his ex if he and I had a baby\u200a\u2014\u200aand as we settled into what felt like a happy, functional routine, I thought about my surgical options, and my next sonogram, and what to say about whether I wanted kids this next time when the doctor asked.Could it really be with a two-time divorc\u00e9 with a kid of his own, the kind of man who had a framed picture of his son\u2019s nine-year-old sonogram on his dresser in a frame that read \u201cLove at first sight\u201d?It wasn\u2019t, of course. His text messages slowed, I withdrew, he withdrew, and one night, two days before my last sonogram, we held each other in my bed as he stroked my hair and said that he wasn\u2019t sure that he could fall in love with anyone again, and I sighed and stopped crying and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and we said our goodbyes.That\u2019s the problem with contextual desires\u200a\u2014\u200athe context changes.I\u2019ve named the new fibroid Malcolm (because he\u2019s in the middle); I can tell he\u2019s going to be a sonofabitch. And I\u2019ll go back to the doctor soon, and she\u2019ll ask me if I want children, and maybe I\u2019ll tell her the truth this time: that I\u2019ve never felt that socio-biological urge to gestate and raise a baby at any cost, but every once in a blue moon, I have the inkling of a desire to build a family, someday, of something more than anthropomorphized uterine bloodsuckers.Or maybe I\u2019ll just say no. Because it\u2019s easier.Illustration: Audrey Lee.

rooms\u2014warm and humid rooms with overhead lights they can dim so I don\u2019t have to close my eyes when lying back. I think they save the bigger rooms for women who have someone with them. Technicians always speak in soothing tones, their practiced expressionless faces turned slightly away, focused on my insides rather than my external presentation. Not that I cry or anything\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe a little sharp intake of breath as they push down on the bladder they make me keep full\u200a\u2014\u200abecause I\u2019ve practiced my own expressionlessness, too.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f711\" name=\"f711\">It\u2019s easier to wear dresses when you go, but no one tells you that before your first one. With a dress, there\u2019s no wriggling my pants down and my shirt up while trying not to rip the paper on the table, no tucking the zipper of my jeans under the folds of my burgeoning belly without it scratching. With a dress, I can just pull it up over my waist (like that last time we had sex, when we couldn\u2019t wait to undress, mutually desperate for that moment of ecstatic physical connection) and pull my stockings or underwear down, and, when it\u2019s done (again, like that last time we fucked), wipe away the goo that\u2019s left over and get on my way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d632\" name=\"d632\">My last one was different, of course. Hung over after two days of post-breakup binge drinking, exhaling mezcal fumes with every breath that the technician must\u2019ve smelled, it took three attempts to get my dehydrated husk of a 40-year-old body to have a full enough bladder for the machine to look inside my uterus. I was glad there wasn\u2019t an empty chair next to the table for a once-loved one to sit in, and when she pressed down and I inhaled sharply as my insides appeared in black-and-white on the just-visible screen, it was less because of how badly I had to pee and more because I heard his voice in my head, telling me how he hadn\u2019t wanted more children but that he thought he should have one with me.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"483f\" name=\"483f\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 377px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53.800000000000004%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg\" data-height=\"1723\" data-image-id=\"1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"c984\" name=\"c984\">I closed my eyes and counted to 10 as she clicked and typed, and clicked and typed, forcing the muscles under my eyes to relax and the ones under my throat to contract, not crying.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"15d2\" name=\"15d2\">\u201cThis one is the most important one,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI know it\u2019s uncomfortable, but because it\u2019s at the base of your uterus, we can\u2019t really see farther up once we do the transvaginal.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d32d\" name=\"d32d\">\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cDo what you need to do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b3b\" name=\"7b3b\">She clicked and typed, and clicked and typed, and I half-stared at the screen, hands resting just under my breasts, trying not to imagine what it would be like to look at it with happy anticipation instead of dread.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"96c9\" name=\"96c9\">Her clicking slowed, and her movements became more tentative. \u201cHow many did you say there were?\u201d she said, looking over at her computer for my last sonogram as reference.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c156\" name=\"c156\">\u201cTwo,\u201d I said, \u201cOne at the bottom and one nearer to the top.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f286\" name=\"f286\">She looked, and moved the wand, and looked and moved the wand, and pursed her lips.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ec96\" name=\"ec96\">\u201cI think I see a third,\u201d she said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e01d\" name=\"e01d\">My body, you see, has never produced a baby, but sometime in the past few years, it became a producer of prodigious uterine fibroid tumors.

Whereas if I have something else, I may be better off doing a mastectomy or a lumpectomy and chemotherapy. We don\u2019t have that kind of research to tell us what to do for fibroids, so it\u2019s a hard field to navigate.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b3f3\" name=\"b3f3\">There are, however, a variety of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354294\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354294\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">treatments</a>: hormones to mitigate the major symptoms of fibroids, which include pain and prolonged bleeding (though only treatments that block the production of estrogen and progesterone and thus simulate menopause actually shrink the growths), and a variety of surgical and nonsurgical interventions to remove them, like myomectomy (in which individual fibroids are removed), uterine artery embolization (which cuts off some of the blood flow to the uterus and causes the fibroids to shrink), endometrial ablation (in which the uterine lining is eliminated), or MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (in which the fibroids are destroyed with sound waves).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e75f\" name=\"e75f\">But the most common surgical treatment, even in 2018, is hysterectomy: 75 percent of women who opt for or require some sort treatment for fibroids end up having their uteruses\u200a\u2014\u200aand, in some cases, their ovaries and cervixes\u200a\u2014\u200aremoved.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a33\" name=\"7a33\">Stewart doesn\u2019t believe that all of these hysterectomies are completely necessary. \u201cMany more women could have alternatives to hysterectomy,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes their doctor tells them about it, but says, \u2018Well, but you know, if you have a hysterectomy, then you\u2019re over and done with,\u2019 or says, \u2018I haven\u2019t seen good results with these.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd2c\" name=\"dd2c\">She added, \u201cEducating yourself about the options is a critical step before you seek treatment.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"13e3\" name=\"13e3\">Fibroids, physicians like Stewart say, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/uterine-fibroids\" href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/uterine-fibroids\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">run in families</a>, but hysterectomies already ran in mine, so it\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s true in my case. Though we can talk about explosive diarrhea at the dinner table in my family, we don\u2019t tend to wax nostalgic about which reproductive system disorder caused the surgeons to cut us open and take our organs out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"17ae\" name=\"17ae\">Stewart sees variations on that silence a lot. \u201cThis is one of the issues, since fibroids can run in families,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf your mother\u2019s periods last 10 days a month, or your sisters all have eight to 10 days of bleeding, when you say, \u2018Gee, you know, am I supposed to be living like this?\u2019 They go, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s all you can do.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"495b\" name=\"495b\">The bleeding is, in Stewart\u2019s experience, what finally drives many of her patients to see doctors, whether because of anemia or sheer, embarrassing, life-disrupting volume. Others go because the pain gets so bad from the size or number of fibroids, or from the way they press on the patient\u2019s bladder and bowels, or from how they intensify period cramps that it convinces them something\u2019s just not right.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c3d8\" name=\"c3d8\">Still others go to the doctor because their fibroids sat quietly, maybe even relatively painlessly, until the women carrying and feeding them wanted to get pregnant or tried and failed to carry a pregnancy to term. Infertility isn\u2019t just the result of the most common treatment for fibroids; it can also be one of the symptoms\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is ironic, because any pregnancy carried to term reduces your risk of future fibroids.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7fea\" name=\"7fea\">It\u2019s almost as if, having never gestated a baby, your uterus just wants to produce <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">something</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6407\" name=\"6407\">At least for now, a hysterectomy isn\u2019t on the table for me; doctors tend to be loath to sterilize white women who have yet to fulfill their biological destiny. Not that it would matter, though, because the surgeon I saw last year said that even on the off chance any sperm could swim up and around the large fibroid at the base of my uterus and worm its way to the center of a healthy, 40-year-old egg in one of my Fallopian tubes, the likelihood that a zygote could find any spare plot of uterine wall to call its own amid the masses was small. And even if life really did win out, the surge in hormones would cause the fibroids grow even more rapidly, suffocating the zygote and probably causing a miscarriage.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2769\" name=\"2769\">Little bloodsuckers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bb39\" name=\"bb39\">I was diagnosed in 2012, not because I was bleeding that much (I told myself) or my periods hurt that much (I told myself), but because my doctor felt something amiss during a pelvic exam just before my 35th birthday.

It was over Christmas; my younger sister was halfway through her first pregnancy and bitching about her sciatica, lumbering around uncomfortably and keeping anyone from giving her soon-to-be firstborn a nickname that might stick.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5bf2\" name=\"5bf2\">I buried that moment of desire for children with all the rest of the hope I\u2019d felt for us, focusing my attention instead on the stoner man-child with whom I\u2019d taken to sharing a never-made bed. He swore he didn\u2019t want children; I generally think teenagers, emotional or otherwise, don\u2019t really make the best parents, so we were on the same page. He and his now-wife had a baby within a year of their wedding, several years after we broke up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d9dc\" name=\"d9dc\">The question of whether I wanted kids kept coming up throughout my thirties, however, on every second date, in every longer-term relationship. There\u2019s something about dating at that age, maybe, when everyone feels like they\u2019re running out of time or really wants to make sure that you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re running out of time. But like Nancy Reagan taught us to, I just said no.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3c5d\" name=\"3c5d\">In a way, dating and having my semiannual fibroid assessment weren\u2019t that different: a near-stranger, having had their face and hands buried in my crotch, asks with a concerned face if I\u2019m thinking about having kids in the near future, and I reassure whomever that I\u2019m not.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9884\" name=\"9884\">When I was diagnosed, saying I did not want kids was easy: I was about to embark on my first-ever cohabitation adventure with a man who also did not want kids, and I was happy with what we were building. Plus, the fibroid\u200a\u2014\u200aI named it Frank\u200a\u2014\u200awasn\u2019t that big or that bad, and my doctor suggested we just monitor it and see what happened.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b7c\" name=\"7b7c\">And so we monitored. I\u2019d maneuver myself onto an exam table every six months, make a little small talk, reassure the technician I knew she was looking for a fibroid so she didn\u2019t have to practice her blank face. My periods got heavier and heavier. I started buying giant bottles of hydrogen peroxide to get stains out of the sheets, my jeans, my nice underwear, the cushions of the cerulean sofa that my mom bought us as a housewarming gift. I woke up in the middle of the night once, my uterus contracting around something that felt hard and immobile, that felt like it stayed still while I twisted my insides around it, moaning in pain, and, as he snored next to me, spent half an hour agony-panting with the nurse on my health insurance\u2019s doctor line trying to figure out if I should go to the ER. She sent me a keychain afterward; my doctor gave me a prescription pain medication.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9283\" name=\"9283\">I bought black underwear, changed the kind of tampons I used, scrubbed blood spots off the bathroom floor, refilled my prescription pain pills. My friend and former boss Anna Holmes, who was diagnosed around the same time as me with a much more serious case (African American women, already more likely to have fibroids than white women, are also <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/symptoms-causes/syc-20354288\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/symptoms-causes/syc-20354288\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more likely to have more and/or larger fibroids at younger ages</a>) had hers removed and sent me a picture, taken by the surgeon, of a plastic Tupperware bin full of veiny Silly Putty\u2013colored masses resting on a surgical drape.

I wanted it to be over. I just couldn\u2019t imagine continuing to manage it. It was so depressing.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4861\" name=\"4861\">And so Harris-Perry, who already had a daughter, opted for a hysterectomy\u200a\u2014\u200aalbeit one that would preserve her cervix and ovaries, which she says helped make her decision easier. \u201cWe talk a lot about keeping your ovaries for the hormonal purposes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even though I wasn\u2019t dating, I did expect to have penetrative sex again with a man at some point again in my life, hopefully not that far off. And I didn\u2019t want to lose my cervix in part because it was part of my sexual pleasure, and often that of my partner\u2019s.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"36b0\" name=\"36b0\">\u201cWhat did matter to me was less the question of fertility, but that I had a lot of my womanhood, identity, and sexual pleasure tied up in the surgery,\u201d Harris-Perry continued. \u201cAnd the fact that there were options that preserved those things while allowing me to know I didn\u2019t have to deal with the fibroids anymore and all the side effects of that was important to me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dc8b\" name=\"dc8b\">Still, she told me, even though a hysterectomy was the right decision for her, she couldn\u2019t stop the what-ifs. \u201cYou regret any choice you make about fertility,\u201d Harris-Perry told me. \u201cYou regret your children, you know. You regret your abortions. Any choice you make, you will have moments when you regret it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d9f5\" name=\"d9f5\">But there was another level of emotion for Harris-Perry in choosing a hysterectomy that I won\u2019t experience, if and when my time comes. \u201cI did feel some guilt about making the choice, because I read, and knew, and maybe even reported that black women are so much more likely to get hysterectomies and that it also happens because they are pressured,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think it took me a minute to make the decision because I almost felt like I shouldn\u2019t do it, because so many other people didn\u2019t have a choice or had experienced involuntary sterilization in our history.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0d2d\" name=\"0d2d\">\u201cIt was a specific angst about how Fannie Loe Hamer didn\u2019t get to make this choice, and my grandmamas didn\u2019t get to make this choice,\u201d Harris-Perry added. \u201cAnd here I could preserve my uterus and I\u2019m not, and is it like not voting? Is it this terrible thing I\u2019m doing to my foremothers?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d6ab\" name=\"d6ab\">Having an African American woman gynecologist helped, she told me: Harris-Perry was able to talk through her concerns, her options, and her potential outcomes and feel comfortable about the decision she made\u200a\u2014\u200ain part because any option that might have preserved her fertility came with a risk that the fibroids would recur.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ee0b\" name=\"ee0b\">\u201cIt\u2019s the oddest thing,\u201d Harris-Perry explained, \u201cbut that hysterectomy is probably the reason I ended up ultimately with a second child.\u201d She and her now-husband, James Perry, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/how-we-made-our-miracle\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/how-we-made-our-miracle\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">added a daughter to their family in 2014</a>, after using IVF and surrogacy. \u201cI really was in such a state, physically and emotionally, that I probably wasn\u2019t able to date just because I was constantly managing this physical thing\u200a\u2014\u200aat work, in my mind, recreationally.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b390\" name=\"b390\">\u201cIt was always the thing I was thinking about,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd so there wouldn\u2019t have been any space for relationship-making with someone new.\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"9132\" name=\"9132\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 100px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 14.299999999999999%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg\" data-height=\"458\" data-image-id=\"1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf-after--figure\" id=\"cad2\" name=\"cad2\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 36.5px; height: 49px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 134.20000000000002%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"98\" data-image-id=\"1*rWbxZ-pzbveFKvj1ScNA_Q@2x.png\" data-width=\"73\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rWbxZ-pzbveFKvj1ScNA_Q@2x.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">F</span></span>ibroid Frank had grown to the size of a fetus at the end of its first trimester by the time my gynecologist wanted to talk through my realistic options\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding whether 38-year-old me was in the market to aim for a now-geriatric pregnancy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4a6f\" name=\"4a6f\">\u201cAre you and your partner planning on having children?\u201d my gynecologist asked me in her cozy file-and-uterus-model-filled office.

Plus, he\u2019d bring up having kids every so often, out of the blue, like it had been on his mind\u200a\u2014\u200athat he hadn\u2019t really thought about having another kid until being with me, how different parenting would be with me than it had been with his ex if he and I had a baby\u200a\u2014\u200aand as we settled into what felt like a happy, functional routine, I thought about my surgical options, and my next sonogram, and what to say about whether I wanted kids this next time when the doctor asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"34ae\" name=\"34ae\">Could it really be with a two-time divorc\u00e9 with a kid of his own, the kind of man who had a framed picture of his son\u2019s nine-year-old sonogram on his dresser in a frame that read \u201cLove at first sight\u201d?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bac3\" name=\"bac3\">It wasn\u2019t, of course. His text messages slowed, I withdrew, he withdrew, and one night, two days before my last sonogram, we held each other in my bed as he stroked my hair and said that he wasn\u2019t sure that he could fall in love with anyone again, and I sighed and stopped crying and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and we said our goodbyes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa4a\" name=\"aa4a\">That\u2019s the problem with contextual desires\u200a\u2014\u200athe context changes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4922\" name=\"4922\">I\u2019ve named the new fibroid Malcolm (because he\u2019s in the middle); I can tell he\u2019s going to be a sonofabitch. And I\u2019ll go back to the doctor soon, and she\u2019ll ask me if I want children, and maybe I\u2019ll tell her the truth this time: that I\u2019ve never felt that socio-biological urge to gestate and raise a baby at any cost, but every once in a blue moon, I have the inkling of a desire to build a family, someday, of something more than anthropomorphized uterine bloodsuckers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1968\" name=\"1968\">Or maybe I\u2019ll just say no.

Others go because the pain gets so bad from the size or number of fibroids, or from the way they press on the patient\u2019s bladder and bowels, or from how they intensify period cramps that it convinces them something\u2019s just not right.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"c3d8\\\" id=\\\"c3d8\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eStill others go to the doctor because their fibroids sat quietly, maybe even relatively painlessly, until the women carrying and feeding them wanted to get pregnant or tried and failed to carry a pregnancy to term.

Not that it would matter, though, because the surgeon I saw last year said that even on the off chance any sperm could swim up and around the large fibroid at the base of my uterus and worm its way to the center of a healthy, 40-year-old egg in one of my Fallopian tubes, the likelihood that a zygote could find any spare plot of uterine wall to call its own amid the masses was small. And even if life really did win out, the surge in hormones would cause the fibroids grow even more rapidly, suffocating the zygote and probably causing a miscarriage.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"2769\\\" id=\\\"2769\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eLittle bloodsuckers.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"bb39\\\" id=\\\"bb39\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eI was diagnosed in 2012, not because I was bleeding that much (I told myself) or my periods hurt that much (I told myself), but because my doctor felt something amiss during a pelvic exam just before my 35th birthday.

My periods got heavier and heavier.

I woke up in the middle of the night once, my uterus contracting around something that felt hard and immobile, that felt like it stayed still while I twisted my insides around it, moaning in pain, and, as he snored next to me, spent half an hour agony-panting with the nurse on my health insurance\u2019s doctor line trying to figure out if I should go to the ER.

I think they save the bigger rooms for women who have someone with them. Technicians always speak in soothing tones, their practiced expressionless faces turned slightly away, focused on my insides rather than my external presentation. Not that I cry or anything\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe a little sharp intake of breath as they push down on the bladder they make me keep full\u200a\u2014\u200abecause I\u2019ve practiced my own expressionlessness, too.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f711\" name=\"f711\">It\u2019s easier to wear dresses when you go, but no one tells you that before your first one. With a dress, there\u2019s no wriggling my pants down and my shirt up while trying not to rip the paper on the table, no tucking the zipper of my jeans under the folds of my burgeoning belly without it scratching. With a dress, I can just pull it up over my waist (like that last time we had sex, when we couldn\u2019t wait to undress, mutually desperate for that moment of ecstatic physical connection) and pull my stockings or underwear down, and, when it\u2019s done (again, like that last time we fucked), wipe away the goo that\u2019s left over and get on my way.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d632\" name=\"d632\">My last one was different, of course.

I was glad there wasn\u2019t an empty chair next to the table for a once-loved one to sit in, and when she pressed down and I inhaled sharply as my insides appeared in black-and-white on the just-visible screen, it was less because of how badly I had to pee and more because I heard his voice in my head, telling me how he hadn\u2019t wanted more children but that he thought he should have one with me.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"483f\" name=\"483f\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 377px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53.800000000000004%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg\" data-height=\"1723\" data-image-id=\"1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*W6IEb3K7bNgGDMqwm5hS7w@2x.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"c984\" name=\"c984\">I closed my eyes and counted to 10 as she clicked and typed, and clicked and typed, forcing the muscles under my eyes to relax and the ones under my throat to contract, not crying.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"15d2\" name=\"15d2\">\u201cThis one is the most important one,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI know it\u2019s uncomfortable, but because it\u2019s at the base of your uterus, we can\u2019t really see farther up once we do the transvaginal.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"d32d\" name=\"d32d\">\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cDo what you need to do.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b3b\" name=\"7b3b\">She clicked and typed, and clicked and typed, and I half-stared at the screen, hands resting just under my breasts, trying not to imagine what it would be like to look at it with happy anticipation instead of dread.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"96c9\" name=\"96c9\">Her clicking slowed, and her movements became more tentative. \u201cHow many did you say there were?\u201d she said, looking over at her computer for my last sonogram as reference.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"c156\" name=\"c156\">\u201cTwo,\u201d I said, \u201cOne at the bottom and one nearer to the top.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f286\" name=\"f286\">She looked, and moved the wand, and looked and moved the wand, and pursed her lips.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ec96\" name=\"ec96\">\u201cI think I see a third,\u201d she said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e01d\" name=\"e01d\">My body, you see, has never produced a baby, but sometime in the past few years, it became a producer of prodigious uterine fibroid tumors.

We don\u2019t have that kind of research to tell us what to do for fibroids, so it\u2019s a hard field to navigate.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b3f3\" name=\"b3f3\">There are, however, a variety of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354294\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354294\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">treatments</a>: hormones to mitigate the major symptoms of fibroids, which include pain and prolonged bleeding (though only treatments that block the production of estrogen and progesterone and thus simulate menopause actually shrink the growths), and a variety of surgical and nonsurgical interventions to remove them, like myomectomy (in which individual fibroids are removed), uterine artery embolization (which cuts off some of the blood flow to the uterus and causes the fibroids to shrink), endometrial ablation (in which the uterine lining is eliminated), or MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (in which the fibroids are destroyed with sound waves).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"e75f\" name=\"e75f\">But the most common surgical treatment, even in 2018, is hysterectomy: 75 percent of women who opt for or require some sort treatment for fibroids end up having their uteruses\u200a\u2014\u200aand, in some cases, their ovaries and cervixes\u200a\u2014\u200aremoved.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7a33\" name=\"7a33\">Stewart doesn\u2019t believe that all of these hysterectomies are completely necessary. \u201cMany more women could have alternatives to hysterectomy,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes their doctor tells them about it, but says, \u2018Well, but you know, if you have a hysterectomy, then you\u2019re over and done with,\u2019 or says, \u2018I haven\u2019t seen good results with these.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dd2c\" name=\"dd2c\">She added, \u201cEducating yourself about the options is a critical step before you seek treatment.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"13e3\" name=\"13e3\">Fibroids, physicians like Stewart say, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/uterine-fibroids\" href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/uterine-fibroids\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">run in families</a>, but hysterectomies already ran in mine, so it\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s true in my case. Though we can talk about explosive diarrhea at the dinner table in my family, we don\u2019t tend to wax nostalgic about which reproductive system disorder caused the surgeons to cut us open and take our organs out.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"17ae\" name=\"17ae\">Stewart sees variations on that silence a lot. \u201cThis is one of the issues, since fibroids can run in families,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf your mother\u2019s periods last 10 days a month, or your sisters all have eight to 10 days of bleeding, when you say, \u2018Gee, you know, am I supposed to be living like this?\u2019 They go, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s all you can do.\u2019\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"495b\" name=\"495b\">The bleeding is, in Stewart\u2019s experience, what finally drives many of her patients to see doctors, whether because of anemia or sheer, embarrassing, life-disrupting volume. Others go because the pain gets so bad from the size or number of fibroids, or from the way they press on the patient\u2019s bladder and bowels, or from how they intensify period cramps that it convinces them something\u2019s just not right.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c3d8\" name=\"c3d8\">Still others go to the doctor because their fibroids sat quietly, maybe even relatively painlessly, until the women carrying and feeding them wanted to get pregnant or tried and failed to carry a pregnancy to term. Infertility isn\u2019t just the result of the most common treatment for fibroids; it can also be one of the symptoms\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is ironic, because any pregnancy carried to term reduces your risk of future fibroids.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7fea\" name=\"7fea\">It\u2019s almost as if, having never gestated a baby, your uterus just wants to produce <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">something</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6407\" name=\"6407\">At least for now, a hysterectomy isn\u2019t on the table for me; doctors tend to be loath to sterilize white women who have yet to fulfill their biological destiny. Not that it would matter, though, because the surgeon I saw last year said that even on the off chance any sperm could swim up and around the large fibroid at the base of my uterus and worm its way to the center of a healthy, 40-year-old egg in one of my Fallopian tubes, the likelihood that a zygote could find any spare plot of uterine wall to call its own amid the masses was small. And even if life really did win out, the surge in hormones would cause the fibroids grow even more rapidly, suffocating the zygote and probably causing a miscarriage.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2769\" name=\"2769\">Little bloodsuckers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bb39\" name=\"bb39\">I was diagnosed in 2012, not because I was bleeding that much (I told myself) or my periods hurt that much (I told myself), but because my doctor felt something amiss during a pelvic exam just before my 35th birthday.

It was over Christmas; my younger sister was halfway through her first pregnancy and bitching about her sciatica, lumbering around uncomfortably and keeping anyone from giving her soon-to-be firstborn a nickname that might stick.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5bf2\" name=\"5bf2\">I buried that moment of desire for children with all the rest of the hope I\u2019d felt for us, focusing my attention instead on the stoner man-child with whom I\u2019d taken to sharing a never-made bed. He swore he didn\u2019t want children; I generally think teenagers, emotional or otherwise, don\u2019t really make the best parents, so we were on the same page. He and his now-wife had a baby within a year of their wedding, several years after we broke up.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d9dc\" name=\"d9dc\">The question of whether I wanted kids kept coming up throughout my thirties, however, on every second date, in every longer-term relationship. There\u2019s something about dating at that age, maybe, when everyone feels like they\u2019re running out of time or really wants to make sure that you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re running out of time. But like Nancy Reagan taught us to, I just said no.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3c5d\" name=\"3c5d\">In a way, dating and having my semiannual fibroid assessment weren\u2019t that different: a near-stranger, having had their face and hands buried in my crotch, asks with a concerned face if I\u2019m thinking about having kids in the near future, and I reassure whomever that I\u2019m not.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9884\" name=\"9884\">When I was diagnosed, saying I did not want kids was easy: I was about to embark on my first-ever cohabitation adventure with a man who also did not want kids, and I was happy with what we were building. Plus, the fibroid\u200a\u2014\u200aI named it Frank\u200a\u2014\u200awasn\u2019t that big or that bad, and my doctor suggested we just monitor it and see what happened.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b7c\" name=\"7b7c\">And so we monitored. I\u2019d maneuver myself onto an exam table every six months, make a little small talk, reassure the technician I knew she was looking for a fibroid so she didn\u2019t have to practice her blank face. My periods got heavier and heavier. I started buying giant bottles of hydrogen peroxide to get stains out of the sheets, my jeans, my nice underwear, the cushions of the cerulean sofa that my mom bought us as a housewarming gift. I woke up in the middle of the night once, my uterus contracting around something that felt hard and immobile, that felt like it stayed still while I twisted my insides around it, moaning in pain, and, as he snored next to me, spent half an hour agony-panting with the nurse on my health insurance\u2019s doctor line trying to figure out if I should go to the ER. She sent me a keychain afterward; my doctor gave me a prescription pain medication.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9283\" name=\"9283\">I bought black underwear, changed the kind of tampons I used, scrubbed blood spots off the bathroom floor, refilled my prescription pain pills. My friend and former boss Anna Holmes, who was diagnosed around the same time as me with a much more serious case (African American women, already more likely to have fibroids than white women, are also <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/symptoms-causes/syc-20354288\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/symptoms-causes/syc-20354288\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more likely to have more and/or larger fibroids at younger ages</a>) had hers removed and sent me a picture, taken by the surgeon, of a plastic Tupperware bin full of veiny Silly Putty\u2013colored masses resting on a surgical drape.

I wanted it to be over. I just couldn\u2019t imagine continuing to manage it. It was so depressing.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4861\" name=\"4861\">And so Harris-Perry, who already had a daughter, opted for a hysterectomy\u200a\u2014\u200aalbeit one that would preserve her cervix and ovaries, which she says helped make her decision easier. \u201cWe talk a lot about keeping your ovaries for the hormonal purposes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even though I wasn\u2019t dating, I did expect to have penetrative sex again with a man at some point again in my life, hopefully not that far off. And I didn\u2019t want to lose my cervix in part because it was part of my sexual pleasure, and often that of my partner\u2019s.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"36b0\" name=\"36b0\">\u201cWhat did matter to me was less the question of fertility, but that I had a lot of my womanhood, identity, and sexual pleasure tied up in the surgery,\u201d Harris-Perry continued. \u201cAnd the fact that there were options that preserved those things while allowing me to know I didn\u2019t have to deal with the fibroids anymore and all the side effects of that was important to me.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dc8b\" name=\"dc8b\">Still, she told me, even though a hysterectomy was the right decision for her, she couldn\u2019t stop the what-ifs. \u201cYou regret any choice you make about fertility,\u201d Harris-Perry told me. \u201cYou regret your children, you know. You regret your abortions. Any choice you make, you will have moments when you regret it.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d9f5\" name=\"d9f5\">But there was another level of emotion for Harris-Perry in choosing a hysterectomy that I won\u2019t experience, if and when my time comes. \u201cI did feel some guilt about making the choice, because I read, and knew, and maybe even reported that black women are so much more likely to get hysterectomies and that it also happens because they are pressured,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think it took me a minute to make the decision because I almost felt like I shouldn\u2019t do it, because so many other people didn\u2019t have a choice or had experienced involuntary sterilization in our history.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"0d2d\" name=\"0d2d\">\u201cIt was a specific angst about how Fannie Loe Hamer didn\u2019t get to make this choice, and my grandmamas didn\u2019t get to make this choice,\u201d Harris-Perry added. \u201cAnd here I could preserve my uterus and I\u2019m not, and is it like not voting? Is it this terrible thing I\u2019m doing to my foremothers?\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d6ab\" name=\"d6ab\">Having an African American woman gynecologist helped, she told me: Harris-Perry was able to talk through her concerns, her options, and her potential outcomes and feel comfortable about the decision she made\u200a\u2014\u200ain part because any option that might have preserved her fertility came with a risk that the fibroids would recur.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"ee0b\" name=\"ee0b\">\u201cIt\u2019s the oddest thing,\u201d Harris-Perry explained, \u201cbut that hysterectomy is probably the reason I ended up ultimately with a second child.\u201d She and her now-husband, James Perry, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/how-we-made-our-miracle\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/how-we-made-our-miracle\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">added a daughter to their family in 2014</a>, after using IVF and surrogacy. \u201cI really was in such a state, physically and emotionally, that I probably wasn\u2019t able to date just because I was constantly managing this physical thing\u200a\u2014\u200aat work, in my mind, recreationally.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"b390\" name=\"b390\">\u201cIt was always the thing I was thinking about,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd so there wouldn\u2019t have been any space for relationship-making with someone new.\u201d</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"9132\" name=\"9132\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 100px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 14.299999999999999%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg\" data-height=\"458\" data-image-id=\"1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K5KopZxK21tLH6jGzaW8lw@2x.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf-after--figure\" id=\"cad2\" name=\"cad2\"><span class=\"graf-dropCap\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"width: 36.5px; height: 49px;\"><span class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 134.20000000000002%;\"></span><img class=\"graf-dropCapImage\" data-height=\"98\" data-image-id=\"1*rWbxZ-pzbveFKvj1ScNA_Q@2x.png\" data-width=\"73\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rWbxZ-pzbveFKvj1ScNA_Q@2x.png\"/></span><span class=\"graf-dropCapText\">F</span></span>ibroid Frank had grown to the size of a fetus at the end of its first trimester by the time my gynecologist wanted to talk through my realistic options\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding whether 38-year-old me was in the market to aim for a now-geriatric pregnancy.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\" id=\"4a6f\" name=\"4a6f\">\u201cAre you and your partner planning on having children?\u201d my gynecologist asked me in her cozy file-and-uterus-model-filled office.

Plus, he\u2019d bring up having kids every so often, out of the blue, like it had been on his mind\u200a\u2014\u200athat he hadn\u2019t really thought about having another kid until being with me, how different parenting would be with me than it had been with his ex if he and I had a baby\u200a\u2014\u200aand as we settled into what felt like a happy, functional routine, I thought about my surgical options, and my next sonogram, and what to say about whether I wanted kids this next time when the doctor asked.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"34ae\" name=\"34ae\">Could it really be with a two-time divorc\u00e9 with a kid of his own, the kind of man who had a framed picture of his son\u2019s nine-year-old sonogram on his dresser in a frame that read \u201cLove at first sight\u201d?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"bac3\" name=\"bac3\">It wasn\u2019t, of course. His text messages slowed, I withdrew, he withdrew, and one night, two days before my last sonogram, we held each other in my bed as he stroked my hair and said that he wasn\u2019t sure that he could fall in love with anyone again, and I sighed and stopped crying and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and we said our goodbyes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa4a\" name=\"aa4a\">That\u2019s the problem with contextual desires\u200a\u2014\u200athe context changes.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4922\" name=\"4922\">I\u2019ve named the new fibroid Malcolm (because he\u2019s in the middle); I can tell he\u2019s going to be a sonofabitch. And I\u2019ll go back to the doctor soon, and she\u2019ll ask me if I want children, and maybe I\u2019ll tell her the truth this time: that I\u2019ve never felt that socio-biological urge to gestate and raise a baby at any cost, but every once in a blue moon, I have the inkling of a desire to build a family, someday, of something more than anthropomorphized uterine bloodsuckers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1968\" name=\"1968\">Or maybe I\u2019ll just say no. Because it\u2019s easier.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"b4b4\" name=\"b4b4\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 100px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 14.299999999999999%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*9SAXZoSu15EqtcMXDXptJA@2x.jpeg\" data-height=\"458\" data-image-id=\"1*9SAXZoSu15EqtcMXDXptJA@2x.jpeg\" data-width=\"3200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*9SAXZoSu15EqtcMXDXptJA@2x.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9SAXZoSu15EqtcMXDXptJA@2x.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9SAXZoSu15EqtcMXDXptJA@2x.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration: <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.audreyjl.com/\" href=\"http://www.audreyjl.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Audrey Lee</a>.

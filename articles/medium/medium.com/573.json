{"content": " I swore I wasn\u2019t going to write about Jordan Peterson, the controversial Canadian psychologist, self-help guru, anti\u2013political correctness crusader, YouTube star, and bestselling author of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. From what I\u2019ve observed, there is little good\u200a\u2014\u200aother than the garnering of foaming-at-the-mouth clicks\u200a\u2014\u200athat can come of it. If you defend Peterson, let alone praise him, the wokescenti mobs will descend upon you, accusing you of propping up a pseudo-intellectual alt-right grifter (\u201cgrifter\u201d being the word du jour for anyone who says things you don\u2019t happen to agree with but is somehow gaining in popularity anyway). If you criticize him, his acolytes will rush to his defense, saying you\u2019re either too stupid or too brainwashed by the edicts of the aforementioned wokescenti to appreciate his deep and not-at-all-pseudo intellect.Both reactions will be extreme and, in most cases, entirely beside the point of whatever point one was originally trying to make. If that doesn\u2019t sum up the current state of public discourse, I don\u2019t know what does.Nonetheless, I\u2019m going to use some recent imbroglios around Peterson to talk about a disturbing phenomenon I\u2019ve been noticing lately. Call it guilt by adjacency. This is when assumptions are made about\u200a\u2014\u200aand, from there, judgments rendered against\u200a\u2014\u200aa person based not on anything he stands for but who might be standing or sitting next to him at any given time.This was the situation for Peterson recently when a photo began circulating online showing him posing in an autograph line with a fan wearing a shirt that read \u201cI\u2019m a Proud Islamaphobe,\u201d followed by a list, in smaller print, of a few dozen phenomena associated with the worst aspects of Islamic extremism. The photo was taken in February in Auckland, New Zealand, following a lecture Peterson gave to a crowd of more than 1,000. By Peterson\u2019s estimates, the photo was one of about 30,000 fan photos he\u2019d posed for over the past 15 months.A few weeks later, a shooter would murder 50 Islamic worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand. The killer, a 28-year-old Australian who identified as a white nationalist, would signal his connection to certain social media\u2013fueled hate groups by livestreaming part of the attacks and issuing a lengthy manifesto, parts of which he linked to on Twitter and also 8chan, an anonymous imageboard website associated with the vilest impulses of the internet.At one point during the livestream, the shooter said the words, \u201cSubscribe to PewDiePie.\u201d This phrase is a both a direct reference to a popular YouTuber who sometimes flirts with white nationalist rhetoric and a sort of umbrella term for an entire continuum of people, memes, and in-jokes that operate in a sort of echo chamber of anti\u2013political correctness trolling and \u201cshitposting\u201d (posting offensive and inflammatory things online to get a rise out of people).The shooter made no reference to Peterson. Nonetheless, within weeks of the massacre, Peterson found himself on the receiving end of two major sanctions.The first was when Whitcoulls, a major New Zealand bookstore chain, pulled his book from their shelves \u201cin light of some extremely disturbing material being circulated prior, during, and after the Christchurch attacks.\u201d The second was when, amid a student outcry, Cambridge University rescinded an offer to host Peterson as a visiting fellow on the Faculty of Divinity.By \u201cdisturbing material,\u201d Whitcoulls meant the photo with the fan wearing the Islamaphobe T-shirt. At Cambridge, the vice chancellor explained that the decision to rescind the offer had been \u201cas a consequence\u201d of becoming aware of the image.Peterson doesn\u2019t always do himself a lot of favors in the likability department.Literally, it\u2019s guilt by adjacency\u200a\u2014\u200ain this case, treating Peterson as if he\u2019d worn the T-shirt himself rather than simply standing next to the guy in the shirt. But Peterson may also be a casualty of guilt by virtual adjacency: the much-discussed tendency of YouTube\u2019s algorithm to lump Peterson, PewDiePie, and other conservative thinkers together with hardcore extremists.Whitcoulls put Peterson\u2019s book back on the shelves about a week later. (Several customers had pointed out that the company still had Mein Kampf available for order on its website.) As for Cambridge, well, there\u2019s a long history of university administrators rescinding invitations to controversial speakers and fellows amid student complaints. Given Peterson\u2019s reputation, it\u2019s kind of astonishing they thought it was a good idea to bring him in to begin with.I\u2019m not a Peterson aficionado. I do not have especially strong feelings about him one way or the other. But I\u2019m a pretty close follower of the media groupthink phenomenon that surrounds him, and I have yet to see a single example of the man himself espousing any racist, bigoted, or misogynist views. (If you can prove otherwise in the form of direct quotes in their proper context, please feel free to contact me and set me straight. And saying he\u2019s \u201cdog whistling\u201d and leaving it at that doesn\u2019t count.)It\u2019s true that Peterson doesn\u2019t always do himself a lot of favors in the likability department. He seems to take a certain glee in his own belligerence. He does not, to use a favorite phrase of many of his ideological opponents, do a lot of \u201cemotional labor\u201d when he\u2019s in conversation with people. If you don\u2019t entirely get what he\u2019s saying when he talks about things like \u201cdominance hierarchies\u201d and \u201cenforced monogamy,\u201d he\u2019s not typically inclined to spell things out in layman\u2019s terms. (He\u2019s really only talking about natural rankings within social groups and monogamy as a social norm, but that doesn\u2019t sound as fancy. He likes to sound fancy.)It\u2019s also true that Peterson\u2019s rants against identity politics of all kinds lend themselves to YouTube clips in which his more impassioned conservative rhetoric is singled out and advertised along the lines of \u201cJordan Peterson OBLITERATES FAR LEFTIST!\u201d These clips, no doubt sometimes compiled by people who actually do have racist, bigoted, or misogynist views, are often stops along the algorithmic path from things that are eminently reasonable, like the podcast of the neuroscientist Sam Harris, to things that are unequivocally terrible, like the videos of self-proclaimed anti-feminist, anarcho-capitalist, race and IQ propagandist Stefan Molyneux.Is it Peterson\u2019s job to constantly try to shuffle people off the algorithm and onto a different path? Moreover, should any given public or semipublic figure (an author, a journalist, an entertainer) be held responsible for who might be adjacent to them?Should they refuse to be interviewed by a podcaster who has also interviewed people deemed problematic or refuse to write for polarizing publications? Should they be worried if the wrong person follows them on social media or shows support for their work in some way? What if they agree to be interviewed by someone they only later realize is trafficking in dubious or harmful ideas? Should they apologize even if they said nothing they wouldn\u2019t say anywhere else?The world has come to feel like a classroom where, if the kid next to you is acting out, the teacher will send both of you to detention just to make a\u00a0point.Not too long ago, the answer to all of the above would be no. As most of us are taught in first grade, it\u2019s what you say that matters, not what people say about you or say you said.But in the past few years, the world has come to feel like a classroom where, if the kid next to you is acting out, the teacher will send both of you to detention just to make a point. Take Joe Rogan, the comedian, former Fear Factor host, and MMA color commentator who now hosts one of the most downloaded podcasts on any streaming service. Rogan interviews serious guests, like astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, biologist Heather Heying, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, and recently, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who was essentially unknown until his appearance on the show catapulted him to sudden prominence.But Rogan has also had on any number of alt-right agitators, like Gavin McInnes, and repugnant conspiracy theorists, most notably America\u2019s Most Vile, Sandy Hook truther Alex Jones, whom Rogan recently brought back after a two-year falling out. At this reunion, Rogan walked Jones through a dramatic\u200a\u2014\u200aif too frenzied and hysterical to really be taken seriously\u200a\u2014\u200aapology for the atrocious hoax theories he\u2019d stirred up over years (theories that drew a lawsuit from grieving parents and may well lead to the end of Jones\u2019 empire).And herein lies the inherent conflict of adjacency. On one hand, getting close to terrible people can be useful if it means you can hold their feet to the fire and get them to answer for themselves. (Not that Rogan does much of this, which is a real problem considering the people he talks with.) On the other hand, getting close to terrible people means sharing your oxygen with them, when, in many cases, the best way to handle them would be to starve them of it altogether. Rogan can share his oxygen as he likes, but what about his other guests? Are liberals like Heying and Yang indirectly breathing life into someone like Jones just by virtue of sitting in the same guest chair he sat in? Is Rogan\u2019s willingness to interview Jones (a public figure who has been interviewed by numerous media outlets) a reason to write off Rogan himself?Last week in Sydney, two writers known for their opposing takes on contemporary feminism, Roxane Gay and Christina Hoff Sommers, shared a stage for a so-called debate about the state of women\u2019s rights. Gay, who wrote the popular essay collection Bad Feminist, is a hero among young intersectional feminists and a prominent voice in social justice conversations on Twitter. Sommers, who wrote books like Who Stole Feminism and The War on Boys and now hosts The Factual Feminist, a popular YouTube series devoted to debunking some of the conventional wisdom of intersectional feminism, is a hero among free speech types, gamers, and some anti-feminists and men\u2019s rights activists.The conversation, for which there is as yet no transcript or recording, was contentious, according to audience reports. Prior to the debate, Gay had been on record as describing Sommers as a \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d According to a widely circulated Twitter thread by an audience member, Gay clarified her statement during the event by saying Sommers was \u201cwhite supremacy adjacent,\u201d because she\u2019d once done a college tour with Milo Yiannopoulos.I\u2019ve always thought Sommers was dunderheaded to go on tour with Yiannopoulos. (The conceit was that she was his foil, though it didn\u2019t always translate.) If there was ever a case of someone needing to be starved of oxygen, he was it. But considering that she\u2019s a Jewish, self-proclaimed liberal feminist who\u2019s never voted for a Republican, the white supremacy accusation seems a little misplaced. Actually a lot misplaced, and dangerously so, since every time the word is used so casually, it loses its power to identify and label actual white supremacists.But that\u2019s the thing about guilt by adjacency. Being a human being walking around the planet means you\u2019re pretty much always adjacent to something unpleasant or harmful. We\u2019re all just one or two degrees away from that kid in class who\u2019s going to get us dragged to the principal\u2019s office even though we had nothing to do with his offending behavior. And whether we choose to sit next to him of our volition (as Sommers did with Yiannopoulis) or get placed next to him by luck of the alphabetical or algorithmic draw, we still deserve to be judged by our own actions, not anyone else\u2019s.Peterson, for his part, issued a statement last week saying that he had asked the company that helps arrange his appearances \u201cto politely ask those who are photographed with me to refrain from more provocative political garb.\u201d True to form, Peterson framed the statement in terms of his own persecution, saying that \u201cthe fallout can be used by those who are not fond of me,\u201d but I was glad to see him make the call nonetheless. If he can\u2019t control the places his fans might go on YouTube, he can at least exert some influence on how they conduct themselves as they walk through the real world. Sure, he\u2019s all about free speech. But he also constantly goes on about comporting yourself with dignity and \u201csorting yourself out,\u201d so it\u2019s actually nicely on-brand.In the meantime, when it comes to deciding things like who\u2019s a white supremacist, maybe it\u2019s time to stop acting like that shortsighted teacher sending people to the principal\u2019s office en masse. Because, as we know too well, there are real white supremacists out there. To lump them in with anyone else is to give them company they don\u2019t deserve.", "url": "https://medium.com/s/meghan-daum/guilt-by-adjacency-15fbeb3af9c0", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html

write about Jordan Peterson, the controversial Canadian psychologist, self-help guru, anti\u2013political correctness crusader, YouTube star, and bestselling author of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</em>. From what I\u2019ve observed, there is little good\u200a\u2014\u200aother than the garnering of foaming-at-the-mouth clicks\u200a\u2014\u200athat can come of it. If you defend Peterson, let alone praise him, the wokescenti mobs will descend upon you, accusing you of propping up a pseudo-intellectual alt-right grifter (\u201cgrifter\u201d being the word du jour for anyone who says things you don\u2019t happen to agree with but is somehow gaining in popularity anyway). If you criticize him, his acolytes will rush to his defense, saying you\u2019re either too stupid or too brainwashed by the edicts of the aforementioned wokescenti to appreciate his deep and not-at-all-pseudo intellect.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dec7\" name=\"dec7\">Both reactions will be extreme and, in most cases, entirely beside the point of whatever point one was originally trying to make. If that doesn\u2019t sum up the current state of public discourse, I don\u2019t know what does.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"70d4\" name=\"70d4\">Nonetheless, I\u2019m going to use some recent imbroglios around Peterson to talk about a disturbing phenomenon I\u2019ve been noticing lately. Call it guilt by adjacency. This is when assumptions are made about\u200a\u2014\u200aand, from there, judgments rendered against\u200a\u2014\u200aa person based not on anything he stands for but who might be standing or sitting next to him at any given time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f2a\" name=\"1f2a\">This was the situation for Peterson recently when a photo began circulating online showing him posing in an autograph line with a fan wearing a shirt that read \u201cI\u2019m a Proud Islamaphobe,\u201d followed by a list, in smaller print, of a few dozen phenomena associated with the worst aspects of Islamic extremism. The photo was taken in February in Auckland, New Zealand, following a lecture Peterson gave to a crowd of more than 1,000. By Peterson\u2019s estimates, the photo was one of about 30,000 fan photos he\u2019d posed for over the past 15 months.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b473\" name=\"b473\">A few weeks later, a shooter would murder 50 Islamic worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand. The killer, a 28-year-old Australian who identified as a white nationalist, would signal his connection to certain social media\u2013fueled hate groups by livestreaming part of the attacks and issuing a lengthy manifesto, parts of which he linked to on Twitter and also 8chan, an anonymous imageboard website associated with the vilest impulses of the internet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ee3\" name=\"1ee3\">At one point during the livestream, the shooter said the words, \u201cSubscribe to PewDiePie.\u201d This phrase is a both a direct reference to a popular YouTuber who sometimes flirts with white nationalist rhetoric and a sort of umbrella term for an entire continuum of people, memes, and in-jokes that operate in a sort of echo chamber of anti\u2013political correctness trolling and \u201cshitposting\u201d (posting offensive and inflammatory things online to get a rise out of people).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e4f\" name=\"7e4f\">The shooter made no reference to Peterson. Nonetheless, within weeks of the massacre, Peterson found himself on the receiving end of two major sanctions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0194\" name=\"0194\">The first was when Whitcoulls, a major New Zealand bookstore chain, pulled his book from their shelves \u201cin light of some extremely disturbing material being circulated prior, during, and after the Christchurch attacks.\u201d The second was when, amid a student outcry, Cambridge University rescinded an offer to host Peterson as a visiting fellow on the Faculty of Divinity.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfd3\" name=\"dfd3\">By \u201cdisturbing material,\u201d Whitcoulls meant the photo with the fan wearing the Islamaphobe T-shirt. At Cambridge, the vice chancellor <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47694921\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47694921\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> that the decision to rescind the offer had been \u201cas a consequence\u201d of becoming aware of the image.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"aee4\" name=\"aee4\">Peterson doesn\u2019t always do himself a lot of favors in the likability department.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"d7e9\" name=\"d7e9\">Literally, it\u2019s guilt by adjacency\u200a\u2014\u200ain this case, treating Peterson as if he\u2019d worn the T-shirt himself rather than simply standing next to the guy in the shirt. But Peterson may also be a casualty of guilt by virtual adjacency: the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/down-youtubes-recommendation-rabbithole\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/down-youtubes-recommendation-rabbithole\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">much-discussed</a> tendency of YouTube\u2019s algorithm to lump Peterson, PewDiePie, and other conservative thinkers together with hardcore extremists.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"af16\" name=\"af16\">Whitcoulls put Peterson\u2019s book back on the shelves about a week later. (Several customers had pointed out that the company still had <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mein Kampf</em> available for order on its website.) As for Cambridge, well, there\u2019s a long history of university administrators rescinding invitations to controversial speakers and fellows amid student complaints. Given Peterson\u2019s reputation, it\u2019s kind of astonishing they thought it was a good idea to bring him in to begin with.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b3e0\" name=\"b3e0\">I\u2019m not a Peterson aficionado. I do not have especially strong feelings about him one way or the other. But I\u2019m a pretty close follower of the media groupthink phenomenon that surrounds him, and I have yet to see a single example of the man himself espousing any racist, bigoted, or misogynist views. (If you can prove otherwise in the form of direct quotes in their proper context, please feel free to contact me and set me straight. And saying he\u2019s \u201cdog whistling\u201d and leaving it at that doesn\u2019t count.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee1c\" name=\"ee1c\">It\u2019s true that Peterson doesn\u2019t always do himself a lot of favors in the likability department. He seems to take a certain glee in his own belligerence. He does not, to use a favorite phrase of many of his ideological opponents, do a lot of \u201cemotional labor\u201d when he\u2019s in conversation with people. If you don\u2019t entirely get what he\u2019s saying when he talks about things like \u201cdominance hierarchies\u201d and \u201cenforced monogamy,\u201d he\u2019s not typically inclined to spell things out in layman\u2019s terms. (He\u2019s really only talking about natural rankings within social groups and monogamy as a social norm, but that doesn\u2019t sound as fancy. He likes to sound fancy.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5ab\" name=\"c5ab\">It\u2019s also true that Peterson\u2019s rants against identity politics of all kinds lend themselves to YouTube clips in which his more impassioned conservative rhetoric is singled out and advertised along the lines of \u201cJordan Peterson OBLITERATES FAR LEFTIST!\u201d These clips, no doubt sometimes compiled by people who actually do have racist, bigoted, or misogynist views, are often stops along the algorithmic path from things that are eminently reasonable, like the podcast of the neuroscientist Sam Harris, to things that are unequivocally terrible, like the videos of self-proclaimed anti-feminist, anarcho-capitalist, race and IQ propagandist Stefan Molyneux.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3fc0\" name=\"3fc0\">Is it Peterson\u2019s job to constantly try to shuffle people off the algorithm and onto a different path? Moreover, should any given public or semipublic figure (an author, a journalist, an entertainer) be held responsible for who might be adjacent to them?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f1fe\" name=\"f1fe\">Should they refuse to be interviewed by a podcaster who has also interviewed people deemed problematic or refuse to write for polarizing publications? Should they be worried if the wrong person follows them on social media or shows support for their work in some way? What if they agree to be interviewed by someone they only later realize is trafficking in dubious or harmful ideas? Should they apologize even if they said nothing they wouldn\u2019t say anywhere else?</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"8d08\" name=\"8d08\">The world has come to feel like a classroom where, if the kid next to you is acting out, the teacher will send both of you to detention just to make a\u00a0point.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"edfa\" name=\"edfa\">Not too long ago, the answer to all of the above would be no. As most of us are taught in first grade, it\u2019s what you say that matters, not what people say about you or say you said.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"00f6\" name=\"00f6\">But in the past few years, the world has come to feel like a classroom where, if the kid next to you is acting out, the teacher will send both of you to detention just to make a point. Take Joe Rogan, the comedian, former <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Fear Factor </em>host, and MMA color commentator who now hosts one of the most downloaded podcasts on any streaming service. Rogan interviews serious guests, like astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, biologist Heather Heying, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, and recently, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who was essentially unknown until his appearance on the show catapulted him to sudden prominence.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ab47\" name=\"ab47\">But Rogan has also had on any number of alt-right agitators, like Gavin McInnes, and repugnant conspiracy theorists, most notably America\u2019s Most Vile, Sandy Hook truther Alex Jones, whom Rogan recently brought back after a two-year falling out. At this reunion, Rogan walked Jones through a dramatic\u200a\u2014\u200aif too frenzied and hysterical to really be taken seriously\u200a\u2014\u200aapology for the atrocious hoax theories he\u2019d stirred up over years (theories that drew a lawsuit from grieving parents and may well lead to the end of Jones\u2019 empire).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"866c\" name=\"866c\">And herein lies the inherent conflict of adjacency. On one hand, getting close to terrible people can be useful if it means you can hold their feet to the fire and get them to answer for themselves. (Not that Rogan does much of this, which is a real problem considering the people he talks with.) On the other hand, getting close to terrible people means sharing your oxygen with them, when, in many cases, the best way to handle them would be to starve them of it altogether. Rogan can share his oxygen as he likes, but what about his other guests? Are liberals like Heying and Yang indirectly breathing life into someone like Jones just by virtue of sitting in the same guest chair he sat in? Is Rogan\u2019s willingness to interview Jones (a public figure who has been interviewed by numerous media outlets) a reason to write off Rogan himself?</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0e23\" name=\"0e23\">Last week in Sydney, two writers known for their opposing takes on contemporary feminism, Roxane Gay and Christina Hoff Sommers, shared a stage for a so-called debate about the state of women\u2019s rights. Gay, who wrote the popular essay collection <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Bad Feminist</em>, is a hero among young intersectional feminists and a prominent voice in social justice conversations on Twitter. Sommers, who wrote books like <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Who Stole Feminism</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The War on Boys</em> and now hosts <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Factual Feminist</em>, a popular YouTube series devoted to debunking some of the conventional wisdom of intersectional feminism, is a hero among free speech types, gamers, and some anti-feminists and men\u2019s rights activists.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"aa66\" name=\"aa66\">The conversation, for which there is as yet no transcript or recording, was contentious, according to audience reports. Prior to the debate, Gay had been <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/roxane-gay-to-face-off-with-feminism-critic-in-upcoming-australian-tour-20180908-p502ln.html\" href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/roxane-gay-to-face-off-with-feminism-critic-in-upcoming-australian-tour-20180908-p502ln.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on record</a> as describing Sommers as a \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d According to a widely circulated Twitter <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/Omaymam_94/status/1111615752514097152\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Omaymam_94/status/1111615752514097152\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a> by an audience member, Gay clarified her statement during the event by saying Sommers was \u201cwhite supremacy adjacent,\u201d because she\u2019d once done a college tour with Milo Yiannopoulos.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7823\" name=\"7823\">I\u2019ve always thought Sommers was dunderheaded to go on tour with Yiannopoulos. (The conceit was that she was his foil, though it didn\u2019t always translate.) If there was ever a case of someone needing to be starved of oxygen, he was it. But considering that she\u2019s a Jewish, self-proclaimed liberal feminist who\u2019s never voted for a Republican, the white supremacy accusation seems a little misplaced. Actually a lot misplaced, and dangerously so, since every time the word is used so casually, it loses its power to identify and label actual white supremacists.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"20fa\" name=\"20fa\">But that\u2019s the thing about guilt by adjacency. Being a human being walking around the planet means you\u2019re pretty much always adjacent to something unpleasant or harmful. We\u2019re all just one or two degrees away from that kid in class who\u2019s going to get us dragged to the principal\u2019s office even though we had nothing to do with his offending behavior. And whether we choose to sit next to him of our volition (as Sommers did with Yiannopoulis) or get placed next to him by luck of the alphabetical or algorithmic draw, we still deserve to be judged by our own actions, not anyone else\u2019s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e8e\" name=\"7e8e\">Peterson, for his part, issued a statement last week saying that he had asked the company that helps arrange his appearances \u201cto politely ask those who are photographed with me to refrain from more provocative political garb.\u201d True to form, Peterson framed the statement in terms of his own persecution, saying that \u201cthe fallout can be used by those who are not fond of me,\u201d but I was glad to see him make the call nonetheless. If he can\u2019t control the places his fans might go on YouTube, he can at least exert some influence on how they conduct themselves as they walk through the real world. Sure, he\u2019s all about free speech. But he also constantly goes on about comporting yourself with dignity and \u201csorting yourself out,\u201d so it\u2019s actually nicely on-brand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"1616\" name=\"1616\">In the meantime, when it comes to deciding things like who\u2019s a white supremacist, maybe it\u2019s time to stop acting like that shortsighted teacher sending people to the principal\u2019s office en masse. Because, as we know too well, there are real white supremacists out there. To lump them in with anyone else is to give them company they don\u2019t deserve.</p></div></div></section></div></main></div><section class=\"u-maxWidth700 u-paddingHorizontal20 u-marginAuto\"><div

But considering that she\u2019s a Jewish, self-proclaimed liberal feminist who\u2019s never voted for a Republican, the white supremacy accusation seems a little misplaced.

If he can\u2019t control the places his fans might go on YouTube, he can at least exert some influence on how they conduct themselves as they walk through the real world.

From what I\u2019ve observed, there is little good\u200a\u2014\u200aother than the garnering of foaming-at-the-mouth clicks\u200a\u2014\u200athat can come of it. If you defend Peterson, let alone praise him, the wokescenti mobs will descend upon you, accusing you of propping up a pseudo-intellectual alt-right grifter (\u201cgrifter\u201d being the word du jour for anyone who says things you don\u2019t happen to agree with but is somehow gaining in popularity anyway). If you criticize him, his acolytes will rush to his defense, saying you\u2019re either too stupid or too brainwashed by the edicts of the aforementioned wokescenti to appreciate his deep and not-at-all-pseudo intellect.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dec7\" name=\"dec7\">Both reactions will be extreme and, in most cases, entirely beside the point of whatever point one was originally trying to make. If that doesn\u2019t sum up the current state of public discourse, I don\u2019t know what does.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"70d4\" name=\"70d4\">Nonetheless, I\u2019m going to use some recent imbroglios around Peterson to talk about a disturbing phenomenon I\u2019ve been noticing lately. Call it guilt by adjacency. This is when assumptions are made about\u200a\u2014\u200aand, from there, judgments rendered against\u200a\u2014\u200aa person based not on anything he stands for but who might be standing or sitting next to him at any given time.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f2a\" name=\"1f2a\">This was the situation for Peterson recently when a photo began circulating online showing him posing in an autograph line with a fan wearing a shirt that read \u201cI\u2019m a Proud Islamaphobe,\u201d followed by a list, in smaller print, of a few dozen phenomena associated with the worst aspects of Islamic extremism. The photo was taken in February in Auckland, New Zealand, following a lecture Peterson gave to a crowd of more than 1,000. By Peterson\u2019s estimates, the photo was one of about 30,000 fan photos he\u2019d posed for over the past 15 months.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b473\" name=\"b473\">A few weeks later, a shooter would murder 50 Islamic worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand. The killer, a 28-year-old Australian who identified as a white nationalist, would signal his connection to certain social media\u2013fueled hate groups by livestreaming part of the attacks and issuing a lengthy manifesto, parts of which he linked to on Twitter and also 8chan, an anonymous imageboard website associated with the vilest impulses of the internet.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1ee3\" name=\"1ee3\">At one point during the livestream, the shooter said the words, \u201cSubscribe to PewDiePie.\u201d This phrase is a both a direct reference to a popular YouTuber who sometimes flirts with white nationalist rhetoric and a sort of umbrella term for an entire continuum of people, memes, and in-jokes that operate in a sort of echo chamber of anti\u2013political correctness trolling and \u201cshitposting\u201d (posting offensive and inflammatory things online to get a rise out of people).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e4f\" name=\"7e4f\">The shooter made no reference to Peterson. Nonetheless, within weeks of the massacre, Peterson found himself on the receiving end of two major sanctions.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0194\" name=\"0194\">The first was when Whitcoulls, a major New Zealand bookstore chain, pulled his book from their shelves \u201cin light of some extremely disturbing material being circulated prior, during, and after the Christchurch attacks.\u201d The second was when, amid a student outcry, Cambridge University rescinded an offer to host Peterson as a visiting fellow on the Faculty of Divinity.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dfd3\" name=\"dfd3\">By \u201cdisturbing material,\u201d Whitcoulls meant the photo with the fan wearing the Islamaphobe T-shirt. At Cambridge, the vice chancellor <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47694921\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47694921\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> that the decision to rescind the offer had been \u201cas a consequence\u201d of becoming aware of the image.</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\" id=\"aee4\" name=\"aee4\">Peterson doesn\u2019t always do himself a lot of favors in the likability department.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\" id=\"d7e9\" name=\"d7e9\">Literally, it\u2019s guilt by adjacency\u200a\u2014\u200ain this case, treating Peterson as if he\u2019d worn the T-shirt himself rather than simply standing next to the guy in the shirt. But Peterson may also be a casualty of guilt by virtual adjacency: the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/down-youtubes-recommendation-rabbithole\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/down-youtubes-recommendation-rabbithole\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">much-discussed</a> tendency of YouTube\u2019s algorithm to lump Peterson, PewDiePie, and other conservative thinkers together with hardcore extremists.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"af16\" name=\"af16\">Whitcoulls put Peterson\u2019s book back on the shelves about a week later. (Several customers had pointed out that the company still had <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Mein Kampf</em> available for order on its website.) As for Cambridge, well, there\u2019s a long history of university administrators rescinding invitations to controversial speakers and fellows amid student complaints. Given Peterson\u2019s reputation, it\u2019s kind of astonishing they thought it was a good idea to bring him in to begin with.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b3e0\" name=\"b3e0\">I\u2019m not a Peterson aficionado. I do not have especially strong feelings about him one way or the other. But I\u2019m a pretty close follower of the media groupthink phenomenon that surrounds him, and I have yet to see a single example of the man himself espousing any racist, bigoted, or misogynist views. (If you can prove otherwise in the form of direct quotes in their proper context, please feel free to contact me and set me straight. And saying he\u2019s \u201cdog whistling\u201d and leaving it at that doesn\u2019t count.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ee1c\" name=\"ee1c\">It\u2019s true that Peterson doesn\u2019t always do himself a lot of favors in the likability department. He seems to take a certain glee in his own belligerence. He does not, to use a favorite phrase of many of his ideological opponents, do a lot of \u201cemotional labor\u201d when he\u2019s in conversation with people. If you don\u2019t entirely get what he\u2019s saying when he talks about things like \u201cdominance hierarchies\u201d and \u201cenforced monogamy,\u201d he\u2019s not typically inclined to spell things out in layman\u2019s terms. (He\u2019s really only talking about natural rankings within social groups and monogamy as a social norm, but that doesn\u2019t sound as fancy. He likes to sound fancy.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c5ab\" name=\"c5ab\">It\u2019s also true that Peterson\u2019s rants against identity politics of all kinds lend themselves to YouTube clips in which his more impassioned conservative rhetoric is singled out and advertised along the lines of \u201cJordan Peterson OBLITERATES FAR LEFTIST!\u201d These clips, no doubt sometimes compiled by people who actually do have racist, bigoted, or misogynist views, are often stops along the algorithmic path from things that are eminently reasonable, like the podcast of the neuroscientist Sam Harris, to things that are unequivocally terrible, like the videos of self-proclaimed anti-feminist, anarcho-capitalist, race and IQ propagandist Stefan Molyneux.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3fc0\" name=\"3fc0\">Is it Peterson\u2019s job to constantly try to shuffle people off the algorithm and onto a different path?

And whether we choose to sit next to him of our volition (as Sommers did with Yiannopoulis) or get placed next to him by luck of the alphabetical or algorithmic draw, we still deserve to be judged by our own actions, not anyone else\u2019s.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e8e\" name=\"7e8e\">Peterson, for his part, issued a statement last week saying that he had asked the company that helps arrange his appearances \u201cto politely ask those who are photographed with me to refrain from more provocative political garb.\u201d True to form, Peterson framed the statement in terms of his own persecution, saying that \u201cthe fallout can be used by those who are not fond of me,\u201d but I was glad to see him make the call nonetheless. If he can\u2019t control the places his fans might go on YouTube, he can at least exert some influence on how they conduct themselves as they walk through the real world. Sure, he\u2019s all about free speech. But he also constantly goes on about comporting yourself with dignity and \u201csorting yourself out,\u201d so it\u2019s actually nicely on-brand.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"1616\" name=\"1616\">In the meantime, when it comes to deciding things like who\u2019s a white supremacist, maybe it\u2019s time to stop acting like that shortsighted teacher sending people to the principal\u2019s office en masse. Because, as we know too well, there are real white supremacists out there. To lump them in with anyone else is to give them company they don\u2019t deserve.</p></div></div>"}

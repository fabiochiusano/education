{"content": "Multi-Level Perspective MappingExamining how the decline in pollinators fits into a global narrativeEdwin ChoBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 1 Photo by Dayne Topkin on\u00a0Unsplash The story of pollinators and why they are on the decline is much, much bigger than just bees. Unfortunately, there is no one convenient antagonist to point to and declare as the cause of all of our problems. To truly investigate the historical context and forces at play within this wicked problem, one needs to submerge themselves in an ocean of global events, social movements, the consequences of these changes, and the ideologies that grew from them. Considering how interconnected and plentiful these historical threads are, how do we even begin to picture the timeline of the pollinators and their decline?The Multi-Level Perspective ModelIn his article, \u201cThe Dynamics of Transitions in Socio-technical Systems: A Multi-level Analysis of the Transition Pathway from Horse-drawn Carriages to Automobiles (1860\u20131930)\u201d, F. W. Geels takes a look at society\u2019s transition from travel by horse-drawn carriage to travel by automobile. He admits that advances in technologies certainly do play important roles in spurring these societal transitions, but they are definitely not the sole catalyst. Many other key players such as economic infrastructure, social and cultural perception, and developing markets all needed to align into self-reinforcing loops to make automobiles as pervasive as they are today.To help apply this holistic approach to examining the causes of the decline in pollinators, our team took a note from Geels and went about creating a Multi-Level Perspective map. By dividing up the different historical drivers of this wicked problem into different levels, it allows us to see how small, niche events grow into regime-level networks and institutions, which eventually become ingrained in our perception and policies at the slow-moving landscape level.By using this model and identifying the flow of events from niche to landscape, we can then start categorizing the different loops at play and use these categories to come up with potential intervention points and gauge their effectiveness. While the first assignment of this five-part project took a look at the various stakeholders within the decline in pollinators and learning what their hopes and dreams are, this second assignment is about discovering the historical context of the problem and finding where the access points are for possible sustainable solutions.Making the\u00a0MapConsidering that industrial agriculture is currently a huge stakeholder, it was natural to begin with the most painfully obvious event that helped lead to the dominance of giant corporate entities and shameless consumerism: the Industrial Revolution. From this starting point, other large global events were identified as frames of references for our timeline; World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and the Moonshot are all major events that can be broken down into more granular events and consequences that fit into a niche-regime-landscape format. By breaking up these events into the actions and ideologies they compose, the map filled up very quickly.The MLP Map for the Decline in PollinatorsSorted by time and by niche/regime/landscape classification, each concept was also color-coded by general topic: red for mindsets/social movements, pink for global events, gold for government and policy, light yellow for economics, purple for infrastructure/technology, and green for environmental. From here, connections were drawn to represent events that either fed into each other, or hurt the progress of another. For example, the acceptance of the use of chemical warfare during WWII led into both the further development of chemicals as a tool and also cementing its place in public perception. This normalization and acceptance led to using chemicals in pesticides to support industrial agriculture, which is now a huge contributor to the poor health and collapse of beehives and colonies.By constructing these threads across levels, patterns emerged on what major paradigm shifts influenced the decline in pollinators.Thread CategoriesBeekeeping TechnologyHoney bees were introduced to the Americas by early colonists; later immigrants brought hives with them as they crossed the Atlantic or the country, only reaching California in the mid 19th century. Bee varieties varied until the 19th-century when Italian honey bees became fashionable and gradually came to make up the vast majority of domesticated bees in the United States (Oertel, 1980).Honey Beekeeping technology is ancient and was mostly unchanged from ancient Egypt until the invention of the modern frame hive in the mid 19th century (Kritsky, 2017). This innovation allowed beekeepers to harvest both honey and wax without destroying the entire hive. The practice of transporting hives also dates to the ancient era, but the new structures facilitated movement of the bees (Lowe, 2018). It wasn\u2019t until the advent of the automobile and the road improvement movement that their transport became practical. Finally, in the 1950s the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System allowed for the current practice of bringing the bees to the crops (Oertel, 1980). Honey bees, who naturally spend their lives in a few square miles, are now moved around the country, from one flowering crop to another. Close quarters and interactions with other hives have lead to the spread of diseases and parasites in bees weakened by inconsistent food supply and exposure to pesticides (IPBES, 2017). Honey bees are now dependent on beekeepers for their survival (Lowe, 2018).Industrial AgricultureAt the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of the population was agrarian. Agriculture became more efficient as machines became more prevalent and farms grew larger (O\u2019Brien, 1977). At the same time, factories multiplied and drew more people to urban areas, away from the land. This movement reinforced the need for farms to produce more food, with consumption increasingly separated from production. Farms became larger and larger. Fertilizers were developed during World War I as a by-product of chemical warfare, and production increased even more (Cordell, et. al. 2008). DDT was synthesized in 1939, the first widely available effective pesticide (Conis, 2017). Genetically modified crops became the third pillar of the industrial agriculture system and the current system of monocultures so detrimental to pollinators came to dominate (JH Bloomberg School of Public Health, 2016).Industrialization, Mass Production, and ConsumerismThe wage labor system replaced subsistence farming and manufacturing lead to a dramatic drop in the cost of goods. At the same time, the middle class grew as did disposable income and purchasing power. New convenience products were introduced to the market, such as the washing machine, and the attitude towards clothing and decorative goods moved from a focus on utilitarianism to the rise of the fashion cycle. Industrial production increased and consumerism was born.The Industrial Revolution initiated a clearance of forests, a vital habitat for bees, that continues to this day. While there was a history of land clearance in the old-world, forests were felled in great swaths in the Americas to provide farmland. With the multiplication of factories, the need for fuel also rapidly increased and forests were cut down to feed engines and smelters. Factories and houses required more timber, and more trees felled (Penna, 2014). There was a rapid rise in literacy with the new middle class and the demand for books and newspapers grew (Meggs and Purvis, 2016). The invention of wood pulp paper meant more forests were cleared (Kurlansky, 2016). With the increase in the production of goods came an increase in packaging. More trees were felled for crates and, beginning in World War II, cardboard. At mid-century social attitudes changed and disposable napkins, towels, and toilet paper met the need for hygiene and convenience, meaning more forests disappeared. In the United States alone, forested land dropped from an estimated 1,023 million acres of forest in 1630 to 754 million acres in 1910, with the majority occurring in the later 19th century (USDA, 2014).With the movement to cities, social attitudes changed and the hygienic movement began. As a result, the incidents of disease greatly decreased and lives became longer. The population in industrialized countries rapidly increased as a result, and megacities were born, and small cities multiplied (Penna, 2014). As the poor came to cities seeking work, the wealthy and the new middle class viewed the environment as crime-ridden and unhealthy and started moving to the suburbs. As the suburbs grew, more forest was cut down and replaced by grass lawns. In the past 50 years, those lawns have become cropped and heavily treated monocultures, leaving little opportunity for pollinator foraging.Climate ChangeClimate change, caused by the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to industrialization and rapid population growth, has substantial impacts on pollinators. As winters become more inconsistent and spring comes earlier, there is a misalignment in pollinator life cycles and the flowering of trees and other plants. Pollinators are then left without food as they are emerging from hibernation (IPBES, 2017).Weather inconsistency also makes crops unreliable and many trees and flowering plants may fail to fruit or seed if subjected to frost. Immediately, the loss of flowers removes a food source, but farmers may change crops or remove trees when the crop ceases to be profitable or reliable. Removing trees denies wild bees essential food sources. Trees also become stressed with extremes of weather and habitat change, causing them to die and, again, depriving pollinators a food source.Other impacts of climate change are more subtle. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere may change plant chemistry rendering the food source harmful to pollinators (Arnold, 2018). Changes in temperatures and patterns of precipitation lead to changes in the ranges of diseases and parasites, possibly directly affecting pollinators.Finally, our understanding of pollinators is inadequate. While honey bees have been studied for centuries, the vast majority of pollinators are wild and unmanaged. Science has ignored the wild bees until recently, so there is no baseline for their population. We do not know how they have been affected by climate change. Add to their number the moths, butterflies, wasps, beetles, flies, thrips, birds, bats, other rodents, and many other vertebrates that pollinate plants, and there is a large hole in our understanding of lives of these important animals and the impact of human development and agriculture.Globalization and the World WarsGlobalization is a broad, expansive topic that can be discussed from many angles, but we will focus on economist Thomas Friedman\u2019s term \u201cGlobalization 2.0,\u201d or globalization of companies. This is notable to our wicked problem because of its impact on industrialization and mass production. As niche companies grew into dominant forces at the regime, so too did the inherent need for efficiency of work, calculability of outcome, predictability/standardization of process, and control over the workforce, concepts that bundled together, would later be coined \u201cMcDonaldization\u201d by sociologist George Ritzer. These landscape level concepts particularly reinforce industrial agriculture and food systems, where the former aims to produce the greatest output of crops at the expense of labor and the environment, and the latter aims to sell as much food as possible for profit.Additionally, the World Wars, ranging from World War I to the Cold War, had many cultural and social implications, discussed in more detail below. As a general statement, these wars were massive in scale and ruthless with regard to human and environmental life. Countless natural habitats were obliterated and continued to be destroyed as a byproduct of war, causing problems with the general biodiversity and ecosystems of the planet. These wars created landscape level changes in culture that normalized the destruction of places in the pursuit of human interest.Social Attitudes and Social MovementsThere are many social movements and attitudes that are related to our problem, but we will focus on 3: The change of attitudes towards chemicals, the emergence of women in the workforce, and the rising of environmental movements.The normalization of chemical use can be partially attributed to the World Wars and similar acts of fighting for territory or supremacy in the 1900s. Experimentation with chemicals and their uses was fueled by the industrialization in the 1800s, and by 1907, the Hague Convention prohibited poison or poisoned weapons. Unfortunately, chemical warfare was prevalent in World War I (mustard gas), Holocaust gas chambers, and the Vietnam War (Agent Orange), to name a few devastating cases. Most notably to our pollinators, DDT changed from a niche level discovery to a regime level use case in World War II, when DDT was systematically used to control parasite-spread diseases for troops. By the end of of the War, DDT was made available for commercial use as a pesticide in the US. While DDT was eventually banned due to modern pro-environmental movements, the shift in the relationship towards chemicals as useful and acceptable on a landscape level spurred many other problems for pollinators, such as the rise of pesticides and GMOs and reduction of their habitat and nesting spaces.As previously mentioned, DDT was developed in 1939. Although it was used to control crop pests as well as malaria-carrying mosquitos, it also killed many beneficial insects and pollinators. Questions regarding its toxicity began in the late 1950s (Conis, 2017). Silent Spring by Rachel Carson drew attention to the impact of pesticides, including DDT, on human health and the environment. Her book helped ignite anti-chemical, anti-pesticide, environmental justice movements. At the same time, Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez co-founded the United Farm Workers (Juur, 2017). Their fight for better working conditions included drawing attention to the health toll of exposure to pesticides. These movements ultimately lead to the founding of the Environmental Defense Fund in 1967 and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 (McLaughlin. n.d.). DDT was mostly banned in the United States in 1973, followed by other pesticides in the late 1970s. A class of substitute pesticides, neonicotinoids, has been linked to colony collapse disorder although findings in the wild are inconclusive (Cornell, n.d.).The emergence of women in the workforce began with shifting attitudes towards women and women\u2019s rights. In 1920, women received the right to vote and began slowly shifting attitudes around a woman\u2019s place in society. The World Wars helped integrate women into working society since many men were drafted to fight in the war. As more women began working, they were able to dedicate less time to home life, and with most men being unwilling to pick up this task, the invention of niche-level convenience foods, such as \u201cTV dinners\u201d began to rise, which reinforced the demand for mass production of foods, industrial agriculture, and the popularity of modern food systems, reinforcing the need for more pollinators to pollinate more monocrops.Finally, around the 1960s, the modern era of pro-environmental movements and awareness began to rise, shifting attitudes at the landscape level. Advances in space travel and subsequently imaging helped people visualize the Earth in its beauty. Around this time, ideas of global warming began gaining traction as well. All these helped people push back against the dazzling allure of consumerism and put us on the fighting path for environmental protection. Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring played a major role in jumpstarting awareness around the harmful impact of pesticides on the environment and pushed back on attitudes around chemicals, eventually leading to the ban of DDT for agricultural use and providing the basis of a later movement back to organic foods that are grown responsibly. To note, unfortunately, this led to other technological advances such as substitute pesticides and GMOs in industrial agriculture.Food SystemsIn 1916, the Piggly Wiggly, America\u2019s first self-serve grocery store, opened in Memphis. This niche level innovation was the first major shift away from small town grocers and paved the way for bigger supermarkets, such as Kroger and Safeway, to open in the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1950s, many small self-service grocery stores had consolidated into supermarket chains, catalyzed in part by America\u2019s shift to living in the suburbs and fueled by the new age of consumerism and marketing. In parallel, the World Wars also contributed to this shift, since thousands of smaller grocery stores were forced to close as employees left to serve in the war.The rise of supermarkets ushered in an era of convenience mentality. While people previous had to visit a butcher, baker, and candlestick maker to get their meat, bread, and sundry items, much of that was now consolidated in one place for cheaper prices. Additionally, the increasing popularity and affordability of refrigerators and automobiles meant that people could now drive to stores, pick up more things at once, and store them for longer periods of time. This created a feedback loop of food consumerism. Stores and food distributors had a new pressure to provide an abundance of food options for consumers, which in turn positively reinforced industrial agriculture and mass production of foods, which then reinforced our consumerist mentality that many food options should be available to us at all times.Identifying Leverage\u00a0PointsAfter analyzing our wicked problem map, stakeholder relationships and the MLP, we now have a deeper understanding of the system, the relationships and the timeline or history of this problem. Our insights from all of these served our analysis of the \u2018leverage points\u2019 of the system, or the places at which we\u2019d intervene to transition away from the decline of pollinators.Systems analyst and scientist, Donella Meadows introduced a list leverage points in 1997 after attending a NAFTA meeting with colleagues\u200a\u2014\u200aafter realizing just how large the system in front of her was and how ineffective the proposed solutions seemed. She writes about leverage points as places within a complex system where a small intervention can produce big changes in the entire system. The twelve intervention points have ascending levels of effectiveness and must be closely monitored to truly understand how the system changes.Within the problem of the decline of pollinators in Pittsburgh (and across the U.S.), we looked across these places to intervene within a system and ideated on a possible interventions that can have the biggest impact in the system.Leverage Point 8, Strength of Negative Feedback Loops:Since one of the major causes of the decline of pollinators is the loss of habitat, we identified negative feedback loops as a fertile leverage point to counter the declining trend in pollinators. This would entail the recovery of lost habitat by greening land and spaces with pollinator-friendly species of plants. While urban land can utilize empty lots, personal yards and gardens and public spaces to plant flowering plants, rural land may be made pollinator friendly by creating and maintaining wildflower meadows and field margins. Another method that can serve as a negative feedback loop in rural farms are practices like crop rotation that decrease reliance on pesticides.Leverage Point 6, Structure of Information Flows:Today\u2019s consumers have been completely disconnected from the food systems that supply their food. Access to information about foods that are local, seasonal, organic, and the benefits of these can create the awareness in people that influences their behaviors and approach to the food system. Choices that support more sustainable agriculture can then influence the \u2018rules of the system\u2019 by increasing the demand for more sustainable agriculture, and in turn reduce the usage of pesticides. This might also affect a reduction in the transportation of bees from state to state to pollinate crops, which not only reduces the stress on bees, but also in turn cut down on carbon emissions. Conscious consumers can, over time, influence the leverage point of mindset, of their own group, but also producers and policy makers.Leverage Point 2, Changing the Mindset:One of the most powerful, but difficult, leverage points to intervene at, is the mindset. We identified that the shift of a profit and convenience mindset of commercial agriculture to a holistic mindset around sustainability can become the intervention point that influences the behavior of all actors within the system. Given the threat faced by the decline of pollinators and loss of soil capacity, we might even be able to create a niche that aims for this target. This change in mindset would influence a fundamental altering of the goal of a system too\u2013 from fast economic gain, to sustainment via healthier soil and eco-system, reducing the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals. However, changing the mindset, or the goal of a system would require policy, grassroots organizing, consumer demand and awareness, and other feedback loops to be addressed simultaneously for it to be effective.Review of Process and Next\u00a0StepsCreating and using an MLP to find intervention points shares a lot of parallels to a more traditional design process approach; starting from a holistic vantage point, a designer pinpoints smaller cycles at work and uses that top-down approach to have a better understanding of their relationships. More commonly however, design research typically is not as wide in spectrum of how broad and how granular its changing scope is. An extremely useful part of this process that our team appreciated was being able to discover these different catalysts of transitions and draw their relationships across exceptionally large timelines. From there, considering how subtle \u2018acupunture\u2019 needles can drive landscape level changes through a logical cycle over time became second nature and much easier to think about.Although initially, our team had trouble discerning what constitutes a landscape vs regime level event (niche events are relatively self-explanatory), that difficulty translated into more discussions about how these events fit together and led to greater insights overall.Our team\u2019s next assignment will be practicing envisioning futures where our wicked problem is solved. What kind of societal perceptions, beliefs, and paradigms would need to exist for the decline in pollinators to no longer be a problem? Is it possible to create a future where all stakeholder concerns are appeased? Solutions sometimes fall into the trap of being reduced down to single, one-time injections that end up having quick expiration dates. Envisioning futures and articulating solutions can provide room to generate ideas that are holistic and sustainable.", "url": "https://medium.com/transition-design-decline-of-pollinators/multi-level-perspective-mapping-a24e6b5f8b24", "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\"><head prefix=\"og: http://ogp.me/ns# fb: http://ogp.me/ns/fb# medium-com: http://ogp.me/ns/fb/medium-com#\"><meta content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=contain\" name=\"viewport\"/><title>Multi-Level Perspective Mapping \u2013 Transition Design: Decline of Pollinators \u2013 Medium</title><link href=\"https://medium.com/transition-design-decline-of-pollinators/multi-level-perspective-mapping-a24e6b5f8b24\" rel=\"canonical\"/><meta content=\"Multi-Level Perspective Mapping \u2013 Transition Design: Decline of Pollinators \u2013 Medium\" name=\"title\"/><meta content=\"origin\" name=\"referrer\"/><meta content=\"The story of pollinators and why they are on the decline is much, much bigger than just bees.

pollinators and why they are on the decline is much, much bigger than just bees. Unfortunately, there is no one convenient antagonist to point to and declare as the cause of all of our problems. To truly investigate the historical context and forces at play within this wicked problem, one needs to submerge themselves in an ocean of global events, social movements, the consequences of these changes, and the ideologies that grew from them. Considering how interconnected and plentiful these historical threads are, how do we even begin to picture the timeline of the pollinators and their decline?</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"dac5\" name=\"dac5\">The Multi-Level Perspective Model</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"ab2c\" name=\"ab2c\">In his article, \u201cThe Dynamics of Transitions in Socio-technical Systems: A Multi-level Analysis of the Transition Pathway from Horse-drawn Carriages to Automobiles (1860\u20131930)\u201d, F. W. Geels takes a look at society\u2019s transition from travel by horse-drawn carriage to travel by automobile. He admits that advances in technologies certainly do play important roles in spurring these societal transitions, but they are definitely not the sole catalyst. Many other key players such as economic infrastructure, social and cultural perception, and developing markets all needed to align into self-reinforcing loops to make automobiles as pervasive as they are today.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"272f\" name=\"272f\">To help apply this holistic approach to examining the causes of the decline in pollinators, our team took a note from Geels and went about creating a Multi-Level Perspective map. By dividing up the different historical drivers of this wicked problem into different levels, it allows us to see how small, niche events grow into regime-level networks and institutions, which eventually become ingrained in our perception and policies at the slow-moving landscape level.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"21cb\" name=\"21cb\">By using this model and identifying the flow of events from niche to landscape, we can then start categorizing the different loops at play and use these categories to come up with potential intervention points and gauge their effectiveness. While the first assignment of this five-part project took a look at the various stakeholders within the decline in pollinators and learning what their hopes and dreams are, this second assignment is about discovering the historical context of the problem and finding where the access points are for possible sustainable solutions.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"c1b9\" name=\"c1b9\">Making the\u00a0Map</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"5233\" name=\"5233\">Considering that industrial agriculture is currently a huge stakeholder, it was natural to begin with the most painfully obvious event that helped lead to the dominance of giant corporate entities and shameless consumerism: the Industrial Revolution. From this starting point, other large global events were identified as frames of references for our timeline; World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and the Moonshot are all major events that can be broken down into more granular events and consequences that fit into a niche-regime-landscape format. By breaking up these events into the actions and ideologies they compose, the map filled up very quickly.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"3297\" name=\"3297\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png\" data-height=\"3024\" data-image-id=\"1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png\" data-width=\"4032\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The MLP Map for the Decline in Pollinators</figcaption></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"5615\" name=\"5615\">Sorted by time and by niche/regime/landscape classification, each concept was also color-coded by general topic: red for mindsets/social movements, pink for global events, gold for government and policy, light yellow for economics, purple for infrastructure/technology, and green for environmental. From here, connections were drawn to represent events that either fed into each other, or hurt the progress of another. For example, the acceptance of the use of chemical warfare during WWII led into both the further development of chemicals as a tool and also cementing its place in public perception. This normalization and acceptance led to using chemicals in pesticides to support industrial agriculture, which is now a huge contributor to the poor health and collapse of beehives and colonies.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"98f7\" name=\"98f7\">By constructing these threads across levels, patterns emerged on what major paradigm shifts influenced the decline in pollinators.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"c0e7\" name=\"c0e7\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 933px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png\" data-height=\"4032\" data-image-id=\"1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png\" data-width=\"3024\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"d048\" name=\"d048\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 933px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png\" data-height=\"4032\" data-image-id=\"1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png\" data-width=\"3024\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"61fb\" name=\"61fb\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 933px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png\" data-height=\"4032\" data-image-id=\"1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png\" data-width=\"3024\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\" id=\"1242\" name=\"1242\">Thread Categories</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"6457\" name=\"6457\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Beekeeping Technology</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"427f\" name=\"427f\">Honey bees were introduced to the Americas by early colonists; later immigrants brought hives with them as they crossed the Atlantic or the country, only reaching California in the mid 19th century. Bee varieties varied until the 19th-century when Italian honey bees became fashionable and gradually came to make up the vast majority of domesticated bees in the United States (Oertel, 1980).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad06\" name=\"ad06\">Honey Beekeeping technology is ancient and was mostly unchanged from ancient Egypt until the invention of the modern frame hive in the mid 19th century (Kritsky, 2017). This innovation allowed beekeepers to harvest both honey and wax without destroying the entire hive. The practice of transporting hives also dates to the ancient era, but the new structures facilitated movement of the bees (Lowe, 2018). It wasn\u2019t until the advent of the automobile and the road improvement movement that their transport became practical. Finally, in the 1950s the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System allowed for the current practice of bringing the bees to the crops (Oertel, 1980). Honey bees, who naturally spend their lives in a few square miles, are now moved around the country, from one flowering crop to another. Close quarters and interactions with other hives have lead to the spread of diseases and parasites in bees weakened by inconsistent food supply and exposure to pesticides (IPBES, 2017). Honey bees are now dependent on beekeepers for their survival (Lowe, 2018).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"26a2\" name=\"26a2\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Industrial Agriculture</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e13\" name=\"7e13\">At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of the population was agrarian. Agriculture became more efficient as machines became more prevalent and farms grew larger (O\u2019Brien, 1977). At the same time, factories multiplied and drew more people to urban areas, away from the land. This movement reinforced the need for farms to produce more food, with consumption increasingly separated from production. Farms became larger and larger. Fertilizers were developed during World War I as a by-product of chemical warfare, and production increased even more (Cordell, et. al. 2008). DDT was synthesized in 1939, the first widely available effective pesticide <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt\" href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Conis, 2017)</a>.

At the same time, the middle class grew as did disposable income and purchasing power. New convenience products were introduced to the market, such as the washing machine, and the attitude towards clothing and decorative goods moved from a focus on utilitarianism to the rise of the fashion cycle. Industrial production increased and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consumerism</strong> was born.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"608f\" name=\"608f\">The Industrial Revolution initiated a clearance of forests, a vital habitat for bees, that continues to this day. While there was a history of land clearance in the old-world, forests were felled in great swaths in the Americas to provide farmland. With the multiplication of factories, the need for fuel also rapidly increased and forests were cut down to feed engines and smelters. Factories and houses required more timber, and more trees felled (Penna, 2014). There was a rapid rise in literacy with the new middle class and the demand for books and newspapers grew (Meggs and Purvis, 2016). The invention of wood pulp paper meant more forests were cleared (Kurlansky, 2016). With the increase in the production of goods came an increase in packaging. More trees were felled for crates and, beginning in <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World War II</strong>, cardboard. At mid-century <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">social attitudes</strong> changed and disposable napkins, towels, and toilet paper met the need for hygiene and convenience, meaning more forests disappeared. In the United States alone, forested land dropped from an estimated 1,023 million acres of forest in 1630 to 754 million acres in 1910, with the majority occurring in the later 19th century (USDA, 2014).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c12\" name=\"7c12\">With the movement to cities, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">social attitudes</strong> changed and the hygienic <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">movement</strong> began. As a result, the incidents of disease greatly decreased and lives became longer. The population in industrialized countries rapidly increased as a result, and megacities were born, and small cities multiplied (Penna, 2014). As the poor came to cities seeking work, the wealthy and the new middle class viewed the environment as crime-ridden and unhealthy and started moving to the suburbs. As the suburbs grew, more forest was cut down and replaced by grass lawns. In the past 50 years, those lawns have become cropped and heavily treated monocultures, leaving little opportunity for pollinator foraging.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"529e\" name=\"529e\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Climate Change</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"78ee\" name=\"78ee\">Climate change, caused by the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrialization</strong> and rapid <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">population growth</strong>, has substantial impacts on pollinators. As winters become more inconsistent and spring comes earlier, there is a misalignment in pollinator life cycles and the flowering of trees and other plants. Pollinators are then left without food as they are emerging from hibernation (IPBES, 2017).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d1fa\" name=\"d1fa\">Weather inconsistency also makes crops unreliable and many trees and flowering plants may fail to fruit or seed if subjected to frost. Immediately, the loss of flowers removes a food source, but farmers may change crops or remove trees when the crop ceases to be profitable or reliable. Removing trees denies wild bees essential food sources. Trees also become stressed with extremes of weather and habitat change, causing them to die and, again, depriving pollinators a food source.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"526f\" name=\"526f\">Other impacts of climate change are more subtle. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere may change plant chemistry rendering the food source harmful to pollinators <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/12/monarch-butterflies-risk-extinction-climate-change/\" href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/12/monarch-butterflies-risk-extinction-climate-change/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Arnold, 2018)</a>. Changes in temperatures and patterns of precipitation lead to changes in the ranges of diseases and parasites, possibly directly affecting pollinators.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0ca7\" name=\"0ca7\">Finally, our understanding of pollinators is inadequate. While honey bees have been studied for centuries, the vast majority of pollinators are wild and unmanaged. Science has ignored the wild bees until recently, so there is no baseline for their population. We do not know how they have been affected by climate change. Add to their number the moths, butterflies, wasps, beetles, flies, thrips, birds, bats, other rodents, and many other vertebrates that pollinate plants, and there is a large hole in our understanding of lives of these important animals and the impact of human development and agriculture.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4422\" name=\"4422\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Globalization and the World Wars</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c554\" name=\"c554\">Globalization is a broad, expansive topic that can be discussed from many angles, but we will focus on economist Thomas Friedman\u2019s term \u201cGlobalization 2.0,\u201d or globalization of companies. This is notable to our wicked problem because of its impact on <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrialization and mass production. </strong>As niche companies grew into dominant forces at the regime, so too did the inherent need for efficiency of work, calculability of outcome, predictability/standardization of process, and control over the workforce, concepts that bundled together, would later be coined \u201cMcDonaldization\u201d by sociologist George Ritzer. These landscape level concepts particularly reinforce <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture</strong> and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">food systems</strong>, where the former aims to produce the greatest output of crops at the expense of labor and the environment, and the latter aims to sell as much food as possible for profit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5fff\" name=\"5fff\">Additionally, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World Wars</strong>, ranging from World War I to the Cold War, had many cultural and social implications, discussed in more detail below. As a general statement, these wars were massive in scale and ruthless with regard to human and environmental life. Countless natural habitats were obliterated and continued to be destroyed as a byproduct of war, causing problems with the general biodiversity and ecosystems of the planet. These wars created landscape level changes in culture that normalized the destruction of places in the pursuit of human interest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3b90\" name=\"3b90\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Social Attitudes and Social Movements</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0690\" name=\"0690\">There are many social movements and attitudes that are related to our problem, but we will focus on 3: The change of attitudes towards chemicals, the emergence of women in the workforce, and the rising of environmental movements.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cb7f\" name=\"cb7f\">The <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">normalization of chemical use</strong> can be partially attributed to the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World Wars </strong>and similar acts of fighting for territory or supremacy in the 1900s. Experimentation with chemicals and their uses was fueled by the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrialization</strong> in the 1800s, and by 1907, the Hague Convention prohibited poison or poisoned weapons. Unfortunately, chemical warfare was prevalent in World War I (mustard gas), Holocaust gas chambers, and the Vietnam War (Agent Orange), to name a few devastating cases. Most notably to our pollinators, DDT changed from a niche level discovery to a regime level use case in World War II, when DDT was systematically used to control parasite-spread diseases for troops. By the end of of the War, DDT was made available for commercial use as a pesticide in the US. While DDT was eventually banned due to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">modern pro-environmental movements</strong>, the shift in the relationship towards chemicals as useful and acceptable on a landscape level spurred many other problems for pollinators, such as the rise of pesticides and GMOs and reduction of their habitat and nesting spaces.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a54\" name=\"2a54\">As previously mentioned, DDT was developed in 1939. Although it was used to control crop pests as well as malaria-carrying mosquitos, it also killed many beneficial insects and pollinators. Questions regarding its toxicity began in the late 1950s <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt\" href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Conis, 2017)</a>. Silent Spring by Rachel Carson drew attention to the impact of pesticides, including DDT, on human health and the environment. Her book helped ignite anti-chemical, anti-pesticide, environmental justice <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">movements</strong>. At the same time, Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez co-founded the United Farm Workers <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/blog/5097/activism-as-art-giving-dolores-huerta-her-rightful-place-in-american-history\" href=\"https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/blog/5097/activism-as-art-giving-dolores-huerta-her-rightful-place-in-american-history\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Juur, 2017)</a>. Their fight for better working conditions included drawing attention to the health toll of exposure to pesticides. These movements ultimately lead to the founding of the Environmental Defense Fund in 1967 and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(McLaughlin. n.d.)</a>. DDT was mostly banned in the United States in 1973, followed by other pesticides in the late 1970s. A class of substitute pesticides, neonicotinoids, has been linked to colony collapse disorder although findings in the wild are inconclusive <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://pollinator.cals.cornell.edu/threats-wild-and-managed-bees/pesticides/neonicotinoids/\" href=\"https://pollinator.cals.cornell.edu/threats-wild-and-managed-bees/pesticides/neonicotinoids/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Cornell, n.d.)</a>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f42\" name=\"1f42\">The <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">emergence of women in the workforce</strong> began with shifting attitudes towards women and women\u2019s rights. In 1920, women received the right to vote and began slowly shifting attitudes around a woman\u2019s place in society. The <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World Wars</strong> helped integrate women into working society since many men were drafted to fight in the war. As more women began working, they were able to dedicate less time to home life, and with most men being unwilling to pick up this task, the invention of niche-level convenience foods, such as \u201cTV dinners\u201d began to rise, which reinforced the demand for <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">mass production</strong> of foods, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture,</strong> and the popularity of modern <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">food systems</strong>, reinforcing the need for more pollinators to pollinate more monocrops.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8beb\" name=\"8beb\">Finally, around the 1960s, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">modern era of pro-environmental movements and awareness</strong> began to rise, shifting attitudes at the landscape level. Advances in space travel and subsequently imaging helped people visualize the Earth in its beauty. Around this time, ideas of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">global warming </strong>began gaining traction as well. All these helped people push back against the dazzling allure of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consumerism</strong> and put us on the fighting path for environmental protection. Rachel Carson\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Silent Spring</em> played a major role in jumpstarting awareness around the harmful impact of pesticides on the environment and pushed back on <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">attitudes around chemicals, </strong>eventually leading to the ban of DDT for agricultural use and providing the basis of a later movement back to organic foods that are grown responsibly. To note, unfortunately, this led to other technological advances such as substitute pesticides and GMOs in <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture.</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f6a\" name=\"1f6a\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Food Systems</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f298\" name=\"f298\">In 1916, the Piggly Wiggly, America\u2019s first self-serve grocery store, opened in Memphis. This niche level innovation was the first major shift away from small town grocers and paved the way for bigger supermarkets, such as Kroger and Safeway, to open in the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1950s, many small self-service grocery stores had consolidated into supermarket chains, catalyzed in part by America\u2019s shift to living in the suburbs and fueled by the new age of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consumerism</strong> and marketing. In parallel, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World Wars </strong>also contributed to this shift, since thousands of smaller grocery stores were forced to close as employees left to serve in the war.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c062\" name=\"c062\">The rise of supermarkets ushered in an era of convenience mentality. While people previous had to visit a butcher, baker, and candlestick maker to get their meat, bread, and sundry items, much of that was now consolidated in one place for cheaper prices. Additionally, the increasing popularity and affordability of refrigerators and automobiles meant that people could now drive to stores, pick up more things at once, and store them for longer periods of time. This created a feedback loop of food <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consumerism</strong>. Stores and food distributors had a new pressure to provide an abundance of food options for consumers, which in turn positively reinforced <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture and mass production</strong> of foods, which then reinforced our consumerist mentality that many food options should be available to us at all times.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"f11f\" name=\"f11f\">Identifying Leverage\u00a0Points</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"cf9f\" name=\"cf9f\">After analyzing our wicked problem map, stakeholder relationships and the MLP, we now have a deeper understanding of the system, the relationships and the timeline or history of this problem. Our insights from all of these served our analysis of the \u2018leverage points\u2019 of the system, or the places at which we\u2019d intervene to transition away from the decline of pollinators.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9b6e\" name=\"9b6e\">Systems analyst and scientist, Donella Meadows introduced a list leverage points in 1997 after attending a NAFTA meeting with colleagues\u200a\u2014\u200aafter realizing just how large the system in front of her was and how ineffective the proposed solutions seemed. She writes about leverage points as places within a complex system where a small intervention can produce big changes in the entire system. The twelve intervention points have ascending levels of effectiveness and must be closely monitored to truly understand how the system changes.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"a41e\" name=\"a41e\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 524px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png\" data-height=\"729\" data-image-id=\"1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png\" data-width=\"974\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"ea7c\" name=\"ea7c\">Within the problem of the decline of pollinators in Pittsburgh (and across the U.S.), we looked across these places to intervene within a system and ideated on a possible interventions that can have the biggest impact in the system.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"96a7\" name=\"96a7\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Leverage Point 8, Strength of Negative Feedback Loops:</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b370\" name=\"b370\">Since one of the major causes of the decline of pollinators is the loss of habitat, we identified negative feedback loops as a fertile leverage point to counter the declining trend in pollinators. This would entail the recovery of lost habitat by greening land and spaces with pollinator-friendly species of plants. While urban land can utilize empty lots, personal yards and gardens and public spaces to plant flowering plants, rural land may be made pollinator friendly by creating and maintaining wildflower meadows and field margins. Another method that can serve as a negative feedback loop in rural farms are practices like crop rotation that decrease reliance on pesticides.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5eb4\" name=\"5eb4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Leverage Point 6, Structure of Information Flows:</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b5a6\" name=\"b5a6\">Today\u2019s consumers have been completely disconnected from the food systems that supply their food. Access to information about foods that are local, seasonal, organic, and the benefits of these can create the awareness in people that influences their behaviors and approach to the food system. Choices that support more sustainable agriculture can then influence the \u2018rules of the system\u2019 by increasing the demand for more sustainable agriculture, and in turn reduce the usage of pesticides. This might also affect a reduction in the transportation of bees from state to state to pollinate crops, which not only reduces the stress on bees, but also in turn cut down on carbon emissions. Conscious consumers can, over time, influence the leverage point of mindset, of their own group, but also producers and policy makers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6786\" name=\"6786\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Leverage Point 2, Changing the Mindset:</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7aaa\" name=\"7aaa\">One of the most powerful, but difficult, leverage points to intervene at, is the mindset. We identified that the shift of a profit and convenience mindset of commercial agriculture to a holistic mindset around sustainability can become the intervention point that influences the behavior of all actors within the system. Given the threat faced by the decline of pollinators and loss of soil capacity, we might even be able to create a niche that aims for this target. This change in mindset would influence a fundamental altering of the goal of a system too\u2013 from fast economic gain, to sustainment via healthier soil and eco-system, reducing the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals. However, changing the mindset, or the goal of a system would require policy, grassroots organizing, consumer demand and awareness, and other feedback loops to be addressed simultaneously for it to be effective.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"c179\" name=\"c179\">Review of Process and Next\u00a0Steps</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"a6a0\" name=\"a6a0\">Creating and using an MLP to find intervention points shares a lot of parallels to a more traditional design process approach; starting from a holistic vantage point, a designer pinpoints smaller cycles at work and uses that top-down approach to have a better understanding of their relationships. More commonly however, design research typically is not as wide in spectrum of how broad and how granular its changing scope is. An extremely useful part of this process that our team appreciated was being able to discover these different catalysts of transitions and draw their relationships across exceptionally large timelines. From there, considering how subtle \u2018acupunture\u2019 needles can drive landscape level changes through a logical cycle over time became second nature and much easier to think about.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"587e\" name=\"587e\">Although initially, our team had trouble discerning what constitutes a landscape vs regime level event (niche events are relatively self-explanatory), that difficulty translated into more discussions about how these events fit together and led to greater insights overall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"77ec\" name=\"77ec\">Our team\u2019s next assignment will be practicing envisioning futures where our wicked problem is solved. What kind of societal perceptions, beliefs, and paradigms would need to exist for the decline in pollinators to no longer be a problem? Is it possible to create a future where all stakeholder concerns are appeased? Solutions sometimes fall into the trap of being reduced down to single, one-time injections that end up having quick expiration dates. Envisioning futures and articulating solutions can provide room to generate ideas that are holistic and sustainable.</p></div></div></section></div><footer class=\"u-paddingTop10\"><div

For example, the acceptance of the use of chemical warfare during WWII led into both the further development of chemicals as a tool and also cementing its place in public perception.

The practice of transporting hives also dates to the ancient era, but the new structures facilitated movement of the bees (Lowe, 2018). It wasn\u2019t until the advent of the automobile and the road improvement movement that their transport became practical. Finally, in the 1950s the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System allowed for the current practice of bringing the bees to the crops (Oertel, 1980). Honey bees, who naturally spend their lives in a few square miles, are now moved around the country, from one flowering crop to another. Close quarters and interactions with other hives have lead to the spread of diseases and parasites in bees weakened by inconsistent food supply and exposure to pesticides (IPBES, 2017).

Agriculture became more efficient as machines became more prevalent and farms grew larger (O\u2019Brien, 1977). At the same time, factories multiplied and drew more people to urban areas, away from the land. This movement reinforced the need for farms to produce more food, with consumption increasingly separated from production. Farms became larger and larger.

pollinators and why they are on the decline is much, much bigger than just bees. Unfortunately, there is no one convenient antagonist to point to and declare as the cause of all of our problems. To truly investigate the historical context and forces at play within this wicked problem, one needs to submerge themselves in an ocean of global events, social movements, the consequences of these changes, and the ideologies that grew from them. Considering how interconnected and plentiful these historical threads are, how do we even begin to picture the timeline of the pollinators and their decline?</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"dac5\" name=\"dac5\">The Multi-Level Perspective Model</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"ab2c\" name=\"ab2c\">In his article, \u201cThe Dynamics of Transitions in Socio-technical Systems: A Multi-level Analysis of the Transition Pathway from Horse-drawn Carriages to Automobiles (1860\u20131930)\u201d, F. W. Geels takes a look at society\u2019s transition from travel by horse-drawn carriage to travel by automobile. He admits that advances in technologies certainly do play important roles in spurring these societal transitions, but they are definitely not the sole catalyst. Many other key players such as economic infrastructure, social and cultural perception, and developing markets all needed to align into self-reinforcing loops to make automobiles as pervasive as they are today.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"272f\" name=\"272f\">To help apply this holistic approach to examining the causes of the decline in pollinators, our team took a note from Geels and went about creating a Multi-Level Perspective map. By dividing up the different historical drivers of this wicked problem into different levels, it allows us to see how small, niche events grow into regime-level networks and institutions, which eventually become ingrained in our perception and policies at the slow-moving landscape level.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"21cb\" name=\"21cb\">By using this model and identifying the flow of events from niche to landscape, we can then start categorizing the different loops at play and use these categories to come up with potential intervention points and gauge their effectiveness. While the first assignment of this five-part project took a look at the various stakeholders within the decline in pollinators and learning what their hopes and dreams are, this second assignment is about discovering the historical context of the problem and finding where the access points are for possible sustainable solutions.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"c1b9\" name=\"c1b9\">Making the\u00a0Map</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"5233\" name=\"5233\">Considering that industrial agriculture is currently a huge stakeholder, it was natural to begin with the most painfully obvious event that helped lead to the dominance of giant corporate entities and shameless consumerism: the Industrial Revolution. From this starting point, other large global events were identified as frames of references for our timeline; World War I, World War II, the Cold War, and the Moonshot are all major events that can be broken down into more granular events and consequences that fit into a niche-regime-landscape format. By breaking up these events into the actions and ideologies they compose, the map filled up very quickly.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"3297\" name=\"3297\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png\" data-height=\"3024\" data-image-id=\"1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png\" data-width=\"4032\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*57yIQaRDiKS4blOTUP0mzg.png\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The MLP Map for the Decline in Pollinators</figcaption></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"5615\" name=\"5615\">Sorted by time and by niche/regime/landscape classification, each concept was also color-coded by general topic: red for mindsets/social movements, pink for global events, gold for government and policy, light yellow for economics, purple for infrastructure/technology, and green for environmental. From here, connections were drawn to represent events that either fed into each other, or hurt the progress of another. For example, the acceptance of the use of chemical warfare during WWII led into both the further development of chemicals as a tool and also cementing its place in public perception. This normalization and acceptance led to using chemicals in pesticides to support industrial agriculture, which is now a huge contributor to the poor health and collapse of beehives and colonies.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"98f7\" name=\"98f7\">By constructing these threads across levels, patterns emerged on what major paradigm shifts influenced the decline in pollinators.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"c0e7\" name=\"c0e7\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 933px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png\" data-height=\"4032\" data-image-id=\"1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png\" data-width=\"3024\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*auD8MDmrcHoSXAKpNExxaw.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"d048\" name=\"d048\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 933px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png\" data-height=\"4032\" data-image-id=\"1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png\" data-width=\"3024\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*74r2CGcZSmZ5IfNgc7LdyA.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--figure\" id=\"61fb\" name=\"61fb\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 933px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png\" data-height=\"4032\" data-image-id=\"1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png\" data-width=\"3024\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5o6IdEQhqxFF696cI8w6dA.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\" id=\"1242\" name=\"1242\">Thread Categories</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"6457\" name=\"6457\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Beekeeping Technology</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"427f\" name=\"427f\">Honey bees were introduced to the Americas by early colonists; later immigrants brought hives with them as they crossed the Atlantic or the country, only reaching California in the mid 19th century. Bee varieties varied until the 19th-century when Italian honey bees became fashionable and gradually came to make up the vast majority of domesticated bees in the United States (Oertel, 1980).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ad06\" name=\"ad06\">Honey Beekeeping technology is ancient and was mostly unchanged from ancient Egypt until the invention of the modern frame hive in the mid 19th century (Kritsky, 2017). This innovation allowed beekeepers to harvest both honey and wax without destroying the entire hive. The practice of transporting hives also dates to the ancient era, but the new structures facilitated movement of the bees (Lowe, 2018). It wasn\u2019t until the advent of the automobile and the road improvement movement that their transport became practical. Finally, in the 1950s the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System allowed for the current practice of bringing the bees to the crops (Oertel, 1980). Honey bees, who naturally spend their lives in a few square miles, are now moved around the country, from one flowering crop to another. Close quarters and interactions with other hives have lead to the spread of diseases and parasites in bees weakened by inconsistent food supply and exposure to pesticides (IPBES, 2017). Honey bees are now dependent on beekeepers for their survival (Lowe, 2018).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"26a2\" name=\"26a2\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Industrial Agriculture</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e13\" name=\"7e13\">At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of the population was agrarian. Agriculture became more efficient as machines became more prevalent and farms grew larger (O\u2019Brien, 1977). At the same time, factories multiplied and drew more people to urban areas, away from the land. This movement reinforced the need for farms to produce more food, with consumption increasingly separated from production. Farms became larger and larger. Fertilizers were developed during World War I as a by-product of chemical warfare, and production increased even more (Cordell, et. al. 2008). DDT was synthesized in 1939, the first widely available effective pesticide <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt\" href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Conis, 2017)</a>. Genetically modified crops became the third pillar of the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture</strong> system and the current system of monocultures so detrimental to pollinators came to dominate <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.foodsystemprimer.org/food-production/industrialization-of-agriculture/\" href=\"http://www.foodsystemprimer.org/food-production/industrialization-of-agriculture/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(JH Bloomberg School of Public Health, 2016)</a>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"10d6\" name=\"10d6\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Industrialization, Mass Production, and Consumerism</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8824\" name=\"8824\">The wage labor system replaced subsistence farming and manufacturing lead to a dramatic drop in the cost of goods. At the same time, the middle class grew as did disposable income and purchasing power. New convenience products were introduced to the market, such as the washing machine, and the attitude towards clothing and decorative goods moved from a focus on utilitarianism to the rise of the fashion cycle. Industrial production increased and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consumerism</strong> was born.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"608f\" name=\"608f\">The Industrial Revolution initiated a clearance of forests, a vital habitat for bees, that continues to this day. While there was a history of land clearance in the old-world, forests were felled in great swaths in the Americas to provide farmland. With the multiplication of factories, the need for fuel also rapidly increased and forests were cut down to feed engines and smelters. Factories and houses required more timber, and more trees felled (Penna, 2014). There was a rapid rise in literacy with the new middle class and the demand for books and newspapers grew (Meggs and Purvis, 2016). The invention of wood pulp paper meant more forests were cleared (Kurlansky, 2016). With the increase in the production of goods came an increase in packaging. More trees were felled for crates and, beginning in <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World War II</strong>, cardboard. At mid-century <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">social attitudes</strong> changed and disposable napkins, towels, and toilet paper met the need for hygiene and convenience, meaning more forests disappeared. In the United States alone, forested land dropped from an estimated 1,023 million acres of forest in 1630 to 754 million acres in 1910, with the majority occurring in the later 19th century (USDA, 2014).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7c12\" name=\"7c12\">With the movement to cities, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">social attitudes</strong> changed and the hygienic <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">movement</strong> began. As a result, the incidents of disease greatly decreased and lives became longer. The population in industrialized countries rapidly increased as a result, and megacities were born, and small cities multiplied (Penna, 2014). As the poor came to cities seeking work, the wealthy and the new middle class viewed the environment as crime-ridden and unhealthy and started moving to the suburbs. As the suburbs grew, more forest was cut down and replaced by grass lawns. In the past 50 years, those lawns have become cropped and heavily treated monocultures, leaving little opportunity for pollinator foraging.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"529e\" name=\"529e\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Climate Change</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"78ee\" name=\"78ee\">Climate change, caused by the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrialization</strong> and rapid <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">population growth</strong>, has substantial impacts on pollinators. As winters become more inconsistent and spring comes earlier, there is a misalignment in pollinator life cycles and the flowering of trees and other plants. Pollinators are then left without food as they are emerging from hibernation (IPBES, 2017).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"d1fa\" name=\"d1fa\">Weather inconsistency also makes crops unreliable and many trees and flowering plants may fail to fruit or seed if subjected to frost. Immediately, the loss of flowers removes a food source, but farmers may change crops or remove trees when the crop ceases to be profitable or reliable. Removing trees denies wild bees essential food sources. Trees also become stressed with extremes of weather and habitat change, causing them to die and, again, depriving pollinators a food source.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"526f\" name=\"526f\">Other impacts of climate change are more subtle. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere may change plant chemistry rendering the food source harmful to pollinators <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/12/monarch-butterflies-risk-extinction-climate-change/\" href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/12/monarch-butterflies-risk-extinction-climate-change/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Arnold, 2018)</a>. Changes in temperatures and patterns of precipitation lead to changes in the ranges of diseases and parasites, possibly directly affecting pollinators.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0ca7\" name=\"0ca7\">Finally, our understanding of pollinators is inadequate. While honey bees have been studied for centuries, the vast majority of pollinators are wild and unmanaged. Science has ignored the wild bees until recently, so there is no baseline for their population. We do not know how they have been affected by climate change. Add to their number the moths, butterflies, wasps, beetles, flies, thrips, birds, bats, other rodents, and many other vertebrates that pollinate plants, and there is a large hole in our understanding of lives of these important animals and the impact of human development and agriculture.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4422\" name=\"4422\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Globalization and the World Wars</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c554\" name=\"c554\">Globalization is a broad, expansive topic that can be discussed from many angles, but we will focus on economist Thomas Friedman\u2019s term \u201cGlobalization 2.0,\u201d or globalization of companies. This is notable to our wicked problem because of its impact on <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrialization and mass production. </strong>As niche companies grew into dominant forces at the regime, so too did the inherent need for efficiency of work, calculability of outcome, predictability/standardization of process, and control over the workforce, concepts that bundled together, would later be coined \u201cMcDonaldization\u201d by sociologist George Ritzer. These landscape level concepts particularly reinforce <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture</strong> and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">food systems</strong>, where the former aims to produce the greatest output of crops at the expense of labor and the environment, and the latter aims to sell as much food as possible for profit.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5fff\" name=\"5fff\">Additionally, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World Wars</strong>, ranging from World War I to the Cold War, had many cultural and social implications, discussed in more detail below. As a general statement, these wars were massive in scale and ruthless with regard to human and environmental life. Countless natural habitats were obliterated and continued to be destroyed as a byproduct of war, causing problems with the general biodiversity and ecosystems of the planet. These wars created landscape level changes in culture that normalized the destruction of places in the pursuit of human interest.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3b90\" name=\"3b90\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Social Attitudes and Social Movements</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0690\" name=\"0690\">There are many social movements and attitudes that are related to our problem, but we will focus on 3: The change of attitudes towards chemicals, the emergence of women in the workforce, and the rising of environmental movements.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"cb7f\" name=\"cb7f\">The <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">normalization of chemical use</strong> can be partially attributed to the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World Wars </strong>and similar acts of fighting for territory or supremacy in the 1900s. Experimentation with chemicals and their uses was fueled by the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrialization</strong> in the 1800s, and by 1907, the Hague Convention prohibited poison or poisoned weapons. Unfortunately, chemical warfare was prevalent in World War I (mustard gas), Holocaust gas chambers, and the Vietnam War (Agent Orange), to name a few devastating cases. Most notably to our pollinators, DDT changed from a niche level discovery to a regime level use case in World War II, when DDT was systematically used to control parasite-spread diseases for troops. By the end of of the War, DDT was made available for commercial use as a pesticide in the US. While DDT was eventually banned due to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">modern pro-environmental movements</strong>, the shift in the relationship towards chemicals as useful and acceptable on a landscape level spurred many other problems for pollinators, such as the rise of pesticides and GMOs and reduction of their habitat and nesting spaces.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"2a54\" name=\"2a54\">As previously mentioned, DDT was developed in 1939. Although it was used to control crop pests as well as malaria-carrying mosquitos, it also killed many beneficial insects and pollinators. Questions regarding its toxicity began in the late 1950s <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt\" href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Conis, 2017)</a>. Silent Spring by Rachel Carson drew attention to the impact of pesticides, including DDT, on human health and the environment. Her book helped ignite anti-chemical, anti-pesticide, environmental justice <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">movements</strong>. At the same time, Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez co-founded the United Farm Workers <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/blog/5097/activism-as-art-giving-dolores-huerta-her-rightful-place-in-american-history\" href=\"https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/blog/5097/activism-as-art-giving-dolores-huerta-her-rightful-place-in-american-history\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Juur, 2017)</a>. Their fight for better working conditions included drawing attention to the health toll of exposure to pesticides. These movements ultimately lead to the founding of the Environmental Defense Fund in 1967 and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(McLaughlin. n.d.)</a>. DDT was mostly banned in the United States in 1973, followed by other pesticides in the late 1970s. A class of substitute pesticides, neonicotinoids, has been linked to colony collapse disorder although findings in the wild are inconclusive <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"https://pollinator.cals.cornell.edu/threats-wild-and-managed-bees/pesticides/neonicotinoids/\" href=\"https://pollinator.cals.cornell.edu/threats-wild-and-managed-bees/pesticides/neonicotinoids/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(Cornell, n.d.)</a>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f42\" name=\"1f42\">The <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">emergence of women in the workforce</strong> began with shifting attitudes towards women and women\u2019s rights. In 1920, women received the right to vote and began slowly shifting attitudes around a woman\u2019s place in society. The <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World Wars</strong> helped integrate women into working society since many men were drafted to fight in the war. As more women began working, they were able to dedicate less time to home life, and with most men being unwilling to pick up this task, the invention of niche-level convenience foods, such as \u201cTV dinners\u201d began to rise, which reinforced the demand for <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">mass production</strong> of foods, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture,</strong> and the popularity of modern <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">food systems</strong>, reinforcing the need for more pollinators to pollinate more monocrops.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8beb\" name=\"8beb\">Finally, around the 1960s, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">modern era of pro-environmental movements and awareness</strong> began to rise, shifting attitudes at the landscape level. Advances in space travel and subsequently imaging helped people visualize the Earth in its beauty. Around this time, ideas of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">global warming </strong>began gaining traction as well. All these helped people push back against the dazzling allure of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consumerism</strong> and put us on the fighting path for environmental protection. Rachel Carson\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Silent Spring</em> played a major role in jumpstarting awareness around the harmful impact of pesticides on the environment and pushed back on <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">attitudes around chemicals, </strong>eventually leading to the ban of DDT for agricultural use and providing the basis of a later movement back to organic foods that are grown responsibly. To note, unfortunately, this led to other technological advances such as substitute pesticides and GMOs in <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture.</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1f6a\" name=\"1f6a\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Food Systems</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"f298\" name=\"f298\">In 1916, the Piggly Wiggly, America\u2019s first self-serve grocery store, opened in Memphis. This niche level innovation was the first major shift away from small town grocers and paved the way for bigger supermarkets, such as Kroger and Safeway, to open in the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1950s, many small self-service grocery stores had consolidated into supermarket chains, catalyzed in part by America\u2019s shift to living in the suburbs and fueled by the new age of <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consumerism</strong> and marketing. In parallel, the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">World Wars </strong>also contributed to this shift, since thousands of smaller grocery stores were forced to close as employees left to serve in the war.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c062\" name=\"c062\">The rise of supermarkets ushered in an era of convenience mentality. While people previous had to visit a butcher, baker, and candlestick maker to get their meat, bread, and sundry items, much of that was now consolidated in one place for cheaper prices. Additionally, the increasing popularity and affordability of refrigerators and automobiles meant that people could now drive to stores, pick up more things at once, and store them for longer periods of time. This created a feedback loop of food <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">consumerism</strong>. Stores and food distributors had a new pressure to provide an abundance of food options for consumers, which in turn positively reinforced <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">industrial agriculture and mass production</strong> of foods, which then reinforced our consumerist mentality that many food options should be available to us at all times.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"f11f\" name=\"f11f\">Identifying Leverage\u00a0Points</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"cf9f\" name=\"cf9f\">After analyzing our wicked problem map, stakeholder relationships and the MLP, we now have a deeper understanding of the system, the relationships and the timeline or history of this problem. Our insights from all of these served our analysis of the \u2018leverage points\u2019 of the system, or the places at which we\u2019d intervene to transition away from the decline of pollinators.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9b6e\" name=\"9b6e\">Systems analyst and scientist, Donella Meadows introduced a list leverage points in 1997 after attending a NAFTA meeting with colleagues\u200a\u2014\u200aafter realizing just how large the system in front of her was and how ineffective the proposed solutions seemed. She writes about leverage points as places within a complex system where a small intervention can produce big changes in the entire system. The twelve intervention points have ascending levels of effectiveness and must be closely monitored to truly understand how the system changes.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"a41e\" name=\"a41e\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 524px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png\" data-height=\"729\" data-image-id=\"1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png\" data-width=\"974\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BvNSmy8cVDdLaW3goHGaVg.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"ea7c\" name=\"ea7c\">Within the problem of the decline of pollinators in Pittsburgh (and across the U.S.), we looked across these places to intervene within a system and ideated on a possible interventions that can have the biggest impact in the system.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"96a7\" name=\"96a7\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Leverage Point 8, Strength of Negative Feedback Loops:</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b370\" name=\"b370\">Since one of the major causes of the decline of pollinators is the loss of habitat, we identified negative feedback loops as a fertile leverage point to counter the declining trend in pollinators. This would entail the recovery of lost habitat by greening land and spaces with pollinator-friendly species of plants. While urban land can utilize empty lots, personal yards and gardens and public spaces to plant flowering plants, rural land may be made pollinator friendly by creating and maintaining wildflower meadows and field margins. Another method that can serve as a negative feedback loop in rural farms are practices like crop rotation that decrease reliance on pesticides.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5eb4\" name=\"5eb4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Leverage Point 6, Structure of Information Flows:</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b5a6\" name=\"b5a6\">Today\u2019s consumers have been completely disconnected from the food systems that supply their food. Access to information about foods that are local, seasonal, organic, and the benefits of these can create the awareness in people that influences their behaviors and approach to the food system. Choices that support more sustainable agriculture can then influence the \u2018rules of the system\u2019 by increasing the demand for more sustainable agriculture, and in turn reduce the usage of pesticides. This might also affect a reduction in the transportation of bees from state to state to pollinate crops, which not only reduces the stress on bees, but also in turn cut down on carbon emissions. Conscious consumers can, over time, influence the leverage point of mindset, of their own group, but also producers and policy makers.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6786\" name=\"6786\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Leverage Point 2, Changing the Mindset:</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7aaa\" name=\"7aaa\">One of the most powerful, but difficult, leverage points to intervene at, is the mindset. We identified that the shift of a profit and convenience mindset of commercial agriculture to a holistic mindset around sustainability can become the intervention point that influences the behavior of all actors within the system. Given the threat faced by the decline of pollinators and loss of soil capacity, we might even be able to create a niche that aims for this target. This change in mindset would influence a fundamental altering of the goal of a system too\u2013 from fast economic gain, to sustainment via healthier soil and eco-system, reducing the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals. However, changing the mindset, or the goal of a system would require policy, grassroots organizing, consumer demand and awareness, and other feedback loops to be addressed simultaneously for it to be effective.</p><h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\" id=\"c179\" name=\"c179\">Review of Process and Next\u00a0Steps</h3><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\" id=\"a6a0\" name=\"a6a0\">Creating and using an MLP to find intervention points shares a lot of parallels to a more traditional design process approach; starting from a holistic vantage point, a designer pinpoints smaller cycles at work and uses that top-down approach to have a better understanding of their relationships. More commonly however, design research typically is not as wide in spectrum of how broad and how granular its changing scope is. An extremely useful part of this process that our team appreciated was being able to discover these different catalysts of transitions and draw their relationships across exceptionally large timelines. From there, considering how subtle \u2018acupunture\u2019 needles can drive landscape level changes through a logical cycle over time became second nature and much easier to think about.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"587e\" name=\"587e\">Although initially, our team had trouble discerning what constitutes a landscape vs regime level event (niche events are relatively self-explanatory), that difficulty translated into more discussions about how these events fit together and led to greater insights overall.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"77ec\" name=\"77ec\">Our team\u2019s next assignment will be practicing envisioning futures where our wicked problem is solved. What kind of societal perceptions, beliefs, and paradigms would need to exist for the decline in pollinators to no longer be a problem? Is it possible to create a future where all stakeholder concerns are appeased? Solutions sometimes fall into the trap of being reduced down to single, one-time injections that end up having quick expiration dates. Envisioning futures and articulating solutions can provide room to generate ideas that are holistic and sustainable.</p></div></div>"}

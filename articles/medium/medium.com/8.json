{"content": " What are the rules we expect the body to follow?When my wife, Cathreen, had our second child, on Thanksgiving Day 2016, we expected her body to return to its pre-pregnant state. For nearly the entire nine months, Cathreen had horrible morning sickness and could barely eat. She threw up constantly. She was dizzy and spent most of the day in bed. Everyone waited for the baby, and not only for the baby, but also for the end of The Sickness.The last pregnancy had also been difficult. Cathreen had pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), which is basically an incredibly itchy hive-like rash. She couldn\u2019t sleep for the itch. She had to take oatmeal baths and slather herself in aloe. Eventually the doctor made her go on steroids.According to her OB doctor, about one in 100 pregnant women get PUPPP (the internet says one in 160), but they often hardly notice, as PUPPP usually comes late in the third term before the baby is born, and birth makes the symptoms disappear. For PUPPP to appear in the third month (my wife\u2019s case), the odds were one in 100 cases of one in 100-something pregnancies\u200a\u2014\u200ararer than one in 10,000.In addition to PUPPP, Cathreen had morning sickness for four and a half months, a month and a half longer than is typical. We would try to go out, and she would make it to the end of the driveway before she threw up and had to turn back.About halfway through the pregnancy, Cathreen noticed that her body also itched in the cold. In the supermarket, if she reached for milk, her hand would break out in a rash. I had trouble believing an allergy to the cold was possible until the doctor confirmed it, to my shame.Once Cathreen gave birth, she was so happy for her body\u2019s old freedom that we immediately went for a walk, though this is not advised. She blames that walk for the pain that came afterward\u200a\u2014\u200afor a year, she had postpartum fibromyalgia. Korean tradition calls for the mother to stay warm and inside for the first three months after delivery, lest the wind gets into her bones, but we had treated this as a superstition. My wife had broken the rules.This is the rule we expected of her body: that the effects of pregnancy would disappear once she gave birth.The one extra complication in her second pregnancy\u200a\u2014\u200athe one that didn\u2019t even follow pregnancy rules\u200a\u2014\u200awas that she felt cold all the time, not hot. Later, we knew that her coldness should have alarmed us. In March, four months after our son was born, my wife couldn\u2019t stop losing weight, was still vomiting, and could no longer even drink.It turned out she had stage 4 stomach cancer.Cathreen immigrated to America in 2009, the year we married. Before she left Korea, she\u2019d built a reputation as an English tutor and was managing an English kindergarten. Cathreen had tutored several kids from the bottom of their classes to the top, and several kids from the top of their classes to citywide speaking awards and scholarships. One wealthy father wanted to build a private academy, which she would run and split the profits.I was a young American finishing his master\u2019s degree in fine arts, with no career prospects and a lot of debt, and who, even after his fianc\u00e9e offered to buy an apartment and support him, insisted he could live only in America. He insisted because he was adopted, because Korea had sold him and America had bought him, and the price was the rules of his body.The story of the Asian body in America is a story about rules, money, race, and imperialism.The first Asians on what is now U.S. land (other than those who crossed over the land bridge during the last ice age) lived in a sailors\u2019 colony in Louisiana in the 1700s. They were Filipinos who had a reputation as good sailors and were often used to crew the ships of imperial white nations (mainly Spain).In the 1800s, thousands of Chinese, mostly men, were shipped to America for labor. Some were replacements for slaves. Writes author and activist Helen Zia:In 1806\u2026using the same ships that brought slaves from Africa, the flesh merchants rerouted to Asia. They indentured \u201ccoolie\u201d labor from China and India to perform the same work, under the same conditions, as the slaves.Many Chinese came for the Gold Rush. White men would wait for the Chinese to find gold, and then shoot them and take their claims. Many Chinese worked on the railroads, where their bodies were used as examples to keep Irish and black bodies in line. When the railroads were finished, Chinese bodies lost their use and were kept outside the frame of history\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally, as the famous photo of the final \u201cgolden spike\u201d included none of the 11,000 Chinese who\u2019d worked on it.After the railroads, what the Chinese called the Driving-Out Time began. Immigration laws banned Chinese women. Chinese men were \u201coffered\u201d the \u201cchance\u201d to go home, not knowing they could not return. Chinese were lynched, shot, raped, beaten, stolen from, run off, all within or outside the rules of justice. The Chinese who continued to work in the United States mostly clustered in Chinatowns for survival and took jobs no white man wanted, like laundry. According to scholar Elaine Kim, the rate of men to women grew as lopsided as 27 to one. Chinese bodies were unruly if they had sex at all, and if they were too unruly, they were no longer human bodies, but targets.Meanwhile, in 1825, the first-recorded Chinese American was born in New York. In 1898, a Chinese American won a landmark Supreme Court case that granted citizenship by birth to all Americans. The Supreme Court ruled on who could be a citizen, how, and why; it also ruled on who got rights and what rights white people had over bodies of color.In 1889, the Chinese Exclusion Act (passed in 1882 and still the only U.S. law to specifically name the exclusion of a single ethnic group) was upheld by the Supreme Court, a ruling with obvious consequences today as the administration keeps adjusting the rules of West Asian bodies. With the Chinese banned, the Japanese and Koreans became the next wave of forced and/or underpaid laborers. Hawaii, especially, needed bodies. (That need created the body of Hawaii as it is today, as Dole overthrew the island\u2019s government and Asian laborers overwhelmed the population.)In 1907, Japan and the United States struck a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to end Korean immigration (Korea being under Japanese occupation), and Japanese and Indian immigration increased. Those immigrants fought for citizenship. In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that a Japanese American could not gain citizenship because he wasn\u2019t \u201cCaucasian.\u201d In 1923, an Indian American took his case to the Supreme Court, which ruled that although Indians were Caucasian, American citizens must also be \u201cwhite.\u201dThe rules of the American body changed to fit the rules of whiteness.In 1924, the United States threw out the gentleman\u2019s agreement and banned immigration from Japan and India. But bodies were still needed. Filipino immigration increased. In 1934, with the economy in shambles, Filipino bodies too were banned.These facts are easily verifiable, but I first found them in Helen Zia\u2019s Asian American Dreams, Elaine Kim\u2019s Asian American Literature, and Lisa Lowe\u2019s Immigrant Acts.American wars played a huge part in these rules, in particular with Filipino immigration, and later (and perhaps most well-known in America) with Vietnamese and other Southeast Asian refugees. American wars played a huge part in my immigration. The first major wave of international adoption was a direct consequence of the so-called Korean War\u200a\u2014\u200athe first children adopted were the half-white babies of American GIs, adopted by the Holt family, whose agency continues even now to deal in babies from around the world.It was the rules of the body, first of all, that got these half-white babies adopted. It was the rules of the body that got them given up. Though it wasn\u2019t built on the bodies of another race, Korea is perhaps as conversationally racist as America\u200a\u2014\u200aand a half-white baby in the 1950s meant incredible shame, whether or not it was the product of a war crime (rape). As the American demand for \u201cGI babies\u201d increased and the Korean supply decreased, the comparative acceptability of Asian bodies (to black bodies in particular) meant that full-Korean babies could fill the gap and increase profits.On the Korean side, these bodies meant money to help rebuild an economy destroyed by war. On the American side, these bodies meant a continued belief in the confusing will of God (infertility) and the valorization of white Christian guilt and its appetite for babies. Even racist Nobel Prize\u2013winning author Pearl S. Buck started her own Korean adoption agency, Welcome House, which in her mind would bring about the end of racism.I was among the largest wave of Korean adoption in the late 1970s and early 1980s. My adoptive parents are Catholic. (My father was on his way to becoming a priest when he married my mother.) They believed the best way to be good Christians was to erase my body from contention. According to my father, they still consider me not Asian at all, \u201conly their son.\u201d In order to follow the rules of family, my body had to be an exception to the rules.It was in search of my body and its rules that I found Cathreen in 2005, when I went to Korea believing that I had no history at all. She introduced me to myself. Four years later, she immigrated to America, married me, and got her green card, putting her trust in rules that historically distrusted us.Recently, in the middle of the night, I witnessed my wife hanging off her mother\u2019s arms, her body jerking up and down, her face squeezed and wet with pain. She was weeping and crying out in Korean that I could understand: \u201cI don\u2019t want to die! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d We were on our sleeping mats (our daughter slept beside her), and Cathreen had on her pajamas, a purple dress with tiny flowers all over it. Her head, shaved short and balding in spots as it grew back in, spiked into the air, then lay flat against the ground. Her arms and legs spasmed. Her mother and sister tried to keep her still, tried to keep the baby from going to her, their faces strained, telling Cathreen she wasn\u2019t going to die. My body had stopped moving. I had stopped knowing what I was doing. I tried to pat her back, and my hand seemed to move in another time zone. My wife had left for Korea 10 months earlier, and my in-laws had seen her like this many times, but for me, who had just arrived, it was a first.Earlier that week, I had gone with Cathreen to her cancer hospital in Seoul (her family is in Busan, on the southern coast, where, Americans always say, MacArthur made his last stand), and in the basement of the hospital, she collapsed to the floor, without any power in one leg. The doctors on break stood around us, watching coldly or maybe resignedly. Every day, my wife\u2019s body is betraying her. Or, more accurately, it is fighting itself\u200a\u2014\u200ait hurries toward death while it also attempts to fight death off.America has often diagnosed Asians with The Sickness. Yellow Fever. Yellow Peril. If the national body is well, The Sickness must come from without. White supremacy is a cancer we must not admit to. The history of immigration above leads directly to concentration camps in which Japanese American bodies were quarantined during the last world war. The only difference between them and the German and Italian Americans who walked free is that the Asian body was infected with foreignness.Today, the administration of the current president of the United States will be the one to decide whether or not Cathreen can ever reenter America. Her fate lies in the rules of a white man who has referred to those same concentration camps as the \u201cprecedent\u201d for a Muslim registry. And he is right\u200a\u2014\u200aprecedent is that my body and my wife\u2019s body are a matter of rules, not nature.The first time my wife gave birth, we had insurance through Harvard and we lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The total cost to us of her many visits to her OB, her hospitalization, and all the care during and after delivery by doctors, nurses, and lactation consultants was nothing. Because of the complications, we visited her doctor every two weeks. Cathreen went to the ER twice, and we paid a total of $80. She gave birth in a spacious and well-equipped room overlooking the Charles River, and the baby was immediately set on her chest before it went to a machine or a stranger.The second time my wife gave birth, we had insurance through the Affordable Care Act. We could have gotten insurance through the university where I was doing my PhD, but even though it would have cost me only about $100 per month, the cost to insure my family was more than $1,000 per month. On the ACA, we paid much less for insurance but were much more afraid to use it.The total cost of having our second baby was more than $7,000, much of it because the hospital didn\u2019t bill our insurance company quickly enough. We had far less control of the delivery process, and when our son was born, they whisked him away from us. When we contested the hospital bills, creditors came after us. In the end, I\u2019m not sure what happened to them\u200a\u2014\u200aafter my wife was diagnosed with cancer, she told them to fuck off. A week later, she flew to Korea.Treating Cathreen\u2019s cancer in Korea was a decision we were forced into. We were in the same city as the best cancer hospital in the world, but MD Anderson had cut off all forms of Obamacare three months earlier. Korean health care covers every citizen, and my wife never gave up her green card to apply to become American.I keep thinking about why we didn\u2019t catch the cancer earlier. Every day, every minute, I am sick with this thought. It is only right to take responsibility. I knew the rules.Each Sunday in Houston, my family attended a Korean church full of cancer doctors and cancer researchers who never thought Cathreen had cancer. The rule of pregnancy is pregnancy symptoms\u200a\u2014\u200aand the rules for Korean bodies in America are not the same as the rules for Korean bodies in Korea. When my wife complained she couldn\u2019t eat, our church friends complained about American food. When my wife complained she felt cold, they complained about American air conditioning. When my wife complained about infrequent doctor visits, they commiserated that in America mothers go months between checkups and are told that if the baby\u2019s growing, everything is fine.These things are true. When my wife told her OB she couldn\u2019t eat, her doctor prescribed heartburn medicine, nausea medicine, sleeping pills. At the ER (which cost us $500 per trip), they treated only her symptoms. Her OB said they couldn\u2019t check for anything else because Texas law prioritizes the fetus over the mother. No procedure could be done that stood the slightest chance of affecting the baby.Still, we could have gone to a GI doctor a month after our son was born, instead of three months. Because Cathreen\u2019s cancer is the most aggressive type, two months might have made a lot of difference.We didn\u2019t go because we thought it was normal to lose weight after giving birth. We didn\u2019t go because we were afraid. We didn\u2019t go because we had been taught by our insurance to go to the doctor only for checkups or emergencies. Of course, insurance companies claim to encourage preventative care and offer free wellness visits\u200a\u2014\u200aonce a year. But the effect of creditors and high copays and confusion over what is and is not covered is caution and fear. You doubt your authority over your body. You go to the doctor only when weighing costs and benefits shows that you are diagnosable, admittable, and cannot get better on your own.I often think back to my wife\u2019s offer to buy an apartment in Korea and give me time to write. It sounds better with each year that passes. It also would have saved her life. When she first came to America, my wife was used to seeing a doctor whenever she sensed anything slightly off with her body. I didn\u2019t understand this\u200a\u2014\u200aI avoid doctors until the moment I can\u2019t avoid them. She didn\u2019t yet fear the cost of being told she was healthy.In Korea, because a doctor\u2019s visit is about US$2, people get their bodies checked as soon as they feel sick. If my mother-in-law feels a cold coming, the first thing she does is get a shot to shorten the cold\u2019s duration. In the week I wrote this, I went to the pediatrician three times because the doctor prescribes only two days\u2019 dosage. With each visit, the pediatrician updated her understanding of my baby\u2019s body and, when necessary, adjusted the treatment.In Korea, they screen for stomach cancer.The most commonly diagnosed cancer in America (by far) is breast cancer. It is also the most cured. This is not a coincidence. After my wife\u2019s diagnosis, a cancer researcher friend hit himself in the face and wished Cathreen had breast cancer instead. Like all the other researchers we knew, he had come from Korea because America has the most money for cancer research\u200a\u2014\u200aand in America, breast cancer research is king. Talented young scientists come to Houston from all over the world to work at M.D. Anderson, and there they follow the funding toward a breast cancer cure.The most commonly diagnosed cancers in Korea are lung, liver, and stomach cancer. Of those, lung and liver cancer have obvious causes (Korea is a leading consumer of alcohol and cigarettes). When Cathreen was diagnosed, her doctor in America said most of the data on stomach cancer that gets to America comes from patients in Korea. Because stomach cancer is so common, Koreans get screened for it the way Americans get screened for breast cancer. Because my wife was in America, the rules of Korean bodies did not apply to preventative care.Maybe if we had lived in a different state, if we had a different insurance, if we had seen a different doctor\u2026how American that our circumstances determined what care our bodies deserved.After my wife screamed for life in her mother\u2019s arms, she lay weeping on the floor. That morning, we\u2019d fought seriously for the first time since I had arrived in Korea, on leave from my professorship. We had fought because when the body turns against itself, so does the part of the body that is the mind.We had fought because I wasn\u2019t on the right dosage of Zoloft because when I brought my prescription to a Korean doctor, she said Americans overmedicate and all Koreans are sad with bad cholesterol and high anxiety and trouble sleeping, so what was I complaining about?We had fought because that doctor was right (in a way): What am I complaining about, when my wife has cancer?We had fought because of cancer.We had fought because we both want my wife to live, but we don\u2019t know what it means \u201cto live\u201d if life is the body\u2019s way of dying.We had fought because I couldn\u2019t help her and felt powerless and so I wanted to make something about me.We had fought because the stress and pain and life were all too much for her.As my wife wept on the floor, her mother and her sister scolded me in Korean. I couldn\u2019t understand completely, but I got the gist. I understood the word stress and I understood the word fault. I understood the words don\u2019t and stop. I understood their expressions and the way they threw their faces at me. I understood my shame and the difference between my body and my wife\u2019s body.\u201cBecause of him\u200a\u2014\u200a,\u201d my wife interrupted. \u201cBut also Sister.\u201dMy shock became less desperate, but not lesser.We were living in this sister\u2019s apartment. The last time I had seen her was three years earlier, when we paid for her and her son to visit us in Houston, because we had missed her husband\u2019s funeral.Missing that funeral was against the rules of the body and of family. Worse, neither my wife\u2019s oldest sister nor mother made it to the funeral. Everyone had real reasons, but the result was a bad feeling that still lingered. The husband died of stomach cancer just when they thought his chemo had worked and he was in remission.What I remember most from my sister-in-law\u2019s visit was a trip to see Inside Out. In the opening short, a lone volcano sang out for love until another volcano answered and joined the first, eruption by eruption, to make a single island. In the theater, my wife and I held hands and smiled at each other, remembering our own island-making. Then I noticed, on the other side of my wife, that my sister-in-law was weeping quietly, her mouth shrunk up in pain, doing nothing to stop her tears\u200a\u2014\u200aand I remembered our differences and felt both grateful and ashamed.Now it was my wife who had stomach cancer and I who was depressed, and we had burdened my sister-in-law with two unruly children.\u201cBecause of me?\u201d asked my sister-in-law.I wanted time to stop, I wanted to go back, an hour, a day, a year, three years, ten.My wife attacked in Korean, and tears immediately sprang to her sister\u2019s face.The next morning, my sister-in-law said my whole family needed to get out of her house by the end of the day.Why does one body that doesn\u2019t follow the rules make other bodies so uncomfortable?When my sister-in-law kicked us out, she said that seeing my wife\u2019s sickness makes her sick. It makes her sick with the past. It makes her sick with her husband\u2019s death. When I see my wife collapse in pain, I see not her death\u200a\u2014\u200abecause how could I? I will not\u200a\u2014\u200abut my own. I see what of course I have known: that the rules of my body are, in fact, the same as the rules of hers, which is to say, we are dying.It is not that knowledge or even seeing it come true that makes me so upset. It is the admission (to myself? to her?) that I have no control, either over the rules of our bodies or over their exceptions.What does that mean, though, that we have no control over our bodies? It seems obviously untrue. Perhaps what I mean is that we persist in the illusion that our minds and our bodies are separate, until the moment we cannot persist in it. We persist in the illusion of dualism, and therefore in the illusion of free will and control.In 1980, a famous and controversial experiment by the neuroscientist Benjamin Libet revealed the time between a subject\u2019s conscious decision to move and the body\u2019s electrical signal for movement. His result was a full half-second (a long time in neurological terms) after the body\u2019s signal and before the conscious decision.Though the amount of time has been contested, many have interpreted Libet\u2019s and subsequent results to mean that consciousness is an effect, not a cause, and therefore is not separate from the body but a function of it.Libet, however, didn\u2019t interpret things this way. His further experiments showed that the subject could consciously cancel the movement before the electoral signal became action.The body can break the rules of the body, but it cannot make them. This is the admission that we sense we must make when we are in the presence of an unruly body. The imprisonment of our will despite our belief that we are free.As a boy, I used to stand at the mirror and see a reflection that didn\u2019t exist. A reflection whose existence was possible in the combination of my parents\u2019 existences. What I saw was whiteness. I have known this for a long time, but I\u2019ve only recently come to realize that I never saw my actual skin as white (of course I could not); rather, I saw whiteness for what it is: a concept, a rule. I was able to see it this way precisely because I wasn\u2019t able to see why I could not be white.It took me a long time to figure out how that reflection was connected to the white man on the street calling to me \u201cNi hao\u201d was connected to the bitter rage and shame I felt when a white film star killed an Asian bad guy and \u201cgot the girl\u201d was connected to the expectation that I should be good at math and how I hated myself that I was.It took me even longer to figure out how those things were connected to history and politics, and longer still to figure out how the history was both mine and not mine, both my parents\u2019 and not my parents\u2019. I\u2019ve figured out, but still cannot accept, how following the rules will never mean my body follows the rules.The rules of the body aren\u2019t actually followable. They aren\u2019t made to be followed. They\u2019re made to define.I was 19 when I realized my body had The Sickness. It was less than a week after 9/11. I had gone to the various memorial services at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I was barely into my first semester and had never lived so far from home. I was both exhilarated and terrified, because my small white town in Connecticut had not been kind, and I was both eager to start my life and afraid for it to be the same life as before.I was on a campus bus, invited to a party by a new, white friend, the kind of whip-smart in-state student who joins a frat and gets a business degree and becomes successful without ever leaving his comfort zone. He was Republican. (I was wrong about him\u200a\u2014\u200aeventually.) In the back of the bus, a group of black students talked and laughed. I sat at a distance from them, probably with some bias and because they were together and I was alone. I felt lonely and uncool, and I was jealous of their ease with each other. I felt how I felt in Connecticut, but this time with black kids, not white kids, which confused me. I had come to Carolina with the idea that maybe I belonged with black people, since I had not belonged with whites.We had gone maybe one stop, not even one, when they mentioned the attacks. Someone said \u201cterrorist,\u201d said \u201cMuslim,\u201d said \u201ctowelhead,\u201d said \u201cgo back to your country.\u201d My face burned. I didn\u2019t seem to realize they were talking about me until they were talking to me. I couldn\u2019t see how I could possibly fit that profile, especially to other people of color.I got off the bus as soon as I could, carrying my infection with me.I am in Korea now. I am here to be with my sick wife, who, to save her life, gets weekly injections of chemicals that kill the parts of her body that follow the rules in an attack on the parts that don\u2019t. Each week, she dies a little more in order to live a little longer.For my wife to return home\u200a\u2014\u200aif she gets the miraculous results we pray for\u200a\u2014\u200ashe will face more rules of the body. American rules that first stole the bodies of people from her country, our country, then banned them from entering, then led them to fight and kill each other, then bought them to end racism. She must become an exception.Right now, the United States is deporting Korean (and other international) adoptees, despite that their bodies are the only things they know about their destinations. That my wife held onto Korean citizenship is the reason her government now covers 90 to 95 percent of most of her medical care (she would have died if she had become an American citizen), and yet her stay in Korea breaks the rules of her visa.We have heard stories from other immigrant friends and friends of friends and immigration lawyers; we have seen the news you have seen. These have always been the rules of the Asian body in America: Yellow Fever. Yellow Peril. These have always been the terms: white supremacist capitalism. What do we have to complain about, then, if in the end all bodies follow the same one rule: They die. What we have to complain about is not how we die, but how we live.Illustration: Audrey Lee.

class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What are the rules we expect the body to follow?</strong></p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"68fc\" name=\"68fc\">When my wife, Cathreen, had our second child, on Thanksgiving Day 2016, we expected her body to return to its pre-pregnant state. For nearly the entire nine months, Cathreen had horrible morning sickness and could barely eat. She threw up constantly. She was dizzy and spent most of the day in bed. Everyone waited for the baby, and not only for the baby, but also for the end of The Sickness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"68a1\" name=\"68a1\">The last pregnancy had also been difficult. Cathreen had pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), which is basically an incredibly itchy hive-like rash. She couldn\u2019t sleep for the itch. She had to take oatmeal baths and slather herself in aloe. Eventually the doctor made her go on steroids.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4fd6\" name=\"4fd6\">According to her OB doctor, about one in 100 pregnant women get PUPPP (the internet says one in 160), but they often hardly notice, as PUPPP usually comes late in the third term before the baby is born, and birth makes the symptoms disappear. For PUPPP to appear in the third month (my wife\u2019s case), the odds were one in 100 cases of one in 100-something pregnancies\u200a\u2014\u200ararer than one in 10,000.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80ec\" name=\"80ec\">In addition to PUPPP, Cathreen had morning sickness for four and a half months, a month and a half longer than is typical. We would try to go out, and she would make it to the end of the driveway before she threw up and had to turn back.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"de09\" name=\"de09\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 165px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 23.599999999999998%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png\" data-height=\"378\" data-image-id=\"1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png\" data-width=\"1600\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"cc9f\" name=\"cc9f\">About halfway through the pregnancy, Cathreen noticed that her body also itched in the cold. In the supermarket, if she reached for milk, her hand would break out in a rash. I had trouble believing an allergy to the cold was possible until the doctor confirmed it, to my shame.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"556a\" name=\"556a\">Once Cathreen gave birth, she was so happy for her body\u2019s old freedom that we immediately went for a walk, though this is not advised. She blames that walk for the pain that came afterward\u200a\u2014\u200afor a year, she had postpartum fibromyalgia. Korean tradition calls for the mother to stay warm and inside for the first three months after delivery, lest the wind gets into her bones, but we had treated this as a superstition. My wife had broken the rules.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"892d\" name=\"892d\">This is the rule we expected of her body: that the effects of pregnancy would disappear once she gave birth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b271\" name=\"b271\">The one extra complication in her second pregnancy\u200a\u2014\u200athe one that didn\u2019t even follow pregnancy rules\u200a\u2014\u200awas that she felt cold all the time, not hot. Later, we knew that her coldness should have alarmed us. In March, four months after our son was born, my wife couldn\u2019t stop losing weight, was still vomiting, and could no longer even drink.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"03ef\" name=\"03ef\">It turned out she had stage 4 stomach cancer.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"0a54\" name=\"0a54\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 92.5px; max-height: 86px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 93%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png\" data-height=\"172\" data-image-id=\"1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png\" data-width=\"185\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"9580\" name=\"9580\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Cathreen immigrated to America in 2009, </strong>the year we married. Before she left Korea, she\u2019d built a reputation as an English tutor and was managing an English kindergarten. Cathreen had tutored several kids from the bottom of their classes to the top, and several kids from the top of their classes to citywide speaking awards and scholarships. One wealthy father wanted to build a private academy, which she would run and split the profits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a473\" name=\"a473\">I was a young American finishing his master\u2019s degree in fine arts, with no career prospects and a lot of debt, and who, even after his fianc\u00e9e offered to buy an apartment and support him, insisted he could live only in America. He insisted because he was adopted, because Korea had sold him and America had bought him, and the price was the rules of his body.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ef0\" name=\"3ef0\">The story of the Asian body in America is a story about rules, money, race, and imperialism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"677c\" name=\"677c\">The first Asians on what is now U.S. land (other than those who crossed over the land bridge during the last ice age) lived in a sailors\u2019 colony in Louisiana in the 1700s. They were Filipinos who had a reputation as good sailors and were often used to crew the ships of imperial white nations (mainly Spain).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"49f7\" name=\"49f7\">In the 1800s, thousands of Chinese, mostly men, were shipped to America for labor. Some were replacements for slaves. Writes author and activist Helen Zia:</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\" id=\"47e6\" name=\"47e6\">In 1806\u2026using the same ships that brought slaves from Africa, the flesh merchants rerouted to Asia. They indentured \u201ccoolie\u201d labor from China and India to perform the same work, under the same conditions, as the slaves.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\" id=\"f2b0\" name=\"f2b0\">Many Chinese came for the Gold Rush. White men would wait for the Chinese to find gold, and then shoot them and take their claims. Many Chinese worked on the railroads, where their bodies were used as examples to keep Irish and black bodies in line. When the railroads were finished, Chinese bodies lost their use and were kept outside the frame of history\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally, as the famous photo of the final \u201cgolden spike\u201d included none of the 11,000 Chinese who\u2019d worked on it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39fe\" name=\"39fe\">After the railroads, what the Chinese called the Driving-Out Time began. Immigration laws banned Chinese women. Chinese men were \u201coffered\u201d the \u201cchance\u201d to go home, not knowing they could not return. Chinese were lynched, shot, raped, beaten, stolen from, run off, all within or outside the rules of justice. The Chinese who continued to work in the United States mostly clustered in Chinatowns for survival and took jobs no white man wanted, like laundry. According to scholar Elaine Kim, the rate of men to women grew as lopsided as 27 to one. Chinese bodies were unruly if they had sex at all, and if they were too unruly, they were no longer human bodies, but targets.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc5a\" name=\"fc5a\">Meanwhile, in 1825, the first-recorded Chinese American was born in New York. In 1898, a Chinese American won a landmark Supreme Court case that granted citizenship by birth to all Americans. The Supreme Court ruled on who could be a citizen, how, and why; it also ruled on who got rights and what rights white people had over bodies of color.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ffe1\" name=\"ffe1\">In 1889, the Chinese Exclusion Act (passed in 1882 and still the only U.S. law to specifically name the exclusion of a single ethnic group) was upheld by the Supreme Court, a ruling with obvious consequences today as the administration keeps adjusting the rules of West Asian bodies. With the Chinese banned, the Japanese and Koreans became the next wave of forced and/or underpaid laborers. Hawaii, especially, needed bodies. (That need created the body of Hawaii as it is today, as Dole overthrew the island\u2019s government and Asian laborers overwhelmed the population.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6956\" name=\"6956\">In 1907, Japan and the United States struck a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to end Korean immigration (Korea being under Japanese occupation), and Japanese and Indian immigration increased. Those immigrants fought for citizenship. In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that a Japanese American could not gain citizenship because he wasn\u2019t \u201cCaucasian.\u201d In 1923, an Indian American took his case to the Supreme Court, which ruled that although Indians <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">were</em> Caucasian, American citizens must also be \u201cwhite.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8551\" name=\"8551\">The rules of the American body changed to fit the rules of whiteness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8dd9\" name=\"8dd9\">In 1924, the United States threw out the gentleman\u2019s agreement and banned immigration from Japan and India. But bodies were still needed. Filipino immigration increased. In 1934, with the economy in shambles, Filipino bodies too were banned.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"42bb\" name=\"42bb\">These facts are easily verifiable, but I first found them in Helen Zia\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Asian American Dreams</em>, Elaine Kim\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Asian American Literature</em>, and Lisa Lowe\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Immigrant Acts</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dbff\" name=\"dbff\">American wars played a huge part in these rules, in particular with Filipino immigration, and later (and perhaps most well-known in America) with Vietnamese and other Southeast Asian refugees. American wars played a huge part in my immigration. The first major wave of international adoption was a direct consequence of the so-called Korean War\u200a\u2014\u200athe first children adopted were the half-white babies of American GIs, adopted by the Holt family, whose agency continues even now to deal in babies from around the world.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fdab\" name=\"fdab\">It was the rules of the body, first of all, that got these half-white babies adopted. It was the rules of the body that got them given up. Though it wasn\u2019t built on the bodies of another race, Korea is perhaps as conversationally racist as America\u200a\u2014\u200aand a half-white baby in the 1950s meant incredible shame, whether or not it was the product of a war crime (rape). As the American demand for \u201cGI babies\u201d increased and the Korean supply decreased, the comparative acceptability of Asian bodies (to black bodies in particular) meant that full-Korean babies could fill the gap and increase profits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e37\" name=\"7e37\">On the Korean side, these bodies meant money to help rebuild an economy destroyed by war. On the American side, these bodies meant a continued belief in the confusing will of God (infertility) and the valorization of white Christian guilt and its appetite for babies. Even racist Nobel Prize\u2013winning author Pearl S. Buck started her own Korean adoption agency, Welcome House, which in her mind would bring about the end of racism.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"1527\" name=\"1527\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 306px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 43.7%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png\" data-height=\"699\" data-image-id=\"1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png\" data-width=\"1600\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"e42d\" name=\"e42d\">I was among the largest wave of Korean adoption in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

She was weeping and crying out in Korean that I could understand: \u201cI don\u2019t want to die! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d We were on our sleeping mats (our daughter slept beside her), and Cathreen had on her pajamas, a purple dress with tiny flowers all over it. Her head, shaved short and balding in spots as it grew back in, spiked into the air, then lay flat against the ground. Her arms and legs spasmed. Her mother and sister tried to keep her still, tried to keep the baby from going to her, their faces strained, telling Cathreen she wasn\u2019t going to die. My body had stopped moving. I had stopped knowing what I was doing. I tried to pat her back, and my hand seemed to move in another time zone. My wife had left for Korea 10 months earlier, and my in-laws had seen her like this many times, but for me, who had just arrived, it was a first.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1bd0\" name=\"1bd0\">Earlier that week, I had gone with Cathreen to her cancer hospital in Seoul (her family is in Busan, on the southern coast, where, Americans always say, MacArthur made his last stand), and in the basement of the hospital, she collapsed to the floor, without any power in one leg. The doctors on break stood around us, watching coldly or maybe resignedly. Every day, my wife\u2019s body is betraying her. Or, more accurately, it is fighting itself\u200a\u2014\u200ait hurries toward death while it also attempts to fight death off.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b19\" name=\"7b19\">America has often diagnosed Asians with The Sickness. Yellow Fever. Yellow Peril. If the national body is well, The Sickness must come from without. White supremacy is a cancer we must not admit to. The history of immigration above leads directly to concentration camps in which Japanese American bodies were quarantined during the last world war. The only difference between them and the German and Italian Americans who walked free is that the Asian body was infected with foreignness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"543b\" name=\"543b\">Today, the administration of the current president of the United States will be the one to decide whether or not Cathreen can ever reenter America. Her fate lies in the rules of a white man who has referred to those same concentration camps as the \u201cprecedent\u201d for a Muslim registry. And he is right\u200a\u2014\u200aprecedent is that my body and my wife\u2019s body are a matter of rules, not nature.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"8382\" name=\"8382\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 92.5px; max-height: 86px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 93%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*kDSySchbzEpm1GAaJ3BHog@2x.png\" data-height=\"172\" data-image-id=\"1*kDSySchbzEpm1GAaJ3BHog@2x.png\" data-width=\"185\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*kDSySchbzEpm1GAaJ3BHog@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kDSySchbzEpm1GAaJ3BHog@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kDSySchbzEpm1GAaJ3BHog@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"c0c5\" name=\"c0c5\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">The first time my wife gave birth,</strong> we had insurance through Harvard and we lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The total cost to us of her many visits to her OB, her hospitalization, and all the care during and after delivery by doctors, nurses, and lactation consultants was nothing. Because of the complications, we visited her doctor every two weeks. Cathreen went to the ER twice, and we paid a total of $80. She gave birth in a spacious and well-equipped room overlooking the Charles River, and the baby was immediately set on her chest before it went to a machine or a stranger.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c0f4\" name=\"c0f4\">The second time my wife gave birth, we had insurance through the Affordable Care Act. We could have gotten insurance through the university where I was doing my PhD, but even though it would have cost me only about $100 per month, the cost to insure my family was more than $1,000 per month. On the ACA, we paid much less for insurance but were much more afraid to use it.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"7403\" name=\"7403\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*d1rtGu00iNVUKHFFLQgd-w.jpeg\" data-height=\"1200\" data-image-id=\"1*d1rtGu00iNVUKHFFLQgd-w.jpeg\" data-width=\"1200\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*d1rtGu00iNVUKHFFLQgd-w.jpeg?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*d1rtGu00iNVUKHFFLQgd-w.jpeg\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*d1rtGu00iNVUKHFFLQgd-w.jpeg\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"494f\" name=\"494f\">The total cost of having our second baby was more than $7,000, much of it because the hospital didn\u2019t bill our insurance company quickly enough. We had far less control of the delivery process, and when our son was born, they whisked him away from us. When we contested the hospital bills, creditors came after us. In the end, I\u2019m not sure what happened to them\u200a\u2014\u200aafter my wife was diagnosed with cancer, she told them to fuck off. A week later, she flew to Korea.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"583b\" name=\"583b\">Treating Cathreen\u2019s cancer in Korea was a decision we were forced into. We were in the same city as the best cancer hospital in the world, but MD Anderson had cut off all forms of Obamacare three months earlier. Korean health care covers every citizen, and my wife never gave up her green card to apply to become American.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"01ac\" name=\"01ac\">I keep thinking about why we didn\u2019t catch the cancer earlier. Every day, every minute, I am sick with this thought. It is only right to take responsibility. I knew the rules.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0239\" name=\"0239\">Each Sunday in Houston, my family attended a Korean church full of cancer doctors and cancer researchers who never thought Cathreen had cancer. The rule of pregnancy is pregnancy symptoms\u200a\u2014\u200aand the rules for Korean bodies in America are not the same as the rules for Korean bodies in Korea. When my wife complained she couldn\u2019t eat, our church friends complained about American food. When my wife complained she felt cold, they complained about American air conditioning. When my wife complained about infrequent doctor visits, they commiserated that in America mothers go months between checkups and are told that if the baby\u2019s growing, everything is fine.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"42cf\" name=\"42cf\">These things are true. When my wife told her OB she couldn\u2019t eat, her doctor prescribed heartburn medicine, nausea medicine, sleeping pills. At the ER (which cost us $500 per trip), they treated only her symptoms. Her OB said they couldn\u2019t check for anything else because Texas law prioritizes the fetus over the mother. No procedure could be done that stood the slightest chance of affecting the baby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dc9\" name=\"3dc9\">Still, we could have gone to a GI doctor a month after our son was born, instead of three months. Because Cathreen\u2019s cancer is the most aggressive type, two months might have made a lot of difference.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"db60\" name=\"db60\">We didn\u2019t go because we thought it was normal to lose weight after giving birth. We didn\u2019t go because we were afraid. We didn\u2019t go because we had been taught by our insurance to go to the doctor only for checkups or emergencies. Of course, insurance companies claim to encourage preventative care and offer free wellness visits\u200a\u2014\u200aonce a year. But the effect of creditors and high copays and confusion over what is and is not covered is caution and fear. You doubt your authority over your body. You go to the doctor only when weighing costs and benefits shows that you are diagnosable, admittable, and cannot get better on your own.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ecd\" name=\"3ecd\">I often think back to my wife\u2019s offer to buy an apartment in Korea and give me time to write. It sounds better with each year that passes. It also would have saved her life. When she first came to America, my wife was used to seeing a doctor whenever she sensed anything slightly off with her body. I didn\u2019t understand this\u200a\u2014\u200aI avoid doctors until the moment I can\u2019t avoid them. She didn\u2019t yet fear the cost of being told she was healthy.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"452c\" name=\"452c\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 299px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 42.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png\" data-height=\"684\" data-image-id=\"1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png\" data-width=\"1600\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"69d3\" name=\"69d3\">In Korea, because a doctor\u2019s visit is about US$2, people get their bodies checked as soon as they feel sick. If my mother-in-law feels a cold coming, the first thing she does is get a shot to shorten the cold\u2019s duration. In the week I wrote this, I went to the pediatrician three times because the doctor prescribes only two days\u2019 dosage. With each visit, the pediatrician updated her understanding of my baby\u2019s body and, when necessary, adjusted the treatment.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5c8a\" name=\"5c8a\">In Korea, they screen for stomach cancer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0e29\" name=\"0e29\">The most commonly diagnosed cancer in America (by far) is breast cancer. It is also the most cured. This is not a coincidence. After my wife\u2019s diagnosis, a cancer researcher friend hit himself in the face and wished Cathreen had breast cancer instead. Like all the other researchers we knew, he had come from Korea because America has the most money for cancer research\u200a\u2014\u200aand in America, breast cancer research is king. Talented young scientists come to Houston from all over the world to work at M.D. Anderson, and there they follow the funding toward a breast cancer cure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9cff\" name=\"9cff\">The most commonly diagnosed cancers in Korea are lung, liver, and stomach cancer. Of those, lung and liver cancer have obvious causes (Korea is a leading consumer of alcohol and cigarettes). When Cathreen was diagnosed, her doctor in America said most of the data on stomach cancer that gets to America comes from patients in Korea. Because stomach cancer is so common, Koreans get screened for it the way Americans get screened for breast cancer. Because my wife was in America, the rules of Korean bodies did not apply to preventative care.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8804\" name=\"8804\">Maybe if we had lived in a different state, if we had a different insurance, if we had seen a different doctor\u2026how American that our circumstances determined what care our bodies deserved.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"036a\" name=\"036a\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 92.5px; max-height: 86px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 93%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png\" data-height=\"172\" data-image-id=\"1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png\" data-width=\"185\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"0251\" name=\"0251\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">After my wife screamed for life in her mother\u2019s arms,</strong> she lay weeping on the floor.

A reflection whose existence was possible in the combination of my parents\u2019 existences. What I saw was whiteness. I have known this for a long time, but I\u2019ve only recently come to realize that I never saw my actual skin as white (of course I could not); rather, I saw whiteness for what it is: a concept, a rule. I was able to see it this way precisely because<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> </em>I wasn\u2019t able to see why I could not be white.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b83b\" name=\"b83b\">It took me a long time to figure out how that reflection was connected to the white man on the street calling to me \u201cNi hao\u201d was connected to the bitter rage and shame I felt when a white film star killed an Asian bad guy and \u201cgot the girl\u201d was connected to the expectation that I should be good at math and how I hated myself that I was.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9378\" name=\"9378\">It took me even longer to figure out how those things were connected to history and politics, and longer still to figure out how the history was both mine and not mine, both my parents\u2019 and not my parents\u2019. I\u2019ve figured out, but still cannot accept, how following the rules will never mean my body follows the rules.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b70b\" name=\"b70b\">The rules of the body aren\u2019t actually followable.

It was less than a week after 9/11. I had gone to the various memorial services at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I was barely into my first semester and had never lived so far from home. I was both exhilarated and terrified, because my small white town in Connecticut had not been kind, and I was both eager to start my life and afraid for it to be the same life as before.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"817e\" name=\"817e\">I was on a campus bus, invited to a party by a new, white friend, the kind of whip-smart in-state student who joins a frat and gets a business degree and becomes successful without ever leaving his comfort zone. He was Republican. (I was wrong about him\u200a\u2014\u200aeventually.) In the back of the bus, a group of black students talked and laughed. I sat at a distance from them, probably with some bias and because they were together and I was alone. I felt lonely and uncool, and I was jealous of their ease with each other. I felt how I felt in Connecticut, but this time with black kids, not white kids, which confused me. I had come to Carolina with the idea that maybe I belonged with black people, since I had not belonged with whites.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"963b\" name=\"963b\">We had gone maybe one stop, not even one, when they mentioned the attacks. Someone said \u201cterrorist,\u201d said \u201cMuslim,\u201d said \u201ctowelhead,\u201d said \u201cgo back to your country.\u201d My face burned. I didn\u2019t seem to realize they were talking <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">about </em>me until they were talking <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">to</em> me.

Cathreen had pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), which is basically an incredibly itchy hive-like rash. She couldn\u2019t sleep for the itch.

Some were replacements for slaves.

White men would wait for the Chinese to find gold, and then shoot them and take their claims. Many Chinese worked on the railroads, where their bodies were used as examples to keep Irish and black bodies in line. When the railroads were finished, Chinese bodies lost their use and were kept outside the frame of history\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally, as the famous photo of the final \u201cgolden spike\u201d included none of the 11,000 Chinese who\u2019d worked on it.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"39fe\\\" id=\\\"39fe\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAfter the railroads, what the Chinese called the Driving-Out Time began. Immigration laws banned Chinese women. Chinese men were \u201coffered\u201d the \u201cchance\u201d to go home, not knowing they could not return. Chinese were lynched, shot, raped, beaten, stolen from, run off, all within or outside the rules of justice. The Chinese who continued to work in the United States mostly clustered in Chinatowns for survival and took jobs no white man wanted, like laundry. According to scholar Elaine Kim, the rate of men to women grew as lopsided as 27 to one. Chinese bodies were unruly if they had sex at all, and if they were too unruly, they were no longer human bodies, but targets.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fc5a\\\" id=\\\"fc5a\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eMeanwhile, in 1825, the first-recorded Chinese American was born in New York. In 1898, a Chinese American won a landmark Supreme Court case that granted citizenship by birth to all Americans. The Supreme Court ruled on who could be a citizen, how, and why; it also ruled on who got rights and what rights white people had over bodies of color.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"ffe1\\\" id=\\\"ffe1\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn 1889, the Chinese Exclusion Act (passed in 1882 and still the only U.S. law to specifically name the exclusion of a single ethnic group) was upheld by the Supreme Court, a ruling with obvious consequences today as the administration keeps adjusting the rules of West Asian bodies. With the Chinese banned, the Japanese and Koreans became the next wave of forced and/or underpaid laborers. Hawaii, especially, needed bodies. (That need created the body of Hawaii as it is today, as Dole overthrew the island\u2019s government and Asian laborers overwhelmed the population.)\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"6956\\\" id=\\\"6956\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn 1907, Japan and the United States struck a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to end Korean immigration (Korea being under Japanese occupation), and Japanese and Indian immigration increased. Those immigrants fought for citizenship. In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that a Japanese American could not gain citizenship because he wasn\u2019t \u201cCaucasian.\u201d In 1923, an Indian American took his case to the Supreme Court, which ruled that although Indians \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3ewere\\x3c/em\\x3e Caucasian, American citizens must also be \u201cwhite.\u201d\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8551\\\" id=\\\"8551\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThe rules of the American body changed to fit the rules of whiteness.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"8dd9\\\" id=\\\"8dd9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIn 1924, the United States threw out the gentleman\u2019s agreement and banned immigration from Japan and India. But bodies were still needed. Filipino immigration increased. In 1934, with the economy in shambles, Filipino bodies too were banned.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"42bb\\\" id=\\\"42bb\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThese facts are easily verifiable, but I first found them in Helen Zia\u2019s \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eAsian American Dreams\\x3c/em\\x3e, Elaine Kim\u2019s \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eAsian American Literature\\x3c/em\\x3e, and Lisa Lowe\u2019s \\x3cem class=\\\"markup--em markup--p-em\\\"\\x3eImmigrant Acts\\x3c/em\\x3e.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"dbff\\\" id=\\\"dbff\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAmerican wars played a huge part in these rules, in particular with Filipino immigration, and later (and perhaps most well-known in America) with Vietnamese and other Southeast Asian refugees. American wars played a huge part in my immigration. The first major wave of international adoption was a direct consequence of the so-called Korean War\u200a\u2014\u200athe first children adopted were the half-white babies of American GIs, adopted by the Holt family, whose agency continues even now to deal in babies from around the world.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"fdab\\\" id=\\\"fdab\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eIt was the rules of the body, first of all, that got these half-white babies adopted. It was the rules of the body that got them given up. Though it wasn\u2019t built on the bodies of another race, Korea is perhaps as conversationally racist as America\u200a\u2014\u200aand a half-white baby in the 1950s meant incredible shame, whether or not it was the product of a war crime (rape). As the American demand for \u201cGI babies\u201d increased and the Korean supply decreased, the comparative acceptability of Asian bodies (to black bodies in particular) meant that full-Korean babies could fill the gap and increase profits.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7e37\\\" id=\\\"7e37\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eOn the Korean side, these bodies meant money to help rebuild an economy destroyed by war. On the American side, these bodies meant a continued belief in the confusing will of God (infertility) and the valorization of white Christian guilt and its appetite for babies.

I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d We were on our sleeping mats (our daughter slept beside her), and Cathreen had on her pajamas, a purple dress with tiny flowers all over it. Her head, shaved short and balding in spots as it grew back in, spiked into the air, then lay flat against the ground. Her arms and legs spasmed. Her mother and sister tried to keep her still, tried to keep the baby from going to her, their faces strained, telling Cathreen she wasn\u2019t going to die. My body had stopped moving. I had stopped knowing what I was doing. I tried to pat her back, and my hand seemed to move in another time zone. My wife had left for Korea 10 months earlier, and my in-laws had seen her like this many times, but for me, who had just arrived, it was a first.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"1bd0\\\" id=\\\"1bd0\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eEarlier that week, I had gone with Cathreen to her cancer hospital in Seoul (her family is in Busan, on the southern coast, where, Americans always say, MacArthur made his last stand), and in the basement of the hospital, she collapsed to the floor, without any power in one leg. The doctors on break stood around us, watching coldly or maybe resignedly. Every day, my wife\u2019s body is betraying her. Or, more accurately, it is fighting itself\u200a\u2014\u200ait hurries toward death while it also attempts to fight death off.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"7b19\\\" id=\\\"7b19\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eAmerica has often diagnosed Asians with The Sickness.

In the end, I\u2019m not sure what happened to them\u200a\u2014\u200aafter my wife was diagnosed with cancer, she told them to fuck off.

The rule of pregnancy is pregnancy symptoms\u200a\u2014\u200aand the rules for Korean bodies in America are not the same as the rules for Korean bodies in Korea. When my wife complained she couldn\u2019t eat, our church friends complained about American food. When my wife complained she felt cold, they complained about American air conditioning. When my wife complained about infrequent doctor visits, they commiserated that in America mothers go months between checkups and are told that if the baby\u2019s growing, everything is fine.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"42cf\\\" id=\\\"42cf\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eThese things are true. When my wife told her OB she couldn\u2019t eat, her doctor prescribed heartburn medicine, nausea medicine, sleeping pills. At the ER (which cost us $500 per trip), they treated only her symptoms. Her OB said they couldn\u2019t check for anything else because Texas law prioritizes the fetus over the mother. No procedure could be done that stood the slightest chance of affecting the baby.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3dc9\\\" id=\\\"3dc9\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eStill, we could have gone to a GI doctor a month after our son was born, instead of three months.

We didn\u2019t go because we were afraid. We didn\u2019t go because we had been taught by our insurance to go to the doctor only for checkups or emergencies. Of course, insurance companies claim to encourage preventative care and offer free wellness visits\u200a\u2014\u200aonce a year. But the effect of creditors and high copays and confusion over what is and is not covered is caution and fear. You doubt your authority over your body. You go to the doctor only when weighing costs and benefits shows that you are diagnosable, admittable, and cannot get better on your own.\\x3c/p\\x3e\\x3cp name=\\\"3ecd\\\" id=\\\"3ecd\\\" class=\\\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\\\"\\x3eI often think back to my wife\u2019s offer to buy an apartment in Korea and give me time to write.

It is also the most cured. This is not a coincidence. After my wife\u2019s diagnosis, a cancer researcher friend hit himself in the face and wished Cathreen had breast cancer instead. Like all the other researchers we knew, he had come from Korea because America has the most money for cancer research\u200a\u2014\u200aand in America, breast cancer research is king.

Because stomach cancer is so common, Koreans get screened for it the way Americans get screened for breast cancer.

For nearly the entire nine months, Cathreen had horrible morning sickness and could barely eat. She threw up constantly. She was dizzy and spent most of the day in bed. Everyone waited for the baby, and not only for the baby, but also for the end of The Sickness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"68a1\" name=\"68a1\">The last pregnancy had also been difficult. Cathreen had pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), which is basically an incredibly itchy hive-like rash. She couldn\u2019t sleep for the itch. She had to take oatmeal baths and slather herself in aloe. Eventually the doctor made her go on steroids.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"4fd6\" name=\"4fd6\">According to her OB doctor, about one in 100 pregnant women get PUPPP (the internet says one in 160), but they often hardly notice, as PUPPP usually comes late in the third term before the baby is born, and birth makes the symptoms disappear. For PUPPP to appear in the third month (my wife\u2019s case), the odds were one in 100 cases of one in 100-something pregnancies\u200a\u2014\u200ararer than one in 10,000.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"80ec\" name=\"80ec\">In addition to PUPPP, Cathreen had morning sickness for four and a half months, a month and a half longer than is typical. We would try to go out, and she would make it to the end of the driveway before she threw up and had to turn back.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"de09\" name=\"de09\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 165px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 23.599999999999998%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png\" data-height=\"378\" data-image-id=\"1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png\" data-width=\"1600\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3mJJgQl-XfR3IRd-jtLJOw@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"cc9f\" name=\"cc9f\">About halfway through the pregnancy, Cathreen noticed that her body also itched in the cold. In the supermarket, if she reached for milk, her hand would break out in a rash. I had trouble believing an allergy to the cold was possible until the doctor confirmed it, to my shame.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"556a\" name=\"556a\">Once Cathreen gave birth, she was so happy for her body\u2019s old freedom that we immediately went for a walk, though this is not advised. She blames that walk for the pain that came afterward\u200a\u2014\u200afor a year, she had postpartum fibromyalgia. Korean tradition calls for the mother to stay warm and inside for the first three months after delivery, lest the wind gets into her bones, but we had treated this as a superstition. My wife had broken the rules.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"892d\" name=\"892d\">This is the rule we expected of her body: that the effects of pregnancy would disappear once she gave birth.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"b271\" name=\"b271\">The one extra complication in her second pregnancy\u200a\u2014\u200athe one that didn\u2019t even follow pregnancy rules\u200a\u2014\u200awas that she felt cold all the time, not hot. Later, we knew that her coldness should have alarmed us. In March, four months after our son was born, my wife couldn\u2019t stop losing weight, was still vomiting, and could no longer even drink.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"03ef\" name=\"03ef\">It turned out she had stage 4 stomach cancer.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"0a54\" name=\"0a54\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 92.5px; max-height: 86px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 93%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png\" data-height=\"172\" data-image-id=\"1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png\" data-width=\"185\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*i8uWmmPP7JdPhgdqZaWODA@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"9580\" name=\"9580\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Cathreen immigrated to America in 2009, </strong>the year we married. Before she left Korea, she\u2019d built a reputation as an English tutor and was managing an English kindergarten. Cathreen had tutored several kids from the bottom of their classes to the top, and several kids from the top of their classes to citywide speaking awards and scholarships. One wealthy father wanted to build a private academy, which she would run and split the profits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"a473\" name=\"a473\">I was a young American finishing his master\u2019s degree in fine arts, with no career prospects and a lot of debt, and who, even after his fianc\u00e9e offered to buy an apartment and support him, insisted he could live only in America. He insisted because he was adopted, because Korea had sold him and America had bought him, and the price was the rules of his body.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ef0\" name=\"3ef0\">The story of the Asian body in America is a story about rules, money, race, and imperialism.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"677c\" name=\"677c\">The first Asians on what is now U.S. land (other than those who crossed over the land bridge during the last ice age) lived in a sailors\u2019 colony in Louisiana in the 1700s. They were Filipinos who had a reputation as good sailors and were often used to crew the ships of imperial white nations (mainly Spain).</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"49f7\" name=\"49f7\">In the 1800s, thousands of Chinese, mostly men, were shipped to America for labor. Some were replacements for slaves. Writes author and activist Helen Zia:</p><blockquote class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\" id=\"47e6\" name=\"47e6\">In 1806\u2026using the same ships that brought slaves from Africa, the flesh merchants rerouted to Asia. They indentured \u201ccoolie\u201d labor from China and India to perform the same work, under the same conditions, as the slaves.</blockquote><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\" id=\"f2b0\" name=\"f2b0\">Many Chinese came for the Gold Rush. White men would wait for the Chinese to find gold, and then shoot them and take their claims. Many Chinese worked on the railroads, where their bodies were used as examples to keep Irish and black bodies in line. When the railroads were finished, Chinese bodies lost their use and were kept outside the frame of history\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally, as the famous photo of the final \u201cgolden spike\u201d included none of the 11,000 Chinese who\u2019d worked on it.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"39fe\" name=\"39fe\">After the railroads, what the Chinese called the Driving-Out Time began. Immigration laws banned Chinese women. Chinese men were \u201coffered\u201d the \u201cchance\u201d to go home, not knowing they could not return. Chinese were lynched, shot, raped, beaten, stolen from, run off, all within or outside the rules of justice. The Chinese who continued to work in the United States mostly clustered in Chinatowns for survival and took jobs no white man wanted, like laundry. According to scholar Elaine Kim, the rate of men to women grew as lopsided as 27 to one. Chinese bodies were unruly if they had sex at all, and if they were too unruly, they were no longer human bodies, but targets.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fc5a\" name=\"fc5a\">Meanwhile, in 1825, the first-recorded Chinese American was born in New York. In 1898, a Chinese American won a landmark Supreme Court case that granted citizenship by birth to all Americans. The Supreme Court ruled on who could be a citizen, how, and why; it also ruled on who got rights and what rights white people had over bodies of color.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"ffe1\" name=\"ffe1\">In 1889, the Chinese Exclusion Act (passed in 1882 and still the only U.S. law to specifically name the exclusion of a single ethnic group) was upheld by the Supreme Court, a ruling with obvious consequences today as the administration keeps adjusting the rules of West Asian bodies. With the Chinese banned, the Japanese and Koreans became the next wave of forced and/or underpaid laborers. Hawaii, especially, needed bodies. (That need created the body of Hawaii as it is today, as Dole overthrew the island\u2019s government and Asian laborers overwhelmed the population.)</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6956\" name=\"6956\">In 1907, Japan and the United States struck a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to end Korean immigration (Korea being under Japanese occupation), and Japanese and Indian immigration increased. Those immigrants fought for citizenship. In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that a Japanese American could not gain citizenship because he wasn\u2019t \u201cCaucasian.\u201d In 1923, an Indian American took his case to the Supreme Court, which ruled that although Indians <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">were</em> Caucasian, American citizens must also be \u201cwhite.\u201d</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8551\" name=\"8551\">The rules of the American body changed to fit the rules of whiteness.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8dd9\" name=\"8dd9\">In 1924, the United States threw out the gentleman\u2019s agreement and banned immigration from Japan and India. But bodies were still needed. Filipino immigration increased. In 1934, with the economy in shambles, Filipino bodies too were banned.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"42bb\" name=\"42bb\">These facts are easily verifiable, but I first found them in Helen Zia\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Asian American Dreams</em>, Elaine Kim\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Asian American Literature</em>, and Lisa Lowe\u2019s <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Immigrant Acts</em>.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"dbff\" name=\"dbff\">American wars played a huge part in these rules, in particular with Filipino immigration, and later (and perhaps most well-known in America) with Vietnamese and other Southeast Asian refugees. American wars played a huge part in my immigration. The first major wave of international adoption was a direct consequence of the so-called Korean War\u200a\u2014\u200athe first children adopted were the half-white babies of American GIs, adopted by the Holt family, whose agency continues even now to deal in babies from around the world.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"fdab\" name=\"fdab\">It was the rules of the body, first of all, that got these half-white babies adopted. It was the rules of the body that got them given up. Though it wasn\u2019t built on the bodies of another race, Korea is perhaps as conversationally racist as America\u200a\u2014\u200aand a half-white baby in the 1950s meant incredible shame, whether or not it was the product of a war crime (rape). As the American demand for \u201cGI babies\u201d increased and the Korean supply decreased, the comparative acceptability of Asian bodies (to black bodies in particular) meant that full-Korean babies could fill the gap and increase profits.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7e37\" name=\"7e37\">On the Korean side, these bodies meant money to help rebuild an economy destroyed by war. On the American side, these bodies meant a continued belief in the confusing will of God (infertility) and the valorization of white Christian guilt and its appetite for babies. Even racist Nobel Prize\u2013winning author Pearl S. Buck started her own Korean adoption agency, Welcome House, which in her mind would bring about the end of racism.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"1527\" name=\"1527\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 306px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 43.7%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png\" data-height=\"699\" data-image-id=\"1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png\" data-width=\"1600\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*s6KRVY26v00zO-vXvF5blA@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"e42d\" name=\"e42d\">I was among the largest wave of Korean adoption in the late 1970s and early 1980s. My adoptive parents are Catholic. (My father was on his way to becoming a priest when he married my mother.) They believed the best way to be good Christians was to erase my body from contention. According to my father, they still consider me not Asian at all, \u201conly their son.\u201d In order to follow the rules of family, my body had to be an exception to the rules.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"60d6\" name=\"60d6\">It was in search of my body and its rules that I found Cathreen in 2005, when I went to Korea believing that I had no history at all.

Four years later, she immigrated to America, married me, and got her green card, putting her trust in rules that historically distrusted us.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"c243\" name=\"c243\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 92.5px; max-height: 86px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 93%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*UNz21laeJeiOaTNglMittg@2x.png\" data-height=\"172\" data-image-id=\"1*UNz21laeJeiOaTNglMittg@2x.png\" data-width=\"185\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*UNz21laeJeiOaTNglMittg@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UNz21laeJeiOaTNglMittg@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UNz21laeJeiOaTNglMittg@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"a405\" name=\"a405\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Recently, in the middle of the night,</strong> I witnessed my wife hanging off her mother\u2019s arms, her body jerking up and down, her face squeezed and wet with pain. She was weeping and crying out in Korean that I could understand: \u201cI don\u2019t want to die! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d We were on our sleeping mats (our daughter slept beside her), and Cathreen had on her pajamas, a purple dress with tiny flowers all over it. Her head, shaved short and balding in spots as it grew back in, spiked into the air, then lay flat against the ground. Her arms and legs spasmed. Her mother and sister tried to keep her still, tried to keep the baby from going to her, their faces strained, telling Cathreen she wasn\u2019t going to die. My body had stopped moving. I had stopped knowing what I was doing. I tried to pat her back, and my hand seemed to move in another time zone. My wife had left for Korea 10 months earlier, and my in-laws had seen her like this many times, but for me, who had just arrived, it was a first.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"1bd0\" name=\"1bd0\">Earlier that week, I had gone with Cathreen to her cancer hospital in Seoul (her family is in Busan, on the southern coast, where, Americans always say, MacArthur made his last stand), and in the basement of the hospital, she collapsed to the floor, without any power in one leg. The doctors on break stood around us, watching coldly or maybe resignedly. Every day, my wife\u2019s body is betraying her. Or, more accurately, it is fighting itself\u200a\u2014\u200ait hurries toward death while it also attempts to fight death off.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"7b19\" name=\"7b19\">America has often diagnosed Asians with The Sickness. Yellow Fever. Yellow Peril. If the national body is well, The Sickness must come from without. White supremacy is a cancer we must not admit to. The history of immigration above leads directly to concentration camps in which Japanese American bodies were quarantined during the last world war.

The total cost to us of her many visits to her OB, her hospitalization, and all the care during and after delivery by doctors, nurses, and lactation consultants was nothing. Because of the complications, we visited her doctor every two weeks. Cathreen went to the ER twice, and we paid a total of $80. She gave birth in a spacious and well-equipped room overlooking the Charles River, and the baby was immediately set on her chest before it went to a machine or a stranger.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"c0f4\" name=\"c0f4\">The second time my wife gave birth, we had insurance through the Affordable Care Act. We could have gotten insurance through the university where I was doing my PhD, but even though it would have cost me only about $100 per month, the cost to insure my family was more than $1,000 per month.

We had far less control of the delivery process, and when our son was born, they whisked him away from us. When we contested the hospital bills, creditors came after us. In the end, I\u2019m not sure what happened to them\u200a\u2014\u200aafter my wife was diagnosed with cancer, she told them to fuck off. A week later, she flew to Korea.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"583b\" name=\"583b\">Treating Cathreen\u2019s cancer in Korea was a decision we were forced into. We were in the same city as the best cancer hospital in the world, but MD Anderson had cut off all forms of Obamacare three months earlier. Korean health care covers every citizen, and my wife never gave up her green card to apply to become American.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"01ac\" name=\"01ac\">I keep thinking about why we didn\u2019t catch the cancer earlier. Every day, every minute, I am sick with this thought. It is only right to take responsibility. I knew the rules.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0239\" name=\"0239\">Each Sunday in Houston, my family attended a Korean church full of cancer doctors and cancer researchers who never thought Cathreen had cancer. The rule of pregnancy is pregnancy symptoms\u200a\u2014\u200aand the rules for Korean bodies in America are not the same as the rules for Korean bodies in Korea. When my wife complained she couldn\u2019t eat, our church friends complained about American food. When my wife complained she felt cold, they complained about American air conditioning. When my wife complained about infrequent doctor visits, they commiserated that in America mothers go months between checkups and are told that if the baby\u2019s growing, everything is fine.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"42cf\" name=\"42cf\">These things are true. When my wife told her OB she couldn\u2019t eat, her doctor prescribed heartburn medicine, nausea medicine, sleeping pills. At the ER (which cost us $500 per trip), they treated only her symptoms. Her OB said they couldn\u2019t check for anything else because Texas law prioritizes the fetus over the mother. No procedure could be done that stood the slightest chance of affecting the baby.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3dc9\" name=\"3dc9\">Still, we could have gone to a GI doctor a month after our son was born, instead of three months. Because Cathreen\u2019s cancer is the most aggressive type, two months might have made a lot of difference.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"db60\" name=\"db60\">We didn\u2019t go because we thought it was normal to lose weight after giving birth. We didn\u2019t go because we were afraid. We didn\u2019t go because we had been taught by our insurance to go to the doctor only for checkups or emergencies. Of course, insurance companies claim to encourage preventative care and offer free wellness visits\u200a\u2014\u200aonce a year. But the effect of creditors and high copays and confusion over what is and is not covered is caution and fear. You doubt your authority over your body. You go to the doctor only when weighing costs and benefits shows that you are diagnosable, admittable, and cannot get better on your own.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"3ecd\" name=\"3ecd\">I often think back to my wife\u2019s offer to buy an apartment in Korea and give me time to write. It sounds better with each year that passes. It also would have saved her life. When she first came to America, my wife was used to seeing a doctor whenever she sensed anything slightly off with her body. I didn\u2019t understand this\u200a\u2014\u200aI avoid doctors until the moment I can\u2019t avoid them. She didn\u2019t yet fear the cost of being told she was healthy.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"452c\" name=\"452c\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 299px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 42.8%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png\" data-height=\"684\" data-image-id=\"1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png\" data-width=\"1600\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SJQtMISW2AJzoMn1BA6_Ew@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"69d3\" name=\"69d3\">In Korea, because a doctor\u2019s visit is about US$2, people get their bodies checked as soon as they feel sick. If my mother-in-law feels a cold coming, the first thing she does is get a shot to shorten the cold\u2019s duration. In the week I wrote this, I went to the pediatrician three times because the doctor prescribes only two days\u2019 dosage. With each visit, the pediatrician updated her understanding of my baby\u2019s body and, when necessary, adjusted the treatment.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"5c8a\" name=\"5c8a\">In Korea, they screen for stomach cancer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"0e29\" name=\"0e29\">The most commonly diagnosed cancer in America (by far) is breast cancer. It is also the most cured. This is not a coincidence. After my wife\u2019s diagnosis, a cancer researcher friend hit himself in the face and wished Cathreen had breast cancer instead. Like all the other researchers we knew, he had come from Korea because America has the most money for cancer research\u200a\u2014\u200aand in America, breast cancer research is king. Talented young scientists come to Houston from all over the world to work at M.D. Anderson, and there they follow the funding toward a breast cancer cure.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"9cff\" name=\"9cff\">The most commonly diagnosed cancers in Korea are lung, liver, and stomach cancer. Of those, lung and liver cancer have obvious causes (Korea is a leading consumer of alcohol and cigarettes). When Cathreen was diagnosed, her doctor in America said most of the data on stomach cancer that gets to America comes from patients in Korea. Because stomach cancer is so common, Koreans get screened for it the way Americans get screened for breast cancer. Because my wife was in America, the rules of Korean bodies did not apply to preventative care.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"8804\" name=\"8804\">Maybe if we had lived in a different state, if we had a different insurance, if we had seen a different doctor\u2026how American that our circumstances determined what care our bodies deserved.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\" id=\"036a\" name=\"036a\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 92.5px; max-height: 86px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 93%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png\" data-height=\"172\" data-image-id=\"1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png\" data-width=\"185\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*mffONL6jNbQ32Yecqdn6sQ@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div></figure><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\" id=\"0251\" name=\"0251\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">After my wife screamed for life in her mother\u2019s arms,</strong> she lay weeping on the floor.

Someone said \u201cterrorist,\u201d said \u201cMuslim,\u201d said \u201ctowelhead,\u201d said \u201cgo back to your country.\u201d My face burned.

Each week, she dies a little more in order to live a little longer.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"115b\" name=\"115b\">For my wife to return home\u200a\u2014\u200aif she gets the miraculous results we pray for\u200a\u2014\u200ashe will face more rules of the body. American rules that first stole the bodies of people from her country, our country, then banned them from entering, then led them to fight and kill each other, then bought them to end racism. She must become an exception.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"6843\" name=\"6843\">Right now, the United States is deporting Korean (and other international) adoptees, despite that their bodies are the only things they know about their destinations. That my wife held onto Korean citizenship is the reason her government now covers 90 to 95 percent of most of her medical care (she would have died if she had become an American citizen), and yet her stay in Korea breaks the rules of her visa.</p><p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\" id=\"eb52\" name=\"eb52\">We have heard stories from other immigrant friends and friends of friends and immigration lawyers; we have seen the news you have seen. These have always been the rules of the Asian body in America: Yellow Fever. Yellow Peril. These have always been the terms: white supremacist capitalism. What do we have to complain about, then, if in the end all bodies follow the same one rule: They die. What we have to complain about is not how we die, but how we live.</p><figure class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing\" id=\"e52c\" name=\"e52c\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 84px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.1%;\"></div><div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*yyOdnJ4OSBAKcABNDoIegA@2x.png\" data-height=\"193\" data-image-id=\"1*yyOdnJ4OSBAKcABNDoIegA@2x.png\" data-width=\"1600\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*yyOdnJ4OSBAKcABNDoIegA@2x.png?q=20\"/><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\"></canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yyOdnJ4OSBAKcABNDoIegA@2x.png\"/><noscript class=\"js-progressiveMedia-inner\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yyOdnJ4OSBAKcABNDoIegA@2x.png\"/></noscript></div></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration: <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.audreyjl.com/\" href=\"http://www.audreyjl.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Audrey Lee</a>.
